perhaps the most shocking and surprising treat of the 2016 halloween season is director mike flanagans prequel tale ouija origin of evil a skillfully crafted tasteful and highly atmospheric follow up to the disastrously bad 2014 thriller ouija its frankly stunning just how good a film flanagan was able to build from such a poor foundation weaving a tale that honestly not only runs laps around its far inferior predecessor but honestly made me completely forget about what came before in my mind ouija will be a forgotten victim of studio greed while this prequel will stand tall as the true film based on the iconic and controversial boardgame of terrorin the 1960s widow alice zander elizabeth reaser works as a fortune teller out of her home staging false sances with the help of her teenage daughter paulina annalise basso and younger child doris lulu wilson after purchasing a ouija board as a new gimmick for her work alice does not notice that doris has become overtaken by a deranged and mysterious force associated with the board instead believing that her young daughters newfound abilities and knowledge of things she could not possibly know are signs that unlike her doris is a real medium however as doris abilities become gradually all the more powerful and sinister alice and paulina must band together to try and break her free from the devious spirits of the past that have taken ahold of her physical formflanagan directs from a script cowritten by jeff howard and much like his wonderful previous efforts oculus and hush here he continues to shine as one of the finest new voices in horror theres a certain sense of taste and thoughtfulness he injects into his work as he takes his time to try and establish strong character and interpersonal relationships in addition to identifiable human drama which helps to accentuate the fear that builds he also just knows how to deliver a darned good scare a skill he uses expertly throughout the entire runtime here to build a great sense of foreboding dreadthe performances are all stellar as well helping to add to the films high quality and impact elizabeth reaser is fantastic as the mother alice and you really get a feel for a person lost after the death of their beloved spouse who is trying to hold it together for the sake of her children wilson is a great new doris and does remarkably well for an actress of such a young age supporting roles by the likes of henry thomas are all uniformly strong and help to round out the cast in likable performances and annalise basso steals the show as paulina also known as lina who becomes our main focus and is a strong presence onscreen at only 17 years old basso is definitely one to keep an eye on in the future she possesses talent far beyond her years and is the beating heart of the film as a sister and daughter struggling to help her sibling and mother from the forces at play both supernatural and emotionalthe film does falter at times a bit which is where it loses points despite the first film being decidedly very poor by comparison this film does a bit of distracting retcon work that may bother those who are familiar with the original some major details of the backstory and rules are changed which made it feel a bit inorganic as a continuation its also a bit too heavy on the scares up front which lessened their impact i would have preferred more slow a buildup and it does lack some drama since this is a prequel and youll be able to guess some of what happens based on this factstill that cannot stop this from being a darned good and very well assembled supernatural horror its not one of the best horror films ever made by any means but its a solid and highly entertaining thriller boasting some heart some good scares and a great cast this is the movie youve been waiting for if youve wanted to see a movie based around the idea of the dreaded ouija board my advice skip out on the first film and just watch this as a standalone its far more rewarding an experience than the awful original could ever hope to bei give ouija origin of evil a strong 8 out of 10 if youre open minded be sure to give it a shot especially if the last one let you down take it from me this is a very pleasant surprise,astonish
this prequel has no business being as good as it is the first ouija film came out in 2014 and quickly faded away into obscurity so imagine my surprise when they decide to make a prequel of all things i hunch is that the conjuring films have been pretty successful and they are set in the 70s when things were a little creepier no cell phones and genuine scary aesthetic imagine my surprise again when up and coming horror filmmakers mike flanagan was the man behind the camera the underrated mirror horror flick oculus and deaf home invasion flick hush were two of his recent outings things were looking not too bad for this flick and to top it off it received some pretty decent reviews alice and her two daughters run a scam business in which they speak to the dead the mother justifies this business by telling her youngest daughter doris that it helps people move on and get closure when her eldest lina plays the new ouija boardgames at a friends house she tells her mother to incorporate it into her act she does and things take a sinister turn when they scam becomes reality its hard to make a game board scary the first film tried failed and this one tries and succeeds for the most part any nonhorror fan might balk at the idea that this film is good but i consider this movie to be one of the most underrated flicks of the year flanagan knows how to build solid tension and he doesnt rely on cheap scares or an obscene amount of gore this film has none of that careful framework and lighting is all he needs to create an unsettling atmosphere whenever someone decides to look through the ouija glass piece you feel yourself tense up expecting something to happen kids in horror films are the go to for anything scary most movies tend to cast children horribly and they end of ruining the film doris played by lulu wilson delivers an innocent and somewhat chilling performance as the youngest daughter her goodbye message to a young boy about what it feels like to be strangled to death is an excellent scene to send chills down your spine no scary images sounds or blood needed just a child delivering one monologue about suffocating you obviously the film is far from perfect but it doesnt cater to the happy ending crowd either it takes some chances and for the most part lands them i was surprised by how much i liked this film which may be why the rating is higher than what others would tend to give a film like this had the first film never existed this would be a bigger hit,astonish
ouija origin of evil is a prequel set in in 1967 and is filmed very much like a period piece from that era the film begins with an old universal pictures logowidow alice zander elizabeth reaser stages scam seances with her teenage daughter paulina annalise basso from her house they justify it by helping their clients to move onwhen they purchase a ouija board as a gimmick for the act the youngest daughter doris lulu wilson seems to have become possessed by a mysterious force and behaves like a genuine medium doris thinks she can contact her father and starts acting creepily even showing strange abilities such as mind controllocal priest father tom henry thomas investigates doriss abilities as a medium and thinks there is a link to a sinister nazi doctorthe film delivers thrills and some scares without going too over the top the acting is good from the younger cast members you get the sense of genuine dread but then lapses into silliness and predictability at the end,astonish
i wasnt really expecting much from this one the ibdb rating was pretty low the title is a bit cheesy and the writers directors and cast are not exactly alisters none of that mattered though as this one was actually pretty goodfirst off the scenes were beautiful it was like watching a warm sunset in addition the direction and camera angles really enhanced the suspense and intensity the special effects were also top notch and at one point i was like whaaaat that is cooli was pretty captivated throughout although it did have its clunky moments but not too many of them and they quickly worked their way out of themthe cast did a superb job with the young lulu wilson pretty much stealing the show ill most likely be seeing her again in my nightmares annalise basso elizabeth reaser and henry thomas also did an excellent job so i dont want to sell them short eitheroverall this was a pleasant surprise with moments of nailbiting suspense definitely worth the watch on a dark and quiet night oh and one other reviewer mentioned not watching the preview i didnt so that might have helped,astonish
when i first heard about this sequelprequel my initial thoughts were who the hell asked for this the first ouija was cookie cutter horror film it use the device of a ouija board and the mystique and eeriness of it as a crutch for the thin awfully written that followed it was a completely forgettable experience so one would wonder why the film series was brought up again its a good thing that first impressions are just what they are because this prequel is not bad at allthe film was in better hands when it was announced that mike flanagan would be directing but i was still mixed oculus was actually pretty great a creative idea that was actually pretty emotional and investing flanagans followup was the netflix film hush i know a lot of people loved hush but maybe these people dont watch movies often or are lenient to what they see on netflix hush was terrible i dont want to go into it here but maybe some other time i can explain how improbably dumb it really is anyways this film is a prequel of sorts to the first and is based on a family who help people move on from their passed loved ones by staging seances a ouija board causes dark spirits in the house to possess a young girl leading to trouble and at times some wicked funthe film is set in the 60s and you can immediately tell by the film style the style is of a film youd see from that era they even used the old universal pictures logo at the start of the film its not just the post production editing of the film but the costume music and just all around aura is done very well no one knows her well yet but lulu wilson made this film she does a great job and there are a few moments where the script was fantastic and she was able to come off as unsettling just from saying her lines she is without a doubt the strongest point of the filmthe film isnt without flaws the third act isnt exactly fantastic as some questionable things happen and you scratch your head wondering if there could have been a better resolution there definitely could have been also the cg does look ropy at times but i think that can be forgettable as the film offers decent entertainment value heres a film that sacrifices scares for build up good performances and focus on the story of why spirits have possessed doris and the circumstances surrounding whats going on i can respect thatim usually extremely critical of horror films because these days so many films go for jump scares and have no substance there are exceptions that are becoming smart nostalgic or reinventing the horror genre i dont think there is anything innovative about ouija origin of evil but its a massive improvement over its predecessor and is a film has a good amount going for it to make for a good time710,astonish
ill keep it simple the curiosity around a ouija board creates an interesting concept for a movie however beyond the first 40 minutes the film becomes predictable and disappointing there are some gaping holes in the storyline and the acting isnt fantastic especially when the boyfriend drops down hung from bedsheets out of nowhere and the reaction from all present is as if to carry on as if nothing happened goes for the snappy fright loud noise moments all too often without delivering on a progressive storyline couldve been a lot better but if youre looking for something along the lines of insidious or the conjuring expect a lot of disappointment,astonish
ouija origin of evil is super creepy and it has good amount of wellplaced jumpscares to rattle even the toughest audiences as a horror fan i definitely enjoy this installment way better than its predecessorthis is actually a prequel to the 2014 film so theyre taking this story back to the beginning how it all started with the same house but 50 years earlier elizabeth reaser is a single mom raising her two daughters played by annalise basso and lulu wilson they run a seance scam business to make a living but when they unwittingly invite an evil spirit into their home which then possesses the youngest daughter this becomes the struggle to save her and drive the demon awaytheres so much to like about ouija origin of evil well for one its set in the 60s so that in and of itself provides a very interesting style in terms of the actors outfit and hair its like watching mad men all over again ill never get over how much effort people put into the clothes they wear just to go to the supermarket back in that era theres also heart in this story the kids lost their dad the wife lost her husband the priest lost his wife and and so that hole in their souls forms a foundation for why each of them has a longing or desire to speak with their dead loved ones the reason why they can be taken advantage of by the spirit totally makes sense because they are at the most vulnerable point in their lives and looking for answers unable to let goand because this is a prequel at the end youll see how the story and the characters connect to the previous installment i wont spoil it here for you but youll be able to make that connection without a problem i think what essentially makes ouija origin of evil scary is lulu wilsons character doris zander horror genre has a history of little creepy kids doing bloody gory things on screen but theres something in lulus performance in that shes able to get your guard down so when the frightening moments do come in they become all the more effective and unexpectedly i might add youll jitter your pulse will keep pounding youll close your eyes with your hands but with a few fingers open and all the while you feel for the struggle of this family youre invested in them ouija origin of evil is one of this years best horror films in my book ramas screen ,astonish
mike flanagan just gets so close yet again yet falls disappointingly short oculus is still his best work and the promise that both hush and this prequel to a pg13 board game prequel show is that if given the right opportunity he might really be capable of a coldblooded classicthis is a film that shouldnt exist should never have gotten theatrical distribution and definitely shouldnt have attracted the likes of flanagan okay he probably did this to increase his clout in the industry but still he musters some great work here following familiar supernatural clichs but bringing his own touch to the proceedingsthe setting is beautiful the characters likable and not completely square the atmosphere is given time to build he luxuriates in teasing and messing with audience expectations as a way of spiting this and goosing the audience lulled into a slow burn placation he includes an explosive scene wherein the actual demon is seen shoving his fist down the little girls throat its both too much and a necessary jolt at the time a conundrum if ever there was one and a small encapsulation of everything right and wrong within this film its too bad some of the nice work done in the first 23rds of the film is undone by a clichd boring exorcismlite finale none of it is very scary and it all has the feel of fitting into the ouija franchise package whatever in gods name that could mean considering the stakes here what flanagan does is still impressive,astonish
i am by no means a hard core horror film buff but i do view them from time to time i found this one to be quite the creepy little horror flick and it gets increasingly scary as it progressesas ive often noted i have to overlook some of the really dumb decisions made by characters in horror movies and this one is no exception also the plot elements here are similar to many ive seen in this genre however i felt it was quite well presented with good acting from all the cast well directed by mike flanagan and solidly written by flanagan and jeff howardoverall this film rather creeped me out and im still thinking about that scary ending,astonish
it is a decent horror film but surely better than the first the previous part was an usual teen themed horror where everything started as a playful but this one was a prequel and it focused on the origins a single mother with two daughters is making money helping the people who want to contact their beloved dead ones the things changes when her little daughter started to communicate the spirits of her own the chaos unleashes the house becomes haunted and the family begins to fall apartkeeping it simple is what worked out well for the film despite thematically borrowed from others scenes were kind of familiar and characters intentionally developed particularly the priest role was the most overused in any horror film followed by the twist that turning point was good but not a new nice performances and well shot film ouija is a fine concept for a horror theme and with this films somewhat success i hope the next one would only get better so it is worth a watch if youre not anticipating a something special610,astonish
ouija origin of evil is a swingin sixties prequel to the 2014 horror movie and sleeper hit ouija its predecessor has a mere 6 on rotten tomatoes but had tremendous financial success the budget was an estimated 5 million and by december 2014 the film had grossed almost 51 million obviously the next step is to plan a sequeli was fortunate enough to attend a prescreening basing my expectations off the 2014 ouija i was ready to be bored and disappointed boy was i in for a surprisethe film opens with a mother and her two daughters performing a scam sance for a grieving man and his skeptical daughter the first part of the film delivers a steady stream of laughs and starts on a lighthearted note this mood only continues when the oldest daughter lina annalise basso sneaks out looking suitably 60s and plays with a ouija board along with her friends then things as they often do in horror movies turn for the worst in an effort to spice up their sance scam linas mother alice elizabeth reaser buys a ouija board doing so then causes the youngest girl doris lulu wilson to become possessed no surprises herewhat happens next however is one of the scariest horror movies made in a while but when the director and writer is mike flanagan you expect nothing less flanagan director and writer for films such as hush oculus and absentia knows what hes doing the whole theatre was on the edge of their seats people shifting to hide their face or cover their ears was a constant sound and the scares delivered genuine screams once the horror starts the 99 minute film never lets you take a breatherthe main person to thank for this is lulu wilson the youngest daughter this girl is only 11 and she carried the film from start to finish her malevolent intensity and purposeful movements made even the toughest members of the audience uncomfortable to be blunt shes creepy af and steals every scene one in particular involving a basement hole in the wall and a menacing doris standing behind a poor soul comes to mind to say any more would spoil the movie but this film has its share of jump scares unexpected frights and a delightful retro tone through out various moments feel like homages to horror classics of the 60s and 70s the film will also appeal to fans of recent horror films oculus and the conjuringanother aspect often neglected in horror films is the human aspect the small rag tag family is reeling from the lost of a husband and father the grief feels genuine as does the hope and tentative joy they feel when the ouija board and doris seem to be contacting her deceased father the film is both horrifying and tragic the ending evokes equal parts screams and empathy for this ailing familyoverall if youre looking for a fresh horror movie to deliver a punchyoure in luck outstanding performances by all the actors a fantastically creepy little girl and a retro vibe create a film that will stand the test of horror time,astonish
am i the only one who finds newer horror releases to be completely predictable boring and the effects unimpressive were living in an era where paranormal activitydont get me started made enough money to make numerous sequelsive tried seeing some recent films like mama okay the babadook decent til the end lights out actually was decent and now this and cgi just makes things not scary was the film itself nicely done yes i liked the cast the acting wasnt badthey actually looked like real people but the clich where the little girl happens to know more than everyone else about the evil spirit she becomes possessed and it becomes like every other attempt at an exorcism film not only are we supposed to fear a child we are supposed to fear a child that has a liquidlike face that stretches and cgi whited out eyes she runs along walls last ten minutes and saysstuff in other peoples voices i just dont get how this can pass as good 310,astonish
sorry but i honestly do not understand the 1010 reviews for this movie in fact i think my 4 is begin a tad over generous let me explain whyill begin with the good bits 1 the score is pretty nice ambient but eery and a bit sad 2 some of the effects are pretty creepy especially where the possession starts to fully show 3 there is some good suspense to be had a few nail bite moments especially as it all gets a bit crazy toward the end with a possession free for all going on 4 the young lady playing doris shines in this movie very talented despite being given a painfully clichd creepy child role she is superb 5 the ending was a surprise but thats probably as i havent bothered watching ouija due to very bad reviews 5 the actress playing lina has her moments also as a promising actress 6 character dynamics and interactions have some genuinely believable moments the not so good bits1 this type of story is beyond exhausted they try to twist it with the whole  we can make our readings more  real with this board but its not enough 2 dead parent creepy kid bitchy rebellious teen kid dead parent and strong but unravel parent 3 a creepy new fad appears and things go all eery people get possessed people get killed and then more people get killed no real reason as to why these spirits are killing a whole family 4 no real closure as to what the other things with markus are 5 the families general reaction to hanging teenager in their stairway  their dead kidsibling is way too nonplused i mean you kill your sister happily then come round not giving a hoot but freak out only when you kill your mother 6 given that the dynamics and interactions have such believable moments  the chronic underacting near the end just makes me frustrated 7 the mother is seriously irritating throughoutand exploiting your child top parenting how does no one step in knowing her kid is skipping school to work with her 8 dialogue begins to drift into clich territory near the end as do all the effects its just like watching a rip of the exorcist mixed with other known themes 9 the end just appears so suddenly i hate it when movies begin to show promise then just race to an ending it just escalates un naturally fast for my liking i mean really the kid does what like 2 readings writes loads of junk in polish then mass murders and possesses people in a couple of days if that 10 daddy sews up doll mouths to stop the voices was he alivedead when he did this and why so suddenly i mean if these things have been in the house so long the mother and her kids do readings all the time why suddenly does it take this kid turning out to be some insane conduit medium out of nowhere surely shed have shown signs sooner surely they would have had weird things happen sooner too many plot holes in this movie which is a shame as it does have promise but the lazy approach tarnishes its ideal,astonish
im a casual horror fan at best ive seen a number of horror films spanning several time periods from hitchcock to 80s slasher films to a few from the 21st century still im not a huge horror buff and i dont take in scary movies time and again the way that some people dothat being said i found ouija origin of evil to be the perfect horror movie for someone like myself who likes a good scary movie now and then but isnt a huge horror buff the movie is very well made features good acting and has an intriguing plot and again taking into consideration my personal comfort zone with these type of movies i found it to be the right blend of scary but not over the top intense the movie is not very gory at all its rated pg13a rating i find appropriate for this film and while it certainly does have its creepy side its not the kind of thing thats going to keep you up all night well i suppose thats a subjective thingbut for me i found it to be a fun kind of scary rather than an overly unsettling filmin light of all that im giving this movie 910 starsa rating that i give to relatively few movies i feel that this movie is deserving of that because it nails its aim which is to be a well made horror flick that is family friendly so to speak ie suitable for a teenage audience if i had teenage kids id definitely feel comfortable letting them see this movieand i wouldnt mind sitting through it with them as it was fun for me as an adult having seen it on october 25th its definitely helped get me in the mood for halloween here in a few days,astonish
first of all let me state that i do not consider myself a hardcore horror connaisseur but i do like to think that i can spot a pile of shte when i see one and boy is this movie a massive shtepilealso i dont ever do reviews but i feel like have to step in herei saw hush it was okay i saw oculus it was bad but this one man oh man the real horror about this movie is that it manages to score 62 on here and even get some good reviewsit is obvious that mike flanagan has seen all the james wan horror flicks it is also obvious that mr flanagan does not understand what makes these movies goodto make things easy lets start with the good  the oldest daughter annalise basso was pretty convincing up until the end  her boyfriend parker mack looked like a young patrick wilson and wasnt horrible nor important   nope thats about it other characters  the mom was bland and boring also more than once the camera stayed on her for too long for her to stay in character  the priest was okay but unnecessary  the youngest daughter wasnt good but hey shes young even worse was her cgi mouth though flanagan mustve thought this looked amazing because we only saw like seven random jump scares with the girls cgi mouth open wide  ghost daddy why whatthe writing is horrible as there are far too many dialogues in which the characters lay out their entire backstory in the most uninteresting way eg we dont need to know that the girls grandmother was a fortune tellerthe pacing was incredibly slow theres one scene in which the girls are alone in the house which could have been a tense sequence instead we see some teenage couple shenanigans and a really tiresome dinner date of two widowed adults the only purpose being that we know the priest lost his wife and we can move on to the seance scenealmost every moment of this movie felt like id seen it somewhere before only slightlya lot better  the 60s feel from the conjuring  the medium hoax setup  the black monsters from insidious  the gaping cgi mouth from 100 movies  the pupilless eyeballs  the slingshot scene  the lips sewn together  the jump scare cliffhanger before the credits  the girl saying it seems really dumb to split up  the fact that they do split up even after the girl said the previous almost all of it is a badly rip off from another or 10 different moviesalmost the one thing that was a first for me was the plot if i understand correctly the family is being terrorized and eventually killed off by an angry mob of polish jew ghosts the priest explains that the ghost possessing the little girl was a rescued from a concentration camp by allied soldiers b brought back to america only to c be kidnapped buy some crazy nazi doctor who experiments on jews in a basement in an american suburb these experiments primarily being your typical torture stuff like sewing mouths shut cutting vocal cords cutting in generaloh and then the priest drops something along the lines of but there was something else in the darkness something that had never been human to begin with so demons do you mean demons priests can you tell us more about those inhuman fiends please no oh you want to keep the focus on the polish jew ghosts oh ok so dont torture jews or they will possess innocent kids and slaughter families thats not a weird moral at allso dont spend money on this please dont i havent seen the other ouija movies but if this is the best one as stated by a reviewer before me i will stay as far away from them as possible,astonish
halloween night over her gave us 3 flicks to watch i watched train to busan and the windmill massacre but ouija i never went due the failure of he 2014 versionon poster the font used to write ouija was the same on both flicks never wanted to see this one due the 2014 version i noticed the reviews were better so i did go watch it afterwardsand its a hell better then the 2014 version the way it was shot and the slow movement of the flick did add towards the creepy atmosphere the ticking of the clock throughout the whole picture also add the creepsit all starts with an ouija fraud and of course slowly it turns into a possession it never had any boring moments and the effects used were great even as they were cgi it all worked out fine be sure to watch it until the end credits are over youre in for a big surprise if youre a horror geek worth picking upgore 05 nudity 05 effects 35 story 35 comedy 05,astonish
what is horror objects move of their own we have the premonition that something is outside the door walls throb with presence the same mechanism props up scary stories around a campfire and funhouses the world over maybe it speaks about powerful animal urge or a desire to enliven a world that is chasing spirits out but it comes back to walking into a room expecting it to come alivehere we have it all quite clearly in a family of storytellers who stage an experience of the beyond for their paying customers inside their house there are stage props actors a narrative of making contact fiction but it leads to shivers of actual experience in this case closure for family members how is horror emotions and self unlike it the story is they end up making real contact except it takes them a while to know it now its this unseen narrator who is staging an experience of the beyond around them the house acquires capricious life of its own the real thing this time there is the requisite backstory of course about heinous evil committed in that house long ago the usual ghastly premonitionsthey acquit themselves well overall im on board the whole film as a funhouse of course with some of the same atmosphere of murky oppression as we find in insidious and that whole slew of seance films but two key differences that set it asideone is the attempt for genuine emotion in being visited by a departed father insidiouslike films tend to use this trope that strikes me as particularly meanspirited the loved one we thought we were making contact with had been a demon in disguise all alongthe second is about choreographing expectation the time comes for the actual show this is where the possessed start flailing about and now obvious evil ricochets around the house the usual priest visits with grave news about arcane evil in their midst all this time there is talk of vatican experts who deal with this kind of thing great now well have to wait for the usual exorcism to be set up except no sooner are we out of the room than someone is thrown to hang the house is already swirling around us,astonish
i just went back and read my review for the original ouija it was a fairly negative review overall and there was an interesting line in there about these movies being doomed before they even start making them because ouija boards arent scary step forward mike flanagan to prove me wrong flanagan is becoming a bit of a heavyweight in the horror industry with each of his films so far being very strong here he does the near impossible and makes the a sequel technically a prequel infinitely stronger than the original wasthere was a lot of great stuff here something i loved was that the jump scares were more about the imagery than just a loud noise typically these days jump scares take almost no skill at all to pull off because the damn noise that accompanies them is so loud that it wouldnt matter what happened on the screen in ouija origin of evil the scares are more about the brilliant visuals that are created throughout the film theyre the type that will stick with you afterwards and require a lot more skill to pull offthe writing is also a lot better this time around the first one had some atrocious dialogue and incredibly stupid characters this time there are genuinely fascinating plot points that give the film even more levels than just a horror film the original also had an immensely weak opening scene on this occasion the opening scene is one of the strongest in the whole film and even has its own minitwistthe character of doris was the highlight of the whole experience i was incredibly impressed with young lulu wilsons performance playing a regular character in a horror movie is easy but playing a villainous character is not she was brilliant and played a large part in making this film what it was altogether i really enjoyed ouija origin of evil in a world where good horror films are becoming rarer and rarer we have to stop and truly appreciate the great ones that do come along this was certainly one of them keep churning out films please mr flanagan,astonish
went in with an open mind with this onei will say now that i am not a 14 year old who would be scared of something on the kiddies channeli am a fully grown up with 50 years of movie watching under my belt everything about this movie is wrong and it would mean me going on for 20 paragraphs like some reviewers to explain them allbut here is a fewplot wrong and insipidactingwrong and woodendirectionwrong and lazycinematographywrong and boringclich countwrong and too muchsewn up mouthsrolling eyesouija boardsnice vicarscursed childrenall seen a million times before in a million moviesthe list goes onalso i had a slight uneasy feeling about the director and his choice of camera work concerning the 2 young girlsfound it a tad disturbing at timesthis movie puts horror back about 50 yearsnothing made any sense and some parts were silly beyond wordsof course there was a few daft teenagers jumping in the theatre but thats never a good sign for true horror fansput this up with last years excellent  babadook and the difference is big as it getsstrangely enough i would compel you to see it as it is an education in how not to mess about with a century old genre i will notwill not be going to the next 2 sequelsnot even if you paid metrash,astonish
to be up front i have to admit  i am not and never was a horror fan for me an alien abduction movie is far more creepy than any horror film could ever wish to be yet some of the classics are decently entertaining as well as the emily rose film from 2005ouija starts out alright it sets up the stage for events to begin nicely they convincingly portray 1967  at least for those of us not alive at the time however once things start to happen the film simply bombs i really cannot comprehend the hype behind this film with praises such as creepy and terrifying heard on youtube radio and elsewhere the plot of this film is never truly realized  you are clued in to who the entities are yet even that doesnt add up one would think an evil spirit would have been an evil person in life they never provide any real backstory aside from a short conversation and we are never given any closure it is basically along the lines of this thing is that and then some halfed attempts at making the audience jump sure the trend these days is for hollywood to milk everything of its last drop of blood  and this film is left totally unanswered likely so another film can be made still if this is a chapter in an illthought moneygrab scheme they could have ended the chapter with one loose end  instead the entire thing is frayed a friend and i actually sat through the credits and were rewarded with an utterly worthless scene of a loose end in present time which also answered zero questions so my rating for lack of any real tangible plot brings this down to 510 when i watch a film i want a story  what i dont want is some looseknit script with a movie constructed around it the acting likewise tanks once the scares beginthat brings me to the horror part of this film the horror here entails a young girl screaming multiple times whispering into ears in an indiscernible language standing on the ceiling or walking on walls and moving quickly every single one of these acts is done repeatedly  and perhaps after the second scream it is all yawninducing so for me this films lack of anything scary brings my final score to 210 if i see a drama i want drama if i see an action film i want action and likewise if i see a horror film i want to jump this film failsi shouldnt even have to mention i will not watch the next iteration of ouija even if it is free and mark my words there will be a equel or two or three of them,astonish
i watched the original film feeling like i wanted to tear my eyes out then this prequel comes along i click the play button and before my eyes i see something that looks like television show quality a throw back to the old cult classics that i use to watch as a kid in the eighties it was an interesting direction but really didnt know what to make of it i say to myself okay its set in the past and we are about to embark on a journey all went well for about an hour there were very little jump scares noises if any and only one stretchy cgi demon facefor the first hour or so but the stretchy cheap cgi demon face was done in a way that is acceptable there were very eerie moments when the camera would pan to the left or right catching a shadow figure in the background but the good thing is there was no clich jump scare sounds it was left up to us as the viewer to deem the scene scary or noti was actually commending the director for this old school style of horror story no silly jump scares but in and around the one hour mark or just a little after all silliness broke loose this movie now turned into jump scare central all the gags were saved to spoil the end its like they didnt know where to go with this ending or they ran out of money and decided to make the last half hour or so an editing mess full of unwanted scenes and dialogue that people have seen over and over againyou can really tell when a production runs out of money these days it had such a good back story but instead of branching out on that story they made it into a teenage horror dramafest they did this by throwing in scenes of other films we all know this film started out good it had a feel of a really good short story and unfortunately thats all it was because the last half hour was all pies and anchovies note to studios stretchy cgi demon faces are silly and just dumb and not even teenage girls find them scary they are a product of the youtube generation and its been done to death so please i beg you stop using cgi in horror it doesnt belong in this genreor any other genre,astonish
ouija boards developed from practices that are nearly 1000 years old and have been controversial almost from the very beginning the modern version of the boards which supposedly allow users to communicate with the spirits of the deceased developed out of the centuriesold chinese usage of an automatic writing method the hole in the moveable planchette device was eventually widened and the writing implement was replaced by a small piece of glass through which users could see letters and words on a flat board thus receiving messages from the spirit world this ouija board the name probably coming from combining the french and german words for yes was patented in the us in 1890 it has survived in the same basic form up to the present but has been criticized  by scientists who claim that the users are the ones actually moving the planchette whether deliberately or unconsciously  and by christian groups who believe that the boards could lead to demonic possession this fear coupled with the games origins became the force behind a dozen or so horror movies since the 1980s 2016s ouija origin of evil pg13 139 is a prequel to the ouija horror film released in 2014this film portrays the origin story of the evil in that house featured in the first film much as it was related in ouija ouija origin of evil takes place in the mid1960s and focuses on the three female characters at the center of the 2014 films mythology alice zander elizabeth reaser is a widowed mother of a teenager named paulina annalise brasso or lina as her family calls her and a little girl named doris lulu wilson alice tries to support her small family by conducting sances for grieving people desperate to speak to their deceased loved ones alice has a few tricks up her sleeve to help her unsuspecting clients believe that the information she gives them is for real and that their dead relatives are really blowing out candles in response to specific questions alices girls are in hiding making the tricks work lina accepts that its just a scam but doris doesnt really understand everything theyre doing so alice explains that theyre helping people by comforting them and giving them needed closureafter attending a party during which her friends played with a ouija board lina convinces her mother to add one to the act as alice is working out how to manipulate the boards planchette for her readings she accidentally summons a spirit which begins possessing young doris as the spirit seems to come and go doris starts acting more and more strangely  doing her homework in ways that are beyond her capability frighteningly dealing with a schoolyard bully channeling voices learning the hidden secrets of their old house and just maybe talking to the spirit of her dead dad of course alice is worried about her daughter but comes to believe that doris is a legitimate medium like alices mother was  and alice wants to talk to her deceased husband too unfortunately for everyone involved this is a dangerous game that alice is playing caught in the middle of all this is linas boyfriend mikey peter mack and the principal at doris catholic school father tom henry thomas who helps alice figure out whats happening and why whats real and whats not and what to do about it risking his own life to do soouija origin of evil does a good job of connecting its story to the original movie but thats part of the problem you wont necessarily be lost if you havent seen 2014s ouija but you wont fully appreciate whats going on either especially in the very short postcredits scene which you should just skip if you havent seen the first film apart from the connections between the films the connections between events in this film are not well established by mike flanagans and jeff howards script and howards direction fails to build any real sense of dread  or much concern for the characters also not helping matters is the acting which is pretty shaky except for during the films climax unfortunately that resolution feels even more random and disjointed than the developments leading up to it many people seem to feel that this film is an improvement on the original but thats not saying very much actually knowing that these films are produced by hasbro studios which is owned by hasbro inc the company which currently produces the official ouija boards tells you all that you really need to know if you have a ouija board ask it whether you should go to see this movie if the planchette moves and hovers over the word no well there might be something to those boards after all c,astonish
i was very interested in watching this movie he had heard good reviews it is true that it is better than before but at no point do i feel that im seeing a good movieeverything is manichaean i do not believe anything i knew it starts with a theater and then its for real but is it really for real all the actors are very bad makeup and hairstyles it seems to be rather a comic movie although the girl is great until the director decides to spoil it what do i mean i explain it in spoilerat no time do i feel tension there is no tension there are not even scares it takes something more than a bug to scare not that the end spoils the film the movie does not say anything to me for a long timethe picture could be fine indoors its nice but little elsethe management is superficial he does not know how to take the movie it does not know how to create tension he does not know how to draw plansi like the genre of fear but it is that this movie is not scaryspoilerthe reflection of the film is the sequence of the girl telling the sisters friend about the hangman the girl is great the camera is kept in the girl the girl attracts you but the director or the editor arrives i do not know what will have been and change the plane to the boy he just finished with the tension already even if you return to the girl you are finished with everything he does not go up any more as you may not realize that,astonish
despite my better instincts i watched this as i was impressed by the directors ability to weave gold out of other tired genres sadly this is nothing more than a bythenumbers spookfest with nothing original mediocre acting no scares and plenty of painfully drawnout scenes leading nowhere my immediate problem was with the music which is so generic sounding it could be stolen from any number of horror films and often sounds as if its been directly lifted from harry potter lots of white contact lenses multiple voices and floppy armsby sides possessed little girl shots and of course the lords prayer just when you thought the film couldnt get any worse i cant think of a single element of this disaster of a film that hasnt been hackneyed to death previously im now wondering why ive even bothered to waste my time typing this dont watch it,astonish
film has a history as it is directed many times before this time it was directed to make it a good one as compared to its previous versions its cinematography was fine dialogues were strong recently seen this film the film has few scenes of interest as father comes and told the history of spirits to family he told facts behind it and gave a solution like to call the vatican priests for exorcism at that point i was excited because the scenes of exorcism brings some horror to the films story and screen play were going smooth before father become hunted by the bad spirits and he attacks on the helpless family that was the weakest turn in the film moreover the story ends without any moral outcome it is unfinished it was a halloween special film its rating is fine as compared to its production as compared to classical horrors like devils exorcist evil dead and nightmare etc this film is bellow average it would be a memorable product if a proper focus would be on horror contents over all film is average,astonish
ouija board has gained certain religious veto with the passing of the years given that the game designed by hasbro company by the end of the 19th century with a child guidance became in a spiritual communicator between the world of the living and the dead these superstitions around the game were calamitously squandered for universal in 2014 with a film that directly pointed to no the equivalent to a creative disaster of horror genre was showed two years ago however with a minimumbudget of 5 million dollar earned around 103590271 million anything unusual with blumhouse productions as production company because of tremendous economic success which reached such film a continuation was unavoidable  the surprising thing was that the start with a clean slate produced a frightening prequel one of the best in the genre so far this yearorigin of evil takes place in 1967 los angeles and tells the backstory of lina zander the character played by lin shaye in the first movie the zander family is going through an economic sentimental and labor standstill following the fathers death roger michael weaver who died in a car accident trying to evade economic suffocation the family does fake seances in order to help people to contact deceased beloved ones with a complex and disturbing indication mechanism they simulate a true communication achieving give an unfounded peace message to melancholic clients despite realistic effect alice elizabeth reaser now familys pillar decides to add a new element to the spiritism circus this is where the ouija board comes into play doris lulu wilson the youngest daughter connects to what she thinks is the spirit of her dad nonetheless once it has shown clement and reliable things become sinister because of the fatal oversight of the three main rules 1 never play alone 2 do not play in a graveyard and 3 always say goodbye remember ouija knows all the answersall starts well from the opening of throwback universal pictures logo which radiates nostalgia and memories in equal parts watching again the company logo for the 70s evokes pure sentimentality for those movies that really established the filmic foundations together with the emblem oval and white marks in the upperright corner of the screen giving the appearance that the film is still projected in the old format providing empathy with the context of the storydirector and cowriter mike flanagan together with jeff howard conceived a greater story in all respects to the first film as it is a prequel it is not prescriptive that you know the forgettable initial story since the task of this film is to lay the groundwork for laine morris story  in addition to serving as main common with the terrible predecessor it does not show unilateral nor empty characters but delivers measured and sumptuous dialogs monologue by doris and wellpositioned plot twists flanagan and howard are primarily concerned to initiate a solid connection between main roles with the audience then hold on us to our seats with calamities suffering them throughout the fulllength film it provides formulaic and common few scares that debilitate what has been achieved nevertheless it is remunerated with practical and original jumpscares supported with exaggerated special effects which overdo the movie of fictions however many of them work with the unexpected ending  unpredictable if you were not thinking in linas life from the first filmin general performances are permissible and even electrifying because of the consistent link generated in the first half with the affable characters doris the younger star performs the role debut of her career in great style shines with her own light and joins the clan of promising girls in horror isabelle fuhrman madison wolfe heather sossaman besides basso delivers what we must perceive of her character a girl who is in physical and sexual awakening reaser an enterprising mother and thomas a priest who must prevent a tragedyone of the most curious and iterative aspects are its references to classics as modern as ancient among these are william friedkins the exorcist the conjuring by james wan oculus and hush these last two were directed by flanagan it extracts helpful techniques and visual pieces in which predominate faithful and precise touch at the end of the 60s cars according to the epoch clothes not so sinister but appropriate and an alarming soundtrackflanagan does not renovate horror genre with origin of evil but gives a new direction to the franchise a glittering direction pointing directly to yes we must keep a close eye on the career of this director who promises much in atmospheres stories and settings perfect for halloween perfect for the loyal horror fans ouija only is for a demanding public,astonish
went to this movie with a friend in order to scare him a little bitwe came out of the movie laughing both our es off because this was pure comedyi do not understand how anyone would find this scary in any way whatsoeverthe only scary part might be where one of the actors scream loud very loudother than that noise being a pain in the ear nothing is scary at alli wouldnt recommend this to anyonenot even if youre taking a date with you expecting her to hug you for safetyno,astonish
read the reviews and couldnt wait to see thisi was so bored and sat there thinking this must get better there must be a scare somewherei stopped the film part way through to see if i was watching the correct one as the reviews were positive in generalthis was actually laughable as it scary parts were so poorly done it was funnythe story was ok the acting ok but as for the horror it was appalling it was predictable slow tedious continue to add as you see fiti can only presume to positive reviews are from kids or from persons with a vested interest in promoting the film,astonish
after seeing the original film i was quite surprised to see the rating this movie received many have given it rave reviews citing quality worki found the film very difficult to watch it wasnt the movie that was scary but the acting as in scary awful annalise basso delivers a convincing performance while elizabeth reaser and henry thomas fall in line well behind their performances were so bad it made the movie unbearable unfortunately little lulu wilson is slowly becoming typecast as the creepy little girl in horror movies i think she acted the role as best she could not exactly a demanding role to begin with mind youthe movie itself was incredibly predictable if you are looking for a good horror movie to watch find something else i wouldnt say it is a waste of time but it definitely isnt the best spent 90 minutes,astonish
the sequel no one cares about to the 2014 film no one cared about is surprisingly good elizabeth reaser stars as a mother who pretends to contact the spirit world and ends up opening a dangerous door to this world with her daughters lulu wilson and annalise basso the director is mike flanagan who previously gave us another surprising critical hit with oculus and his skill is evident in this film right from the start it is clear that ouija ooe is no ordinary clichd piece being set in the 1960s it is made to look so with an oldfashioned universal logo and title card  this is small but is just a cute touch that shows the director at least has some passion for this project there are a few more of these touches tyler durden style toprightcorner white blotches to show reel changes plus a fantastic soundtrack and noteperfect dialogueacting visible in the comedic displays of attitudes towards teen fraternisation which does a really good job of setting the period and making it feel like 60s america the acting is solid throughout in fact with reaser bringing charm and depth to her role and the young actors are great too furthermore thankfully they all manage to imbue their characters with a certain amount of wisdom and common sense that is often noticeably lacking in horror films its also refreshing to have a proper score which really sets the viewer on edge and succeeds in having far more of an effect than the usual horror background music the script is not silly either and theres some genuine dialogue aside from a few instances of over baked exposition later in the film the horror works in ouija instead of relying on jump scares theres some real dread and i found myself with goosebumps and a constantly tingling spine whilst my hands hardly let go of the armrests however it is the buildup which is the best  in the final third things start to falter a little perhaps as it becomes too focused on tying into the first film which i have not seen and seemingly with as many endings as return of the king nevertheless this is one of the best horror films ive seen in a while and is definitely worth seeing if you fancy a solid halloween flick 74100,astonish
surprisingly this sequel is actually better then the first ouija and i was excited about mike flanagan directing it too after making excellent horror movies like oculus and hush the movie has a nice beginning with a story and characters that feels pretty well together with a good pace it doesnt feel too slow or too rushed flanagan has some interesting and original takes on how to scare and thrill his audience but i cant help but to feel like the background story and depth of the movie fell flat in the endunlike oculus where the background story and nature of the horror elements felt very throughout and tied together the plot and reason behind ouija 2 instead felt like an random excuse just so they could make a creepy movie about an ouija board in 5 minutes you get a very compressed story about a evil nazi doctor who experimented on humans during ww2 and that he continued his horrific and occult torture after fleeing to the us in the very house they the main characters live in the spirits of the tortured and murdered people then haunts the house and eventually takes their chance to possess the little sister but the motive is unclear its also not obvious if the possession is done by the evil doctor or by the spirits since you get no information of what happens to him in some cases its more interesting not knowing the motive behind the ghost or demon or that it doesnt have any reason but to torture and hurt humans like in oculus but this movie really needed a story with depth and complexityin addition the scares didnt really do it for me i do realise that its highly individual what is considered scary but things like creepy kids and dragged out mouths have been done a bit too many times the movie had scenes that did surprise and make me a bit unnerved i will give it that,astonish
once again i watched a movie based on imdb ratings and once again im totally disappointed how many movies are you going to make based on the same story lines we all know that home is considered safe so 99 of horror movies happen in the house but its become so stale for at least a decade now its time to make the scale bigger one should feel unsafe at workin the car a mall directors should go big like a neighborhood being haunted  or a city  even a country so the audience feel the chill because now everyone feels it only happened to one family one house one city but when its an epidemic it gives it a more sense of helplessness make the horror movies something bigger than a familys problem moreover when its the kids that are affected its not really scary its more of a kids movie not for adults there was no story development no character build even the demon himself is not described well movie explains all of it in 1013 minutes and then some stupid supposedly horror scenes which at that point i was yawning and done movie ended ,astonish
ouija origin of evil suffers from a common disease in horror films clich it doesnt start this way it actually subverts the genre at first by being not about real paranormal investigators but frauds with good intentions the father of this family that conducts these fake seances is dead ling before the beginning of the movie and it seems this occupation is the familys way of allowing others to have closure but it doesnt really work this means when the youngest girl of the family doris begins to contact their dead father the mother lina sees this as an opportunity to give real closure to people this is all in the first half of the movie and to be honest none of it is very scary but it is pretty original the characters arent very deep but theyre real characters with understandable motivations and while there are a plethora of predictable jumpscares there is at least effort given to trying to make them scary sometimes utilizing long takes to sustain tension and not ending the build up with a jumpscare every time this doesnt mean its good the little girl is basically puts on the usual cute little kid performance when it comes to child performances and then when she becomes possessed it changes to the creepy little girl stereotype it becomes much worse in the second half howeverthere are too many moments in the second half that are incredibly clich and the entire finale is way over the top i found myself laughing at the absurdity of the little girl who is supposed to be creepy the strange changes in voice the casual eyes rolling back with the gaping mouth as she watched tv etc it all just felt really cheesy when they were trying to scare youin the very very end of the film lina the older daughter and only surviving member of the family is in a mental institution she is insane and there is a moment that wouldve been a perfect ending that wouldve showed that their good intentions only resulted in a clinging to dead ones rather than acceptance but then it goes on for one more scene just to deliver a predictable jumpscare this is a pretty good microcosm for the whole film at first it seems like it could have potential but then its thrown away for a lazy jumpscare fest,astonish
usually when i watch a horror movie i can remember some of the jump scares sometimes because i had so much tension built up before they happened or just that they were really scary and good so it is stuck in my head foreverthis movie however had so many jump scares it got to the point it was just ridiculous i mean towards the end it just became funny almost as you could predict every jump scare many of the jump scares are basically the actor just jumping in front of the camera with the face really close with a stupid looking cgi effectsome of the jump scares were also more funny than scary and the acting of the little kid are one of the worst i have ever seen she is emotionless i bet even if you have a demon inside of you you should portray some emotions like hate or anger or spite but nope this little actor did not manage thati have to rate this awful simply because the movie is not scary it only relies on jump scares to scare you its not real fear you know,astonish
this is a much better film supposedly a prequel to the very bland 2014 film  ouija but quite honestly this could stand on its ownthere is nothing new here and it is prone to copying scenes from  the exorcistamong other haunted house filmsthat said its capably done after a rather slow twenty minutes watchable but nothing more than that,astonish
i actually thought this film was better than the original just as the first film this one carries a lot of emotion and longing for a loved one it is not melodramatic or overbearing though and is nicely intertwined with the horror elements suspense is always that much more enjoyable than gore in a horror film and this one has the scares and the suspense and it is rather disturbing as well as the little girl gets more and more possessed the effects are really great  quite stunning actually,astonish
ouija origin of evil 2016 takes almost an hour for the various elements to come together into something that starts to seem scary with the sinister stuff sticking to the periphery until an exposition scene that marks the start of the scarefilled final act and the ending seems to rush itself along to a predetermined conclusion in a way which suggests the filmmakers werent quite sure where their narrative was heading until they decided they had to tie it in to the first instalment which i havent seen due to its reputation as one of the worst horror films of recent years in a meaningful way still this is a visually interesting and characterdriven horror feature that is welldirected and doesnt rely on jumpscares to entertain its audience it is styled to look like a film from the 1960s complete with the old universal logo and intermittent cue marks so it stands out from the crowd with a colourful texture not often seen in todays colourcorrected world though some of the visual effects end up looking a little bit ropy at times perhaps more so because they stand out from the otherwise analogue aesthetic theres still the niggling sense that the concept isnt entirely sound though considering it is based upon a hasbroowned boardgame that shows up and somehow coincidentally causes the spirits which have supposedly been in the house for a long time before the board to start to show themselves 610,astonish
pretty much what it says on the tin i havent seen the original so have no frame of reference but this film was bland in a lot of aspects characters had little interesting going on there were plot details that didnt seem to go anywhere and some inconsistencies in the films internal logicwhat the film did well was that the overall story had interesting direction and some surprises and the low number of jump scares was refreshing the film tries to use bits of monster horror dread and a little body horror for its frights only sometimes effectiveoverall a distinctly middle of the pack film that lives up to what it promises but doesnt impress,astonish
a sequel thats a prequel thats actually better than what preceded it ouija origin of evil is an above average chiller thats a fine scary ride for those not expecting boundary pushingstandard rules apply here widowed mum and two daughters who dabble in the con of seance profiteering get more than they bargained for when they introduce a ouija board to proceedingsdirector mike flanagan knows how to construct a good honest scare piece see oculus and hush and so it proves here the atmosphere is constantly set at impending dread the tension slow built until pic goes into overdrive unfortunately so many horror films of the decade are reliant on the demon formula to fill out their respective tales so much so it has become jaded and utterly unsurprisingthis hurts this picture and it runs away with itself rendering the big final quarter  complete with emotional baggage  as something of a let down though the final shot has goosebump value for sure hadrcore horror buffs will find irritants and emptiness but for those who dip in and out of the genre should find a quick chill to fill a fright gap 610,astonish
too many ridiculous predictable sequences actors were cheesy n very ham even though it was set in the 60smissile n definitely not memorable,astonish
ouija origin of evil three and a half stars out of fivea prequel to the 2014 hit supernatural horror flick ouija both films are based on the hasbro talking board game and released by hasbro studios this chapter tells the story of a widowed mother and her two daughters who scam people out of money by running a fake seance business in 1967 los angeles when the trio begins involving a quija board in their show one of the daughters becomes possessed and things begin to go horribly wrong the movie was directed by mike flanagan and it was written by flanagan and jeff howard the duo also performed the same duties on 2013s oculus another supernatural horror flick the film stars annalise basso who also costarred in oculus elizabeth reaser of twilight fame lulu wilson and henry thomas of et fame its received surprisingly positive reviews from critics and fans alike mostly and its also performed decently at the box office while it is a better reviewed movie than the original it hasnt done nearly as well financially speaking it is a much better film thoughthe story is set in a 1967 suburban home in los angeles where a widow alice zander reaser cons grieving customers out of their money by running a staged seance she has help from her two daughters paulina basso a teenager and doris wilson whos 9 yearsold at a party with her friends paulina uses a ouija board for the first time she then convinces her mother to begin using it in their act real supernatural forces then begin haunting the house and their show becomes more than just a trickthe film is definitely a lot better than the original movie if i remember correctly but i dont remember that film that well other than i didnt like it its also a lot better than oculus i do remember that flick and i wasnt too impressed by it this film is creepy well acted and somewhat nostalgic its very reminiscent of other horror films from decades ago its definitely a lot better than i expected it to bewatch our movie review show movie talk at httpsyoutubeazdklptvrzc,astonish
did mike flanagan  jeff howard even watch the first movie i originally gave this movie a rating of 7 i thought lulu wilson was spectacular and creepy it was an original story and did have some nice creepy moments then i made the mistake of watching the first movie so many inaccuracies from one movie to the next origin took place in 1967 as spelled out on the screen the original movie said the pictures where from the 40s or 50s the story in the paper in the original stated doris was 10 in origin she specifically told the priest she was 9 in the original the girls were much closer in age in the pictures in origin they were at least 6 years apart in the original paulina claims her mother was the one forcing doris to let the spirits in and who sewed doris mouth shut in origin lina sewed doris mouth shut and her mother had nothing to do with the spirits invading doris pauline says in the original movie maybe there is more than one spirit but we know from origin there were many spirits all of the people tortured by the doctor again did the writers of origin watch the original movie one other gripe i have i hate hate hate when the vengeful spirits are the victims of someone else if they themselves were victims of this horrible doctor why would they then go on to hurt this little girl and her family why wouldnt it have been the doctor or the other spirits marcus had referred to in his writing that line never makes sense to me oh i was hurt in my life so now i am going to hurt others after i am dead bad choicebottom line dont make a prequel  sequel if it has no bearing on the original i changed my rating to a 4,astonish
the opening was fantastic the old universal from the 60s the overall look of the film looked as if was from the 1960s the opening scene built up great suspense and then a huge let down as soon as the people left the seer and the girls popped out to show us this really is a scam i was put off sure the scamming family started messing with a ouijawitch board then things started happening but some of the major things that happened was similar to the exorcist the ouija then the demonic possession then here comes the priest that the demon takes over yea just watch the exorcist 1973 for a much better moviei became quickly aggravated with this movie after the great opening scene i really dont know what else to say about this film other than it is better over all than ouija 2014310,astonish
flanagans films tend to be hit or miss so i went into the theater not knowing exactly what to expect i was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie was one of flanagans better pieces along with oculus and hushthe film itself was a pretty masterful period piece with excellent costumes and sets and lines that helped you place the time period without a big date sprawling across the screen at the opening seriously the costumes were so good although some of the lines hit you over the head with the whole we are in the 60s deal it wasnt cheesy or overthetopthe child acting was pretty good particularly from annalise basso who i was excited to see again after her performance in oculus lulu wilson was also exceedingly creepy in plenty of parts i was very pleased with the amount of creep factor especially from a pg13 movie which usually rely on cheap scares example this movies predecessorwhere this movie fell flat for me was the actual demonghoulmonster story i wish they would have kept the ghoul as a fleeting figure instead of fullon showing them fairly early on in the movie its so much scarier to let your imagination go wild instead of seeing a digitized monster maybe it will be scary for the teens who go to see this film but it took the scare factor down a notch for me the origin story for the demon seemed a little forced and rushed towards the end and i think choosing a less complicated origin might have made the movie run a little smoother however the ending was pretty good and it was an overall thrilling theater experience,astonish
so the film defines three rules for playing with ouija board do not play alonedo not play in graveyard and always say goodbyei f any rule if broken ouija will unleash its wrath and it does that happen in this moviei personally loved it as a horror fan since in many movies ouija had always had a side role but this prequel to the awful 2014 ouija is a perfect horror filmit has its clichs and does not break any new ground but its scary and satisfying as a horror movie and that with being different and able to stand out from the crowdafter watching likes of the witch  conjuring 2  dont breathe and lights out i didnt expect much as 2014 ouija was really horrible but after watching hush i had some expectations and the result was beyond that the story is perfect as it explores fear in late 1960s which is scary and the way the story turns from being helping others to needing help is actually worth seeingthe pace is fast and the director has nice grip on the intense chilling scenesone particular scene that was also in trailer where doris says about what it feels to be strangled is spine chilling and remind of the scene in conjuring 2 where ed talk with the demon despite fairly predictable jump scares the film has the potential to built an eerie atmosphere which strikes the right chord all the reveals in this movie are more than creepy especially some creative ways to scare us are also present which were new and refreshing and they are always nice to see a particular thing about the movie is that it does not play good  it makes you root for everything then it just vanishes in thin air as the hunt starts very fast and goes on and onit always nice to see children used as a weapon in horror movies as their innocence contrast with the horrible things they do its the first time i have seen such creepiness in children since orphan and the orphanage so final word watch this unexpectedly great and scary horror movie which finally utilizes the full potential of the so called ouija board also dont watch the trailer as it spoils most of the story and good scenes if something you didnt expect to be good turns out to be more than good then its a must watch,astonish
when watching ouija origin of evil it is easy to say that it lacks any real scares the jump scares are predictable and you leave the cinema feeling at a loss but it wasnt until it turned dark last night and i hopped into bed that i realised how scary this film is the haunting images of the slick black demon and the fear of the concept of possession riddled my sleepless night so in the morning i could definitely and conclusively say this was a scary horror film but i still couldnt find how i really felt about it and then it came to me i actually enjoyed the vintage classic film feel about the film and that was what i loved about it the whole feel of the film is classic and it isnt just the universal title card or the vintage filming look but in the narrative and characters itself the film homages such demonic films of the 70s and 80s such as the exorcist the omen and the poltergeistwith a classic plot trope of using a creepy little girl exorcist poltergeist the shining in a creepy little house doing creepy little things and as all great homage films do they put their own spin on it the backstory behind the house itself is sensationally creepyand slightly clich and adds a creepy atmosphere to the film the film also successfully captures the 60s culture and the craze revolving around the ouija board gameand as you can see by my rating there were a few flaws in this film first off all i felt like they were really hamming up the creepiness of the little girl and made the film feel a little conventional the acting at times was a bit bland and felt quite weak and conviction less the acting does however pick up in the second half the scares could also be considered cheap but nonetheless do their job with startling the audience overall ouija is a fantastic halloween movie and is a classic embedding of what horror is all about,astonish
ouija 2014 was a lazy nonsensical movie about a bunch of teenagers who get killed because one of them plays a ouija board alone and awakens something dark and sinister in the house the hero of the film is a friend who figures out that there was a family of three women  a mother and two daughters who did seances in the same house and one of them is the bad spirit who is killing her friends she visits one of the sisters in an asylum only to be tricked by her to actually awaken the monster sister the film itself was shabby with no logic to the sequence of events and plot holes the size of pot holes on indian roads it was one of the worst of 2014 flash forward to 2016 we have ouija origin of evil which attempts to tell the story of the three women and connect it to the 2014 disaster is this a bigger disaster read on to find out originally reviewed at broth of blogsplot and scriptthis prequel shows the story of middleaged widow alice zander elizabeth reaser who earns her living as a fake medium and has help in her charades by her two daughters 15yearold lina annalise basso and 9yearold doris lulu wilson she insists that she is just comforting the living who come for the readings by faking contact with their dead loved onesfast forward to an underaged alcohol party which lina attends just to fool around with her friends on a ouija board and the suggestion that alice should use one to up her theatrics alice does buy one and invents a whole magnetic mechanical process and tests it to see if she can move the planchette and make it seem like it is moving on its own little does she realize that she has awakened a spirit who channels himself through doris who is obviously the one who will be possessed in the storythings start moving and the father makes contact when doris tries her hand at the board  alice takes that as a sign of doris being a true medium and even puts her to work but all hell breaks loose when the school priest who has a soft corner for alice comes to the house to explain the letter that lina saw doris write  the letter is in polish and is the back story about the history of the house without getting into spoilers the story moves forward to show the possession the havoc caused and how lina ends up in the asylum  connecting it to ouijathe back story was a bit muddled and there were some flaws in the story but the story was largely logicalcharacterization and acting cathe characterization and acting was really good i though special credit to wilson who plays the part of the vulnerablegirleventuallyturning intoamonster quite well a lot of effort again to showcase the 60s and done well right from costumes to the house sounds and effects sesince sound is such an integral part of horror movies it has to be good and i am happy to say it was good in this there were minimal jump scares  if there was a lurking shadow there wasnt a loud noise to scare the audience it was just a lurking shadow and a reaction by the character who saw it the third and final act had a good sequence which helped the suspense the editing is good and flows well  it does slow down once in a while but that is to establish the characters which is done really well the first act is only about that cinematography and visuals cvthis movie looks really good the 60s are shown like how it should be but obviously with a modern twist i noticed the cigarette burns all too well which just shows a lot of care was taken while making the movie to make it seem like it is a period film when people had to change reels once those circles showed up i didnt think too much of the demon itself  it sorta broke away from the setting of the movie because it was cgi and obviously some of the other effects when doris gets possessed are kinda funny if you see  i didnt find it creepydirection and overall d omike flanagan has the craft people  he proved it again oculus and hush fame he made sure the characters are well defined so when the movie moves forward we care about them he made sure the sequence of events was logical though the story is about demonic possession and that it is a well made suspenseful horror movie without the use of stupid jump scares kudos mr directorbottomline the first one was so stupid that most people didnt expect this one to do anything other than bore you but this is a good one in the halloween season well made with solid characters and some good scares does have some flaws but the character of doris played by wilson is by far the best thing about the movie  a kind of damienesque role where you think she is cute one minute and a devil the nextso here are my scoresplot and script ps 1characterization and acting ca  15sounds and effects se  15cinematography and visuals cv  15direction and overall d o  15overall score  7 out of 10originally reviewed at broth of blogs,astonish
mike flanagan give us the prequel to stiles whites first and only feature debut ouija from 2014 this one goes into the history and origins of the first film going into detail of the horrifying characters returning to the same house 60 years ago we go back to find a single parent family who makes a small living from pretending to speak to the dead for clients by way of performing fake seances the mother acting as medium whilst her two daughters pull strings to create the illusions flanagan reunited with oculus child star annalise basso whos now not quite the child playing the older teenager sister and could also be seen in last months captain fantastic shes brilliant but the star and horror of the film is lulu wilson who plays the impressionable younger girl with a keen interest of speaking to the spirits in attempt to speak with her deceased father ets henry thomas is totally unrecognisable being all grown up and playing priest its hard to believe that he was once the alien befriending elliot all those years ago adding an ouija board to the performance obviously leads to terrifying events opening a door for something else which takes hold of the little girl who then proceeds to spread the word this much we know from the trailer and is pretty much the whole basis of the story tying in with the previous it has elements from other horrors like the exorcist and the omen actually using the classic vintage opening with title credits and universals old logo to boot theres some good imagery that creates enough spooks to keep audiences glued to the screen but it is just another conventional horror that lacks any real lasting effect the performances are good especially from both the girls who appear to be accustomed to the horror genre lulu wilson is quite the scare getting her big break in deliver us from evil and is starring in next years annabelle 2 horror films seem to be more frightening when using children its suspenseful and scary in parts but unfortunately predictable and even comical but i think that was just my defence mechanism worth a watch but dont expect too much running time 8 the cast 7 performance 8 direction 7 story 7 script 7 creativity 8 soundtrack 7 job description 6 the extra bonus points 0 would i buy the bluray no only because i dont buy too many horrors 65 710,astonish
looks like were playing some board games again kind of like movies based on video games board game movies are a tough call as there not that many of them and yet so many of the are bad we have clue which i still find a very funny whodunit in a house story but we also have the strange mess battleship was and then we have ouija rather then asking where did the original go wrong its better to ask what it got right i guess you cant blame them for task of adapting a prop for slumber parties into a driven storywhen it was announced that another ouija movie was being produced most people were angry that such a poor horror movie could warrant more of them just remember that as long as something makes a profit that only tells the studios that people want more in a surprise movie the production company in charge blumhouse productions issued an apology for the original ouija promising that the new movie would be up to their standards though i wished we could have gotten this sooner that shows a sign that they do value creativity over cash income so it gave me more hope that ouija origin of evil could change my mindin the late 1960s fortuneteller alice zander played by elizabeth reaser makes her sances more legitimate by adding mechanisms that would allow lights to flicker candles to be blown out at random and for random figure to materialize the use of smoke and mirrors tend to involve her daughters teenager paulina played by annalise basso and nine year old doris played by lulu wilson though they seems to attract customers their finances have been in trouble since the death of the family father after seeing a copy of the newly released ouija board game paulina convinces her mother to add one as a work tool while playing with it doris unknowingly contacts a spirit who she says is her father trying to help the family at first alice sees her daughters contact with ghosts as a delight to her fortunetelling sessions and seems to be actually helping people the more that alice stays in contact with the spirit the more odd things start to happen when her school principal father tom played by henry thomas begins to gather clues that doris spirit may be demonic the ghosts are ready to stand with their possessed girl talk about a complete turnaround of a series ouija origin of evil only adds to this years strong lineup of good horror movies the conjuring 2 lights out dont breathe the shallows with a possession story that may seem unoriginal but throws plenty of curveballs with its premise unlike the original this actually manages to make the board theyre using frightening taking it out of the hands of dumb teens and into unexplained forces makes the situation more unpredictable you hardly know whats going to set off the bad stuffalso unlike the first ouija you actually care about these characters and want to see what the boards effects is going to have on this poor family ill be quick to note that rather then going for the endless supply of jump scares this creates a spooky atmosphere that releases a bigger feeling of dread on the audience this is how you scare people i dont know what happened behind the scenes that made such a drastic chance from the original but lets hope that the team behind ouija origin of evil can continue to produce more of the horror movies we should be gettingill give this eight original ouija games out of ten now that we have this one im not even sure if it makes sense for people to watch the original though this is a prequel its safer just to assume its it own thing rather then an extension lets hope people are willing to give this a chance so that this storys fortunes are pointing to yes,astonish
first and foremost ouija origin of evil may very well be the biggest surprise hit in my opinion of the year i went from writing off this origin story because of how bad the first one was then giving it some respect because the thrillerhorror mastermind mike flanagan was tagged to it who might i add directed the hit ormiss oculus and made the fantastic netflix exclusive hush click here for my review of it now i am here making this review in love with this movie and now this series mike flanagan masterfully created an origin story to a series that was so investing and so eerily creepy that it at times made my skin crawl story alone this film keeps the audience so curious throughout the film until the very end when it hits you full force with consistent terror this is not simply a jump scare movie although it has its moments i have just grown immune to them i found the slow burn creepy actions and mannerisms far more terrorizing than an attempt at catching me by surprise in a sense the film toys with the audience as they expect to be scared but right when you think it may happen it pulls off the trigger a fantastic element of which i applaud mr flanaganbeyond the film itself i must bring focus to what mike flanagan did with this series in 2014 ouija came out and to most and especially myself it fell flat far too many holes in the plot and an abundance of eye rolls and sighs at the frequent stereotypical horror scares two years later flanagan delivers not only an origin story that alone stands as a very strong horror film but also delivers a film that makes the 2014 installment a crucial piece of the story to the individuals who saw the first then watched this many may sit in awe of how the 2014 film blended perfectly into this one it caused me to have an irresistible desire to rewatch the original and be awestruck at how genius this film truly isnow for the wrapup ouija origin of evil not only stands strong on its own as a masterful blend of slowburn horror and fresh jump scares but also stands strong with a story that sparks curiosity throughout the duration of the film and keeps you invested i highly recommend this film and even encourage watching the 2014 ouija afterward just ignore the bad acting and stereotypical horror genre anticsoberrated,astonish
i think what made this shine was either the younger sister or the priestthe youngest girl looked very good she had a nice face and pretty light hair her speaking skills were pleasant she was so cute and petite and resolute she could be anotherthe next dakota fanningthe priest looked a lot like my pastor like in his facial expression he was also very stimulating interesting kind and smart he had a good hold of his acting he helped hold down the fort in the moviei also liked the older sister and mother the other remaining main characters they were sweet and caringit was interesting when we saw a demon instead of the father it creeps me out how the story ended with everyone dead but the older sister who lived in an asylum for some reason like she was being blamed for something she did wrong she was possessed like the others it wasnt really her,astonish
the original ouija released in 2014 cost some 5 million to produce and ended up grossing some 100 million at the box office so its no wonder that production company blumhouse went back to the well for a second helping but as the title suggests ouija origin of evil is more of a prequel than a sequel but in terms of scares and delivering the goods it is far superior to the original the film is set in los angeles in 1967 half a century before the events of the original financially strapped widow alice zander elizabeth reaser from the twilight saga etc and her two daughters run a seance scam in which they offer comfort and solace to the bereaved and lonely alice buys an ouija board the newest trendy toy for teens looking for a bit of excitement hoping to use it to boost her business but when she and her daughters use it they unwittingly invite a malevolent demon into their home before long her youngest daughter doris newcomer lulu wilson is possessed by a demon in desperation alice turns to father tom henry thomas best known for his role in the classic et the principal at the parochial school attended by her older daughter pauline annalise basso from oculus bedtime stories etc for help director mike flanagan has spent ten years in television honing his craft and has since built up quite a repertoire of horror films including the creepy oculus he seems to prefer an old school approach to his horror and doesnt overwhelm the material with flashy cgi effects and green screen work ouija origin of evil does have a few effective moments of shocks and flanagan does manage to build up the tension but ouija origin of evil is fairly clichd and flanagan and cowriter jeff howard oculus etc tick off all the right boxes here  haunted house a family terrified by supernatural forces a young child possessed by a malevolent spirit spider walking up the walls a friendly exorcist  but he also tends to telegraph some of his punches the film is derivative and clichd and borrows from numerous other horror films fans of the genre will recognise many of the references  for example when the kindly priest steps out of his car and walks towards the house audiences will spot subtle allusions to the exorcist one of the modern classics of the genre flanagan also suffuses the material with an old fashioned aesthetic that perfectly captures the era even the opening credit title card is reminiscent of the 60s cinematographer michael fimognari gives the film the look and feel of something shot in the 60s with its colour palette patricia farrells production design also reeks of authenticity and perfectly captures the era reaser brings plenty of spunk and attitude to her role and makes for a strong and likable heroine basso makes the most of her role as the feisty and rebellious pauline newcomer wilson is a standout as the possessed doris and creates a truly frightening character and one of the more creepy child characters the genre has produced thomas has a warm presence and brings intelligence and depth to what could have been a fairly colourless and clichd role ouija origin of evil is a reasonably effective horror movie that will appeal to those who liked the conjuring and insidious and their ilk it doesnt matter if you havent seen the original either as ouija origin of evil stands out on its own however a brief post final credits sequence features horror veteran lin shaye from the original ouija insidious etc and provides a contextual and thematic link to the original,astonish
first of all let me just say that i absolutely loved the individual performances i loved them elizabeth reaser annalise basso and lulu wilson were all flawless and carried the movie brilliantly each bringing their own unique personality to the film made it so much better than it would have been otherwisealso lets not even compare it to the previous movies in the franchise this one takes the lead with no competition in sight still as with so many horror and thrillers recently the ending lacked conviction not only that but when the story starts unfolding you might find yourself rolling your eyes to the same clichd jump scares dialog and story tellingthat said this definitely deserves a viewing it wont disappoint and will even give you some nice scares through the ride just dont go into it expecting something unique or unexpected story wise and youll be fine if nothing else youll come out loving the actors,astonish
this film deals with the demonic possession of children from a ouija boardthis movie had many unrealistic things happening in it such as the planchette moving around on the ouija board without anyone touching it doriss mouth hanging wide open doris dying in an unexplained way all of a sudden at the end when you think that there was going to be a happy or bittersweet ending all of a sudden it turns out to be a sad endingsome of the characters were annoying such as the bratty teenage girl and the bullies who intimidate doris at school there are some similarities between this and annabelle creation both are prequels both star lulu wilson both are a bit better in other peoples opinions than the mediocre sequels were but i also found an interesting comparison i found at is that lulu wilsons character in both movies hate boys doriss character gets bullied by boys in ouija 2 and lindas character in annabelle refuses to talk about boysthe rest of the characters were fine but they couldnt even save this movie the movie just killed them off and id rather for lina to not be in this movie because she was so bratty if she was a lot nicer and sweeter i wouldve not minded her being in this moviethe acting otherwise is the best thing about the movie everyone did a great job portraying the emotions of their characters and not coming off as wooden in their acting skillsverdict this movie is contrived clichd and forced its not much different from your average horror film its got the same clich sweet innocent youngest girl getting possessed dont expect anything groundbreaking from this film,astonish
this movie has a mild storyline but makes up for it with doris this girl made me so scared watching thisthe ending was so creepy it made me get shivers down my spine and i never do that in horror movies ,astonish
an unexpectedly efficient film with tons of scares and good acting a must see,astonish
great horror flick really creep with lots of super scary scenes and moments but this movie was also very well made the directing was great the cinematography was awesome so many great shots and long continuous takes well acted with developed characters and a wellputtogether story i dont always notice all of these things but it was so well done that it stood out to me the directors last two movies before this were hush and oculus so hes 3 of his last 3 right now 1 viewing,astonish
its rare to find a sequel that surpasses the first these days but ouija origin of evil manages to just that not that it was a very tough feat considering the original was one of the most lamebrained movies ive seen in a while but origin of evil improves upon its predecessor tenfold  just not enough to make it really worthwhileits obvious that mike flannigan is on his way to becoming one of our true masters of horror but this film seems more like a paycheck movie for him and it shows he does the best he can with the tepid material but ends up using the old distorted facesmouths with rolled back eyes effect a few too many times and it quickly becomes tediouslike all of flannigans films its wonderfully well cast and beautifully put together i just wish theyd spent a little bit more time with the script you might be better off watching flannigans hush absentia geralds game occulus or the haunting of hill house,astonish
a really good film that has an authentic horror feeling to it set in the 1960s the time period is perfect a good story and an excellent performance from possessed girl i highly recommend this film to horror fans,astonish
i eat horror movies for breakfast lunch and dinner ive seen it all in my experience there are two types of horror movies those that you can watch many times and enjoy the story as well as the scares such as drag me to hell 1408 resident evil final destination etc and then there are those that are full of scares of all kinds particularly jump scares but you may not want to watch many times because storywise they are just not as interesting or varied as the horror movies of the first category for me ouija origin of evil falls into the latter category it is by far the scariest movie i have ever seen i jumped at least 20 times during this movie which is a record in and of itself and 4 times i felt as if someone poured a full bucket of icecold water all over me and chills were sent down my spine that is yet another record the jump scares here are surprisingly effective the acting cinematography music score and atmosphere are topnotch but its not one of those movies that i would want to watch more than twice unless i watch it say 5 or 10 years from now when i have forgotten about the movie and enjoy the jump scares again because the jump scares will stop being effective the more you watch the movie and the story is not really something that i would want to watch more than once its about a ouija board after allanyway the jump scares alone win this movie a 1010 strongly recommended,astonish
i gave this movie a go the other day and found it surprisingly effective it succeeds in creating a sense of dread and the chills are very effective thanks to the excellent cast i would say its one of the best possesion films ive seen since exorcist and exorcsim of emily rose,astonish
a sequel far better than anyone probably could have expected after seeing the first installment ouija origin of evil is a real treat for horror lovers and its one of flanagans most wellcrafted efforts to date,astonish
this prequel to ouija i was really interested in checking out due to it being written and directed by mike flanagan i actually only checked out the original to ensure if there was any carry over i would know it to get into this the synopsis is in 1967 los angeles a widowed mother and her daughter add a new stunt to bolster their sance scam business by inviting an evil presence into their home not realizing how dangerous it issomething i can really say about this film is that it really authentic about when it was set from how they dress their speech and even how the ouija boxes look that is something i wanted to touch on and was really impressed by it kicks off with alice zander elizabeth reaser as she is having a sance with mr browning sam anderson and his daughter jenny kate siegel they ask questions to his passed away wife and are freaked out when a presence is there behind a curtain it ends up getting too intense and the two leave alice decides not to charge them from what happenedit turns out though that they are running a scam the candles that blow out during are done by the youngest daughter doris lulu wilson the presence we saw was the other daughter lina annalise basso we learn from some interesting scenes that the father has passed away the family is trying to get on without him but it is a struggle doris is carrying on like he is just not home while lina is acting out we see her sneak out that night to go to a party it is here that we meet a boy who has a crush on her mikey parker mack and we get introduced to an ouija board and the rules of them the party is broken up and alice has to pick her daughter uplina makes a comment about buying an ouija board for their scam and alice does that she comes up with a way to make it move without using her hands she actually also tries to play it but cant get it to work doris tries later that night and thinks she is talking to her fatherdoris slowly changes and her family realizes that she actually has contacted spirits alice decides to actually use this to help those that seek her out but the problem is the spirits they are contacting might not be the ones they think doris has a dark entity that is latching on to her they do seek the aid of the principal at the catholic school the girls attend father tom henry thomas to help save the daughter and the familyive already touched on the realism of time period as being good the other thing that i really have to give to flanagan was he incorporated things from the original as well the original film i didnt find to be that good and had problems when doris first contacts the spirit it spells hi friend this is a recurring motif in the other film this is the only time that we see it but i thought it got a bit repetitive in that film the rule to not play alone is used again but this one builds on the mythology of not playing in a graveyard which i thought was a good touchgoing from there being that this was a prequel you kind of know how things are going to happen i have to admit though despite that this film has a much more interesting storyline any sequel or prequel really needs to take the good things from the previous film and to build more on the story i actually think that this one does that they also use looking through the planchette you can see the entities this gives the history of the entities why they are there and what they are doing i was concerned for a bit that it wasnt going to sync up but i definitely like how it plays out it actually even explains why the events in that film happen which is a pluswith that id say that the films editing is good as well the film has a normal runtime and it moves through at a good pace i was never bored and it kept me engaged i heard good things about this one but the original had me slightly intrigued how it could play out for this i definitely wanted to know more as things were revealed which it definitely did it was well donethe acting of the film was something that was really good as well i have noticed is that flanagan likes to use the same actors for his films basso who was previously in oculus is our main character i thought she did a really good job in this and i was quite impressed i do want to see her do more in the genre for sure reaser was good as the mother she has an interesting position of needing money but also needing to do what is right i thought it gave the film an added dimension wilson intrigued me as she is a cute kid some of the lines she said made her quite creepy and the duality of her character was solid thomas was good as the priest i like that he has enough doubt early on but the more the evidence presents doug jones makes an appearance in this film as a ghoul im always a fan of his work whether he has lines or not he can do a lot with just movements and physical acting also want to shout out the small appearance by siegel as well the rest of the cast round the film for what they neededeffects for the film were something else that i thought were well done this film doesnt really rely on jumpscares too much which im glad they went away from the look of jones was pretty creepy i thought the glowing eyes were a good touch something else that was good was the eyes of those that are possessed making them completely white i thought was a creepy effect i do believe there was some cgi in this film but it didnt bother me the effects were pretty solid i would saynow with that said this film is the rare case where the prequel is much better than the original i thought this one had just a much more interesting story even though i know how it was going to end it introduced us to more mythology while ensuring that everything lined up as it was supposed to it was edited together in a way that kept things moving and made me interested in seeing what happened next coupling with that was good acting and effects the soundtrack of the film really didnt stand out to me but it also didnt hurt it i definitely think this is an above average film and im still impressed by all of the films ive seen from flanagan i would recommend this one for sure if you like ghost haunted house or possession films,astonish
i saw this one with low expectations since the first ouijamovie was sosobut boy did i enjoy it the actors especially the child actors were great and the effects were creepy and cool mike flanagan is truly a great director and if you havent already check out his other movies hush oculus before i wake and the haunting of hill houseseries,astonish
as an horror fan i obviously wanted to hate this but couldntyes its predictable yes its clich but its extremely hard to do a horror movie that isntthe pacing and overall ambience is quite good just as the acting it wont win an original horror movie award but will keep you entertained for 90 minutes or soi wanted to give it a 6 but went with a 7 because of the actingperhaps a bit more suited for families or people not used to the genre its a bit generic which is not a bad thing for this crowdif you dont expect greatness youll enjoy it,astonish
i am mainly confused while the exposition and framing story are quite original the plot is anything but and is as cookiecutter as they come if youve ever watched a film about an ouija board haunting then you already know exactly whats going to happen you could even guess some of the characters without watching a trailer no actual plot twist nothing slightly innovative or smart about the turn of events nothing but the same old features to which weve grown tiresomely accustomed then why oh why was this film so great and entertaining i truly ask myself thatperhaps it was the absolutely terrifying manner in which the hauntings were portrayed and presented both in means of visual effects and cinematography yes there are some jump scares but they are far from being the main fear factor as the film is by far more terrifying than physiologically startling besides there are chosen few films that succeed in utilizing jumpscares in a way that doesnt feel like a cheap cheat and this one if absolutely one of the title at the top of that listperhaps it was the profound acting especially by young 11 year old lulu wilson as little doris younger actors showing such talent always impress me but watch out for this one she has a very dark and horrifying future ahead of her besides theres something about antagonist children that makes horror films all the more terrifying and while this feature is usually utilized in films portraying young sociopaths  a haunted little girl has been the stuff of nightmares ever since the classic the exorcist annalise basso was also excellent as lina this time given a far greater and long overdue role than in the oculus in general acting is definitely one of the finer aspects of this filmall in all i had a great time was kept compelled and at the edge of my seat and honestly finished watching a little frightened to go to sleep keep in mind im a 33 year old man i honestly believe more creativity and originality in terms of screen writing and story and a good plot twist would have made this film a solid 10 i know i shouldnt have enjoyed it that much i know its not as good as i made it sound here but its been a long time since a horror film had succeeded in scaring me to such extents id say watch it and judge for yourselves never believe the critics you might love the film even more than i did and you might hate it personally id give it a try,astonish
superior in every which way to the underwhelming 2014 original this prequel recalls 2016s lights out with its focus on atmosphere and design over jump scares and loud noises like its own predecessor however after a strong start its hard not to notice that it gets repetitive and hohum but getting there is a pleasure the first half coopts the look and feel of vintage horror classics with young lulu wilson delivering a creepy magnetic performance that can give even a seasoned horror veteran like myself a few chills but melodrama takes over the second half and the movies momentum sputters but not before suggesting a better richer movie just at arms length,astonish
another strong prequel to a less than stellar original this movie has a strong blend of genuine horror and family also stars the great young actress lulu wilson,astonish
the start of the movie is similar to so many other movies of the same overly saturated genre a family with a single parent a rebellious teenager and a sweet hearted little girl get in touch with the spirit world the first half an hour can almost be skipped as it is riddled with clichs not enough money to pay the bills daughter sneaking out to see her friends teenage romance etc however after making it past the first half of a pretty uneventful movie the second part makes up for it of course cheap jump scares are being used on a regular basis but the atmosphere of the movie changes entirely and opts for a much darker tone a direction that succeeds in most parts although the plot twist did nazi that coming falls short in the end the last 20 minutes are a hellish ride of emotions even if a lot of different scenarios are crammed into it to conclude this movie starts off very slow even too slow for a movie of this genre but then delivers a strong final punch even if the ending feels a little unsatisfying,astonish
the makers of this b movie didnt look selfassured in the extras no worries we were worried seeing it the little girl strikes once more the little girl in horror movie is the lightning rod there are more girls than the other kind in this i am still trembling with creepy feelings,astonish
its already been mentioned many times that for a sequel this movie is very good i actually cant judge it against the original as i havent seen it but i thoroughly enjoyed this one i didnt find any reason not to watch this without seeing the firstthe style is top notch creating similar imagery as 60s and 70s horror movies all the way to double focused shots i did find some of the flare slightly distracting a lot of the look was probably added in post but in general the movie is skillfully craftedacting is very good especially the kid who is as good as any classic horror movie kid characterhighly recommended for horror fans its not really gore horror which is good but rather old school stuff with some scary images thrown here and there im not sure if there was any blood actually,astonish
the film takes place in 1967 los angeles imdb claims 1965 where alice elizabeth reaser performs scam seances for money something she has been doing since her husband roger died michael weaver she allows her two catholic school daughters to help her then enter a ouija board possession tubular bells style music a priest and a little girl with an odd voice very formula up until the ending which they just scrambled around until no one was happy with itin spite of the formula writing the actors did a good job to raise the level of a less than stellar script especially young lulu wilson who has a flair for horror she will be in annabella 2 guide no swearing sex or nudity,astonish
i found this movie to be very enjoyable for those reviews that say the acting was horrible what horror movies are they watching overall this was well cast the acting was fine and the little girl was successfully creepy this is not a gore fest or a movie with a lot of cheap scares it was more of a slow burning psychological scare and it worked watching it late at night alone the movie is set in the 60s and had a great story line that naturally unraveled it has an exorcist feel to it that is missing from most modern day horror movies it was successful in being creep while being entertaining and the little girls behavior was freaky particularly when she spoke to her sisters boyfriend or used her voice to enhance her performances however like almost all of these types of movies the story writer felt they had to explain everything by tying it into a tired story line of evil that occurred in the house it would have been more unique and fun to just have a bad spirit that shows up the little bit of killing just seems forced and the last 20 minutes or so are just a mess of your typical expected storyline with this type of story why does the spirit control itself until the last 20 minutes who knows just felt like time to wrap it all up in a neat bow which ruined the story however it is very entertaining the first 23 and really demonstrates you dont need gore and cussing and teenage sexual situations to present a scare and creepy psychological situation wish theyd do a third installment and take it in a new creative direction,astonish
more like a prequel than a sequel ouija origin of evil takes place in the late 1960s and tells the story of a family that is fascinated by the board game of the same name the scare factor in this one is pure pg13 horror and suspense from the blumhouse factory known for low budget hits like get out and others and it works this film was shot digitally yet they made it look like a 60s film with film grain and wide instead of flat cue marks every 20 minutes along with warped audio make sure you stay after the credits for a bonus scene,astonish
im sorry but i felt the acting in this movie was just terrible the acting and the script made the overall movie more laughable than scary,astonish
ouija origin of evil the best thing about communing with the dead through a ouija board today is they all communicate in abbreviationsin the sixties however specters like the ones in this horror movie had to spell complete wordssingle mother and sham spiritualist alice elizabeth reaser uses her daughters to help swindle her clients during staged sances by pretending to be their relativeswhen alice adds a spirit board to the act her youngest lulu wilson starts to actually channel entities in the home including her father meanwhile the eldest annalise basso seeks help from a priest henry thomas despite being a sequel this frightful followup surpasses the forgettable original in all aspects filling in the blanks from the first origin of evil also explores some interesting new themes concerning the afterlife while maintaining ample scares incidentally ouija boards are only good for reprimanding dead relatives over the pittance they bequeathed you green lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,astonish

like most horror movie fans i was not impressed with the first ouija film it was flat and lacking in almost every aspect for that reason i didnt plan to spend my hardearned money on a prequel this film takes place before the original the surprise part of my story is that my daughters dragged me to see it and i really liked it it was a whole different concept than the first film and it worked on many levels to be what i feel is one of the strongest horror films of 2016as with many horror films it does take a while to really get going in fact despite some good scares and creepy atmosphere in the middle the best scares are in the last 13 a story must be told so i get why they have to tell it calmly in the beginning there are two daughters an 18 and 9yearold they live with their mother and their father has died the mother runs a psychic medium business out of a parlor in her house she gets customers in touch with their dead ones and she knows what she does is a scam she has no guilt because as she tells her daughters she is helping these grieving people her daughters know its all bs i must mention this was directed by mike flannigan oculus hush who i have tremendous respect for he really made a good horror film here and i look forward to seeing more of his work in the future spoilers aheadthere is a rather intricate plot here which reminds me of recent horror films like the conjuring 2 and lights out in a way it was too busy for me but i appreciated the story it sort of came together and worked in the end again it was very complicated does anyone miss movies like halloween where horror is simpleafter one daughter gets seemingly possessed by a demon spirit and helps her mother do readings the older one meets a boy and reports strange letters her sister wrote in polish to the headmaster priest at their school and that priest is sort of dating their mother but not really because he made a vow he wont break see what i mean by complicated it gets more complicated suffice it to say nazi german history weaves in and  well the ending is sad beyond what you normally would see in a horror movie bring your kleenexall in all despite the convoluted overlong plot i really liked the scares and creepy atmosphere in this film i would recommend it as a 810 for horror fans,astonish
the positive  there was a good backstory in there somewhere but lordy lordy it would have needed a decent director to bring it out and whoever  i couldnt even be bothered to look who it was  did this really didnt have a clue and should stick to daytime soaps  every few minutes theres an image stolen from some other film  the lead actress who plays the mother has too many teeth  people didnt have teeth like that in the 60s  there is just so much wrong with this its impossible to catalogue  basically if you like horror and youve seen a horror film before just dont waste your time  they even copy the star wars character shock from insidious  its soap opera mulch  and this is supposed to be better than the previous instalment   i hate to think,astonish
not often a sequel is better than the first movie but this one actually is better the first one was okay to watch once but ouija origine of evil is just creepier good acting from that kid doris by lulu wilson there were some good scary moments that are necessary in a story like this one im not going to debate about my personal experience with a ouija board because it doesnt matter to the story the only thing i have to say about that is that ima devoted atheist but that i will never ever play with a ouija board again but with that experience in mind you watch a movie like this one with other eyes then you would watch another horror movie the horror in ouija origine of evil isnt really gory or bloody but it got my wife pretty scared a couple of times and thats always nice to see it was better than i expected,astonish
this movie is phenomenal if you consider clich and horror stereotypes some sort of revelation unlike lights out that had a few elements of originalityouija origin of evil follows a mother who is running a scam fortune telling business and her two daughters who lost their dad recently the reason i bothered to mention their dad died recently is because they mention his departure a lot in every scene in fact just in case the audience forgot the beauty of this film is that you dont have to retain any information from the previous scene because they just blurt out exposition during any moment of plot development anyway the acting is okay but its pathetic character arcs and the characters non existent personalities give the actors little to work withid recommend conjuring 2 before id even remotely consider recommending this crock of crap i genuinely found myself laughing of bordem during this film especially since the mothers source of the ouija board was at a cafediner and peoples reactions to some of the events in the film were over the top on some of the minor characters behalves all and all just about every element of this film was a let down from the screenplay to the direction and the fact that the film is even remotely being praised because of its homage to its cigarette burn on the film and opening title card featuring roman numerals is not enough to redeem this disappointment in film form,astonish
sorry but i wish someone had written the review im about to write before i went this movie is not a terrible piece of garbage but it is boring not very creepy not very frightening and barely has much tension it is pg13 and dont expect much gore being pg13 is no excuse for not building tension not playing with the viewers minds and simply not being creative expect to wait about 45 minutes before anything creepy even really happens and then even when it does barely flinching a few jump scares happen but theyre expected every time and have little effect then expect the story to fall apart quickly and the ending to be stupid all of this would be fine if the ending were terrifying but its mediocre clich and worst of all boring i was deeply disappointed wait till you can watch it on netflix dont waste 20 like me and my gf did as avid fans of horror this one is a rental and only after most other good horror movies are rented out dont breathe lights out new blair witch,astonish
well acted and scary too with a dash of retrofun with patience and attention to detail directorwritereditor mike flanagan continues to hone his horror movies and seems to be a caring creator of this lowbudget genreits clear that the money spent was allocated where it was needed and unlike the majority of horror movies it feels less like product and more like a production with everyone in on the same vibewhile the movie contains a few tropes wideopenmouths and a few obligatory jump scares it is the pacing editing and retropresentation that makes this one different among the samecreepy suspenseful and with characters that are fleshed out to make your flesh crawl and you may find yourself actually caring about what happens to this family of a widow and two daughters living alone or are they in 1967notethis is a prequel to an inferior film ouija 2014 made by a different team of creators that was a flop with fans and critics,astonish
who knew ouija was going to release a sequel or in this case prequel that could provide more than cheap thrills and shallow characters ouija origin of evil certainly deliversthe highlight of this movie would be the wonderful child acting by lulu wilson as doris zander whether intentional or coincidental the girl portrays childhood innocence very well which ultimately becomes a mask for the possessionthe story is set in the 1960s around a widow and her family who are trying to make money as mediums counterfeit ones of course it is not centered around present day teens making stupid decisions in their hormonal angst and that is already a good startthere was potential to make it more the elder sister is very skeptical in the beginning and remains so throughout the movie this seems to be her only role in the film and it would have been nice to see her resolve some of her own conflictsthe effects are not brilliant especially some that appear on doriss face but overall they do the trick some may not like the ending but i for one dont feel the need to achieve moral resolution in any supernatural horror production so i liked it even though i wish it hadnt been so abruptfinalgood movie 710,astonish
the premises of this movie are quite good to be honest it starts with an idea thats not often exploited by letting us into the daily life of a con artist medium in the late 60s and slowly builds up from the moment the ouija board is introduced then it starts to gently derail completely missing great opportunities to build an original ambiance and falling back to generic obvious jump scares the last part of the movie is a total botch with a shortcut plot exposition which introduces all the clichs you could expect up to the very end this movie had potential especially in its acting but you can see good actors in other movies you dont have to suffer though this one,astonish
in 1965 los angeles a widowed mother and her two daughters add a new stunt to bolster their seance scam business and unwittingly invite authentic evil into their home when the youngest daughter is overtaken by a merciless spirit the family confronts unthinkable fears to save her and send her possessor back to the other sidefollowing up the truly great hush mike flanagan is back at the helm of a new horror picture and this time it is a prequel to the 2014 film ouija which i didnt see my main interest in this was to see flanagan delve into the genre again and hope to experience some of the same terror he has been able to give us in the past strangely enough this film is very light on the scares and shifts the focus on a more dramatic angle which works beautifully if only it werent that the build up does not pay offwhat is clear from this film is that flanagan is no average horror director and actually no average director at all the screen is filled with brilliant filmmaking and he manages to pull off some beautifully touching character moments that arent exactly what you are used to seeing in a horror film from the touches he adds to make the film have a retro 60s feel to the way he directs every single one of these actors he just demonstrates a confidence in the visual medium that is effortless to grasp and enjoywhat is really particular of this horror film is the fact that i wouldnt actually call it a horror film it is more of a supernaturalfamily drama firstly because the scares arent neither what the film is interested in nor are they scary more on that later furthermore what is primarily in focus here and what is the actively most engaging part is the characters who are being portrayed their story is absorbing it is filled with obstacles and since it is very hard not to empathize with these people it makes for a very riveting small scale drama the characters involved are five at best but every single one of their journeys is clearly presented to the audience all of them have legitimate reasons to do what they are doing and the more it went on the more i surprised myself with how much i was actually engaged by their stories and these actors performancesthe supernatural element is treated very smartly and gets incorporated into the story seamlessly and convincingly plus the fact that these people feel so real and authentic really gives the film a touch of greatness that i was surprised by i laughed multiple times and the character depth that the teenagers were graced with was something that really pleasantly surprised methe film has just one big problem it is not scary for some reason flanagan does not come back to the tension filled sequences he gave us in something like hush the vast majority of this films scares are basic jump scares with a pleasant touch of creepiness added yet only jump scares they remain for a moment in the finale it seems like we could be touching great suspense dynamics yet they are cut pretty fast basically the first two thirds of this film are amazing character development and genuine drama with which the viewer is really pulled into the picture the problem is that it feels like all of this is building up to something spectacular yet we end up with a final act that might have a couple of surprises up its sleeve even if they might be a little too out illogical but isnt able to deliver a satisfying finale to these characters story and enters territory thats way out of what the story world asked forstill i would say this stands up as a worthy film indicative of the directors great talents in technical filmmaking and competent storytelling,astonish
after the trailers the previous film and just the name ouija made me anticipate that this will be a bad film like the predecessor but whoevers idea it was to switch directors needs to get a highfive mike flanagan the director of hush and oculus two films i enjoyed comes in this film and totally turns this horror franchise around when i saw they were making a sequel to ouija i was just thinking cashgrab which is initially what horror sequels are but after seeing this film i didnt think that at all flanagan actually put effort and heart into it the story characters and execution of the scares was improved tenfold and the predictability that a lot of films have was pretty much nonexistent however i did give it a 7 out of 10 for a reason even though this is much better then the first it has flaws it takes a while for the film to get going the first quarter and a half was spent wondering and worrying and talking then the climax hits then stuff gets good but i took some sitting through to get there also the film despite being very good is actually forgettable there is nothing that stands out or is something i havent seen before besides this film takes a very familiar trait of a ghost story about possession weve seen that many many times before and this doesnt offer anything special or memorable however one thing i will remember is the little girl she was superb if you remember linda blair from the exorcist and how good that performance was this is just as much so i dont remember her name but im sure i eventually will she was excellent so with all that said i do enjoy this film as a whole and a sigh that it was a welcoming improvement over the first film mike flanagan you did a great job here are my grades story b characters a execution of scares b music c directing a acting a overall b,astonish
we went to check out ouija origin of evil 2016 last night and honestly it wasnt as bad as we had thought or was told it would be ouija origin of evil uses a ton of nicely used affects that have been used in most films of its genre the cast was for the most part good also average for this movie type so either way you look at it this film hit on the mark for others within this movie typeouija origin of evil 2016 did have a few areas that would make you jump it tried this tactic several times within the film till it became sort of over used but it did get me a time or two i liked the story it was simple and smooth on a small cast which worked well sort of the old school exorcist vibe to it certainly not a bad film for fans of this genre i believe youd enjoy it as we thought for the most part that it was very entertaining,astonish
ouija origin of evil is a prequel to a spooky yet lackluster original title ouija that scared me but received abysmal reviews i dont recall all of what happened in the original but i remembered some of the story and the twist in that one that leads to the story laid out in this movie the setting is 1967 in the same house where murders would come back to haunt teenagers in the present day during this time period a family that runs scams about contacting the dead lives there a mother alice zander elizabeth reaser and her two daughters lina annalise basso and doris lulu wilsonto spice up the act alice brings home a ouija board doris plays with it by herself and starts to communicate with an otherworldly being the special effects are subtle and not too overused but as doris becomes more possessed her eyes turn white and her mouth stretches overly large to create a disturbing visual the movie establishes a decent emotional core as the three women mourn the loss of the father and husband the need to reach out to the dead is understandable as they tread into dark magiccheck out more of this review and others at swillikycom,astonish
i was actually really annoyed by this movie but im the sort of person that rolls my eyes at a jump scare this gives you an indication of what sort of movie this might be it was a cgi driven amityville horroresque story which wasnt particularly inventive and definitely not new i think in order to work a horror movie has to have a surmountable obstacle for if our heroes cant defeat the obstacle and theres no hope of a victory then whats the point this movie had no victors and no satisfying resolution i saw this movie in a cinema full of teenage girls that screamed at every jump scare which got very irritating after the first hour or so really are jump scares that terrifying it made me sad that these are the sorts of thrillers being dished out to this generation none of the thrills in this movie are psychological additionally im not sure how many times ive seen the motif of the mouth being sewn up thats not scary anymore and im sick to death of heavily madeup monsters being shown on the screen when will filmmakers realise that what we cant see is more terrifying than what we canbleurgh you might get something out of it but hire it at home,astonish
ouija origin of evil is a prequel to the first ouija set in the 1960s where a fraudulant medium gets hold of a ouija board that spells demonic possession for her and her family its tired predictable stuff for sure an insipid picture from blumhouse productions that goes through the same old material weve seen countless times the cast is uninteresting with former child star henry thomas wasted as the investigating priest and the cgi stretchedmouth scares are laughable,astonish
i dont understand the ghost it dosent look demonic or scary but the movie is creepy it is a good movie however the demon made me laugh out loud,astonish
its a cheap knockoff of the conjuring in a way but its still a not great but infitely better than the first ouija,astonish
its rare that i give this genre such a high score because most director rely on cheap thrillsthis however was a pleasant surprise i was delighted to wath this 80s style piece of cinema that unfolded itself slowly and masterfully and most important tastefullyunfortunately i hated the ending,astonish
can we pleaseeeee stop with the giant mouth opening shit like it was freaky the first time we saw it i laugh every time now the movie is pretty unoriginal i am a fan of ghostscreepy movies the atmosphere wasnt that creepy the acting was pretty good a few of the jumpy scenes were good youll want to put this one on in the background while youre doing homework or something,astonish
mike flanagan has been a director to watch since his film oculus with his netflix movie hush he really gave a sense to the way he directs suspensehorror movies with ouija origin of evil he beautifully displays yet again why he is one of the best horror movie directors working todaywith todays modern horror i can see why audiences find ooe hardly scary at all no jump scares not graphic not gory which is what i think to be the downfall of movie goers these days and i cant blame them over and over we anticipate scary movies to be so over the top that when a movie like ouija comes we push aside because it didnt meet those standards of silliness mike flanagan way of creating fear is by simply placing it on the screen it is completely silent the way it would be at your house when you think you see something in the shadows or you hear a bump in the night there is no loud music no dumb jump scare to a cat popping out of the cabinet the fear is just thereanother credit to the director is the way he chose to direct it the movie takes place in the 60s and boy does he really make you feel like you are in that time era not only with the clothes or the cars but the way the movie is how the title of the movie just appears on the screen with the old school font title at the bottom to the cigarette burns you see at the top right corner of the screen as if it signals to change the reel of the film you even see a jump in the screen as if it were really changed all the little details to this movie is down to flawlessthe acting across the board is great with a standout performance by lulu wilson playing doris be on the lookout for her in future films the way she is able to deliver lines in the most bone chilling way literally makes you quiver want to know what it feels like to be strangled to death absolutely frighteningi definitely recommend this film as it not only surpasses its the first one that was trash but shows a new way of horror go in with a open mind and enjoy the film,astonish
i was not expecting a good film i was expecting as usual with sequels especially in the horror genre a mediocre but entertaining filmcould not have been more wrong in watching this one by my self  big mistakethe story starts out slow but midway through it picks up and turns into an intense creep fest without giving too much away all i can say is that this installment is surprisingly good and even better than the original its smart in using tactics and angles to creep you out strong story with good acting always elevates cinematic projects like this but what truly did it for me is that it sort of defied some horror basics and played by the horror movie rules by adding a smart direction to it its an excellent horror film that does not rely on a heavy r rating and goreviolence to deliver chills now that is smart do not watch this movie alonefinal grade b,astonish
yeah its kinda like that series well except the exceptional writing great acting ingenious subplots and intrigue but hey you get it all under two hours verses a full seasoni was told ouija origin of evil is better than the original i only bothered with this movie because of that recommendation and the fact i was the told the same thing about the other ghost story part 2 in 2016 the conjuring part 2 while i agree with the conjuring part 2 being tremendously better than its original i graciously disagree herewhile the first third isnt that bad as the movie progresses it gets incredibly sillier to the point i was literally laughing out loud at some of the scary scenes mainly including the younger daughters i am legends bad special mouth effects seriously i was completely cracking up where the director probably wasnt expecting or desiring that reactionthe movie is supposed to be a prequel to the 2014 undeserved smash hit ouija but i found no connection outside the game of the witchboard its set in the 60s where a scamartist family falls prey to the board while i appreciate the filmmakers going in a different direction than the failed original its just turned hokey towards the midtofinal acts that takes you completely out of the picture and absolutely makes you yawn skip this messfinal thoughts while also not perfect this makes me wanna rewatch 1986s witchboard for the xth time that campy mid80s flicksooo enjoyable thisnot so much,astonish
i think ouija origin of evil is superior to its predecessor ouija but i still didnt find it very satisfactory what hurts me the most is that ouija origin of evil starts pretty well and it eventually degenerates into chaos and confusion which demerit its pros to start with we can compare the premise of this prequel with the one of the original ouija in the first film a group of friends plays with an ouija and unleashes the rage of a vindictive ghost the lack of effort and creativity in setting up the premise is clearly noticed on the opposite ouija origin of evil presents a much more interesting situation a dishonest but not malicious psychic has sincere intentions to relieve the sorrow of her customers with false readings she organizes with the help of her daughters employing classic tricks of spiritism which were already employed in 19th century their introduction to the ouija is only with theatrical purposes in order to make the experiences of the customers more convincing until strange things start to happen unfortunately as i previously mentioned ouija origin of evil eventually loses cohesion while introducing arbitrary manifestations which feel forced and excessive until getting to a confusing ending nevertheless elizabeth reaser annalise basso lulu wilson and henry thomas feel credible and enthusiastic in their roles in conclusion after a pretty good start ouija origin of evil ends up disappointing for not being able to keep the same narrative discipline afterwards however it kept me moderately entertained and i think i can give it a slight recommendation to sum up ouija origin of evil offers a tolerable horror dose to occupy our time but its mediocre and definitely inferior to many films which are much more suitable to enjoy during the halloween month,astonish
the sequel and prequel to the critically panned ouija ouija origin of evil is about a family contacting the dead through the titular board game only to have the youngest possessed by something demonic now the first film wasnt great it was watchable but nothing memorable that probably didnt warrant a sequelbut yet here we are interestingly thoughthe sequel is much better its just a shame it is still missing something firstly the acting was great the youngest of the family was genuinely creepy the older sister was a typical teenager but had some depth and the mother had an emotional pastthis all sounds like a typical horror movie but the characters were handled with extra care thankfully the script was able to elevate the characters slightly it was sharp and concise with some excellent dialogue between the family members the direction was great with slowly panning camera angles a few one take shots and also throwing in some quick cuts to create the creepy atmosphere the runtime was adequate at 99 minutes it was not too long and was not too short so the story was perfectly developed so what was missing the story itself had no substance and that means not being invested in the characters it was all very predictable and tedious and the problem with being a prequel is that we know how the film ends there was no room for twists in the plot therefore remaining formulaic and unfortunately that means it is boring a horror film is not a horror film without scares so how scary is it you ask its hit and miss some of the scares are executed well and retain the tension however the majority of them are cheap jump scares just loud noises to scare the viewers and unfortunately this is becoming a common trait in most hollywood horror movies a lot of these jump scares are also predictable and just dont deliver the chills it needed todidnt help i was in a cinema full of teenagers who had to laugh every time they got scared overall ouija origin of evil was a much better executed film compared to its predecessor but the story lacked substance and was full of cheap jump scaresreview at httpwwwthemoviedioramacom,astonish
a surprisingly engaging story with good performances all round a mix of body and haunted house is sure to bring the scares,astonish
i enjoyed the movie but i really wanted it to be scary it seemed to have potential but sadly its as scary as a road runner cartoon glad to see eliot from et is still getting work in a nutshell lame,astonish
never been a fan of horror movies with children the plot and the story line has a bit of a new flavour but would have liked it without brutality with little ones so my rating for this movie is low purely because of that,astonish
of course with such an obvious title like ouija  ill bet you could never guess what this little tale of terror is gonna be about neverand because ouija has a pg13 rating you can be sure that both its level of horror and its visuals of gore are gonna be toned down bigtimeand you can also be sure that as the story progresses theres never gonna be any good that ever comes out of playing with an ouija board never even if its strictly for laughsyes ouija did have some good production values and yes there were some fairly eerie moments throughoutbut overall  ouijas suspensefactor was sustained for far too long which reduced its story to a purely predictable level that hohum ended on one of the most cliched notes imaginable,astonish
the most dire horror film ever made dont believe the ratings theyre wrong its truly awfulbad actingbad script bad cgidoesnt deserve a rating its so badyou have been warned,astonish
its amazing how they turned things around the first ouija was awful a real time waster it was such a great surprise how they turned this around making it a good film to watch despite its flawsand jump scares the acting was good the effect a were awesome and honestly you can get crypt by some scenes its like the people involved actually care to make a decent movie not just cash a lame horror movie that will become forgettable over timeover all this was good a decent movie to investing your time in its just worth your while despite its flawes the movie makes sense and the period is based on is well madego watch it even with the blumhouse lame trademark jump scare at the end,astonish
i am quite hesitant when it comes to horror films as most of them are not scary at all and majority of them is quite boring so i had no expectations going into this one and i was right it is not bad but it is not great either it is somewhere in the middle but i am giving at rating 6 as it is not quite boring and some scenes were actually goodi do not understand why the film had to be placed in the 60s i did watch ouija or original film and i did not really like it this one is better saying that i forgot what was happening in the 1st one so maybe that has to do with timing of the filmthe end of the film is puzzling that old woman in the mental institutionisnt she the star of some other horror films so it is confusing why is she here or that was done on purpose horror films which have no links  connect though of course why wouldnt a woman from one horror film star in other horror filmi think the red hair girl is also in some other horror filmall in all not bad but you can choose something more entertaining  like the autopsy of jane doe that is something new for a horror,astonish
i saw ouijaorigin of evil starring elizabeth reaserhellomy name is doris the twilight movies lulu wilsonthe millerstv deliver us from evil annalise bassocaptain fantastic oculus and henry thomasdear john gangs of new yorkthis is a sequel and not a sequel to the 2014 movie ouija it is actually a prequel which takes place about 50 years earlier than the first movie in 1965 los angeles where elizabeth a widower with two young daughters is working a seance scam she uses her daughters9 year old lulu  14 year old annalisein the business to help make customers believe they are talking to departed dead relatives elizabeth hears about a new board gameby hasbrothat might add some spice to her con game so she brings one home that is when the fun begins real spirits are released by the game and want corporeal bodies and decide to start with little luluhey i could be mistaken but wasnt that the name of an old cartoon character anyway henry the resident priest tries to help out with the situation but is severely under qualified fyi the annalise character is the connecting character to the first movie i dont know if you saw the first ouija or notit wasnt that goodbut this one is definitely better and you do not have to have seen the first movie to enjoy this one there is a scene after the end credits so make sure you stay for itit has a character from the first movie in it its rated pg13 for disturbing images and terror and has a running time of 1 hour  39 minutes i would probably buy this one on dvdas opposed to the first one being a wait for cable viewing,astonish
ive been scared by horror movies beforebut never physically incapacitated by onei may never write another review with that line in it and i doubt i have previouslyalthough i havent seen the original film of which this is a prequel to it looks at the characters from that film and what went wrong when a trial of a ouija board by a family of fake mediums accidentally conjures up a real ghost with the mostlittle lulu wilson superbly creepy is the youngest of the family used as a cute conduit by evil spirits the quality of the acting does not unfortunately continue up the ranks of the cast but director mike flanagan and the technical teams ability to create some genuinely physically unnerving moments is never for once in question,astonish
a retro prequel to the 2014 horror film based on the infamous ouija board this film explores the place that has a fine line between our reality and the other sideit focuses on a family of 1 single woman with 2 daughters and she is a fake medium pretending to communicate with the dead and justifying her cause by giving people closure until of course they discover the ouija board and learn of its powers and their own compatibility with iti didnt feel as though these characters were very deep or unique you have the single strong caring mother the rebellious older daughter and the young innocent carefree daughter who because of her age is not the slightest bit phased by an entity from another realm and then the two supporting roles who are a priest and the daughters polite and shallow boyfriendthe relationships between all of these characters was limited and the boundaries were rarely touched upon whereas in groundbreaking memorable horrors these boundaries are always pushed and twisted which is what ties the story up in fascinating knots the only reason i felt like the characters had interactions with each other was to mildly further the plot but not develop characters or to keep us curious andor intriguedthe themes of this horror are the fears of not being safe in your own home fear of the your loved ones in danger possession and evil spirits with evil intentions obviously you have the board in this movie which connects us with other beings but it is when something inevitably goes wrong and channels through the youngest daughter that we experience the true nature of what lurks on the other side one thing i can say is we witness an exceptional performance from lulu wilson as doris the young girl as she goes through the changes she is very intimidating however the cgi of her possession and the demon appearing occasionally were more comical than menacing and the over amplified and boosted demonic voice does not compare to the classics like the exorcistthis film has a good genuine concept but lacks originality and never quite peaked at any time throughout it has potential but rather than explore the world of the supernatural it sticks to the jump scares tense cutting and ordinary horror soundtrack,astonish
although this film is a prequel so having not seen this original its better to start with this one set in 1967 los angeles the story moves so leisurely one can imagine the movie audience fidgeting impatiently for the action to start its slow true but the tension does build and the things little doris spies through the planchettes glass are only given in tantalizing glimpses the usual shock scene of something thrust into the viewers face as she peers through the glass is absent perhaps making its actual appearance even scarierthe story a widow supporting herself and her two children by giving seances is shocked to learn her youngest daughter has contacted her dead father through a ouija board when the child finds money saying her father told her where to find it so they can pay off a foreclosure the mother gets the idea of having the girl help her with her seances and give actual readings to clients she keeps the child out of school to do readings and its surprising no one investigates this since the priest who runs the school is very aware things go from there to worse when something not her fathers spirit invades the childthere are so many moment in which the expected horrific images are given chances to appear and those are ignored using doris to convey them which makes the action even more frighteningall in all the absence of ghostly presences with most of the spectral action conveyed through the child makes it even more frightening though i had hoped for the fathers spirit to perhaps intervene a bit indeed he does little more than appear a couple of times perhaps not being strong enough to fight the true evil lurking in the houseanyone whos seen the original movie knows how this is going to end but its still frightening when it doesgood lowkey performances by all with a truly eerie one by the child actress portraying who carries the storythis dvd was viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review,astonish
for the beginning i must say there is absolutely no connection between the first movie and this successful sequel some viewers will criticize lots of clichs like sewn up mouths mysterious ouija boards creepycursed little girls with scary eyes  yes but seeing all these clichs i think lots of viewers even the neverhappy critics liked some scenes of jumpingthe little girl character played by lulu wilson she clearly does have a bright future  was creepy we are all used to see japanese girls whose pale faces semicovered with longdarkhairs this time a nice looking 9 year old blonde cutie turns out to be a white eyed demonic creature whispering into peoples earsthere was no really bloody scene but reaching to the end you find yourselves wishing that house burn and the movie end understanding that there is no way for that family to be normal again at the ending the director mike flanagan proves why he is at least for lots of movie fans one of the best horror movie director in the industry,astonish
this movie was very well done although the story is of course nothing new  it was remade in a very high production value way visuals and immersion worked well for me  and there was a lot of nice detailmind you there were only like 2 major locations  the house and the schoolacting was good  except the mothers acting in the last act i did like it before  but in that act it felt unnatural and actually broke my immersion noticeably i do not know why that was so  maybe i imagined it but i really disliked itwhile the movie had only sparse effects in the first half  it became quite abundant in the last half but they were placed well enough for a good effect there werent many really any cheap jump scares  the movie rather used peripheral effects most of the time with a few well placed center focused full screen effectsin terms of the story  i very much appreciate a story where the protagonists actually communicate and act quite naturally that means they do not stubbornly deny anything until neither do they progress through the story in blissful ignorance the characters talked to each other drew good conclusions and also acted on those conclusionsall in all  this movie is highly recommended  alone or with friends when it is darkpostscript the movie would have worked just as well without the namesake ouija board which plays a rather insignificant role,astonish
ouija origin of evil is the stylish prequel to 2014s sillyscary ouijadirector mike flanagan mostly eschews jumpscares as he deftly delivers a state of unease that incorporates a flirtatious rapport between mom and the young priestprincipal of the girls school the films ending is baffling and a dropin holocaust twist to a houses supernatural secrets is out of place ouija origin of evil is deliciously creepy thanks largely to a good performance by the youngest of its starsmr flanagan springs some effective scares though eventually the proceedings turn a little silly i go with 355 for this very better improvement on its predecessor,astonish
the main thing i have a problem with in oiuja is the performances at times they are pretty good and then at others the whole thing feels messed up the most consistent was the youngest daughter but even her very purposeful movements which are meant to be creepy just look weird and forcedthe film does take a while to get going and i like how it develops the characters a lot more than other horror movies do i didnt quite get the feeling of actually caring for the people but it was a good attempt i think the characters needed to be a bit more likable but that could just be meso basically the first half of the movie is a solid horror film but it devolves into an average movie with strange actions by the family that dont fit with anything normal people would do thats so typical for films like this so i cant bash on it too muchoverall it had nothing really special about it and the final act of the film kind of went all over the pace and felt kind of rushed because of the focus on the family for the first half of the film,astonish
the ouija board has been a staple in the horror genre dating all the way back to 1944 when the very first horror movie featuring this spiritual boardgame was released the premise is almost always very simple a group of people get together and sometimes as a joke use the ouija board to get in contact with the afterlife the ouija board however has a small set of rules one must abide by in order to play without any troubles more often than not these rules are broken and as a result one of the players becomes possessed with an evil spirit ouija origin of evil directed by mike flanagan follows a similar premise and has a story centered around a small family consisting of a widowed mother and her two daughters by means of an ouija board the family tries get into contact with their father who passed away a few years ago what they dont know is that they unwittingly invite pure evil into their homes causing the youngest daughter to be overtaken by a merciless spirit a problem with the story of ouija origin of evil is its predictableness if youve ever seen a horror movie and more specifically one featuring an ouija board then you have pretty much already seen this movie every side characters is pretty much disposable and the major plot twists never appear as a surprise the horror side of the movie is also very hit or miss there are some very well done psychological horror moments that definitely create an eerie feeling and the sense of tension is often times extremely high sadly the many predictable jumpscares present in the second half of the movie do not manage to capitalize on this and quite often have an almost jarring effect that can pull one out of the movie mixed in are also some minor attempts at gore horror which felt extremely misplacedthe movie starts out a little slower than most horror style movies as it really takes its time to set up most of its characters a lot of times this was done through conversations characters had with one another by dropping a lot of not so subtle hints at their past this heavy use of expositional dialogue is extremely blatant however unlike most horror style movies it isnt crammed into a mere five minutes the movie really takes its time to at least try and get the audience invested into the characters before moving on to the spooky part of the story it fails to execute this properly considering the family as a whole does not feel genuine whatsoever the mother alice and the oldest daughter lina never actually seems to care about their family and these characters are ultimately extremely forgettable by far the best acting amongst the main cast comes from the eleven year old actress lulu wilson in portraying the youngest daughter doris her character definitely conveys a great sense of creepiness that really adds to the horror vibe in this film all in all ouija origin of evil is a mixed bag the horror moments are extremely hit or miss the acting overall isnt very good and the story is extremely predictable however with low expectations this one is definitely fun to watchmy rating 510,astonish
if you have never seen the movie the ouija then your in the clear but if you have seen the movie then while your watching this one you will know the ending before it even gets near the story itself is entertaining and the acting is superb the little girl in the movie makes the whole story believable and downright freaky the special effects were not cheesy which is a major plus unlike the conjuring 2 the casting agency did a great job putting together a wonderful cast that delivered the story well the only issue about prequels like this is knowing the ending and not being excited for it it can ruin the element of surprise,astonish
a mom and her two daughters have a fancy scam setup deceiving their customers during fake seances to make them believe they are communicating with a deceased loved one still it doesnt pay for the bills yet she doesnt seem to have problems paying the catholic school for the girls this is in 1967ouija is released and the mom buys it to add it to the scam paraphernalia the older daughter lina has already played it with her friends among whom is a boy she likes they ladies try it out they want to talk to the husbandfather who is dead he does answer the little girl doris starts playing it by herself and she makes contact with someone named markus she and lina have nightmaresvisions but doris isnt troubled except for some neckpain one day shes told about some money in the basemen and indeed she finds it now the mom can avoid foreclosure doris acts weird at school and draws the attention of the head priest who one day goes out to dinner with the mom but they just toast to another life when something between them could happenone day lina sees doris furiously writing she takes the pages to the priest it written in polish he knows a nun who can translate with the translation he visits the mom to talk about what is going on with the girl by then doris has already dispatched linas love interestturns out that markus who has sort of possessed doris was a homeless guy who had emigrated from poland where he was tortured by a nazi nicknamed dr death in the us he ran into him again what are the odds and was captured by him in the drs lairthe moms family housemarkus witnessed and experienced all the horrors againand now the mom lina and the priest find the lair in the basement a bunch of skeletons with their mouths  sewn shut something that has happened to the girls as well at some point and even to a doll now they have to fight these forces somehowouija 2 is like most of these fashionable seancepossession horror movies its a sober mature slower horror movie thats not particularly scary nor thrilling it has one good scare the background of the ghosts is mildly interesting the moment between the mom and the priest is touching other than that its the usual nearly allgirl movie dealing with a situation pretty much all by themselves i guess this movie dared going beyond the hollywood agenda by hiring a male to play the priest i also liked that they went for classic horror with the creatures in the background out of focus it reminded me in that regard of the much better we are still here most of the stuff weve seen before white corneas mouths growing shut lit pupils crawling along walls and the ceiling lulu  wilson shines in the role of the creepy little girl other than that the movie is pretty tepid and nothing about which to get too excited,astonish
   ouija origins of evil makes a fairly direct case that the roman cult has given rise to much if not most of the evil in this world quantum physics and string theory inform us that humans can make things real by simply imagining them if you build your dream castles for demons they will come have you ever noticed that there are no flicks about methodists mennonites lutherans or presbyterians who have the sudden needor urgefor an exorcist though ouija 2 is set in 1967 mom alice zander is suspicious enough of the roman cult leaders that shes spent her life around that she shows up for her dinner date with father tom virtually topless in a desperate attempt to keep his demonic libido away from her two young daughters yet torsos are stabbed bones are cracked lips are sewn young folks hung and minds broken despite alices precautions when ouija ends alice doesnt live here any more,astonish
saw this just tonight  have to say it was greatthose who panned the first ouija would call this a so called improvement i thought it was a great sequelprequel if not an equally great sequelprequel to the originalthe film is about a single mum  her daughters as scam artists for the paranormal seances who con people out there money the mother comes across a ouija board dun dun dun  she tries to use this as a hoax until the daughter used a a gateway starts to communicate with a war veteran who killed people by ripping their tongues out  silencing them via cutting their vocal cords he was evil  his wrong doings where left in the grave yard in their house  they awaken a dormant spirit via this ouija board so thats the premisethe scares were good as always  the story 1960s setting was great it was a good film  trailer delivered greatly the film was overall great  was equally as good as the first the dark humour was great  the sinister setting was epic the scene with the school boy getting sling shotted himself was epic  great with the dark twisted humour the scene with the daughter  her sisters bf was great talking about in detail how  what it is like to be strangled to death man that was sinister as fki overall found this to be a great sequelprequel to the 2014 original which was epic as fk  as great as this film was 910,astonish
because i dont condone making girls act possessed for the love of god stop buying up all the ad space i do not want to see your filmhollywood has resorted to millions of dollars in cgi or pushing the extremes of perversity and terror the only things that films have become are more gross more rude past the point of forgiveness or more violently dramatized stop spending ad money to promote a failure to express your simple minded  fad perversions i would appreciate if we could be at least civil minded to cater to my ad choices internet i dont accept being interrupted for nonsense from peaceful calming music,astonish
poor execution of ideas and weak storyline theres nothing in the movie that scares you except one scene where you find the man in the mirror a total waste of time,astonish
it was okay better than the first one but not really what it could be minus one star because i couldnt quite deal with them summoning demons using a hasbrobrand toy sorry,astonish
prequel to the disappointing ouija nicely set in 1967 so we are treated to cars and fashions from that period which also means no 21st century annoying brats i thought the first half was slowly but surely building to something genuinely intriguing but that sadly started to fall apart at the first sight of of a bad spirit that looked like an alien dressed in a gimp outfit from then on it becomes ever increasingly silly with big plot holes the discovery of a secret laboratory in the basement used after the end of ww2 by a former nazi which comes complete with still working electrical lights yeah yeah whatever i disagree with some reviewers the acting i felt was fine the film does deliver a few good scares early on trouble is they lose their power after a while and thats the problem  the makers threw too much at the audience and i just became immune to itbetter than the original though that is not saying much however still only an average horror movie and further proof that the name blumhouse is not a guarantee for successstay tuned to the end credits there is a brief but relevant post credit scene,astonish
its not scary its not original and the only terrifying thing about it was the acting gamebut i admit maybe the movie deserves 35 because the first 30 minutes of it were not that bad however after that most of the scenes were either ridiculous or very boring and predictable and this special effects looked so cheap made i dont know how someone can think this is a good horror movie or a good movie at all,astonish
what a slow mo stinkfest as bad as flanagans hill house series he spends too much time on gadgety photographykid actor lulu is just awfulpu stop giving flanagan money,astonish
an appropriate bookend film to be viewed before 2018s the haunting of hill house this movie has a lot of things in common with the subsequent series by mike flanaganouija origin of evil has many trademark mike flanagan horror tropes but they are effective and well executedwith a wonderful retro feel complete with vintage universal titles and cigarette burns this is an appropriate film for those who want something of a feel good horror film its not a bundle of laughs but it is for the most part warm and soft moments of nastiness are limited and tastefully delivered for a younger audience8 out of 10 not a perfect film i didnt really like the resolution but its definitely worth a watch i must confess i enjoyed its predecessor so this prequel was a pleasant surprise stay for the whole end titles too theres a subtle link to the original ouija movie for the patient viewer,astonish
typical horror movie with a very predictable scenario few jump scares and a retro vibe ticks all the boxes for a horror film tv dinner night but its definitely not at pizza level,astonish
ouija origin of evil is a true and surprising delight for horror fans this film was beautifully shot directed and acted the story was great but the ending could of been a little better but all and all this film truly entertained watched this the other night with a group of friends and every one of them loved it so definitely give this movie a watch i gave this movie a 10 because of the acting directing and cinematography like i said the ending could of been better but i didnt hate it enough to drop down my rating so watch it people,astonish
lets just start with who doesnt think little girls are creepy i mean everything about them is and the lead creepster kid really brings their natural creepiness to lightthe film itself was well paced thought out and enjoyable i recommend it with hot chocolate and a curly wurly bar as it really sets it off,astonish
it is 1967 recently widowed alice runs a spiritualist scam business with the aid of daughters doris 9 and lina midteens buying a ouija board to bring in as a prop for the scambusiness may not have been the most sensible move however as it appears to exert a malign influence on doristhis film struck me as efficient it does exactly what you want a horror film to do it sets out its stall it builds nicely it feeds you some scares and it delivers a climax which is exciting and adequately horrifying and then as expected finishes of with a chilling little postscript it does this with a good sense of period design with excellent performances particularly from the two girls who play doris and lina and with a feeling of genuine commitment from performers and crew at no point does it scare you out of your pants without giving you fair warning that a scary bit is on the way i might have wished for some plotlines to have finished differently but i cant complain at them i can complain at the mystery thingies however which were never explained in any way whatsoever  what they were what they wanted what they were doing and i can also complain at how the deceased father was given a role which ultimately didnt really go anywherei was interested to note that whereas japanese ghost children are black and white wet have wide starting eyes and creak like doors with rusty hinges american possessed children have white eyes open their mouths very wide and scrabble along walls and ceilings i find it helps to know the nationalities of haunted childrenand so thats what happened to elliott from etas far as horror films go this one works well,astonish
amazing movie i could watch it again i love lulu wilson and annalise basso they are so beautiful and great actors,astonish
yeah some bits were lame sure but that kid creepy afi was wondering about the story of dz and paulina i think they did a good job with this prequel i was sufficiently creeped out,astonish
the power of suggestion just cant be underestimated when my expectations are high im disappointed but when they low and really really low in this case im often intrigued and yet that doesnt distort the fact that ouija part two is a miracle an awful timeworn premise the ouija a vapid predecessor and an almost certainty a worse film than for example i know what you did last summer part two turns out this one is a very very good movie it doesnt deserve an 8 probably more a 7 but i gave it a bump just because of the miracle,astonish
its 1967 los angeles alice zander elizabeth reaser runs a crooked spiritual reading business out of her home she uses her daughters lina annalise basso and younger doris lulu wilson in operating her scams they incorporate an ouija board into their production while trying to contact the girls dead father doris seems to make real contact father tom henry thomas is the headmaster of the girls school mikey parker mack has a crush on linasurprise this is actually good it is wellmade the characters are welldrawn and wellacted i wouldnt say that this is breaking down any new walls but there is good in doing good work i do have a couple of small nitpicks for some reason alice and father tom go out for what looks like a fancy dinner it almost looks like a date if it werent for the characters second i would keep the possibility that doris is scamming everyone until further into the movie it would be nice to have father tom uncover the whole situation as a reveal the good are the actors the mood the simple premise and good construction its a shocker that this is all pretty good,astonish
im going to start by admitting i shouldnt like this movie as much as i did its clich in so many ways they use the loud orchestral pops to make you jump throughout the movie but while cheap i found many to be chilling the pg13 rating took away from some of the scenes im not look for gratuitous gore but some of what occurred in the movie was simply too clean to believe what was happening the premise of the movie is a mother of two makes a living as a psychic medium she uses various mechanisms to put on a believable show so that she can provide peace for the families who come to see her after deciding to add a ouija board to her business for added effect after her younger daughter begins playing with the ouija board the daughter seems to gain the gift of being able to do what her mother only pretended to do for her clients and thats where business picks up the movie was corny throughout and the effects were low grade you could practically see where the harnesses were attached when bodies were thrown about the ending was rather clunky and sudden i guess i generally like movies involving the ouija board although its not inherent as i wasnt crazy about the movie ouija 2014 the movie for which this movie is a prequel but i loved the movie witchboard1986 and its sequel witchboard 2 1992 so why did i like this one all i can say is i was entertained maybe ill have to ask a ouija board goodbye,astonish
trying to operate their illegal scam service a widow and her teenage daughters running fake seances for rich clients find themselves in real trouble when an innocent game with an ouija board turns into a nightmare when they unleash a terrible evil and must stop it before it takes her overthis was quite a fun and thrilling supernatural effort what really gives this one a lot to like is the rather strong and striking action played out throughout the film the opening seance scene where the offscreen noises and shadows around the room lead to a belief in the supernatural that eventually turns out to be a part of their scam service gives this a strong start while theres more to like about the way this one targets the daughters as the haunting scenes grow far more dangerous throughout the film many of these occur through the seance scenes that are placed in here which allows this to take full advantage of its premise with the kids playing with the board on several occasions in brief rather fun spurts to help sell their supernatural plight adding to the scares is the rather heartwarming factor brought into play when they realize the true nature of their ghostly visitors coming along to help them as the scene where they all see the gameplay by itself and see whats been going on the entire time by the time it changes into the more deadly and dangerous setups later on they generate more of an impression as the frantic scenes of her getting manipulated by the ghosts in her room the disfigurement dream she has with her sister and the series of behavioral outbursts that slowly seem to suggest something is happening to them once it really throws the idea of the possession into fullforce this becomes much more fun with the events inside the basement at the end which are a lot of fun and manage to really work out some fun ideas from the revelation of the houses history and how the daughter connects to it all to the chilling supernatural action that occurs in the basement which gives this a really frantic finale while these here work nicely for the film it does have a few rather prominent flaws the main issue here is the fact that theres just not a whole lot of interest in what happens in the first half the fact that this one goes through the idea of their scam business and then moves on to their other plight really doesnt leave this one with a whole lot of interest as it simply drags on far longer than it really should some of the problems are based on the fact that very little of what happens here is really all that scary as this is content to have her worry about her imaginary friends and play with the board which doesnt generate any kind of real thrills this does lead to a longer startup that expected and gives this a longer running time than what should really be required here as well the films rating doesnt really let it go the type of extremes this couldve generated as many of the scenes are the typical type found here and dont really generate much else here beyond these jump scare setups beyond these issues it doesnt have a lot else wrongrated pg13 violence language and childreninjeopardy,astonish
ouija was poorly executed and badly received and is generally regarded as one of 2014s worst films so its hard to imagine anyone eagerly lining up around the block for a followup film as it turns out the prequel ouija origin of evil is a massive improvement on its predecessortalented director mike flanagan  confirming his status as the latest horror maestro by adding this to his 2016 output alongside hush and before i wake  has been brought in to class up the proceedings and he succeeds admirably flanagan captures the look and feel of 1967 los angeles and adds a number of neat visual throwbacks and details such as universals 196390 logo that opens the film origin of evil also has more on its mind than might be expected raising some interesting ideas around the issues of faith belief and the existence of an afterlife mainly via protagonist alice elizabeth reaser and most effectively when it examines with her belief that the supernatural force in her home is her husband attempting contact from beyond the gravethe film has a number of effective frights with the scene where doris lulu wilson first sees a ghostly apparition through the ouijas planchette probably being the best jumpscare wilson also brilliantly delivers a monologue to her sisters boyfriend about being strangled to death an utterly chilling moment and thanks to wilson one of the standout scenes of the film its also nice to see annalise basso back in another mike flanagan film after she showed such promise in the brilliant oculusunfortunately origin of evil goes a bit off the rails in the final act up to this point much of the film thrives on how the haunting plays into the family dynamic and the feelings of the characters but this is abandoned in favor of a seenitallbefore haunted house explanation which feels overthetop for this particular story the depiction of doris possession also becomes a bit stereotypical as the film goes on she spiderwalks up the side of a wall stretches her mouth to inhuman lengths whispers malevolently in the ears of other charactersall things that feel old hat and arent always visually convincing unlike the aforementioned monologue scene ultimately it feels like origin of evil succumbs to typical supernaturalhorror excess making it only twothirds a great film and overall simply a quite good one but for a followup to such a dreadful first entry into the franchise this film is far better than anyone had a right to expect,astonish
this movie gives us some background as expected on how did the ouija become vulnerable to real spirits the story is kind of plausible but unoriginal to say the least the performances are very acceptable specially on the older sister who has some difficult scenes on her parti enjoyed the movies progression it wasnt boring or anything and it had some thrilling scenes however it all comes down to this you simply cannot do a good thrillerhorror movie with bad special effects the enlarged mouthface you see in the trailer gives away the poor quality of cgi and thats really pretty much youre going to get when it comes to scares this makes the movie completely ridiculous and an overall mediocre horror experience producers need to start understanding that if the effects are unrealistic the movie will suck unless its a horror comedy so please just refrain from producing them in the first placemy verdict a fun movie if you can ignore the pathetic effects i couldnt,astonish
a young los angeles widow struggles to make ends meet and uses her two daughters in a scam seance business new customers are attracted when a ouija board is added to the act the youngest daughter doris lulu wilson is intrigued and drawn to the board believing she is in contact with the spirit of her dead father a malevolent entity is in deed summoned all hell can only break looseseveral real good jump scares with building suspense and a simmering sense of doom character development is better than a lot of horror flicks and some good acting with miss wilson leading the way kudos to director mike flanagan some chilling atmospheric music tooalso in the cast elizabeth reaser annalise basso parker mack halle charlton doug jones and henry thomas,astonish
its a scary movie alright but not much story otherwisefor me a good scary movie need to have a story in addition to the scariness for some reason scary movie makers think that if the movie is scary then a complete story is not neededand a story needs to have an ending just like music needs to have an ending if a music stopped in the middle you can tell it has not reached its end and thats how it feels with this movie there is no ending they just run out of story or budget,astonish
i wasnt impressed with the first ouija but i didnt think it was one of the worst films id ever seen as most would have you believe sure it was the exact kind of cashcow deadcenter of creativity horrorfilmmaking that we could certainly use less of in this decade but it wasnt wretched rather just absolutely mediocre i wouldnt have had any interest in this prequel either but the involvement of mike flanagan director of abesentia oculus hush etc won me over i knew he would do something interesting and genuine with the film and he did its still not what it couldve been though and i think the weakest film this director has put out yet the film starts out strong with an atmospheric and effective opening sequence and i like the characters and concept of a family of scammers who encounter actual spirits but halfway through the film becomes somewhat cheesy and contrived instead of remaining subtle and loses its effect the actors are all very good especially the youngest girl who gives a frightening and mature performance i also really appreciate the usage of actual film which lends the picture a beautiful look while this is not a great film its still miles above most of the films coming out nowadays which is why i continue to praise flanagans work whether you hated the first or not this one actually deserves a look,astonish
this movie instantly puts you into a different era which you can tell as soon as the studio insignia comes up and it continues throughout the movie with the screen blips that makes it seem like you are watching actual film i was very surprised that they were able to convey such a creepy and horrific feeling in this movie especially with a pg13 ratingit doesnt rely on cheap jump scares but gives you the tension and creepycrawlies through the telling of the story and the fantastic acting especially the two sisters when doris lulu wilson talks to her sisters boyfriend about what it feels like to be choked i got goosebumps and when doris who was just staring at the tv is suddenly staring at the other people in the room you can feel the evil radiating from heri dont jump a lot while watching horror movies but towards the end some of the effects that they did without cgi had me jumping the scene that takes place on the stairs and with the boyfriend was just perfecti highly recommend this one and feel like i need to make a new graphic so i can give it more than five stars,astonish
ouija origin of evil being a better sequel surprisingly even from the lowest standard that the predecessor set back in 2014 yes this sequel is way better which the first movie followed with a nonexistent story terrible acting and clichs with teens making stupid decisions the sequel improves with about everything all thanks to new writers and director in this film like mike flanagan who takes the story back in 1967 which does create a classic horror movie feel that has a look with tone that the exorcist and other classic horror movies had from the films editing look with color tone cinematography and so on the plot follows a widow alice elizabeth reaser who lost her husband in an accident so raising her two daughters alone is hard enough all while trying to pay for the mortgage she makes money by scamming people to believing she is a psychic reader and can talk to the dead in the spiritual world her oldest daughter paulina annalise basso and the youngest doris lulu wilson are involved in it by rigging the dining room table to shake and lighting up the candles and cause a shadow effect through the curtains alice discovers an ouija board game that they can use as a prop for their scamming business tempting to use the board to talk to her husband with no response besides another spirit figure that decides to haunt the family in the house the dark haunting figure possesses doris as she mysteriously causes injuries to her bullies at school and concerning her mother she tries to get father tom henry thomas to help bring her daughter back as they learn about the history of an old owner to the house that used his basement for a disturbing experiment the pros about ouija origins of evil was the theme about a struggling family dealing with a loss and being nonbelievers to the spiritual world of course that changes when they bring in the board game that releases a disturbed figure to possessing the youngest daughter the plot worked with giving more leverage to actually caring for these characters unlike the first movie mike flanagans direction and script build this family dynamic as they experience this possession and are trying to save their youngest also there are better performances with elizabeth reaser annalise basso lulu wilson and henry thomas the film does have some creepy factors seeing a dark demonic figure at the end of the hallway leaving you feeling a little on the edge or seeing a hanged body dangling on the ceiling with a possessed girl that can come out of anywhere the sinister figure does have a backdrop of details that are quite disturbing making it a scarier threatthe con about the film for being a supernatural horror movie was the lack of scares it had a creepy eerie direction that would have worked for the best if the movie were released decades ago i did not find the film to be scary which did not deliver jolts or jump scares maybe its just myself not finding supernatural horror movies as scary anymore overall ouija origins of evil is a better film than the last and better than expected from how the trailer looked,astonish
the prequel to the critically panned ouija is a surprisingly good wellcrafted  quite entertaining chapter that packs a welcome dose of fun  frights and makes brilliant use of its vintage setting  timespecific props to deliver a horror flick that many consider to be a major improvement over its already forgotten predecessor which ive neither seen nor do i intend toset in 1960s los angeles the story of ouija origin of evil concerns a mother  her two daughters who run a seance scam business at their suburban home with former posing as a spiritual medium while latter assisting in staging the events but things take a sinister turn when they incorporate an ouija board into their stunt and inadvertently invite an evil presence into their housecowritten  directed by mike flanagan best known for hush the film takes its time to set up its premise and presents the writerdirector putting more effort into establishing a tense atmosphere to deliver the chills rather than opting for cheap jump scares the script packs a predictable story but the way flanagan structures it  utilises the genre elements do lift things up by a few notchesinfusing more freshness to its story is its smooth camerawork oldschool colour palette  steady pace which provide a uniform streamlined flow to its set of events also whatever connections it has to the original if there are any apart from the aftercredits scene seem subtle for this film is quite capable of working as a standalone entry and thanks to its separate treatment does so with relative easebut it also isnt without its shortcomings there are some moments that are supposed to be scary but turn out to be unintentionally funny the origin of what started it all is really uninspiring and it is easy to guess whats going to happen next almost all the time elizabeth reaser annalise basso  lulu wilson play their part well its 99 minutes runtime is rarely felt and supporting it all the way is its complementary scoreon an overall scale ouija origin of evil further strengthens mike flanagans growing reputation as a promising talent when it comes to horror filmmaking and validates his keen eye  understanding of the genre there is a lot to nitpick here but the positives eventually outweigh the negatives by a significant margin and turns ouija origin of evil into a delightful surprise for those who had to sit through its lacklustre predecessor give it a shot,astonish
i love supernatural horror particularly ones with creepy wee children in them alas pretty much every single film thats been out in recent years has been predictable samey and actually not remotely scary ouija origin of evil breaks the mold here as it has good twists to its tale is filmed a bit differently with good effects and actually succeeded in frightening methe child actress who plays doris is great she is genuinely chilling as a character doris avoids falling into the irritating child bracket that befalls so many kiddie characters and as such is really scary there are a couple of jumpy scares but mainly its the continual feeling of dread surrounding the horror that is doris that drives the film when the twists start to come at the end they are really quite horrible and offer a great explanation as to why this housefamily are under attack the ending is absolutely great and avoids terrible hollywood clichsin short this film is great fun both my partner and i couldnt sleep afterwards i had a terrible nightmare about doris actually to me if a scary film gives me a nightmare i know its a winner ,astonish
there was a time when hollywood was obsessed with period crime dramas which seemed to have spilled on to the horror genre it could be either the higher supply of hollywood props leading to discounts or the ease of storytelling without having to deal with modern communication and other technology also in the recent times this genre has collectively matured into a less gory and more character driven plots and sometimes featuring popular actors ouija the popular childhood game to invite spirits to answer silly questions forms the basis of this plot but it gets more irrelevant as the story unfoldsalice zander elizabeth reaser is a recently widowed mother of two  teenage lina annalise basso and 9year old doris lulu wilson she runs small scams as a fortuneteller or as someone who talks to spirits out of her house with her daughters as accomplices she purchases a ouija board when suggested by lina for adding it to her props when they get a notice of foreclosure for her house doris finds a package full of money hidden in their basement by previous tenants this discovery along with solving their present crisis also brings forward doriss abilities to really communicate with the spirits that booms her business is doris able to positively use her new ability or is she getting consumed by itthe movie establishes a moderately happy family where they collectively try to contribute towards running their house all the standard tropes you would see like a single mother striving to stay above water a rebellious teenager and her crush an adolescent handling her bullies at school etc while this is all well established the moms character is shown to be flipflopping though the tone of the movie still continues to show her in a positive note instances like when the mom doesnt try to investigate much further into the money purse discovery doesnt pay heed to the changes in doris after her new ability and just pushes on to exploit it etc with the eventual revelation about the spirit having the ouija board in the center of it doesnt make any sense the acting is moderately good which has very minimal characters overall much like most other movies of this genre most of the scenes either happen indoors or at a schools entrance which means that the entire movie was shot in a shoestring budget despite its period setting  considering this is observed only in retrospect shows the quality and it is worth to commend the production design of this movie the atmosphere setup is one of the most important element in a horror movie which it gets right to most extent but the overall quality of the story or the thrills plays the spoiler where the origin story is very undercooked and full of holes leaving a lot of content that doesnt make sense a serious evil doing mischievous things is what i cant comprehend in most horror movies and this movie isnt any differentfumbles both on human and other aspect with a passable story and occasional thrill,astonish
its halloween season and the big horror movie studio blumhouse has released another film in their canon franchise with their famous business plan that movie is ouija origin of evil which is a prequel to ouija from 2014 i know i get suspicious too when a studio wants to start telling prequel stories to the masses most of the time they dont work but blumhouse and filmmaker mike flanagan oculus really raised the bar with this prequel that is terrifying fun and connects the original film nicely despite some silly problems here and thereoverall the film works has some great scares some funny moments and even has the characters doing and saying some smart things which is usually not the case in these horror films needless to say i kept the lights on at night after watching this prequel set almost fifty years prior to the events of ouija meaning this movie takes place in the heart of the 1960s with all of the excellent furniture clothing and hairdos  not to mention the great music the zander family is the main focus here with a young doris zander lulu wilson and teenage paulina zander annalise basso with their widowed mother alice elizabeth reaser living in that beautiful home reading peoples palms and fortune telling the family dynamic seems good and loving despite the loss of their husbandfathera ouija board is purchased to help with the fortune telling business when all hell breaks loose if youve seen the first film you will know what is going to happen here which the script and filmmaking perfectly captures all the horror you heard about in the first movie if you havent seen the original movie then youre in for a thrill ride that will make the hairs stand on end throughout the film with all of its creepinesseither way i believe this horror film will do its job in scaring you at least for a little while there are some odds and ends that dont make sense here and it seems like filmmaker mike flanagan wanted to incorporate the exorcist somehow in this film because there are some shots and moments that were completely taken from the exorcist including the famous shot of the preacher henry thomas my man walking up to the house and looking up upon itthe performances are decent and the scares are genuine the time period really adds to the feel of the movie in a good way in that it feels more organic and there werent any issues with social media or mobile phones even though there were some usual genre tropes used here it all felt fresh for the most part and was quite enjoyable to watch doug jones is billed in the film and im sure youre able to pick out which character he plays which as usual is excellent and scaryashell for the halloween season this is the film to seerecommended,astonish
greetings from lithuaniaouija origin of evil 2016 may not be the best horror film from 2016 but its closed really close this second movie in a franchise hopefully surprises the original which i liked overall but not as much as this one by far in every possible way this is a first rate horror movie i loved the 70s style horror movie flick written all over this movie  this is clearly visible not only from the sets and the time in which action takes place but also the movie making itself acting was good especially by the two young leads writing was solid directing was first rate overall the first hour of ouija origin of evil was pure 1010  it worked perfectly as a horror movie type drama where all the chills arent rushed and the movie was carefully constructed maybe the second half of this movie when the things that cant be explained a bit rashly started to be explained by the script and it lost a bit of that tension and terror of unknown nevertheless this is a superb horror movie that first of all builds the story and does not rush by doing it introduces the characters that we start to care about two young ladies of course and goes for a wild climax which is good but not as great as the first part of the movie two thumbs up for ouija origin of evil nevertheless,astonish
this movie is positively impressing the setting reminds of insidious occasionally even if ouija does not appear to be as original and entertaining the first hour of the movie is honestly remarkable  we are given a complete background of the main characters and the atmosphere is adequately prepared for the expectable final actionsequence in the first section of the movie the narrative elements combine in perfect proportion  thrill realism humor drama they all build an absolutely convincing plot but then action comes and all falls down to pieces as a matter of fact after the first 60 minutes the movie seems anxious to run too quickly towards a very confusing conclusion the dosage of cgi is reduced but shows a cheap quality concerning the end as i said too many elements cliches and attempts of originality which do not assemble organically are brought on the screen all of a sudden at the same time this contributes to creating the sensation that it took less then 20 minutes to shatter a promising work of horror cautiously built in over one long hour the two young actresses were both incredibly talented and gave a brilliant performance i cant wait to see both of them in better horrors,astonish
we were never alone ill never be alone alice reaser and her daughter lina basso are running a sance business that is more of a scam than truth they are trying everything they can to stay one step ahead of their customers when the youngest daughter finds a ouija board and starts to play with it she unknowingly invites a spirit into their lives and now the line between truth and lies are blurred and no one knows what to believe the first ouija movie a few years ago wasnt anything amazing but it was entertaining and worth seeing this one is about the same thing the movie is entertaining and fast paced but at times it gets a little too generic horror fans will like this one although this isnt all that scary it is worth seeing but dont expect to be terrified overall if you liked the first one you will like this as well an entertaining yet generic prequel i give this a b,astonish
its one of the rarest times that the sequel is better than the first movie i guess it is more watchable a little more frightening and way more entertaining i guess thats the reason it is took so positive reviews expect some chilling and creepy moments i liked the way the plot is reveiling but it keeps you in agony for what is going on and of course the tittle says it all origin of evil so it is like it starts from this one so i guess you have to forget everything you felt from the first movie and give this brilliant horror movie a chance you wont regret it i hope the next one if it ever comes to continue like this one,astonish
i dont see why this film got the recognition that it got maybe its because a horror movie sequel that is better is actually very very rare sure this is better than the first one and i thought its focus on trying to bring back the late 1960s vibe when it comes to the cinematography was a nice touch but when it comes the flow of this film at its core it just feels like another generic horror movie i liked how it didnt focus too much on jump scares and didnt try to put in needless blood and gore maybe i am getting numb since i have seen way too many horror movies but i just cant see what makes this movie stand out from other horror movies out there a family gets haunted and they try to figure out the origin of that evil there isnt any real suspense tension or twist that kept me remembering this is most definitely not a bad horror film but just a easily forgettable one6110,astonish
honestly i think i hope too much for this movie because the trailer looks so awesome but its still the same as the first part  that movie have too much preface and it makes me feel so boring however i love the special effects because its so real likes you work hard for it and the actor and actress that they work so hard on their own too much of preface its waste a lot of time and you oppress the interested scenes and combine it and mix it together likes you dont have much time for movie lines at the end finally thought i love this movie but as i said it still have a lot of things that i dont like it but good movie and you pretty much watch it d,astonish
ouijaorigin of evil could have been one of the best horror movies but it ended up being just an ok movieby that i mean that it was almost goodthe beginning of the movie was great and the movie really had some great horror scenesa great storyline and it took place in the pastin the old daysmore precisely after the end of world war iii thinkand thats what made this movie soo scarry because the horror movies were always creepy and scarry when the action took place in the old daysin our days they arent that scarrybut at the end of the movieit disappointed me because almost all of the characters had diedjust lina zander livedand if its one thing that i hate about the horror movies is when they have a bad endingespecially the horror movies about supernaturaland this movie showed us that the evil won and the good isnt always winningand it isnt the only horror moviethere are a lot for example sinister 1 and sinister 2those movies werent too scarrythe storyline wasnt soo good and both of the movies had a bad endingsoif the movie didnt had a bad ending than it would have been greateven better than conjuring 2but it had to be like all the ordinary horror moviesand by that i mean that the movie was just oknot good and definitely not great,astonish
ouija is the best jump scare horror film to exist at the momentouija origin of evil is super creepy and has a good amount of wellplaced jump scares to scare even the toughest audiences as a horror fan i definitely enjoy this film better then any horror film i have seen at timethe movie is about elizabeth reaser who is a single mom raising her two daughters doris and lina they run a seance scam business to make a living but when they unwittingly invite an evil spirit into their home which then possesses the youngest daughter doris this ends up becoming the struggle to save her and drive the demon away from the familythanks,astonish
after the death of the father a family struggles to stay together by staging hoax medium sessions but when an ouija board is introduced to the act they find themselves drawn to the other side slightly better prequel to the original flat effort this time produced by the team behind oculus the premise is coherent and the menace builds convincingly as a host of ghostly troubles is channelled through the youngest daughter but about halfway through the dialogue begins to struggle and i got the sense there was some rewriting on the hoof that led us to a third act where all conviction evaporated just as i was looking forward with dread there was an unconvincing death scene with a sheet same thing done much better in the first film and things fell apart it may be because the story jumped about in its emphasis on a main character only making its choice at the very end maybe the family situation could have been drawn more interestingly if they were coping with a suicide of the father connected to the houseperformances were good the little girl slightly overacted but the big sister was impressive even if a little lost in poor dialogue toward the end frightwise there was some interesting stuff going on in the background but nothing much removed from clich and mostly delivered by cgimusic  photography nothing special editing kept the pace even overall engaging claustrophobic family drama that loses its bearingsand you have to wait for a very late end credit to catch an appearance by one of the biggest horror stars of the moment ,astonish

having sat through a heap of somewhat questionable ouija movies before it was with some reluctance that i sat down to watch ouija origin of evil but hey it is a horror movie after all and that alone is actually enough to peak my interesti will say that ouija origin of evil turned out to be much better than i had anticipated or hoped for and that is thanks to director mike flanagan who managed to set up a great atmosphere and skillfully execute turning points and spooks throughout the course of the moviethe storyline was good albeit somewhat simplistic as horror movies often tend to be so dont expect that the movie will challenge you intellectually but dont get me wrong it is still a very enjoyable movie and while the movie was not overly predictable it just really wasnt a frontrunner for the horror genre and it didnt really bring anything new and innovating to the genreit is the cast and their performance that really also need to be complimented for their work in ouija origin of evil especially elizabeth reaser whom was so wellcast for her role in this movie and she really carried the movie quite nicelythere was a good amount of pseudocreepy moments throughout the movie but not really any moments where you are spooked out of your seat and that was a shame because i was expecting and thus missing those momentsit is important for a horror movie to have good and believable special effects and ouija origin of evil has that i enjoyed the way that we were kept in the dark about the spirits and what they looked like but when they were revealed i sort of had a mixed feeling sure they were nicely made but they just werent all that scary to meouija origin of evil is definitely a movie that you should take the time to sit down and watch especially if you have seen the other ouija movies in their many shapes and presentationsthis is an entertaining movie in all honesty although it lacks some good old fashioned scares it is still fun to watch and might actually still turn out to be creepy to some viewers,astonish
ouija origin of evils biggest strength was its performances i usually give horror movies sht for bad actors but this one knocked it out of the park elizabeth reaser was brilliant as a single mother just trying to survive she doesnt know exactly what the best things for her kids are and she feels just emotionally weighed down you sympathize with her throughout the whole movie and a lot of that humanity present was due to reasers performance annalise basso and lulu wilson were also excellent in their roles as the children the character of doris is the one given much more to do compared to the other characters as she is the one who becomes possessed evident in the trailers and i thought wilson was fantastic she was definitely channeling the exorcist at certain parts sometimes it work as well as other times but overall for such a young kid i thought she was remarkable basso was also great because she walked a thin line her character had the most potential out of anyone to become the annoying one yet basso gave a multilayered performance that really helped even out the dynamics between the three main characters,astonish
i saw a lot of positive things being said about this movie having not seen the first instalment i decided to just jump in and check this out anyway i do like mike flanagan but i think absentia and oculus are far better than his other films including this one its wonderfully shot and stylistically very well handled where this film fails for me is in the actual horror and its final act you have a nice buildup with attention to characters and mood only for the film to completely fall apart twothirds in turning into a pg13 exorcist on steroids which isnt scary at all the suspense at the start was nicely built but once it starts piling on ropy special effects and endless attempts at jump scares i really lost interest without a doubt i would recommend this if its on tv and youre bored but i wouldnt go out of your way to see it,astonish
upon seeing flanagans ouija it pales in comparison to his previous two entries hush and oculus although they are all exercised in atmospheric elementsouija seemed rather tamed some decent scary moments but seasoned horror aficionados would be blunt to its anticipation the cinematography is made to reflect the period in which the story is set in with blotches appearing on screen occasionally to look like degradation seen on film but sometimes feels contrived visually some of the shots are reminisce of a james wan movie not without its merits the first half of the movie sets up its characters for the audiences to sympathize with and care about in their times of distress it is well acted especially the young girl who has to carry the element that drives the plot forward the film is aware of makebelieve with doubts slowly descending into something more sinister it is a watchable film but forgettable,astonish
after reading all these positive reviews i felt compelled to write a quick review is it better than the last installment yes is it better than lights out dont breathe hell no despite some negative comments saying the plot was poor i thought the base plot was good the acting is decent but the killer for me was the reactions to some terrible situations that were so poorly directed i said to my wife multiple times did that just happen because they dont seem to be that worried about it many people myself included have tried a ouija board so can probably relate to the movie more than other horrors maybe that is why people think it is better than it actually is the directing or lack of was very noticeable and ruined it for me there are better horrors out this year than this one but if you have time to kill you could do worse,astonish
ouija origins of evil was not a bad movie at all i like how the directorfilm crew filmed the movie as if it were a 1950s1960s type film if you look close throughout the movie youll get a black blotch on the right corner of the screen occur every now and then in those times of filming that indicated something about the film spool i cant remember exactly what but the point is that it was really neat and creative it went right along with the films vintage setting even the cars were appropriate for the time the starting title also has a vintage feel to it i think this was a very creative way to film the movie this little girl in this movie was indeed creepy as they come she did an excellent job of acting in fact she may be the best child actor ive seen yet maybe all i know is she did a great job even during her possession phase of the movie i can just imagine how much cosmetics and cgi were used with that weird mouth of hers as the character she played it off real nicely thats talented for such a young actress so props to the crew for selecting her all i know is she needs to come to my house and find thousands of dollars in my wall for me then shed be really awesome we all know thats not going to happenso after watching the movie it was actually better than i expected truthfully ive never seen the first one because it had such bad reviews i usually learn to judge for myself but i also know when to trust my gut im glad i did because i was told personally by others that the first one was garbage so i got a lot out of watching this there were a few jump scares in there where i thought i was going to poo a little they got me then again im easy to jump scare the talent in this movie met all my expectations the acting script and dialog were very well done i would recommend this movie to horrorsuspense lovers for a one time watch,astonish
a widowed fortune teller who decides to incorporate a ouija board into her fake routine soon meets real evil when the board starts calling to her daughter uncovering a horrific secret director mike flanagans 1967 setting gives it a different feel to many of its contemporary rivals in its eerie effective first 40 minutes ouijas cast shine its only in the special effects driven latter half the character build up which flanagan and co skilfully created is unnecessarily thrown out elizabeth reasers alice zander who believes theyve contacted her dead husband is sadly side lined in favour of digital spectacle child star actor now an adult henry thomas is particularly notable his priest hogan character with a past is played out well young actress annalise basso as lina and even younger lulu wilson as doris are memorable the two sisters feel real enough with some help from the newton brothers score the ouija board scenes and planchette usage gives some chills as they talk to an entity who they think is their father it becomes noticeably derivative in the last act borrowing the matrixs neos closed mouth effect the exorcist with possessions and the exorcist iii where doris skitters across ceilings to name a few theres enough jump scares and creepy faces to retain interest with its world war two connection twist the stretched face look is over used and to wilsons credit her performance can be spooky enough without it the dark shadows darting in the corn of the eye are particularly well executed and more effective than the big stunt set ups as a prequel to the 2014 film ouija it arguably surpasses its predecessor but in a sea of horrors its another addition that simply cant compete with the classics or more recently the conjuring films and exorcist tv series but flanagan and writer jeff howard thanks to the good small cast ensemble have a solid stab at it,astonish
this movie truly captures the curiosity of the ouija board in the 1970s the movie highlighted the types of clothing language and struggles of this period the ouija has a story line that is more believable than other scary movies this is most likely because there have been plenty of horror surrounding the ouija board since it was created the ouija board is a real thing and many real demonic experiences have happened to people therefore there are plenty of scenes that will make you jump and with an ending that surprises its audience finally a horror movie that isnt predictable or corny and actually terrifyingthe stories that you have always heard about are brought to life,astonish
man was this movie good i wont go into the plot to avoid spoilers other than to say it has to do with an ouija board and possession in another directors hands this could have been a cheap exorcist ripoff but instead it was an intelligent sometimes moving high quality horror filmi loved the family dramadynamics  the characters really seemed fleshed out to me the film dealt with death and loss in a very smart and warm way there were times i was even misty eyedthere is some dark humor in the film which had me laughing out loudand the scares i literally jumped out of my seat four times and there were a lot of scenes that sent shivers down mewhile the story isnt all that original the execution is the acting is topnotch for everyone and lulu wilson who plays the 9 year old should get an academy award seriously she earned it i had a blast really enjoyed myself 8 out of 10,astonish
i went to see the movie without watching the trailer or reading anything about it first i watched the first one though didnt like it so i didnt expect much from this one however to my surprise the movie was very enjoyable i specifically liked it because my family had experienced things similar to the story told in this movie just not as dramatic my mom played the ouija game after my dad passed away trying to contact him out of grief and we my mom my siblings and myself believed we were able to contact him for a long time until things got weirder good thing is my mom stopped playing the game shortly after we found out someone else was pretending to be my dadso as i watched the movie with my sister we felt like we were living that part of our past again it has been almost 20 years since then but thanks to the movie for bringing back old memories because of our personal experiences we found the movie believable id recommend it to anyone who wants to see a creepy and not so clich horror movie,astonish
 when you talk to the other side you never know who will be listening this seems to be the overall theme with movies about a ouija board similar to the paranormal activity series ouija origin of evil reveals the events and answers the questions some had when watching the 2014 ouija movie the acting was genuine and real lulu wilson who played the possessed little girl did a rather wicked job as being creepy and as well as staying in character creating that bonechilling factor for the movie with it being rated pg13 it had a few jump scares none that were particularly scary to keep you up at night but to shudder and jump in your seat with movies that are prequels are either a hit or miss but ouija definitely delivered making this a must see this halloween giving this movie an 810 rating i leave you with these important rules if you ever play with a ouija board never play alone never play in a graveyard and the most important rule always say goodbye,astonish

i went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy campy romp with the same tried and true tricks of the trade like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame but i quickly discovered that this would not be case with after watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now i can honestly say its one of the scariest movies ive ever seen in fact there were several points during the film where i screamed like a 13year old girl at a justin beiber concert keep in mind i was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure mainly because i was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months she incidentally didnt make a peep thankfully i later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time i was also expecting to see some blood and guts especially coming from the guys who made saw but there wasnt a drop instead they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater my girlfriend included from literally the opening credits they created an intense haunting tension that didnt leave my body till several whiskeys and half a xanax later and the movie constantly feeds that tension making even the characters mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying i was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming i was unable to control id say its the most calories ive ever burned while watching a movie well at least a pg13 movie overall the movie was great it was crazy scary thoroughly entertaining and even surprisingly funny at times having said that it will be quite some time before i watch another horror movie i have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon so if you plan on seeing this movie please consider this a cautionary reminder its probably best to go with someone whos already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home and maybe bring a xanax as well,astonish
of all the genres that hollywood has to offer the most tattered of the bunch is without a doubt the horror department i am so sick of these wannabe so called horror flicks that belong on late night lifetime channel im sick of the same old parlor tricks and scare tactics that have been used for the past 10 years and i am even more sickened by the fact that they keep making the same crap year after year you would figure after great horror flicks like the decent and paranormal activity studios would start realizing what actually works and what audiences want to see hopefully in the coming years this genre will come back to lifewhen it comes to horror movies i think the two most crucial elements are the cinematography and the musical score actually i prefer there to be no music at all almost all the great horror movies never use it because they rely on scaring the audience with disturbing images not raised music that makes everyone jump if i want that ill go to a haunted house when i go to see a horror flick i want it to leave a lasting impression however movies like this are the one exceptionthis film had such amazing cinematography that i didnt even care about those raised music sequences i rarely get creeped out at the theater and this movie scared the crap out of me im talking sweaty palms eyes wide open my body sunk all the way down in my chair scared and for those of you who have read my reviews in the past i hardly ever say that about a horror flick and what really sold it was the cinematography this film is packed with tons of really creepy and disturbing images so much in fact that you will hate walking into your dark house alone yes they do use the same scare tactics but since everything in the movie looked so damn creepy and demented i for once didnt want the lead female to hurry up and open the basement door and get it over withthe storyline is pretty decent its not an amazing concept or genuinely creepy on its own but it does a decent enough of a job to keep your interest and sell what your seeing unfold on screen and its safe to say that this is a very different take on your typical haunted housebottom lineholy crap i just realized that this movie is only pg13 is it possible for a movie to be scary as hell and only be rated pg13 the answer is yes and this is a prime example of that you know when a horror movie has done its job its when it scares you both in the theater and hours later when you try to sleep at night tonight i will have lots of trouble sleeping i can easily say that this will probably be the best horror movie of the year,astonish
the film has done something many horror movies have failed to do recently and that is to be scary has a lot of really intense moments that scare and then grab hold of you its not entirely made up of make you jump scenes which it does have but scenes with genuine horror has taken a risk with doing something original and it works here for them without giving anything away the movie does not just talk about whats scary or show the the aftermath of something going on in a room that you can only hear until its over and the door magically unlocks shows you whats scary and quite often reminds you whats there and waiting in the dark,astonish
when i first saw a preview for this movie i knew it looked like it had potential it had been a while since i saw a decent scary movie so i was looking forward to it i went into it expecting some scares but nothing too bad wrong this movie scared me out of my wits i dont think i have ever jumped more during any other scary movie the audience was spooked too i saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screamswhat i loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you not gross you out the images are frightening for sure doesnt waste any time trying to creep you out the scares already start with the opening credits i sure was not expecting this to be one of the scariest movies ive seen but it lives up to that that being said i dont think id have the guts to see it again,astonish
i went to an early screening of the movie last night and im not exaggerating when i say that i felt like a little child watching the exorcist for the first time james wan did a very impressive for only an 800000 budget for this movie if youre going in the theatre expecting to see the typical run of the mill haunted house flick you will be sadly mistaken and surprisingly pleased at the same time the parts that i liked most about the film is the detailing everything in the movie means something no matter how small and i love that when the suspense builds up for the audience to be scared you wont be disappointed to find its just the dog or the tree brushing against the windowit will definitely be something to be scared of the people sitting beside me kept laughing at me because whenever the suspense would build i would say to myself uh uhuh uhbut enough of my rambling the plot was definitely original and james wan and leigh schanell definitely succeeded in bringing the audience something scary suspenseful funny emotional and frightening all at the same time the score is amazing the use of all sound design was great specially since they werent any fake screams lol the best acting performance hands down was lin shaye she did an amazing job with her role i cant say anymore without spoiling the movie all i can say is if you love a good scary movie then you must see this movie,astonish
when i went to the theater to see this i had been excited for awhile and boy did this movie deliver but it unexpectedly did more i was thinking youd get your exorcism with everything being all happy and good in the end but i honestly was not expecting something that complex ill come out and say it the outline of the movie was not that original but what the writers did with the traditional ghost story was amazing they twisted it to make it not so much about the ghosts but about what was going on to the family in the house how they were taking itthe effects were great for this type of movie which really only require a slamming door or a random person standing in and i also thought the actors did a great job i particularly liked patrick wilson playing the father that doesnt want to have any part of the hokuspokus ghost stories but is sort of pulled into it against his will the best part it was genuinely scary there is virtually no gore because its not needed to build the creepiness of the plot it sort of builds and is intense right from the get go im a major scary movie veteran and i was truly scared which doesnt happen often i highly recommend this movie to anyone up for a good scare if you arent an experienced scary movie watcher this is a good starter and trust me you will check all the closets and doors when you get home from the theater,astonish
just came back from watching an advanced screening of   tonight with my wife we both liked it a lot when it comes to horror films there are always the same horror formulas which film makers really cant escape when making a horror because there arent much they can work with and they are limited to that same formula so insidous borrows many of its ideas from other horror films one comes to mind is 1982 film  poltergeist  but here we have a family of 5 patrick wilson and rose byrne play the parents of 2 boys and a little baby girl after a slow build up a small accident occur and their older son falls into comma or so it seems  soon after weird things start to happen at the house and the mother suspects evil spirits are in the house  a simple story that as i said was done before however i thought it was done differently here there was a better atmosphere and some elements of the plot stood out as being fresh that made this film unique somehow as scares goes this was definitely scary there were several moments in the film that gave me goosebumps  there were also the classic jump out of your seat moments too some scenes were creepy and the mixing of music and sounds were done superbly to add to the horror so the movie does deliver as far as scares are concernedacting was superb too all cast involved did a very good job particularly rose byrne whom im fond of after watching her in the excellent tv show  damages  patrick wilson was also good herethe atmosphere was creepy the director managed to catch nice footage of the house and other elements of the film so in summary get ready and grab your loved ones and go catch this movie this friday it entertains very enjoyable and scary and even though it borrows ideas from other horror films it never imitates it stand out as a new and fresh take on traditional horror ,astonish
james wan best known as one of the initial creators of the saw series returns to the duo with saw cocreator leigh whannel who also stars with a new ghost story starring patrick wilson watchmen and rose byrne get him to the greekjosh wilson and renai byrne think they have it all a beautiful new home three lovely children   and a gang of unruly ghosts causing torment around them unfortunately after dalton one of their sons is knocked unconscious and falls into a coma things take a supernatural turn for the worst to save dalton josh and renai call on a ghosthunting team leigh whannell angus sampson and a psychic lin shaye to investigate the paranormal presence within the house and put a stop to it before their sons soul is lost to the furtherdue to recent trends within the horror genre haunted house flicks have been rather few  far between however a few recent solid entries have been more than worthwhile including el orfanato and the paranormal activity films james wan thankfully adds this quality haunt film to the short list of recent successes his film however does something different than other ghost stories its funny while it doesnt go as overthetop with its humour as a film like drag me to hell it does blend enough laughs throughout to greatly enhance the entertainment value of the overall film making it feel like a classicstyle dark house flick if only vincent price couldve been around to perfect that feeling technically the film is quite impressive especially for the reported 1 million budget which is unsurprising after what wan  whannell did with the 12 million they had for the original saw the highest levels of the film come from those elements that dont need a massive budget the direction cinematography and writing these really were what set the film above what by anyone else would have been a straighttovideoquality forgotten film another solid element that makes the film a step above most at its level comes from the cast especially the work by genre veterans barbara hershey the entity and lin shaye dead end their acting added a muchappreciated level of depth to the fun of the film of all the many positive aspects of however perhaps the most attractive is the simplest its actually pretty damn scary while it doesnt contain the slowburn creeps and chills of paranormal activity and the like it does contain some of the most well executed and well timed scares in a long time though the quantity of scares tapers off throughout the final act of the film the first twothirds of the film contain more than enough to satisfy any fan of the haunted house subgenreoverall manages to be as expected by wans previous work an entertaining  original ride it has enough humour  horror to satisfy any filmgoer without focusing too heavily on one angle to make the other side feel awkward one hope do not let the pg13 rating shy you away it actually contains more content worthy of an rrating than paranormal activity didfinal verdict 7510 highly recommendedap3,astonish
the experience of watching is a great one director james wan and writer leigh whannell have put together a fun ride for horror fans and those who like to be scared patrick wilson and rose byrne are very solid as the two leads and the supporting actors including whannell himself do a fine job as well amplifying the drama and providing welcome bits of humor the only downside to the film is that a few aspects of the third act should have been toned down a bit and left to the imagination overall though is a great creepy film its refreshing to watch a horror film full of genuine scares practical effects and that has an ending thats just downright chilling it should be very interesting to see what wan and whannell do next,astonish
 out of judging by the anticlimactic advertisements youd think just why theres an evil child film almost every year and what separates one from the rest you have every right to think so but not with trust me when i say it is an entirely different beast one that actually resonates with scares and intrigue one that relies on character development and a script to hold it together this isnt a one trick pony its a well made film with some solid production values thrown in as a bonus if you dont have a film to see this weekend make sure you make it this onerevolves around the perfect couple beautiful kids a new home its all smooth sailing until dalton is in a supposed coma but the actual reality is that hes haunted what will daltons family do to stop this entityfirst of all many complain that the second act bogs down the film and is inferior to its first half i wholeheartedly disagree i think as a whole the film is just fine yes theres a drastic tonal shift midway but that doesnt detract from the experience the first half plays a typical haunted house flick except its actually scary and the suspense is well built then the second half is like a cross between poltergeist house of wax and a little of beetlejuice sprinkled in for good measure furthermore the performances while nothing to write home about are pretty decent to say the least the two leading protagonists do their job and dalton is pretty solid given what he had to work with moreover the script is very inventive and has multiple twists and turns yes this isnt the most unique screenplay but it still stands on its own and is actually quite effectiveto top it off the production is just very beautiful this movie is very easy on the eyes when it comes to cinematography and location now the question everyone is dying to hear is it scary id say yes but dont get too carried away if you walk in thinking your going to have nightmares or if youre going to see rosie o donnell chances are youll be a little disappointed however if youre going in expecting a creepy thriller that just happens to have a few intense moments youll be in for a fun night out also i love the nostalgic factor this movie has it feels as though it was made in the 80s old school horror strikes backwith a restraint heavy pg13 rating and a middleoftheroad concept isnt looking too pretty however looks can be deceiving this is one movie that doesnt mess around and doesnt play it safe either i can easily say i will be revisiting this film from time to time just because its so fun youll laugh youll jump youll be entertained this is what a fun night out should be like get your large popcorn and soda and sit along with the crowd be prepared for a good time,astonish
this is my first movie review ever and i felt i had to write this to express how severely overhyped this movie is the movie starts out much the same way as the movie paranormal activity a family in a house doing regular things after a while some weird stuff starts to happen and one of their kids have an accident so far so good then the kid falls into a coma this is where the movie starts to go in the wrong direction two nerdy looking guys come in to the house with some instruments to take measurements of whats going on to me it seemed like these two guys should really have played in some nerdy comedy and not a intented horror movie however they call in reinforcements  an old lady who figures out that the kid is really skilled in astral projection and the problem is that he has floated away and got lost in the astral realm after this all sorts of really silly looking ghosts and demons start showing up especially the one with a red face to resolve this the father astral projection as well to look for his son fistfighting his way trough ghosts and demonswhen i look back at what i have written here it seems like a really funny concept  material for a humorhorror movie however its not it tries to be convincing but instead it becomes embarrassing annoying and completely unconvincing with its mixture of newage elements drama and fistfights with demons and ghosts,astonish
after reading many of the reviews listed here and entertainment weeklys quote has some of the most shivery and indelible images ive seen in any horror film in decades and wcbs radios most terrifying film since the exorcist there was no way i could miss this filmto compare this sham of a film with a classic like the exorcist is an insult to real horror film fans everywhere and apparently ew hasnt been to a horror film in decades as far as all the other reviews that list this waste of time as being one of the scariest films i just dont get itit was nothing more than a lowbudget amateur attempt at a poltergeist remake and a really bad one at that apparently barbara hershey needed the check as well as the rest of the cast they all acted as if they were thinking of somewhere else theyd rather be i kept waiting for all those really scary moments that everyone was talking aboutim still waiting i laughed throughout the film especially when elise waits till josh gets the crap beat out of him by the big bad demon before she tells him he is stronger than the demon while looking for his sonthe story was a farce the acting was lame and ive seen scarier demons at my front door on halloweenthe only horrors about this film were that i had to hear tip toe through the tulips after all these years of trying to block it from memory and that i paid 20 for this complete waste of time,astonish
im sorry but honestly i dont get what all the hype is about to me this movie seems so overrated they were trying way too hard just to scare people that it left no room for a good story or good acting i actually think i was laughing more than being scared while watching this movie because of the ridiculous acting and also does anyone agree with me when i say the music was absolutely outrageous and over the top thats what i meant when i said they were trying too hard to scare the audience without the music this movie would be totally hopelessnot to mention they copied probably 3 to to 4 different movies you got poltergeist with the kid getting lost in some other world and the dad goes in to save him you got dead silence with the smiling doll lookalike people and you have all those exorcism movies with the demons and the devil thrown in there as well also did anyone notice that the music was extremely similar to that of the exorcist total copycat movieyou get nothing new in this unoriginal and highly overrated movie i would recommend this film to those who like cheesy teen horror flicks and like to be scared by stupid popout moments to me it was a very overhyped movie that will probably be forgotten within the next year i wouldnt waste my money and if your still interested in this pathetic excuse of a horror movie i would wait to rent it on dvd overall it was a hot mess stay awaymy rating 010,astonish
how people are claiming this is the scariest film in decades is beyond mei went to watch this thinking it was going to be cheesy id seen the trailer but i thought id give it a chancei was rather surprised for the first 2030 minutes and thought it was going to prove me wrong yes the story had been recycled but it still could have been a good concept if done rightthen the cheese and my giggles came pouring out i was sitting there thinking wth this cant be serious heavy face paint is meant to scare me ive seen better at haloween and as for the ghosts well they made me cry with laughter i cant believe i wasted my time and money the thing that annoys me the most is that it could have been a slightly different more modern version of poltergeist at least that would have made it acceptablebut no another huge waste of time i would not suggest it for any true horror film fans,astonish
13 ghosts meets exorcism of emily rose meets house of 1000 corpses meets house of wax meets nightmare on elm street meets constantine with special guest darth maulthis movie was a freaking disaster aside from the psycho path family when the coward father first enters the further the movie blew just awfulif this movie is considered a 73 out of 10 i weep for humanity am done watching movies i see 90s movies like days of thunder getting 55 and this is nearly 2 points higher maybe i should have been higher when i watched this movie or high at all i was laughing during half of it anyways,astonish
i know there is some fanboy out there that thinks i just committed sacrilege by saying that but for me its very true dont let the pg13 throw you off consider the standards of today you have to be 1 step from a snuff film to get an r rating now a days to me a scary move doesnt just make you jump or squirm in the theater but its stays with you making you check in the back seat under the bed and question every little bump in the night well did it the first thing i said leaving the theater was well im never sleeping again how bout you and whats more amazing its not gory which is something i would have expected having the saw guys on board instead the movie works from the paranormal activity angle building suspense to the point where your almost screaming oh just do it already cause you cant take it anymore but in a good way and one of the biggest things i noticed while sitting there was the cold feeling i had through most of the movie i havent had a movie do that to me in a long long time if this is the type of movie was can expect from the paranormal activity and saw guys then they need to make more movies and pronto,astonish
clich family moves to haunted house story video is bleak washed out and boring overall actors play bad but that is ok for horror moviesmy verdict would have been 510 if the authors just realized their mediocrity but they decide to be special and this is the very worst kind of special that you can think offrom audio standpoint the whole movie is just silence mumbling silence generic ambient noise silence boom with boom being around 90 decibels or higher my ears actually started to hurt after second such effect and after 4th or 5th i decided to leave the theaterhighly not recommended avoid at all costs,astonish
this movie started off with a lot of potential but took a turn for the worst i feel like what was meant to be scary turned into a joke and a poor one at that i literally went from being excitedcreeped to laughing at how funny the movie turned i was more frightened watching killer clowns from outerspace i am one who enjoys the simple things in a horror movie and i think that is what makes them scary but i feel like too much was thrown in for no reason i have watched a lot of horror movies in my life and this is up there with the worst of them while i was in the theater an angry movie watcher stormed out very upset about how bad this movie was i was very excited to see this movie and felt let down for anyone who likes a real horror movie i would advise them not to watch this,astonish
haunted houses and questionable children have composed many a horror film but theres a reason they work when they do so despite years of being recycled its usually thanks to talent saw director james wan found something of promise in saw writer leigh whannells story and the same mustve gone for stars rose byrne and patrick wilson horror films rarely get that infusion of talent and as such does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horrorjosh wilson and renai byrne lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl like always paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son dalton in a coma a few months pass and they move dalton back home the freaky incidences increase and eventually renai sees the ghosts she convinces josh to move them into a new home but it gets worse so they bring in a paranormal expert lin shaye who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their sonlike paranormal activity a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods as much as youve been spooked this way by films before you cant simply shirk the way the film creeps in  wan wont have any of it in fact nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards no gore or horrific images to be found here  does it old schoolonce shayes character elise and her two employees arrive on scene the story mutates from paranormal suspense to otherworldly mystery elise explains whats going on  something that involves daltons soul being lost in a realm called the further  and now they must rescue him whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mysterythriller with demonic elements in a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of whats going on its mostly interesting but in many instances flatout weird to the point that horror purists might not like itthe best way to describe is first half paranormal activity and second half something akin to sam raimis drag me to hell which equates to a nice balance between selfseriousness and horror fun the x factor would be the performances byrne keeps renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her roles importance dwindles in the latter half of the film in which time she still keeps renai relevant wilsons character is no typical over macho father figure or anything together they provide an unusual boost for horror which typically strives for random faces with questionable experiencein general possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills although lacks distinctiveness in terms of story not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow what a rare but not unusual treatsteven cvisit my site at httpmoviemusereviewscom,astonish
thank goodness we went to go see this at the cheap theater because otherwise i would be so angry that i wasted my money usually even if the movie isnt great the experience itself is okay but this movie gave me a headache literally like others have said it starts out a little promising but turns into a complete disaster it was just a downward spiral into a throbbing headache for methere were some interesting parts when the movie wasnt actually trying to make fun of itself but they were always spoiled by some horrible interruption the scares are entirely predictable the camera always pans in and moves slowly a reused tactic that i caught onto right away at every shocker moment i was thinking great something else is going to pop out oh look im so surprised i totally predicted that all of the scares are completely unrelated and the fact that the location changes drastically left me feeling isolated from the familybonding connection the ending was laughable i ended up feeling nothing for any of the charactersthe ghostsspirits and tactics were overused there is nothing creative about the imagery at all the entire second half of the movie seemed to shift from building family values to humor and then the plot started to turn in on itself you cant mix that kind of humor with horror without the movie turning into a parody with an unstable and translucent genre escaped family morals and overusedgeneralized horror that was predictable at every corner this entire movie was less of a picture and more of a train wreck my poor head,astonish
as soon as i heard about the new movie i said oh boy this is a mustsee for as long as i can remember i have been a fan of this genre im not talking about the freddiejason slashertype films or the tortureamputation sickoflicks but the truly psychological twisters that do a number on your headthis is the story of a young family whose oldest child dalton after a seemingly minor household accident slips into a mysterious coma that medical science is unable to explain doctors and hospitals not being able to do anything for dalton his parents are forced to take the notquitelivingbutnotquitedead boy home where he lies in his room completely unresponsive spectral entities are soon haunting the house or so it seems but when the family moves to a new home the haunting continues hence the tagline its not the house thats haunted turns out little dalton has entered the further a sort of netherworld where evil spirits vie to inhabit his body at some point his grandmother played by barbara hershey hires a psychic who sends the boys father into the further to search for him and hopefully bring him back via some sort of astral projection or outofbody experience did not disappoint although highly derivative that is not a bad thing here it has elements of every one of my favorite ghost stories the haunting haunted house unexplained noises the innocents possessed child ghostly apparitions eerie weeping the others creepy climactic sance flatliners crossing over into another realm and carnival of souls palefaced ghoulies coming to get ya very much like the aforementioned the haunting most of the early scares in rely on sound lighting and camera angles because of the way tension builds up like in paranormal activity the sight of a face eerily appearing in a window or a sudden loud noise can make you jump out of your seat the beginning of the movie is all about suggestion mood and atmosphere and what you dont see which are the elements of the very best ghost storiesspecial commendation for the excellent editing as much as you might want to shield your eyes in anticipation and dread while watching this movie you wont want to miss some of the splitsecond spinetingling imagesmy only complaint is that the last onethird or so of the film was almost overkill the scares were so relentless toward the conclusion of the story you barely have time to recover from one fright before another is foisted on you nevertheless there are some truly frightening images in this movie i have seen many many such movies and have read even more such novels and i consider myself pretty jaded and not easily frightened but i am a little embarrassed to admit that one scene in particular actually made me scream out loud in the movie theater  a first for me by films end my heart was literally pounding if you are highly suggestible or prone to nightmares do not see this film but if you are truly a fan of a good ghosthaunted house story do not miss got to be one of the scariest movies of all time,astonish
i went to see this film the other day and for some reason i wasnt surprised at how bad it was considering how much people overhype films these dayswhere to start with this filmthe pacing is all over the place the film is too slow at the start and by the end you feel like youve sat through an hour and a half of a cheap home moviethe acting is another negative point to this filmyou cant connect with the characters and as a result you dont care what happens to themthere are some good things about this film if very fewthe film makers try to use creep factor instead of giving the audience blood and guts and the premise of the story is decent but the end result should have been so much betteras for the scary parts its one least scary films ive ever watchedthere are a few moments that make you jump out of your seat but nothing morepeople are saying this is the scariest film theyve ever seen  how many films have these people watched not many i guess i would strongly advise people to wait for this to come out on dvd and have it for a saturday night shock because its not worth the money or the trip to the cinema,astonish
please do not spend money on this movie it is awful it is not scaryif you look at the information you can see this is a low budget movie and it definitely shows i was just looking at how much profit it had already made and i felt nauseous i had to write this all the reviews giving it high marks are so clearly fake or written by people with horrible taste when it comes to movies the imdb is being used as an advertising tool dont buy it dont buy a ticket for the movie its like throwing money out the window it is impossible to write a comprehensive review of this crappy movie so i wont even try the plot is standard in the beginning but turns outrageously ridiculous at the end you might find yourself wondering who comes up with this kind of stupidity and who gave the screenplay a thumbs up for filming it the acting is on the level with the movie you will notice the incredibly loud and annoying background music i guarantee it i also guarantee you wont like it i might call it watchable up until the little lady psychic from poltergeist same character different actress  is introduced her explanation of events turns the plot hilarious or outrageous it depends how you look at it and whether you spent money on it and by the way the main bad guy is a demon its a bad cgi character with hooves black shiny body hair like a horse and a red face like darth maul the other ghosts look like sick people with bad make upagain the movie is not worth watching so dont spend money on it if you are curious wait for the dvd or get it some other way,astonish
some decent bits at the start but soon becomes poltergeist and then star wars when that bloke with the red face who was a sith turns up with for some unknown reason tiny tim the ending descended into farce when after getting in the excorsist for one scene they sent for the ghostbusters who called in the landlady from kingpin and all hell broke loose for the last 20 minutes as the cast reenacted scenes from poltergeist but could not afford a rope and instead just made do then the guys who were in michael jacksons thriller made an appearance and we got a shock ending that was obvious and silly the most frightening part of is that we will likely see a part 2 i am not sure whether it was meant to be a horror film or a comedy and cant really be bothered to care,astonish
this movie wasnt scary i laughed the entire time the only cool part was the random playing of tiptoe through the tulips yeah there were a couple parts where i jumped but laughed after they showed the demon way too much it would have been much scarier if they didnt show him maybe a drawing of him but thats it i do not recommend it at all i saw it with a friend and we both thought that it was the stupidest movie ever the ending was ok but i kinda saw it comingwe both thought that it was hilarious when they showed the word with screaming violins it was a complete waste of 750 dollars ive seen home movies that were scarier than this movie but it is just one opinion against many people who oddly think that this is the scariest movie ever,astonish
when it comes to horror directors there are only a handful of them out  there that produce consistent quality there is eli roth but his  resume is still in its infancy cabin fever hostel and hostel ii  there are the spierig brothers who brought us daybreakers and the  undead and rob zombie who has the halloween franchise under his belt  but again each are still fairly new and are still trying to experiment  with the genre to find their niche  then theres james wan saw dead silence and death sentence are were  shot with wan behind the camera and saws ii iv vi and the new saw  3d were all executive produced by the budding horror star  for the 2010 toronto international film festival james wan brought his  new film to the masses in what was a generally crowd pleasing  tale of a family and their fight against evil spirits   the film opens with the introduction to the family josh and renai  patrick wilson rose byrne head a family of three children with their  eldest being dalton ty simpkins at an approximate age of around 10  the family has just moved into a new house and are still in the stages  of unpacking when strange things begin to occur things begin to move  around the house and noises can be heard in rooms where the children  sleep one night dalton goes investigating in the attic and falls and  bumps his head the next morning dalton falls into a comatose state  the family takes dalton to the hospital but doctors are dumbfounded as  to why dalton is not responsive months later the situation has not  improved and dalton is back at home where he is tended to by his mother  and a day nurse but unexplained things continue to occur in the house  doors open and images of ghosts are seen by renai but when a red blood  handprint shows up on daltons bed sheet the family moves in fear that  their house is haunted  their new home brings them no less troubles and we learn that it is  their son that is haunted not the house an expert and two  scientistsassistants run tests and reveal to the family that dalton  can astral project himself and he has done so and lost himself in a  place known as the further now with the help of the psychic and  joshs comparable abilities to project they attempt to find dalton and  rescue him from a ghastly hoofed tormentor that wants to use daltons  human body for evil  the comparisons between and 1982s poltergeist are too  comparable to ignore both films have a haunted child both have a  psychic and assistants who have weird gadgets in an attempt to capture  evidence of the unknown and both films employ a solution wherein a  parent must travel inside the spirit world to find their child   the first two thirds of have great scares and moments of  spinetingling suspense wan didnt want to use normal conventions in  the film so there are no cats jumping out of closets or images  appearing in bathroom mirror reflections when someone tries to put  their toothbrush back in the medicine cabinet   instead the scares from the experiences with the family think of it  as paranormal activity shot with multiple cameras and with a budget  some of the scenes were downright frightening like when the psychic  sees the face of the evil spirit which looks like darth maul hissing  at her behind joshs head  but in the final acts could not keep pace with the momentum  of the first half and we lose a little of the eeriness when josh enters  the further and dry ice and ghosts become the setting the creature  which has abducted dalton has great powers and strength but we are to  believe that he uses cheap breakable chains to entrap his victim and  when the creature does get screen time he is hardly as scary as the  description and flash images we had leading to his formal introduction  still delivers the goods enough to be a recommendation a  strong recommendation wan knows how to manipulate an audience and  doesnt try to bite of the hand that feeds him he puts humor in all  the right places and doesnt dumb things down too much for the genre  loving audience there was a lot about the final 20 minutes that could  have used tweaking and please tell me there was a better ending for  the film that will show up on the dvd but still i challenge you not  to be creeped out by events leading to the final chapters seriously i  dare you,astonish
it pains me to even give this one stari would skip the cinema screenings and dont bother renting it in fact if you receive this film as a gift it means your friend hates youi have flushed things down the toilet with more depth than this steaming pile of nutty turdto be serious for a moment i thought this film showed promise the trailer seemed scary and then to find out it was created by the two great minds  i use that term loosely after seeing this film that brought us two great films  saw and paranormal activity this one would be great suspenseful and possibly gory boy was i wrong it was predictable the performances where stilted some of the line deliveries looked like read throughs it started okay and thats being kind it steadily no wait it nose dived off a cliff so fast i could feel the wind in my hair as i watched the screen i am searching for a reason to recommend to see this movie wait i got it if you had the choice between having your limbs chopped off while listening to the latest justin bieber album on repeat and watching as people throw themselves off a building on fire or watching this film then i would say watch it asides from that situation just go and watch a good movie like the exorcist,astonish
i am a fan of all types of movies especially very good ones when i decided to check this one out i read quite a lot of reviews on this site about it beforehand and the majority was how frightening it was everybody not only said it was good but that it was the scariest film they had ever seen to be fair the poster artwork is pristine whoever was responsible for the poster definitely did a brilliant job the boy standing in front of the house with the red shirt and demonic eyes looks amazingi put the movie in started playing it and seriously prepared myselfi am not going to dump on anyone elses review this will be straight forward the small portable intercom that conveniently picks up audio from another area has been done before people instead of aliens its a demon signsthe woman being a piano player in general has been done before also instead of a haunted house its a haunted boy the orphanageand oh yes oh yesthe premise of a child being abducted by evil spirits that ultimately encompasses one of the parents having to cross the boundaries into the other world to rescue them in case you forgot or are not aware was already thoroughly covered in a spectacular 1982 steven spielberg film called poltergeist instead of a little girl its a little boy they even managed to steal the idea of the outside help who enter and examine their spooky home two men and one woman exactly the same scenario except that in poltergeist the three characters delivered intelligent lines and dynamite performances in their lines are incredibly flat and their acting particularly the two guys could rival any performance from a japanese godzilla filmnow aside from the fact that this movie rips off from everything in sight ill focus on the level of the scare meter the scares are equal to a fairgrounds haunted house they involve a character dressed in very cheap makeup to go rrraaarrr right after the director yells action and then of course adding in post production a loud piece of music thats silly filmmakingi have never said the following words in my whole life but i mean thisthe poster art is misleading its so misleading in fact that the poster is more interesting to look at than watching this entire filmi only mentioned a few films that this silly movie steals from but there is actually moreif the storyline had some originality to it and the whole project was more respectfully constructed this could have been a memorable tripevery other movie i mention here i highly recommend signs the orphanage poltergeist and of course the exorcist are all excellent is cartoon scares and dull thrillsthe following is a massive spoiler the little boy even though youre expecting him to frighten the living hell out of youhe does absolutely nothing reagan in the exorcist lives up to all the hype watch that insteadi also want to say one more thing if you open the trivia page on this site youll see that the writer stated at a film festival that he wanted to avoid any movie clichs i personally found that information to be shockingly hilarious if you havent seen this movie yet check out the trivia firstthen check the film out if youre a regular movie goer who knows a ripoff when you see one then the trivia will have you rolling on the floor in laughter,astonish
ive been anticipating this movie for a while and when i finally was able to go see it it delivered for the first half of it anyways like i already said the first part of this movie was actually excellent if not a little slow around the middle aka the part where the ghost hunters come in things started to get laughable the actors were not the worst but definitely not the best but around the ending it seemed as though they were trying way too hard to be serious and it came out as humorous instead it was actually terrifying in some points until the demon started listening to tiny tim near the ending and then i couldnt help but not take this film seriouslythis movie could have been amazing it really couldve the graphics for the demon were not very good and some of the music felt out of place at times but this was certainly not the worst pg 13 horror movie ive ever seen laughable yes in some parts it was decent i suppose so its not one of those movies that makes you want to walk out in the middle of it overall a six out of ten stars seem suitable,astonish

is not a new idea of a horror film but it is a new take on the subject having a family get caught up in a horrific matter that has a wife played by rose bryne and her husbands played by patrick wilson son whos mind is trapped in an otherworldly place beyond our realm of existence called the further the story is great and the acting was great no supercheesy oneliners or offthewall moments its just a plain and simple deliverance that achieves buildup scares emotion and just an overall spectacle not seen since steven spielbergs poltergeist is a classic not just among horror films but among the family drama it shows that parents would do anything to keep their children safe no matter the cost is a theaterworthy film and a mustsee dont think twice about seeing this movie even if its from the makers of saw and paranormal activity because it is way better than both or if its pg13 because it shows the bloody gory horror films how to make an effective horror without ripping off body parts or dismembering victims i recommend this movie for all horror fans and for anyone who likes the actors and actresses in the film because the performances in this movie were great910 stars,astonish
it is very clear that the writer of this film had seen steven spielbergs classic horror film poltergeist because this entire film pulls whole cloth elements from poltergeist and reworks it to a bastardized version it is as if this film is written and directed by high school kids who saw poltergeist and thought it would be cool to make their homage to it with their simplistic understanding of how to create suspense and horror for these writerdirector horror to them is a person wearing scary makeup and sudden loud noisesnothing more wants to be poltergiest but ends up doing everything wrong and its embarrassing to watchto no surprise after finding out that this film was made by the people behind paranormal activity and saw i knew right away one would have to check their brain at the doorfor me i can look by bad acting poor effects and amateurhour directing but if the underlying script is terrible then i am going to bash it and this my friends is serious high school play writingdirecting  the kind of mess where parents go sit in the audience and no matter how crappy it is you end up clapping and going home half asleep and thinking about other thingsto be fair and give you an idea of what horror films i likejaws  poltergeist  american werewolf in london  exorcist  frailty  tale of two sisters foreign filmits a small list but they are considered classics by critics and viewers alike check imdbs ratings for each they are so loved because each tells a story in a very realistic way and not looking to cheap tricks for scare value its professional storytellingid love to discuss in a scene by scene way as to what a disaster the thing is but i doubt anyone will read my review outside of seeing my rating of it 110id rate this as unwatchable and spit but imdb wont let meif you are an aspiring screenwriter then watch this film and learn what exactly not to do,astonish
uhoh i need to turn on the lightsis one of the few modern horror films that is truly scary not many movies can hold your nerves hostage like the exorcist or the omen but comes close with atmospheric direction bloodchilling sequences and lots of screeching violinsa family with three kids moves into a rambling house in middle america  the type with hardwood floors high ceilings and a dark attic that practically screams hey look at me im haunted patrick wilson watchmen is father josh rose byrne is mother renai sans her baby fat as brads plaything in troy 2004 their little boy dalton ty simpkins has an accident in the attic and goes into a coma that doctors cant explain months pass when renai tucks in daltons little brother he whimpers to her one night about comatose dalton in the next room i dont like it when he walks around at night blood chills hairs rise cities fallwritten by leigh whannell and directed by james wan the twisted australian duo who brought us saw kicks us in the ribs with classic horror iconography loud noises doors opening by themselves apparitions whispers on a baby monitor some beautiful scares  like the unclear vision of the dickensian boy through the window dancing to tiptoe through the tulips only thing scarier is tiny timchannels poltergeist fiercely  and though we might call that movie a classic today even poltergiest did get a little kooky in its third act remember all the hollywood commotion in the final scenes skeletons popping up in the pool the house disappearing in some kind of vortex and the elf woman with the voice that sounded like she was suckling helium so too insiduous cannot live up to its razorburning first half although it does retain enough ectoplasm for a wild ride to a satisfying surprise conclusionlike most horror films does not survive its explanation phase as per horror protocol a suitably wizened old woman psychic or medium or charlatan or whatever theyre called provides the prosaic explanation behind daltons coma as the poltergeist helium elf called the other dimension the light the psychic lin shaye calls it the further and explains that dalton is actually astral traveling there while demons are trying to use his inert body as a vessel to squeeze their bad selves into our dimensionroytwhich brings up all those usual questions i have for psychics mediums charlatans whatever why dont the demons just come through and be done with it instead of poking around halfheartedly by leaving bloodied handprints on sheets and speaking through baby monitors are they trying to possess dalton is he going to turn into a maniac axemurderer inbred hillbilly why murder people if they only wind up in heaven isnt that undermining your whole demonic task of bringing them to hell why bother scaring them at all wouldnt demons from another dimensional plane consider simple earthbound scares below their dignity and in the noisy climactic scenes ghosts try to cross into this world by busting out of a closet  and a man obstructs their paranormal entrance into our dimension by holding the closet door closed really thats all it takes i thought ghosts could go through things can we get a demonic infiltration rulebook up in this haunted hizzouseand then  the perennial sance why in the dark does the absence of light really affect interdimensional contact human eyes can only pick up a miniscule section of the electromagnetic spectrum  between 4000 to 7000 angstroms  that we call visible light so how could it possibly affect entities that can obviously communicate along a much wider bandwidth and who are from a dimension where everything is supposedly so frickin bright ill tell you why in the dark because all those unsophisticates who handed down ghost stories from yore figured it would be scarier how i love scientific explanationswriter leigh whannell plays one of two paranormal investigator dorks whose funny appearance in the film is at a point where some levity is welcomed after heartskipping scares  but his presence also presages the wizened woman and the unneeded explanations from the outset the main drawback of is its pg13 rating we know theyre allowed to say fuck but once and are only allowed concepts that wont overwhelm your average lindsay lohan fan so with that hobbling we realize what a good job the filmmakers did to make those hairs rise on your mammalian body point the finger at joseph bisharas eerie evocative musicfunniest or most ignorant byproduct of movies like is that the slapstick mongoloids who call themselves ghost hunters notice all the madeup paranormal detection devices on screen and believe that they can actually construct this bogus equipment  at the very least name some glorified toaster the same name as that apparatus in the movie and presto instant ghost detection device which says more about the pantswetter who is using it than the device itselfthe first half of the movie gives you the fear  that notion of the inexplicable halfseen visions with no point other than an abiding alienness the second half is for ghost hunters with weak bladders that would be all of them noif i a nullifidian cucumber far above the superstitious beliefs of afterlife angels and demons needed to sleep with the lights on after this effective movie i shudder to think how hellish this movie must be on those pantswetters look behind you ghost hunter its waiting for you in the dark,astonish
i saw the screening in nyc last week as well and i thoroughly enjoyed the movie the lack of gore and elimination of fake scares adds to the boding sense of doom i think that the masses are going to like this movie its well done the haunting concept here is different and its refreshing i was scared during the movie and some of the scenes still give me the shivers its easier in many ways for me at least to dismiss over the top gore versus the buildup of increasingly scary concepts in this film lin shaye is fantastic and very effective in her role i thought that patrick wilson and rose byrne were excellent as well as pointed out above the script does not explain every aspect of why the characters do what they do eg why does patricks character start working late and stay away from home but it seemed obvious enough to me the only thing that confused me was the introduction or lack thereof of patricks characters mother barbara hershey it becomes clearer later in the movie that she is patricks mother so this is a minor nitpick in my mindcongrats on a refreshing take of a classic horror theme,astonish
while not a perfect horror flick is certainly one of the best of its kind in many a year not since drag me to hell have i enjoyed myself so much watching a scare flick while the formula is a redux of many a ghost story and heavily reminiscent of poltergeist the movie still feels fresh and originalthe scares in both the cheap and unique variety and it is all in good fun gore is definitely underplayed and the visuals and atmosphere are what yank you in and nail your eyes to the screenhopefully the team holds this high standard in what is sure to be a new franchise from the saw crew overdone as those movies have become they certainly have me locked in for ii,astonish
midway through james wans foray into the haunted house genre comes a moment so misjudged and tonally out of joint that a cynic might ponder the real intention of those behind this fitfully scary horror romp i mention it purely because what has gone on up until this point has been for the most part effective and enjoyablethe premise of the upwardly mobile wasp family having their nest hauled apart by forces unseen is hardly groundbreaking territory but the slow disintegration of this cosy tad too opulent bubble invites the same hint of schadenfreude that audiences may have felt when spirits trashed designer chic in genre bedfellow paranormal activity notably director oren peli takes the role of producer here the restraint wan uses in the first portion of the film must be applauded much like paranormal activity the key lies in the domestic space and in the seemingly mundane our first glimpses of the other are brilliantly executed  more often than not we are left in horrible dread  what was it that just marched across the balcony where in gods name did that child in victorian dress disappear to the zenith of all this creeping tension comes at that most benign of places at the dining table and in broad daylight a hideous apparition that comes at you in a snarling flash a knee jerk moment that sets the film at a cracking pace raising audience expectation to giddy heightssuch a tragedy it is then that the film dissolves so rapidly into a fairgroundvideo game aesthetic negating all of the good work gone on before in place of illjudged generic thrills that feel as creaky and predictable as the last time you were in a haunted house rideto take us back then to the point at which takes that fatal stumble just when our nerves are suitably raw we see the introduction of two ghostbuster dudes who trade funnies with each other like extras in a judd apatow vehicle comic relief is entirely justified and a lot of the time expected in horror films the banter here though is on display for too long  the characters come off as too smart too knowing thus plunging proceedings into doubtwhen busting parafernalia is brought out we snigger a ripple of derision that picks at all the plausibility carefully in place when a medium starts to do her thing whilst wearing a gas mask no less those sniggers turn into out and out howls of laughter  the like of which no amount of spooks or kooks could ever hope to dispelin short a great opening 45 minutes followed by a needlessly botched second half how sad that it is that it should be two of the characters in the film that reveal the smoke and mirrors from which all of the films horror emanates,astonish
okay well i had heard nothing but praise for and that it was the scariest movie of 2011 so far so naturally i gave the movie a go being the horror aficionado that i amand i will say this much praise for the movie it was great up until half way through give or take the first half of the movie was actually quite good because it was building up a lot of dread and suspense and there was a certain feel to the movie the sort of feel you had going on in the old poltergeist movie you slowly got to see more and more of the haunting and whatever entity it was that was the cause of thisbut then you find out what it was and the movie started to crack and fail i was thinking they cant be serious about this so now i know what happened the darth maul wow talk about being a major disappointment in revealing what was doing the haunting i am sure the concept was working well enough but this darth maul lookalike clone no not really working out all that muchand to top it off when josh went into the further as they cleverly called the astral plane that was painful to sit through and look at there was nothing out of this world about that at all and it was a shame because it would otherwise have added a very cool element to the movienow is more interesting and more spooky than both of the paranormal activities and that is a big plus because they were major disappointments in each their own way i read that someone compared to saw and said that was more scary ehm yeah two completely different genre of movies here so you cant really compare the two had a lot going on for it especially in the first half of the movie but then it snapped and went spiraling downward fast and the whole poltergeist feeling or tribute not sure what the director was going for also worked out well for the movieas for the cast and their acting well i think they had managed to put together a decent enough ensemble of people here and it was a bit weird to see patrick wilson playing josh lambert in a movie of this genre but he did pull off the character and came through with a good performance so the genre change worked for him lin shaye playing elise rainer had some big shoes to fill out standing up against the iconic character tangina played by zelda rubinstein in the classic poltergeist movies but still lin shaye did it well and added her own unique touch to the moviei had been looking forward to watching but was sorely disappointed my low rating for the movie is because of the nature of the entity behind the haunting and the last half of the movie had the entity been something else a high rating would have been given what pulls up the score is the dread and suspense that the movie managed to build up in the first half i will say that for a horror movie then does a better job than many othersprovides adequate entertainment for an evening in front of the screen but for those who have been addicted to the horror movies for many many years like i have there is just something unsatisfying about the end result,astonish
i watched this film the other day after reading reviews on here they told me its really scary and an awesome film blah blah blah ive wanted to watch a movie that would actually scare me for absolutely ages so was looking forward to this one welli so should not have bothered i mean honestly this film looked like it was made by low budget teen directors in the 1990s the deamon looked like a mask you would see kids wearing on halloween the ghosts looked like ill people and the acting was absolutely awful not to mention the poor camera work and bad effects its like a bad remake of poltergeist and that wasnt even a great film honestly do not watch this film if you actually enjoy horror filmswatch it if you enjoy cheap awful craphope you guys listen to this reviewthe film annoyed me so much i signed up just to write this,astonish
in all honesty i thought this movie was appallingly bad so bad i laughed the whole way through was a joke of a movie the first 20  30 minutes were pretty interesting and i thought that it would be a great movie but unfortunately i was wrongthroughout the whole film theyve taken little parts from different movies like poltergeist and the exorcist which sounds like itd be pretty enjoyable but somehow teamed with silly little demons and music thats just way too dramatic for its own good they found a way to make you want to jab your eyes out with a ballpoint penthe acting was just awful and too dramatic  at times i felt like i was watching a lame horror special of the bold and the beautiful the only actor who was remotely good was the little boy and thats because he was in a coma for the majority of the time and didnt talk much the demons and ghosts were laughable  oh wow a demon that looks like it was trying on some of its mums makeup  quelle horreurthe only part that even remotely scared me in the movie was when the weird demon family all sync in this massive grin  and that was still lame the entire movie was just way too predictable and just too over the topthe only thing i dont regret about watching this film is that thankfully i didnt have to pay for it at the beginning i wont deny it this movie had potential  but the creators of it just tried so hard to make it something it wasntthe only reason im rating it 210 is because i got a few laughs out of it,astonish
is a typical bproduct from the scary movie genre its story is a collection of clichs from the japanese horror wave of the past decade and the american remakes thereof haunted house et ceterait is a sure sign of poor writing skills when a movie has characters sitting around explaining the plot for minutes on end and this movie has a lot of that an awful lot this is exacerbated by the fact that the audience arrives at every major conclusion about 30 minutes before the characters do and the predictability of the plot should even make the end quite unsurprising for the average viewerthe dismal and dreary visual style is actually not a bad choice for the subject and some of the photography was quite agreeable but the editing and overall feel of it seemed a bit much like a television production the acting was below average and the two geeks were nice distraction though they were clearly underuseddue to the total lack of atmosphere relies heavily on the overuse of cheap thrills like creaking doors creepy or sudden music or noises and suddenly appearing ghosts and demons just like the haunted house at the local funfair yes it will scare you for a moment but you will call it a ripoff at the exit nonetheless some scenes that were clearly meant to provide suspense were even involuntary funny and laughed at by the audiencethe only thing that really scared me is that so many users proved to have obviously never seen a really good movie by rating this stinker at an insane 70 and nearly half a million people like it on facebook i personally rate this movie a miserable failure,astonish
it looks like there are either a lot of relatives or a lot of people being paid to write reviews because i dont know how anyone can say this movie was goodthe concept wasnt bad but the execution was god awful the direction was amateurish the camera angles were awful and one of my pet peeves way too many close ups the makeup looked like it was done by high school kidsyou never really connect with any of the characters so you dont care what happens to any of them the whole thing was just badwait for this to come out on dvd or even cable i read all the good reviews and thought that the bad reviews were just people that dont really like horror movies i was wrong im really not kidding when i say that i think people were paid to write reviews,astonish
i have no idea what the big deal is with this movie i mean this was the funniest horror movie i have ever seen i was laughing the whole time my wife and i looked at each other and wish we could have our money back it is filled with cheap acting cheap thrills and the music is basically someone banging on a piano every time there is some monster or creature behind someone or staring at someone felt like a rip off of paranormal activity poltergeist and exorcist in one the one thing i cant figure out was this movie supposed to really be horror and scary or a comedy because if its comedy then i can accept it but if this is supposed to be scary man whoever made this movie needs to watch some real movies in that genre what were they thinking please dont make a part 2 well it doesnt matter to us we wont be watching it,astonish
theres a guy in my office that occasionally hides under my work desk and yells boo when i return from the restroom sometimes he jumps out from the coat closet near the front door or hides behind the wall adjacent to the office kitchen every time he uses the same lame boo scream because hes too stupid to properly construct an effective scare it worked the first few times but now its totally worthless he cant scare me i on the other hand will occasionally hide behind his door in the morning before he arrives his office lights are usually off and the lighting is dim hell walk into his office feel someones presence turn around and see a shadow near the door is it a part of his imagination or is it real he squints his eyes for a few seconds and then notices that someone is actually there it scares the crap out of him every time and i dont even need to scream boo ironically sometimes when i dont do it hell stop by my office and say man i thought i saw you this morning this very basic difference between amateur shock tactics and wellconstructed sequences of terror is something that 21st century american filmmakers ignore with reckless abandon in case you hadnt noticed the american horror industry has sucked for quite some time and one major reason is that they almost always go for the cheapest laziest routes to producing scares in the case of its jump scares supplemented with 100decibel pianoviolin booms if limited itself to 2 or 3 such moments or even 4 or 5 then it could have saved enough room for more mature expertly crafted horror elements unbelievably tosses in approximately 20 jump scares an unacceptable descent into unprecedented laziness the condensed nature of the jumps falls prey to the law of diminishing returns it would be like the guy at my office jumping in front of me and yelling boo every 3 minutes it quickly becomes a parody of itselfbrian salisbury from film school rejects makes some good points in his review of so id like to quote him here seriously horror filmmakers put a moratorium on jump scares i know everyone and their brother is using jump scares as a counterattack against increasingly desensitized audiences but its time to give up the ghost pun only slightly intended i got sick and tired of something popping up like jackinthebox every five seconds obscuring my vision from the much more interesting and far scarier story going on behind it jump scares are the junk food of horror films  providing only superficial and extremely temporary sensory nourishment soon enough your brain is hungry again for that fear response and jump scares are about as substantial as eating a box of twinkies on thanksgiving day when you watch the oscars and the category of achievement in sound mixing comes up you know when you normally make a trip to the bathroom you may ponder on the value of a films sound mixer or sound designer five minutes into you will understand the dire necessity of these artists if only by virtue of the fact that were subjected to their spectacular failures for 90 minutes every apparition carries with it its own deafening shriek and every jump scare is heralded with an explosion of disharmonious read eardrumshredding violins it seems to be operating under the same delusion as drag me to hell that loud  scary but along with jump scares incessant loud noises are the charlatans of fright we are not infants so please refrain from resorting to the same tactics that terrify barely cognitive life forms that sums things up nicely the praise that has earned for its cheap scare tactics should be concerning for fans of the genre because a transition from the recent torturegore trend towards jump scare compilations isnt much of a progression for the pitiable american horror industry take away the 100decibel pianoviolin booms and almost none of the jumps will work on your mainstream cinephile and by work im using the generous term startle which is probably the laziest way to scare someone the storyline is stupid the acting is mediocre at best the dialogue ranges from decent to lame and the dramatic elements are limp the only true positive is the fairly brisk pacing that keeps things from getting unbearably boringdespite everyone i know complaining about my biased preference for japanese and south korean horror its pretty damn obvious that my fellow americans are simply too incompetent to construct longsustained sequences of terror produce dense atmosphere develop interesting psychologicalphilosophical elements use ambiguity properly patiently utilize deliberate pacing to build tension or supplement horror with good story lines and characters if is the creme de la creme of modern american horror then its time to write an epitaph,astonish
im really surprised to see this film is averaging 72 at the moment the film took an eternity to actually get into with the opening 30 minutes of the film a constant cycle of the mundane daily routine of the family affected the concept of the film doesnt work and seems like a cheesy attempt of a childrens bedtime horror i waited an eternity for a proper scary moment but it completely failed to deliver this it also seemed to combine pieces of other films most notably the fire demon seeming freddie krugeresque and the start of the film seeming liking paranormal activity acting is poor concept is poor dialogue is poor film is a bore from start to finish if you want a scary film avoid this at all costs,astonish
i sat through this awful movie last night and regret it the acting was woeful even the great rose byrne and barbra hershey couldnt save it the suspense was non existent and i just couldnt get into the movie there was no explanation of why the child was in a coma they tried to explain it toward the end badly but by then you just didnt carethe story line was just a cheap bad rip off of poltergeist it was just plain dumb it could have been better developed but the result is an epic faildont waste your time with this rubbish if you want to see something better see the original poltergeist if you are a fan of wan and whannell stick with saw,astonish
i had high expectations of this film as i am an avid horror fan but i came away feeling let downit started well building the tension and there were a couple of moments that made both myself and my 15 year old daughter jump however around half way through the film the so called scary parts became comedic and i am not on about the two characters others are talking about in their reviews which in my view were good valuei also took along my mother who jumps like a cat on a hot tin roof at horror films and even she thought it was silly by the end the film cost me 25 for the three of us so if i were you i would save your money and either wait for it on sky or buy the dvd 810 for the first half  210 for the remainder 510 overall,astonish
this movie was slow boring  painful but at least it was long they took some of the basic story lines of poltergeist  the exorcist  made a new movie out of themthe beginning is way too long  drawn outthen the rest is goofy or predictable the assistants coming to evaluate if the situation was real is pointless the medium already knew the fathers history so she knew it was most likely real was she testing her assistants what was the point couldnt it have been for the audiences sake weve already seen proof by then as have the parents so all that was a waste it felt like it was just so they could shock us with blaring music notes while we see creepy ghosts in corners weve seen all that before its a clich  it wasnt neededthe father not realizing he was actually asleep  outside his body has also been done before several times so much thats its expected when its expected its not scary or shocking its boring him walking thru the realm of darkness wasnt bad but again it seems like it was so they could shock us with more extremely loud music notes  ghosts with creepy smiles how many times has that been done before seriouslysimply a bad movie go watch the exorcist  poltergeist youll see what they were trying to do here only better,astonish
when i watched this movie i thought i would probably have trouble sleeping tonight mainly for the fact that im the biggest coward that youve ever seen but i also thought it would be an interesting movie to watch at least not alone so we watched it with the lights off and for the first 30 minuets and it was alright even though it was a bit clich but towards the 23 of the movie things became clich for the worst of reasons the characters became even more dull than they already were and downright silly even the usually enjoyable nerds of movies like these were poorly executed i dont really see what was so scary about this movie pedo women who stole my look guy with claws and old people the ending reminded me too much of michael jacksons thriller so yeah in conclusion an overrated cheap flick which is so bad it becomes funny,astonish
i loved this movie it was really scary i didnt know exactly what the movie was about when i went hadnt looked it up on imdb so i was pleasantly surprised that it wasnt a typical slasher or ghost movie i screamed several times and just had chill bumps thru the last half of the movie in comparison paranormal activity 2 had some chilling moments but you pretty much knew when they were coming this movie had lots of scary moments i loved that it wasnt gory and it had some great 70s type horror movie scenesmusicsound effects at the beginning of the movie when the name of the film came up the sound and look of the title reminded me of many old scary movies when they relied more on sound effects than computer generated effects it was surprising and unpredictable at times it was not corny either very refreshing for a scary movie lover i went with a friend that i always see scary movies with and we both agreed that this was the scariest movie we have seen in a few years i would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves horrorghost movies,astonish
i love the horror film genre seen virtually all and own most on dvd  now bluray not since the 70s when the exorcist was released has there been any film which has made me really jump several times not want to look at the screen on a few occasions and have an effect on me after the film had finished i left all passage lights on when i went to bed the first time in over 30 years and didnt want to look in the mirror when washing my teeth just in case someone would be looking over my shoulder watched bluray version on 50 led tv with he system at 200 am with all lights off and volume up and it scared me big time it makes the likes of paranormal activity 2 look like a kids tv program,astonish
this movie was absolutely amazing i went to see it last night with my friend and it scared the living hell out of me the guy with the red face kind of reminded me of that guy on star wars though and the boy that was dancing was really really creepy but all i could do was laugh at that part i think the scariest part of the whole movie was the old lady i cant get that image out of my headi dont know why but it was just so scary the movie shouldnt be rated pg 13 it should be like rated r scariest movie ever it probably wouldnt be so bad on like a small tv but seeing it on the big screen terrified me lol at one part i punched myself in the face something scary happened and my arm flew up to cover my eyes and i ended up hitting myself anyway great movie waaay scarier than paranormal activity when i saw the previews for this it seemed like one of those movies but it was so much better id definitely go see it again and again and again although i may have nightmares for the next few weeks id recommend it to people of any age as long as they can handle creepy faces and scary pop out scenes ,astonish
why does hollywood have no concept of money or common sense this family lives in a 500k  1 million house depending on where the story is supposed to take place they have three kids one of whom requires constant medical care and the wife doesnt work the wife claims she needs to move because the place is haunted so does the husband who hasnt seen anything to indicate ghosts in the house maybe question his wifes sanity as the most plausible explanation of course not instead he does the following well sure honey any reasonable person would think youre insane we have thousands of dollars of medical bills to pay per month for our comatose son and im a freaking teacher so yeah of course we can just up and leave this house and move into another mansion its only money baby despite all that this movie is just your average clichridden mess full of gasp jump scares which are the laziest horror staples money can buy,astonish
i saw the screening of this movie weds march 23 2011 andnot bad three things to know1 the acting is good but the music was great very corny orchestrated string music and loud 2 the story was actually easy to follow and not predictable till the very end i dont think anybody in the theater knew how the ending would be till the very last five minutes of the film 3 as for being scary its more creepy than scary also jumpy because of the music creepy as in little children creepy with those little giggles and laughs they have give the movie time because it takes a while for the movie to get going but thats what makes this movie good a creepy person doesnt just come up and scare you right away cause thats just weird a creepy person sends you messages of im there but you cant see me like someone hiding in a bush and you see them for a split second and you look back and they arent there anymore if you are frighten or startled easily then this is the movie for you but if you arent scared easily then youll just find this movie really creepy,astonish
how much can you hate a moviewell let me tell you i went out of my way to register with imdb to make my protest me knowsimply put is one of the worst films i have ever seen i could not verify this however im sure all the reviewers that have submitted comments for this film were written by people who have not actually watched this movie i wish i could reclaim back 90 mins of my life not to mention a refund for hard earned money that was thrown away on this so called scary movie if you want a fright equivalent to  just switch of the lights in your house and play loud music with the occasional hysterical scream in the background that your 5 year could supply at no cost i guarantee the experience will be far more likely to scare you than this moviebe warned you will hate yourself for watching this crud save your money and wait for the sky rerun in 3 months,astonish
i dont want to be too harsh on this movie but it really does just cover old ground stuff weve seen so many times it doesnt do it in a fresh way either like some have said family moves into big old house kid gets possessed doors open and close on their own ghost kids laughing and running around swirling violin music a devil with a red face dolls and puppets an old record player playing an old song cue old lady medium and ghostbuster sidekicks with ridiculous gadgets seriously i love good horror films and this isnt one of them think of something original please i have had to say that there are spoilers in here but the things i mention already spoil the movie well i was horrified its scary how unimaginative some directors and writers can be sad to say that this wont be the last film of its kind,astonish
theres too much material and too little time for adequate cinematic presentation everything feels rushed and crammed into one movie they waste too much time on irrelevant scenes and not enough time on scenes that should be anticipated theres too many plot twists that strain credibility and after an hour the entire situations starts looking ridiculous que the nostalgic seventies technology and it gets very close to comedicstarting with zero stars i gave one star for originality one star for competent acting not oscar winning but watchable one star for paying homage to movies that were actually worth a damn and another star for setting and ambianceso i hear they are making another installment chapter two but i cant imagine the next movie to do anything but rehash the first one all the ideas were used in this oneand after the paranormal activity series i get that people dont want to wait five years to figure out whats going on i just dont think cramming a couple movies into one is a very good idea either,astonish
this was pretty bad all the way around  acting story scare factor if you are a horror movie veteran this can be safely skipped the only good part was there is a hilarious scene about a seance with a goofy psychic and involves an unexpected accessory she puts on it was laugh out loud funny but besides that nothing interesting the effects are bad and very cheesy you can tell this movie didnt have much of a budget nice house though its amazing a teacher could afford a big house like that in a place like california yea right im being sarcastic here this is a typical crappy horror movie like they seem to constantly make,astonish
wow what can i sayit starts with the title what does it mean it rings through your head its a fascinating word it means proceeding in a gradual subtle way but with harmful effects one should wonder why is it called i was excited about this film from the moment james wan announced it i am a fan of him and leigh whannell and have been since saw dead silence was scary as hell and death sentence was pure fun when i saw the trailer i was so excited and anticipated opening daythis film will grab you right from the opening shots and its opening titles james wan knows how to set the mood for an experience that will fill you with fear and dread and is proof the cinematography is excellent and atmospheric boasting a mostly muted and gray look wans visual style sure is eyecatching and creepythe films plot revolves around a family of five a married couple josh and renai a teacher and musician and their children having just moved into a new home they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging however one night the eldest child dalton bumps his head after falling off the ladder and is soon in a comatose statethree months later creepy stuff begins to happen ghosts can be seen breakins occur they move to joshs mothers place but even that doesnt help soon they find out its dalton thats haunted not the house as he is stuck in a realm called the further is creepy and good fun if youre expecting jump scares every 5 minutes you will be disappointed this movie is largely tension based and jump scares are minimal wan brings back what horror is about being scared to feel fear to dread whats coming nextthe performances are great too wilson is excellent and so is rose byrne also turning in a good performance is leigh whannell undoubtedly the show stealer as the geeky and hilarious specs he and his buddy tucker provide the comic relief the flashlight scene was hilariousin short is a success wan and whannell clearly love being scared as much as we do and it shows to james wan touche thanks so much for showing what horror is about,astonish
my other half and i were looking forward to this as wed seen both paranormal films and liked them both unfortunately we fell into the trap of seeing the trailer and thinking that it looked good thought id learnt my lesson about trailers but obviously not started off ok but quickly turned into just another horror film with a lack of ideas the film really started to go downhill when the mothers friend appeared the out of body experience was laughable and really spoilt the film we both thought that sequence was awful it looked like something a bunch of school kids had put together with no money to spend very disappointing considering how good paranormal activity was it just goes to show that less is more,astonish
a couple josh patrick wilson and renai rose byrnes move into their new home with their three children they have twin boys dalton ty simpkins and foster andrew astor and a baby too josh works as a teacher while renai stays at home to look after the baby and work on her music career when strange things start happening in the house renai begins to panic she has visions of small children running through the house and is also hearing loud disruptive noises after dalton has a fall in the attic he slips into a coma the doctors say that he does not have brain damage but the boy is left bedridden inside the house when even more disturbing events occur like bloody handprints appearing on the sheets both patrick and rose are convinced that their house is now haunted helping them move into a second house is patricks mother lorraine barbara hershey but they find that the paranormal world still follows them horror movies are always full of boring stupid people they shriek ask what the hell was that like theyve never seen a horror movie before and enter dark rooms by themselves went to this school of horror and spent all its time copying notes off paranormal activity 2007 the film is directed by james wan who gave us the first saw but producer oren pelis stamp is visible he made the first paranormal activity and the plots are so lazily similar that you can pinpoint the moment the psychics will show up this is a copy of a film that was already a rehash of every haunted house clich true it is a break from the torture porn trend but its only to fall back on the first tier of horror clichs like creaking doors and mysterious falling objects unoriginality is not even the films biggest sin though its unintentionally funny rather than scary the way the opening titles come up is like a throwback to 1950s schlock horror except theyre not playing for laughs the tone visually provided through the films ugly muted colour filters is deadly serious but its very difficult not to laugh at this brand of horror because its been parodied so often in its favour its a marginally better film than paranormal activity because its unconcerned about masking the artifice wan omits any phony quasidocumentary aesthetics and the narrative is more eventful in its final quarter but its also in the last fifteen minutes that the story moves from otherworldly and into lets say politely nonsense it mistakenly shows the monsters and also tries to explain their existence through lazy slabs of expositional dialogue its saved by some slightly creepy imagery though im certain theyve pinched some from the video game bioshock 2007 and the demon cheaply looks like a man in a rubber suit whod be more suited to tapping people on the shoulder in a ghost train typically for a horror film the characters are underwritten and the cast is misused wilson and byrnes are not the most annoying horror couple but they lack distinctive voices and any life they share exterior from the house is empty with very few lines or actions barbra hershey is terribly underused but you know your film is in real trouble when the most disturbing element is hearing australian comic angus sampson putting on a thick american accent,astonish
the reviews giving 10 smell like money spent on an advertising campaign which wishes to look like grassrootsfor a good eye its a bad movie sucking the benefits from words like  independent original scary and so on new media will never be credible with this kind of attitude when bad acting meets lack of creativity you get a scary movie like this one why dont they start to show us a black screen and then pop  up some white faces and scream when the atmosphere is most silent then youll get some heart attacks or other results alike so keep creating real accounts and submit positive critics lying doesnt cost a thing make them vote like theyre doing it from the heart and youll obtain a 7 grade i sincerely appreciate the imdb site posting other scores and critics than the ones coming from astroturfers,astonish
wooohcan i say it was good it was crazy goodso when the film opened i noticed that it was definitely a james wan and leigh whannell collaboration the camera movements the dark sensibility of the scenes and fear factor the opening remind me of hitcock and a little bit of fw murnau nosferatu with the music and the gritty in redi tried to brave throughout 87 of the film but i ended up failing freaking out for the last 30 minutesbut that laterrenai josh and their 3 children move into a new house life seems good but right away strange things start to happen she wakes up and her son eerily tells her he doesnt like his bed roomas the film progressed i realized that it was not just another haunted house film i loved the twists and turns in the story like moving from a large three story house to a considerably small ranch styled home even though they had moved the things renai were seeing didnt go away finding out that the child was being haunted instead put me on edge its not the house thats haunted wooh that is scary i loved the camera movements and the quick shot tricks and shadowlighting contrasts helped the film become more scary during first person viewafter they find out the real reason things are wrong the movie quickly sped up and before i knew it i was covering my eyes hoping for the best with these lovable and relatable characters the film ended in a twist that reminded me of dead silence mainly because of the woman in 19th century clothing the twist was expected a bit but i was shocked when at the only physical death and i was also left wondering what happened at the end when she turned aroundit was fun and scary i really suggest you watch it not just on my own review but the reviews before and after me it was good,astonish
please read this review as it will save you more than an hour of your lifei came onto imdb to see what got to my surprise 74 also backed up by the directors of paranormal activity and saw sooooo what did i do i gave the film a try let me start off by saying the acting is so rubbish a bunch of school kids could of done better the scare factor is a joke and the story is all over the placeplease dont get me started on the effects and the rubbish application of makeup to make people look deadthis film was a joke if not a load of horse pooh which i would consider more valuableplease listen and do not bother your life with this crapyou will thank me,astonish
if you want to rent this movie  i would recommend seeing poltergeist instead the premise and concept is the same as poltergeist although a little cheesier if you have previously seen poltergeist you would be extremely disappointed in this movie the acting is somewhat bland and the storyline is overly predictable the special effects were ok at best which is faint praise for the amount they spent to develop this film i would have expected much better than the few parlor tricks and simple props they used in the moviethe majority of the audience left well before the movie was over i was one of the few people in the theater to sit it out my date wanted to stay most patrons left and went into a different movie one of the benefits of seeing a bad movie at a multiplex i am puzzled by the averageslightly above average reviews my only explanation is most of the reviewers must not have seen poltergeist i realize there are few if any new ideas in todays movies this movie is just another unoriginal flick trying to put a slightly different spin on an older story your redbox dollar is better applied to renting poltergeist,astonish
i really dont understand the good reviews for this unless this was meant to be a comedy it did make me laugh a few times there were a couple of jump out at you scenes but overall it was just a cheesefest it was too cheesy to be scary the concept sounded interesting and the movie started off okay but just continued to go downhill the acting was not great more annoying than convincing i havent been this disappointed in a movie in a long time i kept waiting for it to be over and it just kept getting worse basically if you want to jump in your seat a couple of times but sleep soundly and not think about it ever again this is the perfect movie,astonish
how did they make a film that messes with you head on such a low budget is amazing if you like to be scared watch this film the low budget does seam to show towards to end of the film but believe me you wont want to go in to a deep sleep for a while the performances by the actors are top class this film is guaranteed to raise the hairs on the back of your neck a horror film these days consists of bored teens getting murdered for been dumb but the paranormal activity genre seem to be reviving horror lets just hope more will follow horror aint just about the gore its about the psychological effects of the film to make you believe i enjoyed it so much i watched it twice in the same day 2 please,astonish
this film is about a suburban couple dealing with the fright of living in a haunted house and their son suddenly having fallen into a comais such a great supernatural thriller it does not require gore or sudden loud noises to scare all the scare is the psychological atmosphere created by masterful filmmaking the plot is amazingly suspenseful and engaging it makes you scared ill at ease and on edge all the timei really enjoyed which is something rather unusual as i normally do not like scary movies if there is a sequel which there could very well be i would watch it,astonish
is by far the best scary movie to come out in what feels like a very very long time it wasnt just a good scary movie but a genuinely scary scary movie from the opening shot to the credits everything just seemed to work there were no big special effects and there was no cheesy cgi which in my opinion really brings down the quality of supernatural movies the scares were genuine and a few parts really had the whole audience gasping and jumping out of their seats i myself had chillswhich hasnt happened with any scary movie in the past 8 years granted its not a perfect movie and there are some of the usual scary movie clichs but in no way do they rob the movie of being enjoyable overall is creepy and very scary and most importantly a fun movie to watch it gives you the scare you want and the enjoyment you want from walking through a haunted house during halloween time after watching this movie horror directors and writers should takes notes and tips from james wan and leigh whannel,astonish
only next time i wont be hiding behind my bag of popcorn for most of the movie tells a tale about a family who flees their haunted house only to discover that it was never actually the house that was haunted the proceedings follow a familiar path to anyone who has seen classics of this genre like the haunting and poltergeist but it tells it so much better than similar films of more recent vintage right out of the gate it spooked me i cant think of another movie that grabbed me by the throat quite that fast that ive seen in a theater recently a good bit of the credit for that goes to joseph bishara who wrote a score that skittered up my spine like a spider director james wan also made great use of shadows and unexpected juxtapositions and just created such an allaround sense of dread that even when youre pretty sure you know whats about to happen its still freaking scary when it does leigh whannell hits all the marks for an old dark house movie and layers it with believable middle class family pathos the actors all fill out their roles sympathetically and lin shaye in particular knocks it out of the park as the psychic who tries to help the family the only flaw i can see here is that the way the story plays out is not really going to surprise anyone familiar with this genre if you watch a lot of haunted house horror ill bet you even guess the twist however its all told so very very well that ill only take away one point for that highly recommended,astonish
all i have to say to james wan and leigh whannell isthank you is such a breath of fresh air when it comes to the horror genre its a wonderful homage to some of the great classics but it puts its own little spin on it no cheap scares no excessive cgi no blood and guts just a simple creepy blast of a good old haunted house film the last time i left a theater after seeing a horror film and felt this uneasy and satisfied was back in 2002 when i saw the ring which is also pg13 once again thank you guys for reviving the piece of crap otherwise own as todays horror genre keep making films like and i can assure you they will all be successful,astonish
you know how you think you have a movie figured out before going to see it well i thought was one of those movies i thought it was a run of the mill scary movie however the concept was differenti thought the movie was well put together at times i thought the plot was a little shaky but it managed to correct that thoughtthe actors really did a good job with making their roles believable the concept of the plot made us think if this stuff actually goes onif your looking for a movie that does not fit inside the normally box of movies in this genre then this is itgood movie i recommend you go see it,astonish
come on people why are so many saying this film is not original i dont know their are certain motifs to consider when making a film especially one that is in the realm of horror and those motifs dictate what sub genre to put it in but enough about labels this film is in a category all its own why its down right good the acting is on point lin shay is always amazing the direction is beautiful each shot or frame rather is like a series of paintings and the scenes in the further are breathtaking the story is original the writers set up a world for the dead and its connection with the living that is quite refreshingyou dont need to be a horror film fan to enjoy this film especially since it has close to no goreand relies mainly on suspense if your looking for a great story close to a folklore or an extended bedtime story this is the movie for you,astonish
in 2009 there was a huge phenomenon buzz around the film paranormal activity bringing the scare back with simple effects and noises around the house that would make the hair on your arms stand up i can see why hollywood would want to capitalize on this since it was so successful so a bigger budget film was made with the critiques on the poster on how this film is not only scarier than paranormal activity but even scarier than the proclaimed most frightening film of all time the exorcist i love how almost every scary movie wants to upstage that title when i would say personally that the exorcist raised that bar too high for a lot of other films of the genre to reach my grip when people said that paranormal activity wasnt scary because you didnt see anything was that in my opinion its what you dont see that is very scary i think the producers of took that criticism too far and gave us what started off as a very creepy movie and gave us way too much to be truly frightenedrenai and josh lambert have recently moved into a new house with their three children one night as dalton is playing he hears noises in the attic and goes to investigate he steps on an old ladder to turn on the light when it breaks causing dalton to fall he starts screaming after looking at something in a shadowy corner renai and josh help him the next day josh goes to wake dalton but he does not move they rush him to the hospital where the doctors say he is in an unexplained coma three months later he is still in a coma and they bring him home to care for him over the next few days disturbing events begin to occur while renai plays piano and the baby is sleeping renai hears whispering from the baby monitor then as she gets closer to the stairs someone yells i want him now renai believes the house is haunted but it turns out that there maybe more to this house than just being hauntedthe beginning was pretty strong even though we have no real connection to these characters so i dont have much sympathy for them the film does have some genuine scares mainly they rely on the jump scares but for the most part the ghosts are pretty creepy however i do have a couple complaints one being that i think seeing the ghosts killed it for me because if they dont scare you they look goofy and to me they looked a little goofy and too cgi the devil is sharpening his knife fingers to a pleasant song which i know is supposed to be creepy but for me killed the moment and i was just laughing like crazy not only that but the way he moved was too typical and clich then the ending that drove me crazy because it seemed like the writers just gave up and went into a m night shamalamadingdong territory where the ending went into a totally whacky land the whole being haunted was inherited from my daddy thing was bogus and such a cop out i kinda wished they maybe would have made the boy just pure evil like an omen thing would i recommend this film i guess this is the paranormal activity for the teenagers now im not trying to insult the adults who found this film frightening but honestly after all the films ive seen this movie is nothing410,astonish
is the latest horror endeavor by the original saw creator james wan and paranormal activity producer jason blum that will literally terrify audiences it revolves around josh lambert patrick wilson and renai lambert rose byrne as they move into a new home their oldest son dalton ty simpson is an adventurer who likes to explore one night when venturing into the attic he falls and hits his head the next morning he is in a coma unable to do anything josh and renai bring him home to care for in the hope he will one day come out of it then strange things start to happen strange noises occur faces appear things are moved the alarm sounds strange happenings occur more frequently after a while they have had enough and move to a small house for lease it does not help apparently it was not the house that was haunted but rather dalton more bizarre things happen  frightening things at this point they turn for help from joshs mom barbara hershey and elise lin shaye she explains the strange things that pervade what is happening why it is happening and how to get dalton back this leads to a secret memory that josh has buried which was easy to figure out and a terrifying venture into the spiritual world despite a few flaws is deft craft using atmosphere suspense terror and stunning visual imagery that will frighten the deepest part of your soul this accomplishment is primarily done with wans wonderful direction that leaves an audience confused guessing and frightened the performances by wilson byrne shay and simpson are also good giving the audience people to care about the story is also engaging slowly unfolding in a subtle way that keeps our interest it is part amityville horror part poltergeist part exorcist and a few other horror gems the most stunning aspect is the imagery especially when crossing over into the spirit world it is not only frightening but downright disturbing yes it has a few flaws the explanation offered by elise seems too convenient and easy as if writers assumed the audience had to know what was going on instead of leaving us in the dark to figure it out for ourselves the surprise for the audience is also weak and is something that can be seen a mile away making up for these flaws is a disturbing terrifying movie that relies on suspense and fear instead of buckets of blood and guts in the end i was exhausted by fear and it took almost an hour after movies end for the terror to fade this is one of the few times a horror movie has infused a fear into my soul i would rank this as one of the most terrifying movies i have ever seen,astonish
i felt compelled to write a review about this film having just watched it there is a lot of hype and praise regarding the two films that they are the scariest films in years next to the exorcist let me assure you that is not the case the concept of the story was recycled heavily as were its scares i found myself bored to tears waiting for it to get better but it actually got worse as it went along poor acting poor characters and dont get me started on the ghosts the art department should be especially proud for incorporating a ghostlike darth maul into the film im actually angry that this film is getting so much hype and praise how this piece of garbage can be compared to a classic like the exorcist is beyond me so i will do the right thing and say thisdont watch just watch the exorcist instead and if you have already seen the exorcist watch it again,astonish
 catch it  a  ever since i saw first trailer of i knew there was something special about it then after its release slowly and gradually it got the critical acclaim and became one of the most successful movies of the year cost on 15 million and it has so far earned over 76 million which is a great achievement finally i got the chance to watch all alone in a dark room wow it literally scared the sht out of me there were moments where i was holding my heart just so i can pass through those scary moments the best thing about is it deals with a new supernatural element astral travelers which rarely we see in supernaturalhorror movies the director made a great choice to cast patrick wilson  rose byrne as grieving parents whose son falls into astral projection state both wilson and byrne are famous in indie circle but not on the international level which makes us really easy to relate to them plus both have proved their talent in various movies ty simpkins as dolton was adorable and impressive after his innocent face on the poster sold out the movie perfectly besides the lead stars the supporting cast barbara hershey lin shaye angus sampson and leigh whannell did an amazing job in lots of contribution goes to makeup artist  set designer who created the horror with minimal special effects brilliant overall to have complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room itll scare the hell out of you,astonish
the first act of while not breaking any new ground offered several genuine scary moments that is until morphed into a ridiculous missmash of bad filmmaking the climax was so badly conceived and executed i was begging for it to end who are the people giving this movie good marks i am perplexed maybe young teeny boppers it is very sad that dreck like this makes money a good marketing campaign and cool billboards seem to have made this a financial success even worsethey are making a sequel indeed there is no accounting for taste,astonish
first things first i thought this was one of the better scary movies i have ever seen well made and as creepy as i would imagine a movie could be wo being exploitative in some fashion however i was shocked when i left the movie w my three friends all of which loved the movie and like myself have seen thousands of horror flicks i heard a meatheadish guy behind me being like dude that didnt scare me at all i thought it was funnythis reminded me of a few of my other friends that always laughed during scary movies  i was never annoyed by this until i noticed that they laughed harder during movies that i thought were scarier than the average horror flick eg exorcist the shining etc upon further research i feel quite confident that this type of reaction is disingenuous and apparently quite prevalent psychologists have examined it for years many people when scared are able to disassociate from the traumatic situation w laughter this is how they minimize the extent to which they are scaredthat being said w people like this out there and likely critics too i would imagine it is a very tough battle trying to outdo horror classics not only are there these disassociate types but people are generally more desensitized overall so you are trying to scare an audience that isnt as easily scaredmy point is this  this movie was very well made and very scarycreepy despite some of the comments to the contrary  im sure there is merit to some of the criticisms about the acting and such but i believe very strongly that this movie will eventually get the credit it deserves,astonish
i saw this movie because id seen a lot of reviews that said it was great and pretty scary it is neitherthe acting was alright that is about it for the good pointsthe demon or whatever it is looks like darth maul with a big nose it looks silly the ghosts or whatever they are are all annoying and not original i was waiting for a guy with a mustache holding his head under his arm to come strolling along at any momentthe part where it turns really bad is when they start talking about the astral projection that could have been a good interesting twist but it just ended up being sillywhen the psychic woman gets the guy to draw pictures for her it seemed pointless why does she need him to do that what is the point why does she need him to write down what she says too what is with the sandman mask why cant she just talk normally too many things in there just for the sake of trying to make it spookythis movie is like a really bad freddys nightmares episode,astonish
okay first of all i was expecting to be scared out of my wits the beginning left me wanting to leave the theater because the music was so loud and creepy especially because i was at a matine and no one was there except me the movie drags for so long some scenes feel like paranormal activity realistic and boring just waiting for the good parts i felt as if i was in a cheap haunted house during halloween i thought the point of this movie was for the child to be evil and do crazy stuff but that only happens occasionally and he is completely zombiefied i wouldve given this movie 1 star but there were some scenes i particularly liked for instance the scene of the insane family in the further towards the end and the scene where the little boys tormentor is up in his crazy room with his machines and clocks the plot of the story is plain boring the lines were so dreadful and the actors i just felt like punching in the face especially the father the only decent and interesting character was the old women who came to help and the other little brother everyone else seemed tired and uninterested almost as much as i was i was falling asleep and forcing myself to watch until the last 20 minutes came in after that the mood i got from it was bad this movie is so cheesy and i had no trouble sleeping if you want to watch something scary just pop in the exorcist,astonish
i went to see this movie with a few of my friends today it was a waste of time and seven bucks i went into this movie without really being certain of how i felt about it usually i go into a movie thinking it will be good or that it will suck but honestly when i walked into that theater i had no idea what the movie was about or what it would be like other than an it looks scary from some preppy chick in my geography class i will tell you this right now it was not scary at allthe movie started with its title being thrown obnoxiously at the screen with psycholike music playing in the background it was annoying and loud and unnecessary the fact that they continued to do it throughout the movie rather frequently only agitated me morethe movie was predictable and relied mostly on things suddenly jumping out accompanied by humongous banging noises to scare you however as soon as you got over the initial shock and saw how ridiculously bad the monster or whatever you were looking at was you started bursting out laughing im not even kidding the entire theater was laughing most of the timeof course was not meant to be a comedy and the worst part is that they continued to try to keep it serious despite how ridiculous it was the parts where they attempted to develop the plot were boring and i spent most of the movie just dying to get out of the theater it would have been better off if they had originally intended it to be a comedy or you know a parody of poltergeist considering the plots were pretty similarim really not sure how this movie managed to get the rating it has on here considering it was simply ridiculous im also not sure how anyone managed to find it scary either considering the entire theater was laughing throughout the duration of the movie last time i checked laughter meant something was funny not scary,astonish
comes from two of my alltime favourite filmmakers james wan and leigh whannell nevermind the fact that this film is on a 1 million budget and the cast is filled with no big names this movie will blow your mindkeep this all in mind as you watch this horror masterpiece it takes you on an intense ride that will have you squirming in your seat it is probably going to be the best horror film of 2011 and one of the top ten of the year as well its just so damn goodit starts off showing a family unpacking boxes in their new home when strange things start happening making me think of the haunting in the connecticut it quickly dives into depression as the son dalton falls into what the doctors deem as a comabut not really but the strange things dont stop but instead grow more intense even when the family changes environments by moving to another house the family is plagued with the spirits in the houseit doesnt follow the same setuppayoff format as paranormal activity and nor does it follow the disturbing nature of dead silence instead it combines these two elements to give us the psychological aspect but while also giving us jump scenesi lept from my seat at one point because this movie is scary it doesnt have any bloody scenes but it is not necessary here it doesnt have any of those scenes like paranormal activity but instead makes its own scare scenes using lighting and effects it is truly a freaky film by most of what happens in the the second half of the movieperhaps the creepiest thing in the movie is the song that is sung by tiny tim it occurs briefly twice in the movie but both times send some serious shivers down your spine it chills me and although this movie freaked me out more than any movie has i would love to see it again seriously folks if you havent yet seen and want a good scare and want a good film to see for the early 2011 go see it,astonish
a movie of its own genre is like 2 movies in one the first half is a introduction to the family then the scary stuff starts their experiences start as they move into a new house it starts out as little experiences like books moving doors opening etc then the son dalton falls off a ladder in the attic and goes into a so called acomma now the events really start escalating figures are being seen the house alarms are going off and then a bloody hand print on daltons bed the family finally has had enough and moves again but as the ghostly encounters continue to happen at the new house they decide to call in a psychic and her 2 goof ball assistants this is when the second movie starts the psychic tells the parents that dalton is in some other dimension called the further she also tells the parents about the fathers past experiences with a different witch like demon only seen in photos taken of the father the father then goes into the further to save dalton before a demon possesses him  there he meets many strange demons including the one that haunted him in his childhood finally he finds dalton all chained up and somehow he magically gets the chains off but now he has to escape daltons demon or darth maul you could call him but for some reason the demon is extremely weak and they get away from him easily as they get back to the house the father comes face to face with the witch demon he just tells her to go away and she does or so we think the father and son get back into their bodies and regain consciousness as the family is celebrating the return of dalton the father and psychic are talking for some reason she takes a photo of him and instead of seeing the father we see the witch demon that haunted him as a kid he then strangles her to death the last scene of the movie we see the mom who finds the psychic dead she finds the picture and finds out her husband is now a demon she then confronts her husband and the movie ends,astonish
just before paying for my ticket to see i heard a scream come from the woman at the ticket booth she screamed pretty loud looking up to see what happened i noticed someone scared her from behind as i paid for my ticket i told the woman i hope i scream like that when i see this movie of course she laughedi cant say that i screamed during but some people in the audience did i must admit i jumped a few times with help from a rather loud audio when the jump scare happens there are even suspenseful moments to get your heart racing for the first half of the movie i knew i was in for something greatnotice i said the first half of the moviewhen the movie begins it reminded me of one of those old 1970s horror films with a scary sight large words of the title appearing on screen and the classic shrills from the violin as if to say boo at this point i felt the film was trying too hard but i was giving it a chance since it just startedthen we are introduced to the family moving in enter josh and renai patrick wilson and rose byrnes who have two boys and a baby girl they just moved into a creepy looking house that looks right at home in amityville and like paranormal activity strange things happen at night things take a turn for the worse when their son dalton falls into a coma and the doctors have no idea why for three months they keep him on oxygen and the other boy claims he walks at night this is where they get strange visits from ghosts and the situation gets so bad they did something the couple in the first paranormal activity should have done move but then things get worse to the point where they call in a paranormal investigation team it is there they discover whats really going on and why darth maul is running around in their houseas i said before the first half was great the second half gets so outlandish and weird though still implementing some good ideas that it took me out of the movie even still it was like the film lost sight of their main characters in the first half of the film we see renai is struggling to become a musician while josh is teaching in school but as the film goes on it just seems like the two of them are just going through the motions losing track of those plot points and just focusing on the entities and that stupid story they are trying to tell also besides the use of the baby monitor i didnt get why the baby was needed in the film it didnt help with the plot device only to serve for a couple of scares this may be a result of some lazy writing and the film itself could just be going through the motionsone last criticism that needs to be addressed and i know i am not the first one to point this out darth maul i cant help but to think that the main ghost thats causing all of this looks suspiciously like darth maul i was waiting for the double lightsaber to come out this isnt something i should be thinking about when im watching a horror filmis a hit and miss its an enjoyable experience but it will only be enjoyable one time it wont have the lasting appeal as some of the better horror films out there if anyone is thinking of going to see this one by all means go see it it definitely has its moments unfortunately those moments are a one scare wonder,astonish
should have been titled hey look at that thing in the background or loud music when you least expect it i dont understand how these kinds of movies keep getting advertised as terrifying or how audiences find this and similar films the conjuring paranormal activity etc frighteninganother ghostdemonspiritentitymonstershadowman in a mask haunting another family in another house with creaking doors strange noises people in places they shouldnt be opened windows lights going out specialists being called in specialists being scared out of their minds a history of something malevolent in the main characters past a handful of jump scares as things pass by the screen and ultimately another lessthansatisfying scary movie how do actors keep a straight face when making a movie so silly chances are youll jump a few times but thats because the filmmakers lure you in with the quiet and then throw a loud noise at you with a scary face attached dont waste your time with this one,astonish
i rented by believing all of the hype i heard stating how scary the movie was in short this movie disappoints on so many levelsfirst there is not a real impending sense of danger in most of the movie the filmmaker seems to think that doors opening on their own and faces popping into the window is enough to scare yousecond they kept the father in the movie a skeptic for too long and played along the basic horror clichsthird they essentially ripped off both a nightmare on elm street and poltergeist seriously they even had lin shaye who played a teacher in a nightmare on elm street in this movie i have nothing against lin shaye and admittedly she is the bright spot of this bore festfourth they tried to add humor too late in the movie if they would have maybe put more humor in the not scary silent believe me there are times where nothing is happening at all parts of the film maybe it would have been betterfifth there a character that just completely disappears in the movie now this is not a spoiler or anything one of the children of the main characters is not seen again at about half way through film granted he was very important to the story but he is noticeably goneif you are easily scared by ghost children jumping out of closets or people seemingly in danger but perfectly fine a minute later or if you like the blair witch project or paranormal activity then this movie is for you but if you desire a little more meat on the bones of your horror film then definitely choose something elseand of course there will be a sequel only time will tell if it is as bad as this onei rented this movie for 99 cents and let me tell you what i want my money backnow if you do like the movie please dont attack me for this is merely my opinion on the film,astonish
the scariest movie that some have ever seen well i think i must have watched a different movie i truly laughed out loud at so many moments here that id almost have to describe it as a comedy the ghostly figures are about as scary as the painted zombies in michael jacksons thriller video yeah that scary and the main scary creature who is the spitting image of darth maul is so unscary i really was in fits of laughter i wish someone could tell me which bits were so frightening the whole thing looks like some cheap made for tv movie and is such a let down from james wan i havent read up on how much it cost to make but it really seems as if all expenses were spared this thing wouldnt scare a child i was so disappointed and let down after reading the other reviews here dire,astonish
lets get rid of the nonactor type actors who seemed so natural and get people who overact was sorry to see patrick wilsons performance in this but oh well he certainly can be pitch perfect in something moretheatrical something better his best moment in this spectacular is applying metrosexual eyecream lets get rid of lo tech scares that are actually somewhat creepy and use ridiculously cheesy cgi shirt oh and lets not forget lets have this couple be a one person working only as a school teacher but they dress all high fashion and their house is chockablock with antiques when will we stop seeing ordinary people dressed like supermodels i mean even models dont dress as well as studly pw who never looked an inch less than sharp earth to hollywood men who teach grammar school dont shop at barneysin spite of the fact that theres nothing to spoil i now issue aspoiler warningwhen babs hershey sees that silly face appear in the black on black painting peeping its head out to go boo  good lord i was thinking maybe its time to see what else is in the multiplex today and fired up my phone when the ghostbusters showed up with their comic relief i said to myself with a british accent and all right time to check in on hanna and source code cheers everybodycause this movie was making scary sucking sounds and horrible sucking images and it was time to leave for shoe,astonish
is directed by james wan and written by leigh whannell it stars patrick wilson rose byrne ty simpkins barbara hershey lin shaye andrew astor and leigh whannell music is scored by joseph bishara and cinematography by john r leonettithe team behind saw and dead silence bring us one of the finest exponents of the haunted house movie in the modern era of course that doesnt count for much with those not particularly struck by the formula but does seem to be one of the very few horror subgenre movies to come out with better than average appraisalsof course its not perfect few films especially in horror world can stand up and come through unscathed by critics and fans alike yet for the like minded adults who can set the mood and channel themselves into the boo jump and creepy atmosphere world wrung out by wan and whannell then is the bombmuch has been made of the shift in the last third where the film brings in astral projection as its reasoning for the pant soiling previously unleashed undeniably the film runs away with itself goes too far and the last 15 minutes are a chaotic mess of bold ideas and inadequate staging however its interesting to note how often the haunted house movie in recent times gets accused of not bringing something new to the table something thrown at the wonderful woman in black that followed down the pipe here the makers offer up something different true it hasnt worked in the way they or the hardened genre fans would have liked but personally i found on second viewing it is easily forgivable its like riding your favourite big dipper you enjoy the spins and upside down scream moments but just tolerate the flat standard drive stretches of track while your heart tries to steady its beatwhen is hitting its heights its utterly thrilling and unnerving paced to perfection it builds from whispered voices on a baby monitor to entities invading the home of the poor lambert family the mystery element is strong just what do they want why is son dalton in a coma but the medical boffins have no idea why how come the entities have followed the lamberts even when they move house the latter of which is refreshing to see in the screenplay its a logical move but so often its not done in other horror movies the jumps are nicely placed throughout and a number of scenes are so freaky they get under your skin and stay there for some time seriously i dont think ill ever be able to listen to tiptoe through the tulips again without my blood being chilled the use of photographs and mirrors bring the goose flesh to the skin while lin shayes arrival as the paranormal physic and the subsequent use of a gas mask keep things ticking on the freaky deaky scaleit borrows ideas and takes its tonal cues from other horror movies definitely and the second half doesnt live up to the promise of the first hell ill even concede that a certain entity is badly designed but does have something new to offer the formula its also well performed by the cast that itself is a rarity it hasnt resonated with all but it was a monster hit at the box office making nearly 85 million in profit the market for a good haunted house spooker is always open in spite of its second half irks sits in the top draw with the best of them 810,astonish
one of the best horror thriller horror horror breathtaking breathtaking thriller movie with perfect sound tracks matched with sudden ghost appearancesthe creators of saw and paranormal activity have joined forces on this silly horror  which is good for a handful of jumps and guilty giggles before it quickly reaches for the slipshod hokey contrivances you dont expect until number 2 or 3 in the franchiseyou have to pity poor patrick wilson and rose byrne playing the parents of a young family they must keep straight serious actor faces while trapped in a haunted house movie rejiggered into a possessed kid movie when their son falls into a coma  his soul trapped in a nether realm cue a cast of undead tortured souls creepy twins an old lady veiled in grannynet curtains a demon luridly covered in black and red face paint like a juggler on ketamine at a rave most preposterous and unterrifying of the lot perhaps aware that they have a largely scarefree experience on their hands the filmmakers insert a comedy sideshow a psychic who is more avon lady than exorcist accompanied by two geeky assistants,astonish
i love finding a 1010 film for me especially when you least expect it i also love a good horror flick horror is probably my favourite genre so i definitely go out of my way when im in the city to see the newest horror flicks and am i ever glad i caught because it turned out to be one of the best supernatural thrillers i have seen in a very very long time possibly ever amazing suspenseful well acted terrific twists and turns emotional story and just all out really creepy because im such a big horror fan it takes an awful lot to creep me out and got under my skin in all the right ways one imdb reviewer who also loved the film said he felt like a kid watching the exorcist again and that is exactly dead on the money this film could easily stand up next to the exorcist and holds its own in any ghost story genre making paranormal activity look like childs play gripping and terrifying dont even seem to be strong enough words for the film it mixes together the haunted house factor with demons exorcisms the imagery of hell and a twist to the story which is never easy to pull off that will really make you even more terrifiedas far as im concerned this is the performance of patrick wilsons career he is terrific as the doting father who begins to unravel the mystery about his son and about his own past he has an intensity and a down to earth quality that will make you relate to him rose byrne plays wilsons wife and the mother of the young man haunted by this being byrne gives an intense and worthy performance and her and wilson have terrific chemistry and together they will make you riveted to the screen for the entire story youngster ty simpkins is anything but a newcomer he has had multiple roles in his young life and this proves he has the acting chops to continue his performance in this film is well beyond his years and he gives a stirring and disturbing performance on par with linda blaires exorcist performance lin shaye might be the one small stone in the shoe of this movie her character is vital and could be a truly terrific part and she does okay and her and wilson have good chemistry opposite each other but there are times when i feel like shaye is giving a bit of a campy performance and doesnt live up the rest of the impressive cast still she gives a valid performance and an important charactersaw patriarchs james wan leigh whannell write and direct the film and its no secret that these two guys work so well together and they know horror better than just about anyone else i mean granted the saw series is blood soaked and is more of a psychological disturbing film but both have great stories and has their fingerprints all over it its worth mentioning the great easter egg in the scene where patrick wilson is teaching his class and leigh whannells name is on the blackboard below a picture of the saw clown with an 8 underneath it either just a clever easter egg or a sign of another saw instalment however makes the entire saw series looking boring and contrived because this film is truly brilliant fun twisted disturbing and an absolute must see for horrorthriller fans go see it now 1010,astonish
the savvy viewer coming into this should know that he will have to struggle with some cheap devices overexplaining of the haunting situation with twaddle about the further and astral projection mumbo jumbo technology that permits us to see the spectra a bevy of jump scares some well orchestrated others notbut the notions are as good as they always were as far back as the innocents haunted rooms mapping to haunted minds how inside disturbance manifests around usi only wish that a better filmmaker than james wan wouldve tackled the project to deliver a more potent vision of a jungian subconscious there is a little of the exorcist centered around a seance and a little of fire walk with me inside of this  i wouldve liked more of the latterin other words when strange figures stand or creep the movie is all that youve heard when they lunge at us or walk on walls the effect is dilutedwhat we get is good enough though if we deliberately work to discard the cheapening then were left with a few arresting atmospheres to keep the house as playground of malevolent presence an empty ceiling by broad light the house again reversed by a mirror,astonish
seriously dont waste your time on this movie its not scary its not even laughably bad its boring and it was painful making myself actually sit through the whole thing theres nothing in this movie to try and scare you except ridiculously loud shock music in other words the loudness makes you jump not the content what did make me laugh however was lin shayes appearance as elise rainier the psychic slash expert on the further all i could think of when i saw her was her role as the landlady in king pin ughi did not enjoy this movie at all i watched it because the review on imdb was high compared to most psychological thrillers but i now know better than to trust user reviews i remember the same thing happened when snakes on a plane came out the initial score was above 90 if you can believe it tragic,astonish
this is the first movie that made me come here on imdb and write a review so better read it if this movie was scary as people are writing here then shawshank redemption was awful you do the math to sum it all up the movie was  bad bad bad funny almost the good part funny bad bad the end i do not find it very amazing if horror movies are mixed with humor it just does not work this movie could have been very very good if christopher nolan director of inception would have made it but if you check the budgets  inception was 160 000 000 and 1 500 000 i would say that is where the problem came from if you watch this movie you will get exactly as much as you paid for or how much the makers of the movie paid for give this script to cristopher nolan and he will make this movie watchable i am just amazed that people are here giving it 10 points and saying how scary it was i was literally scared for only 0 or 1 seconds throughout the movie the best way to sum this movie is this  imagine inception done with a budget of 1 500 000 would you go watch it me neither what ever anyone says this movie is not worth 74 here in imdb absolutely ridiculous yes people have different taste but you cant really argue this was awful ,astonish
i really wanted to like this my sister had seen it a year ago and said it was too twisted and scary and that i shouldnt watch it so i didnt but it kind of made me want to watch it more so i watched it with really high expectations all i can say is the movie was terrible the only scares were jump scares which dont count because thats being startled not scared the demon was hilarious when i first saw it i thought of darth maul terrible cgi when he walks on the wall the movie was only an hour and 45 minutes but it felt longer than that because i wanted it to end i left a poor review on here a while back about the film sinister and i actually think that movie was better than oh well guess they cant all be winners,astonish
distant voicesnoiseswhizzes flashing lights music from the past ghost busting and exorcism those who think the above mentioned are hairraising should have their mindnerves checked and cured it would be another story in case of a wrongdoer a criminal or an alien a vampire  at least in the era of digital effects ghosts and devils may be catchy to watch but in fact they are unable to terminate someones life that is why i prefer physical evil as  in the event of well written and directed movies  it is hard to predict the course of events and ending eg se7en silence of the lambs the cast is also just above average nothing special the ending has a twist but nevertheless i cannot comprehend the movies popularity and i can hardly recommend this movie to anyone i know if you must see a similar movie then pick the others or rosemarys baby,astonish
i had heard that was terrifying so i was really looking forward to watching it i scare very easily ive watched films in the past where i have found it difficult to sleep afterwardsthis is what you want a horror film to do make you think once youve left the cinema or check behind you when you are walking up the stairs to bed did non of these thingsthe film starts like a lot of other horror movies slowly which is fine because you suspect they are building up the suspense actually what they are doing is lulling you into a false sense of security and preparing you for the biggest load of crap you will ever watchi think my main issue with this film is that it just isnt scary at all the music is laughable im sorry but no matter how many times you play really loud violins at me im not going to jump the main demon looks like darth maul crossed with a goat crossed with a snake  in fact it look like a dude with loads of makeup on and false hooves again not scary but quite funny the ghosts which make an appearance throughout the film are stupid a little boy 2 weird women who smile and a guy who looks like he should be in a budget vampire film  seriously and the concept of the further is more scifi than horror and since when has scifi been fear inducing plus the ending was predictable which never helps overall is not just a crappy horror film its a crappy film overall,astonish
what do you get when you mix the exorcist poltergeist dreamscape the entity saw and ghostbusters you get one of the most ironically titled movies ever every single one of the movies listed above was referenced in one way or another the most annoying being the sudden camera shaking and bounce around type edits from the saw films there nothing original let alone scary about this uneven silly horror moviejust a few questions about the plotwhat happened to the two other children in the final act i ask this because if the baby was staying with the mother why was the baby monitor still in the roomthe family just moved into a house and was able to sell it and rent another one almost immediately come onhow is it that elise the psychic was unable to tell that the old woman came back with joshtotal waste of an hour and 45 minutes,astonish
how many horror movies are actually scary three maybe four make that five just made the listjames wans is unusual in every sense of the word its a 100minute thrill ride that is a homage to countless horror movies including poltergeist and the shining and often enough succeeds in bringing the scares terrifying and entertaining threatens its viewer with an insulting amount of jump scares however it does not matter when the result is this good popcorn entertainment may not be this fun again for a whileplot may sound contrived and thats because it is leigh whanells original script borrows a lot of previous horror greats renai rose byrne and josh lambert patrick wilson are a married couple with three children that have just moved into a new house yet not everything is perfect the protagonists marriage is tense and cold and theres something deeply unsettling about their home it isnt long before one of their sons dalton falls from a ladder while he is investigating a noise in the attic and becomes comatose the house isnt done with the lamberts yet and the filmmakers arent done with us eitherwan shows a clear sense of maturity with that is to say that he has stepped it up from the bloody albeit twisty saw and the boring dead silence alludes to past horror masterpieces frequently and after all isnt copying the sincerest form of flattery wan uses all this to his advantagebecomes creaky slow carnival ride that never lets up wan has clearly learned from the masters now hes just showing offas if atmospheric tone wasnt enough wan has made a textbook example of horror done right lighting is used to create intrigue and mystery the camera whirls and shakes to give the film an unsettling dissonance often verges on corny but this is all with good intent violins certainly hit the high notes to give the viewer chillsbut is far from perfect in fact wans film is still marred by many flaws notably a tonal change about halfway through that nearly wrecks any momentum gained in the quiet first act it also seems that every two minutes there is a jump scene this is a something that works at first but by the end of it it gets to be a bit much and while there is some much needed comic relief in some of the scariest parts it doesnt quite hang together when jokes are made furthermore some elements of the plot are nonsensical yet all this can be missed when disbelief is suspendedin 2009 paranormal activity was hailed as one of the scariest movies ever its time for to get the recognition it deserves may not be everyones type of horror movie but its an intelligent scary and wellmade film designed for people who actually care about watching movies although may take itself way too seriously its hard to ignore a film that is so intensely scary as this theres one scene where lorraine played by barbra hershey says i had a dream last night i was in the house i was very afraid arent we all darling,astonish
this movie has restored my hope in the horror genre it does just about everything right one thing that particularly impressed me is the fact that they managed to keep it scary while revealing what was haunting them this movie mixes both terrifying visuals and a haunting story to create a oldstyle yet unique horror experience as for comedy it does have a little bit at the very right moments to act as comic relief and one scene is quirky yet unsettling at the same time isnt like any other modern horror movie it take queues from the classics while mixing in a modern feel and is a very good combination of the two also the acting is superb watch this movie if you are a fan of horror,astonish
ive been looking for reviews on here and was surprised at how split the opinions are people either seem to love it or hate it for one thing when you combine the people from saw and paranormal activity you are likely to have an audience that does not overlap i personally only really liked the first saw and i love both pas i felt that saw 2 became more like final destination where each sequel only seemed to push boundaries and create gruesome situations instead of providing a solid plot line therefore i feel that may be part of the rift between opinionsthat said ill share mine i was very surprised with this movie like many other people said i thought it would be the type where you could predict everything and always be ready for whats coming im not a screamer and only really cringe at detailed gore but this movie kept me uneasy until the end there are moments of comic relief where you can relax momentarily but not for longi feel thats worth mentioning many people complain that it tries to be too funny at times or over the top from the title card it gave me the feeling of a dario argento flick more like his older ones such as suspiria i personally find that refreshing but what i really want to say is that i think this movie includes these moments to show that its not taking itself too seriously not to say it is not scary but i think it acknowledges that its a bit humorous and eccentric at times to me the eccentricity of some of the characters in the movie while some may call it cheesy adds a dose of madness a character like michael myers or jason vorhees are straight up scary but a character like freddy krueger is more eccentric and maniacal not to say characters in this movie are like freddy but insofar as that freddy is eccentrically scary his madness is what makes him so scary and i feel characters in this movies possess that same quality i feel it might be fair to compare them to the style of the characters from thir13een ghosts as welli feel like this movie took a unique idea and executed it well there were some parts i wasnt sure they could pull off but i have to say especially near the end i feel they pulled it off there were parts that probably could have been progressed further or deeper but its not to the point that it ruins the movie for me i also think the ending has a classic argento feeling to it and contributes to what i said about it not taking itself too seriously if youre going to like this movie youll likely still be creeped out at the endi really liked this movie you may or may not it depends on what you are willing to accept and what you consider to be scary i especially am not impressed with movies that overgore just to show off their great effects so for this movie being a pg13 i feel it managed a very high creepfactor without unnecessary gorelastly a bit of advice if youre the type that lingers after the credits,astonish
im an oldschool horror guy and a tough critic for a pg13 movies you really get youre moneys worth those with a deep imagination will be awed and spooked when the film started i was instantly impressed with the title sequence and the creepy fiddle music the film starts a little slow appearing keywordto be youre modern clich ghostsuspense film it takes a dramatic turn into a demonic science fiction the film has some truly interesting and terrifying avantgarde displays of demonic and supernatural entities i felt like some scenes even transcended the movie the best part is the ending is not fluffy and bublegumy people die they do not live happily ever after evil overcomes good muahah m very pleased with the film and was worth the money i spent for it definitely would recommend,astonish
i loved every moment of since the beginning of the credits i usually avoid horror movies in the mainstream because its all cheap thrills too much gore not enough gore clich or predictable right from the moment the title appeared before my eyes i knew i was in for itnot since the reaping has a horror movie made me scared to sit on the edge of my seat i kept finding myself praying that things wouldnt jump out at me and i even spilled a little bit of my slushy on myself from jumping as the movie went on i was sinking lower and lower in my seat the day after i was ushering at the movie theater i worked at i go in to clean the theater was in and my walkietalkie began to make funky noises like the baby monitor in the movie was i grabbed my broom and bucket and ran for it from now on i have to turn on the lights to clean instead of the dim theater lighting this one is going my top ten for the year,astonish
full disclosure this is not an objective review on the third of every month i sacrifice a bullock without blemish to patrick wilson that said i would have liked this movie no matter who was had the lead roles it is genuinely scary and uses horror conventions with skill toward an ending that is both entertaining and unsettling the humorous scenes are genuinely funny i loved the way the movie turned tiptoe through the tulips into a counterpart to schuberts erlking the acting from both the leads and the character actors is excellent especially the elderly exorcist wilson gives a selfless rigorously characterbased performance and byrne is moving as the griefstricken mother shows how our mood and sensibility has changed since poltergeist was on the screen,astonish
okay this movie was simply incredible it was brilliant in fact for all of you horror flick lovers who have been waiting along time for a good horror film here it is at last this film was not only scary it had a little humor as well but not too much the music and intro was raw instruments it reminded me of horror films back in the day i cant explain how awesome this film was you jump throughout the whole movie and youre not sitting there like whats going to happen or when are we gonna see it the whole stinking thing and then everything scary is crammed in the endingdont listen to the bad reviews they are nuts go see this film for yourself please,astonish
as it has always been here and there come along the stars of the genre that fixate amongst orbiting imitations and makeabuckers with we see magic spiritualism and its eerie intrigue of supernatrual tricks and mind games the ghosts of are evil in their playfulness as they scream to be heard seen and felt whether on screen or not for those really bored with searing hackmeups and unable to groove with the documentary or video journal styles of some contemporaries we have a stylish film that breathes with its seemingly dead ancestors of the last century such as poltergeist the entity the changeling rosemarys baby and of course the exorcist in some of the scoring and shots i even felt a few flares of the original black christmas this is cinema that feeds on the imagination of what ifs and wouldnt it be fd up if that happened the sweetness of a creepy ghost tale that makes you smile at its clever inventionsthe story follows through with a mixture of conventions and reversals of them topping dashes of original ideas unique to this film some fantastic lighting and gothic images invading a victorian home with a modern family running for normalcy as dark forces culminate and mount against them hunger for the living and life dominates their hunger as they lurk and wait watchingid say give this one a shot and open your mind and imagination that is hopefully not dead yet,astonish
have you ever been so horrified that you cried tears of fear have you ever seen a film so creepy you cant stop shaking for hours this is one such film many have lauded the cinematography and i must give praise as wellthe concept not too out of the ordinary however it has a much more concrete twist if you will about itto me not only were the images immensely disturbing and frightening the whole idea of what was happening did me in the mostwhen people think of haunted houses and ghost it is fuzzy beyond us this film eerily made the concept of apparitions plausible almost scientificallylisten to what is said carefully and think about especially when it comes to the how and whysee this film please do not see it if you have health issues im healthy and usually am like a typical man and dont get scared easily except for psychological films like event horizonthis movie made me scream out loud in panic,astonish
i was pleasantly surprised throughout most of this movie basically surprised at all the jumps and screams from the audience and the ones coming from myself as well i thought this film was an extremely fun scary movie to watch if you like scary thrills and jumping out of your seat then this movie is for you i give it ten stars because i thought it had a good plot with many surprises and twists it is definitely not just your average gory slasher film that is hard to find these days it had substance as well as scare and i think it would be great to watch a few more times and i probably could still not see the scary parts coming,astonish
from the guys of saw the original masterpiece not the 6 other movies it comes this movie with its title which can be meaning also as maliciousthe beginning is one of the best scene i have seen in a lot of time in one movie the story is kinda simple a kid in comma is being haunted by some evil spirits and his parents are trying to prevent that to happen without get in spoilers the ending is as well as good like the beginthe story is good the acting has his good parts with a patrick wilsonwatchmen hard candy sometimes inspired a rose byrne mixed up 28 weeks later knowing and a ty simpkins scary the dialog fail in some parts but sustains the movie in a good way for being a movie of the guys of saw is surprising that there is no blood and gutsin average is a scary movie that gives sometimes some good scaresfor a pg13 movie,astonish
this film had such a fresh premise and could have been right up there with the exorcist but its overshadowed at times by a ridiculously over the top soundtrack and some corny moments that were almost laughable which is too bad but its still worth checking outspoiler alert there are some weak plot holes like the other kids pretty much disappearing for the second half of the film with only a quick mention of there whereabouts or not really explaining why the psychic needed a gas mask to communicate with the comatose boy nevertheless it was still one of the better horror films ive seen in awhile because the basic idea that drives the plot was rather interesting it explores not just the idea that we leave our bodies when we dream but that evil could take advantage and try to possess you for that i have to give the writers credit for being truly original although you might call this a dark twist on poltergeist,astonish
once upon a time there were scary movies the problem was they could not scare me i tried everything watching all sorts of movies from classic horror to gory torture but nothing worked that is until i saw for those of you who know horror you will see how inspired this film really is this is a true horror film that uses suspense and plot to lock the movie goer in i appreciate that it was very well done and did not need to rely on gore and cheesy special effects to scare me this movie had it all weaving a plot that was original you may hear some critics saying it was basically a combination of a bunch of other movies but what movie isnt wan took a risk with talking about astral projection as the average person is not familiar with what this is however it worked perfectly for this movie and that is what sets it apart from the others you can tell that this movie was very well thought out this movie is suspenseful visually stunning terrifying and pulls at the strings of spirituality it is a classic masterpiece with a modern twist that will leave you begging for more this is the first horror movie that i have enjoyed watching in a long time thank you mr wan my hats off to you and for all you skeptics out there beware ,astonish
a pg13 that not only scared me but gave me hope for the horror movie genre i love horror movies ill watch anything from slasher to monster this one was like nothing i have ever seen i dont want to give away spoilers im just letting you know whatever you think this movies gonna be about its not beautifully shot good acting good direction great story scared the crap out of me and had an ending i have been praying for since i started watching horror films when i was a kid ill be honest paranormal activity scared me there is some paranormal activity moments in this movie that made me jump but thats not the whole point of the movie dont be thinking it is also its from the dude that directed the first saw there is not blood and guts galore either just a well thought out crazy awesome story that will have you leaving the theater feeling satisfied and ready to tell all of your friends and co workers to go out and see it,astonish
normally i review very good or really really bad movies this falls in the good category we have to admit that making an original movie is specially difficult there are too many common places and while this movie visits quite a few of them it introduces twists and surprises that takes you unpreparedthe initial scene only makes sense once you have watched the last one bringing the whole tale fullcircle the highpitch music delivered with the initial title and then repetition with the closing title have devastating effects on your nerves the depth of the title becomes more and more apparent as the final credits roll slowly you start thinking that was an b the execution of this film is superbthis is not to say that the movie is without flaws there are several lost opportunities and towards the end some of the carefully crafted eeriness dissolves but only for a moment this movie is a great piece that honors a crowded genre,astonish
some of my friends told me it was one of the scariest movie they ever saw after having seen it i am dumbfounded by what makes people scared and what not i also agree with the people saying it has a lot of poltergeist rip offs but also from the shining and i presume a lot of other horror movies the movie was very clich like girls always have to scream when they get scared the electricity always fail when evil is present small children run around as decoys  etc etc the acting becomes strained because of how strangely the characters react to different situations there was a lack of genuine response and emotions in certain situations take for example the scene where they boy has just been comatised the father coldly asks the doctor so what do we do should we stay here or what parents would even ask such a question no parent in their right mind traumatised or not would even think to ask that if they would have just focused on rose byrnes at least genuine felt feelings and he just stayed quiet that scene would have been okthis kind of non real reactions to situations just disturbed me throughout the movieeven tough i could have coped with this the movie all of a sudden went very theatrical meaning they showed way too much of faces wearing way too much paint acting way too theatrically it just killed the suspense making it more of an action movie than a horror moviethinking back on the movie i think there was too many logical errors if you can talk about logic when talking about paranormal happenings for example dead evile people are trying to get to the other side by using other bodies as vessels but still they can get through to the other side physically and attack people seemingly when it suits them so why the h do they need a vessel for why not take over the world anyways other scenes seemed just random adding no explanation to what was happeningthe use of string instruments for creating suspense is ok if used conservatively but in they were just overused to no end sometimes i felt like i was watching a black and white horror moviethere is only one twist in the movie and you will know where it is if i say that this twist occurs where all horror movies always have a twist i hope to god though there will not be an 2the cinematography worked although i felt the camera was sometimes too far away from what was happening where it should have been close to the actor the smokefog machine was used a little bit too much when it was used the camera angles where nonoriginal and mostly panned glided or zoomedwhat about the good stuff yes what about it for me i think the best scene in the movie was when one of the nerds in the psychic team went around the house taking camera snapshots with different colorfilters it reminded me somewhat of when playing the computer game fatal framei give this movie a 5 for cinematography a 2 for story and a 3 for acting in total a 3,astonish
is a collaboration between director james wan and screenwriter leigh whannell who are both mostly famous for being the creators of the saw saga which initiated the controversial torture porn subgenus some people might suppose that a new collaboration between wan and whannell will have the same ingredients of blood cruelty and violence which gave them such a fame 7 years ago however they attempted to do something completely different with and even though it might not be totally original i consider it to be an intense and very entertaining horror film which deserves a recommendation because of its tense direction solid performances and a retro atmosphere which evokes the cinema from the 70s without losing a contemporary identityif we omitted some details and the name from the characters a plot synopsis of could describe almost any haunted house film made since various decades ago in other words is an amalgam of images scenes and concepts taken from poltergeist both versions of the amityville horror both versions of house on haunted hill the uninvited and paranormal activity seasoned with an atmosphere of a domestic melancholy which reminded me of dont look now the changeling and other serious horror films from the 70s and early 80s and i could go on and on comparing to other movies and pointing out the similarities imitations and even tributes which bring the story to shape however that would be like describing a meal only mentioning the elements it contains fortunately is more than the sum of its parts thanks to its perfect direction well structured screenplay and the force from the performances which are solemn when they should and with the slightest humorous wink when they require so in order to make us accomplices of the horror in summary a dish composed by leftovers which conceals its lack of freshness with good tastes textures and shocks i think that this last one does not fit into the gastronomical analogyas any good ghost movie advances without any hurry gradually tightening the gears from the suspense until we feel paranoid with every sound or movement which comes from the screen and like in many of these stories there is also a personal drama which emphasizes the characters anguish when they face the unknown and notice that the world is much stranger and more threatening than they imagined rose byrne and patrick wilson credibly express their characters emotions and their reactions feel totally natural and lin shaye interprets a character which respects her not only as a veteran of the fantastic genre but also as a talented but unfortunately underrated actressof all the films i mentioned on the second paragraph poltergeist is the one closest in structure and subjects to however at the difference of that classic this time the special effects are reduced to the minimum with very few instances of digital tricks and a refreshing variety of effects obtained on camera or with traditional methods of makeup and edition that visual minimalism emphasizes the importance of the suspense and the atmosphere to cause terrorso it might not be a great film but i liked pretty much and i recommend it either if you are a fan of the horror genre or if you are a casual spectator who is bored of the hollow gore and digital ghosts we usually see nowadays in this genre,astonish
director james wan and writer leigh whannell have burst into our filmic consciousness having being responsible for saw that launched an enduring franchise created a new antihero and spawned a frenzy in the torture porn subgenre horror films are their forte though wan did branch off for a remake of death wish with death sentence before reteaming with whannell behind the camera to come up with one of the best jump in your seat horror offering in quite some timeits easy to pass this off as another quick hack out to earn an easy buck at the box office for instance the poster has this creepy child and creepy children have been staple in films such as the orphan the remake of the omen and countless others in recent years the opening credits scene is incredibly cheesy and cheap looking but it gets better trust me then theres the story about a haunted house a requisite in many many horror films but thats only the tip of the iceberg as wan and whannell intended to lull you in with complacency built up from ones horror film experience before shoving the motherload of scares right down your throateven the building of the premise may make you roll your eyes at the expectation that this may be just another paranormal activity since it tells of the lambert family with parents josn and renai patrick wilson and rose byrne respectively and their three children dalton ty simpkins playing wilsons kid again collaborating before in little children foster andrew astor and another toddler in arms who bawl at the slightest of disturbances in the house and there are plenty with the usual moving and slamming doors a very receptive baby monitor and documentary styled camera movements that reminisces that of paranormal activity 2 sans voyeuristic eyes from cctv and found footage you wont be faulted if you had suspicions that this film took a leaf from paranormal activity and combined it with your classic haunted house spooks but heres where whannell who also starred in this film as a paranormal geek alongside angus sampson upped the ante despite having to have the family move house and came up with a tale thats best kept under wraps to retain the surprises that come along the way although some may find fault with his rather geeky and detailed explanation through the medium elise lin shaye engaged by joshs mom lorraine barbara hershey that links up with joshs own repressed pastbut as far as scaring the audience goes scores top marks wan has a knack for designing his scary pieces with aplomb to jump scare even the most jaded of horror film goers and the best part is youre primed to expect something to happen and they do without too many time wasting red herrings wan gives what an audience will expect and does so without pulling his punches so much so that its somewhat of a thrill ride as we journey with the characters to make sense of whats happening the beauty comes from the simplicity of the ghoul design clichd some may be even and one red faced demon that looked very much like darth maul but they did their job in old school like fashion complete with a very in your face scratchy soundtrack that did half the job since this film would not have worked without joseph bisharas violincentric scorecosting only 15 million dollars to make and grossing over 50 million to date just goes to show how profitable horror films can be where theres no need for fancy graphical effects but reliance on simple practical ones to send chills up your spine if its a good scare in the cinemas youre after then serves that up by the bucketloads without insulting your intelligence stay right through to the end credits for one final hurrah highly recommended,astonish
the concept has been done to death the delivery hasnt ghost stories can end up being cheesy and cheep or they can be a frightening experience if directed with creativity and originality the film does contain some bone chilling scene and is effective in making sure it sticks at the back of your mind when you lay down in bedit not groundbreaking by any means but it sure trumps over films recently released in the genre unlike other ghost tales this film is quick off the mark and successfully pulls you inalso like many other ghost films the father will always be in a state of denial belittling the claims of their wifes or children agreed the father in this does seem more approachable and in fact becomes centre of the attention the first act effortlessly drags you in second act leaves you wanting more frights and the final act takes you a surreal journey which some may or may notoverall the film achieves its goal on delivering a chilling experience and making sure you dont forget it any time soon after viewing,astonish
minor spoilers i was expecting to like i heard how scary it was and after seeing many scary films that actually failed to scare me i was ready to be genuinely scared by and guess what i loved every minute of it right from the really creepy opening i knew i was in for a pretty creepy experience there are several sequences in this film that actually are genuinely scary and most of is down to james wans fantastic directing mr wan knows how to make something creepy he allows the audience to follow every bit of camera movement making every shock count there is something very unsettling about a camera sweeping through a hallway slowly its almost as if you are there and you know that something is going to come out to shock youthe acting is also very good for a horror film barbara hershey manages to impress again like in black swan only not quite as impressive as that and there were some characters there that we could all care aboutmy only complaint would be that the granny shouldve been the main demon villain i dont feel that there was any need for the red faced bloke he was no where near as terrifying as that granny i think that it confused the story and he ended up being a bit naffbut the final moments in are really tense edgeofyourseat stuff it turns out to be frightening fun and an excellent experience in the cinema i think the effect would unfortunately crisp on the small screen so i do feel its important to see this in the cinemawhat i really liked in was the fantastic music it was a throwback to those 70s80s ghosty films in the way drag me to hell did with its music it blew me away to hear it in the cinema and i got a chill whenever something popped up with that dissidentatonal music it is brilliantis an updated poultergeist its filled with genuinely scary creepy and terrifying moments there are some images in there that will scare the hell out of you if youre willing to go on with the storyline and accept all the supernatural farce then you will find yourself in for a fantastic ride,astonish
for once an original horror film from the usa comes and with no gore or cctv footage this turns out to be one of the most chilling haunted houseboy films to be released in a long long timedalton is a boy who can project himself out of his body when he is asleep the trouble is hes been doing it for so long that demons have noticed and want his physical formhe ends up in an inexplicable comatose state and the family thinking that the house is haunted move but there troubles follow the film doesnt rely on the performances of wilson and byrne although they are very good the film relies on all out scares and even though they are the sort that contain shrieking strings from the soundtrack and are predictable they are delivered here in drovesfrom the makers of saw you would expect gore but here there is none even though the billy puppet is featured in one scene there is no gore and this is another thing that is refreshing there is also a lot of humour in the film even though its serious throughout there will be laughs to hadthe film does borrow heavily from other films most notably the shining house bbcs ghostwatch the exorcist and signsthe first hour is pure mayhem and has to be one of the best times i have spent in a cinema with an audience but it goes a little ridiculous toward the end when wilson travels to the further this is where the comparisons to the 1985 classic house come inboth the main protagonists in these films have to go into another dimension to save a loved onebut these days who really cares about stuff like this when you are entertained for the duration of the film and not bored onceall in all its a great horror film filled with dread with a good ending and one things for sure youll never see darth maul in the same light again,astonish
normally there are very few horror movies that can really scare and manipulate my mind and if so i seem to get over it pretty quickly if you are like me and really think hollywoods horror category cannot scare the pants off you you need to see thisfrom the very beginning of the movie i was on the edge of my seat from then on couldnt eat my popcorn for the next hour and a bit i was petrifiedthe whole storyline was pretty standard horror but those guys really put all their work into making it more than the plot without the blood and gore which i completely expected from the director of saw it cut to the sheer terror that the idea of paranormal things can reach usit was an absolutely brilliant horror which still stays with me now the day after when opening my cupboards outstanding,astonish
when their young son is injured in a fall mysterious and terrifying events start to happen to a young familyhorror films especially recent films from america have become obsessed with violence and gore the socalled tortureporn horror there is also an obsession with remaking or rebooting films to try and make money from the horror film franchises like the recent nightmare on elm street however what proves is that by writing something clever and serious you can make a new and scary horror filmthe key to the success of is that on the whole the cast play it straight the cast led by patrick wilson and rose byrne are all good it helps that the script written by leigh whannell while in truth not the most original taking elements from films such as poltergeist it does enough with these elements to work on its on level it also helps having james wan directing although still best known for making the first and best saw film he has made some interesting films since death sentence being one and dead silence which has a similar feel to while wan may not be a high profile director he does an excellent job here he creates an atmosphere of tension throughout including some excellent scares in daylight a rare feat indeed and while he does use the jump scare technique it works very well even at the climax of the film which is a little predictable he stages a chilling endingthere are faults the ending does go a bit overboard loosening the tension created up till that point and a couple of paranormal investigators bring some unwanted comic reliefbut these are minor issues whannell and wan have created a truly unsettling horror film and one that pretty much succeeds on every level it takes a lot to scare me when i go see a film the only ones that can are those that create the right atmosphere most films dont manage that this does easily and it did scare methis is easily one of the best recent horror films ive seen and id recommend it to anyone who enjoys being scared,astonish
james wan the director of the cult classic saw returns to make what might be one of the greatest pg13 horror films ever made things may start off a bit slow but when things start to get rolling the scares dont stop until the very end youll be grabbing your arm chair and covering your mouth to avoid screaming the entire time let me just say that this review is coming from a very skeptical very antihorror film kind of guy i had low expectations for and was expecting to just laugh and make fun of the dumb characters on screen instead i was met with an intense and sometimes just downright scary thriller that had me at the edge of my seat to the very end i think what holds this entire movie together is the music it intensifies every situation and is what separates its self from other realistic horror movies like paranormal activity which for the sake of realism didnt have any the screeching violins and banging and clawing come together to make a reckless terrifying soundtrack that ensures that your scared even with your eyes closed another strength that has and most horror movies dont is great acting the entire cast although small makes this film very believable the main characters feel real so you care what happens to them most horror movies fail to make you care at all about any of the characters involved but youre able to connect with them in the script writing is good i can see some of the lines from this becoming remembered like the famous he doesnt want us to cut off our chains  he wants us to cut off our feet line from saw im not gonna spoil anything but the ending sort of let me down and left some questioned unanswered other then that i enjoyed the script and every development within the filmthe bottom line is has everything you could possibly want from a pg13 horror film and more its scary but its also really good i can see this becoming a cult classic in the near future anyone who enjoys horror movies will definitely enjoy this however this can be enjoyed by anyone theres absolutely no gore and nothing thatll really gross you out if thats not your thing and i think thats just one more thing that makes so good itll make you scared out of your mind without blood and guts something that horror movies cant seem to do nowadays,astonish
i am an avid fan of horrorghost films when i was 5 years old my father took me to see poltergeist in the theater that movie stirred fears in me that took decades to quell remember i was 5 poltergeist created a genuine love for the genre but also very high bar for other movies to reach in other words a movie has to offer some truly shocking and creepy unsettling moments to take home with me when the movie is over for me to even remember itwith that being said this movie will haunt me for years and that says a lot i went to see the sunday matine nearly empty theater adds to the creepiness and i was completely floored by the amount of hair raising spinetingeing jumpingoutofmyownskin moments that this movie packed this movie was amazing i have seen most if not all of the acclaimed horror flicks nightmare on elm friday the 13th halloween the ring paranormal entityactivity amityville and manymanymany more none of them came close to delivering like this movie did poltergeist came on at a distant 2nd place tied with the ring and maybe the grudgei would do this movie an injustice by telling you why i rated it 9 out of 10 see it for yourself and make your own judgement if you like a good scare you wont be disappointedif you want a creepy movie that you will remember for a long time to come and that will keep you glancing in the shadows for what may be lurking this is the movie to see this is one you will not walk away from empty handed you might just find those silly childhood fears reemerging in your subconscious thats what ive been looking for for many years and i finally found the key to that lock with ,astonish
omg so this movie isnt what i expected at all i was a little disappointed in some parts but it made up for that a great deal i screamed in the theater just a little  for the first time in a long time great movie it is obvious that this was made from the makers of saw keep your eyes open for little parts of saw in this movie and you will find them hidden in the background the acting wasnt too bad but the storyline its self was just kinda dumb to be quit honest there were a few parts i laughed it was so bad but again it made up for it with simple properly placed scary parts that made me jump not a movie filled with top actors and expensive cgibut still worth watching,astonish
just seen this at a preview screening in londonfrom the makers of saw this was surprisingly devoid of any gore and instead what we get is a refreshingly old school scare fest 80s style no stupid overused cgi just good effective camera work and traditional make up effects akin to that of sixth sensebut this film was so similar in structure to one of my favourite 80s scary movie that if i mention what that movie is i feel i would spoil the whole movie for you im pretty much saying this is an act for act total rip off of that movie im surprised theyre not even calling it a remake or a reboot but i dont mind the extraordinary similarities as this has its own signature and flavour to win over fans of the original and definitely will win over those who haventdid i jump out of my skin at least 20 bloody times at one time i worried if i was too far away to get back in my body granted they are your traditional boo moments with the sound cranked up to maximum you know the type but they are pretty damn effective and done with great timing and excellent editingthe audience i saw this with clearly loved the scares whilst dreading it at the same time its amusing to find people trying to laugh the scares off and i was one of them its like a defence mechanism you know you just got tangod so what do you do you try laugh it offhaving said that i think they used that card a bit too many times in the first and second act so it was quite noticeable that later scary moments didnt quite have us jumping out of our seats and in fact some of it fell quite flatmy other gripe was that the last act did not quite reach the urgency of excitement that the film was clearly building to some more tightening in the editing was needed here i might have felt that way because im uncontrollably comparing it too much to the original i was also hoping for a little more visual imagination in that last act but i later found out that this movie was made on a minuscule budget of 800000 considering this they did a damn good job of making use of every penny of it so it was moderately exciting but not as fulfilling as i would have liked even though i think this a clear rip off of an 80s film i love this delivered exactly what our sadistic inner demons have been crying out for lately a movie that scares the bejesus out of us so this is a great movie to watch on a friday or saturday night with your friends and for guys with their dates as i guarantee your arms will be sore as your girlfriends grab you violently several times,astonish
without a doubt this is the scariest movie i have ever seen it isnt a movie that only makes stuff jump at you combines sudden creatures jumping out at you with disturbing creepy figures you cant even bare to look at i personally cant remember the last horror movie that actually mad me scared but this i will say is the first to succeed plot is very good when a kid goes into a coma and his soul gets trapped in another world where demons roam and attempt to possess his body in order to escape to the real world to live again it may not seem scary but trust me it was really really horrifying the way they looked with their weird smiles and close up images of them make you jump and screamit was clear that 70s and 80s horror films inspired this movie with high pitched violins to build up the scene where something really creepy happens some scenes were so scary i had to cover an eye it was the way the creatures looked that did most of the scares some of the predictable scenes scared you because you knew something was going to happen but didnt know what it was a movie with high pitched violins really loud noises and lots of screams is a descent way to define it the movie starts off kind of slow but progressively gets better and better as it goes on there are a few shaky camera angles and some dark shots that tried to make it feel scary but you cant seen anything in the shots like this they only last for a few seconds before changing to give you a better view of the sceneyeah it gets kind of stupid near the end and darth maul was in it why again but it was rather enjoyable however there isnt much to go back to and i dont have any desire to see it again but for a single viewing was well worth the watchgets a 710,astonish
four stars out of five the team that brought us the original saw once again team up to bring us this creative low budget shocker james wan a member of the unofficial splat pack a grouping of the best of modern horror filmmakers directs and leigh whannell writes this supernatural thriller the film stars patrick wilson rose byrne ty simpkins lin shaye angus sampson and whannell in a rare comedic turn and was made for a mere 800000 which goes to show what you can really do with a limited budget given a lot of passion and creativity the film is a good old fashioned creepy ghost thriller sort of like a modern variation on poltergeist in many waystells the tale of the lambert family who recently moved into a new house dalton lambert simpkins is one of two brothers who falls into a coma early on in the film for unknown reasons his mother renai byrne keeps seeing creepy images in the house and believes its haunted she also thinks the things shes seeing are after her son her husband josh wilson is disbelieving and hides from the familys problems by staying late at the school where he works he eventually gives in and hires a supernatural expert shaye who discovers something more terrifying than either had imaginedthe film like i said is just a good old fashioned spook fest what wan and whannell pull off on such a low budget is amazing theres no cgi here just classic horror gimmicks clever camera motion lighting and creepy music they also do so with little to no blood or gore this is their first pg13 effort and its just as creepy and effective as their other films i enjoyed this much more than either of the paranormal activity flicks the acting is adequate the screenplay well polished including some pretty humorous moments and the directing top notch if you like this sort of film you definitely wont be disappointedwatch our review show movie talk at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvffxjyiwluko,astonish
has been one of the few wellmade horror films that have come out in the past several years that kind of stays with you and gets under your skin while other reviews have noted the obvious parallels to other horror movies  poltergeist paranormal activity etc  it adds a rather original take on the whole genre of haunting and possession while i liked the movie overall i couldnt help but feel it suffered from an issue that seems to be a common pitfall for most horror filmsim often surprised how nonsensical the main characters act in horror movies which make me not sympathize with them for instance why would renai be fine with just hanging out at home by herself after all the craziness of the one night where the front door is opened and she sees that man by her babys crib josh seems to be unfazed by the bloody handclaw print renai finds on daltons bedsheets yeah just normal bloody claw prints on the bedsheets see them all the time and after daltons room gets destroyed by no apparent thing he still says to the paranormal investigators you guys are just taking advantage of a bad situation really but what really got me was how joshs mother lorraine kind of just only appears when they move into their second house with all thats happened to her grandson going into a coma you would think shed make an appearance at some point during the first part of the movie and impart her knowledge to renai then i mean was she traveling in bali the whole time where was she until this point it just felt so arbitrary that you really felt she was more of a place device than a characterstill i appreciated the fact that the scary moments werent the obvious let something jump out when the music builds up that you get with most other movies interestingly the scariest moments were never really things having to do with the demon but the little things like the child facing the wall in the laundry room while renai is walking through the house and she doesnt see him there but i really liked how the movie gave us little clues as to how josh was not or rather more than just josh and its only until the end that we realize elises efforts to rid josh of the hag had failed and he had been possessed this whole time and its that oh sht moment thats what makes it so creepy in the end because his seeming normalcy in the face of it all undermines those other movies of what possession would look like instead its something thats stealthy and creeping its ,astonish
unlike what seems like most of the reviews are from im not a movie critic or self appointed movie expert and im not going to use big words to sound all educated and knowledgeableexcept this onei just wanna let everyone know its a pretty good horror movie and its been a long time since ive seen one as scaryanyways i took my girlfriend to watch this and it did start out very slow and had me a bit worried that i picked a movie that might suck but once it picked upabout 20 mins in it didnt me downscary as hell thats pretty much all all i have to say only thing i would call a complaint is that the ghosts near the end seemed a bit haunted house or not very scary at times haha but thats only at certain times most of the time i was jumping left and righta lot of the popups were obvious but holy crap i still jumped haha,astonish
over the past few days there has been a certain hype over the movie with many reviewers giving it titles such as scariest movie of the decade so when i finally got time today i decided to watch it with my movie palsfirst of all the movie overall is scary and actually creates a frightening atmosphere over the course of the film however when i walked out of the theater i felt somewhat disappointed probably because i was expecting more the movie contains a few original ideas of its own and takes an unique approach to the horror genre at the end there is an unexpected twist that caught me off guard which again is a nice touchdefinitely worth a watch but dont go in expecting it to be the scariest movie youve ever seen cause it wont be,astonish
this movie was hands down the best horror movie in a long time first off the movie had an eerie feel to it which gave it an uneasy feeling as you saw all the paranormal stuff happen rose byrne and patrick wilson were amazing and good in their roles the old woman in the beginning might not make sense but as you get towards the end it makes perfect sense i found the actual creature that was trying to take over the young boy very creepy i could only look at it for a couple of seconds before turning away the further world was very creepy and surprised me when i saw it i was expecting something crappy or not scary the only i found funny instead of scary were the ghosts in the further world that smiled me and my friend cracked up when they would come on screen overall the movie was very scary and will definitely stay with movie for a while,astonish
this was an unexpected surprise it had many unique plot twists the existence of the further while incorporating both asian horror films american classic horror films and tongueincheck campy this is so badits good aspectshard to describe unless youve seen it but the audience was screaming laughing and groaning being someone who was raised on old black and white samurai movies and foreign films like diabolique and who loves good supernatural thrillers old b horror movies like the mummys curse and totally terrible firsttimefilmmaker attempts at scary movies like the the fanglys this was a fun ride from beginning to endsee it but dont bring your youngsters,astonish
this hands down is one of the worst films i have ever seen i was so disappointed due to the amount of fantastic reviews this film has received but i honestly do not know what all those people were watching it has about 10 mins of exciting edge of your seat moments in the whole film and then the story goes from bad to worse becoming more stupid and over the top with every passing moment it may only be 90 mins long but i was ready to leave after only 20 just seems sad to think that there goes yet another hour and a half of my life that i will never see again they should refund everyone their money as it truly was wasted on thisrubbish,astonish
this movie lives up to its name the plot evolves as you watch and its clear that the maker of pa was involved the movie never gets boring or slow the plot constantly evolves the horror element was really good up until the monsters form was revealed that sort of ruined it because spoiler he looks like darth maul and a goat had a baby after that the movie was still very thrilling but this is only a horror in the fact that that there are a few scenes where the actors see the demons and the end where the  hits the fan its a trill ride of endless fun scared and an ending that cries sequel this is the most entertaining movie i have seen in a long time and highly recommend it to any horror fan,astonish
this was a a solid horror movie its refreshing to see a good horror movie with all the crap they release today theres not much to say about this with out giving anything away  but the story was a good old fashioned horror story in vein of the exorcist the acting was real good for a horror movie there are a lot of jump scares and a lot of weird stuff happening through the movie  the only thing i hated was the ending it was predictable but other than that a nice solid horror movie that is a good watch for any horror fan one of the best ive seen this year for horror filmsgood writing solid acting  good atmosphere and scary looking villain defiantly recommended,astonish
i think scream 4 said it best when it comes to the state of horror films nowadays its all either torture porn or failed reboots of famous classic horror franchises if they decide to remake jaws or the exorcist ill never forgive them or worse dumb them down to pg13 tweenfriendly spooks that will barely raise an eyebrow for classic horror fansdoes not follow todays trend its not gory or bloody it does not have sex scenes or too much foul language the pg13 rating is justified the movies sole purpose like many horror movies is to scare the crap out of us and it does brilliantly using good old fashioned scare tactics without making them cheap  remember the clich where there is incidental music build up to a probably scary killerghost only to cop out to a scared animal or whatever nope none of that here the music comes strictly when it scares you the nonmusic parts greatly serve to build the tension so high to the point that you can cut the tension with a knife its old school i like old schoolin fact its so old school with the delivery of the scares that one may mistake the film for being stuck in between the 1970s or 1980s director james wan and writer leigh whanell together with producer oren peli probably fashioned the film to be a homage to the great spook horror films of the past most notably poltergiest with bits of the exorcist the shining and pelis own paranormal activity thrown in for very good measurea script which is a homage to other films can either sink or swim this one swims because whanell uses the classic scare elements and removes the clichs wan directs with caution going mostly against audiences expectations the actors play their role straight as per the crew  rose byrne and patrick wilson are very good in their roles and lin shaye is a bit creepy as the medium who helps them with the music by joseph bishara effectively eerie at many parts and some truly spooky production design and camera work wans tense direction propels a homage script into their own  a great solid horror flick that does exactly what its supposed to do  scare  brilliantlylook at the horror film directors of the past john carpenter wes craven tobe hooper the granddaddy of horror alfred hitchcock even sean cunningham has a cult following does anyone familiar with horror films remember names like samuel bayer or nelson mccormick granted alexandre aja and neil marshall has done some fairly solid stuff yet eli roth to be honest tries too hard james wan isnt up there with the greats yet but if he keeps up this oldschool trend without copping out he just might very well be im just sayingthis is great stuff for a horror film this was how scary movies were made in the past this is how it still should beoverall rating 80100,astonish
1 i havent logged into my imdb account in about a year and a half i did today just to give this 9102 i have never yelled like a little bitch in a movie before in cinemas or watching at home i did in this i am still so on edge and feeling physically ill from being in panic mode for so long i fear i might not sleep tonight or ever again3 go see this movie if you want a jump out of your seat i wont be able to sleep tonight film a more old fashioned screeching violins horror that you wish they would keep making go see it nowfilmmakers need to keep making horror movies like this,astonish
i regret to say this time i was totally wrong the movie starts fine and thats why i give it 3 stars the beginning is quite similar to paranormal activity coupled with a quite saddening family drama if i had to judge from the first 2025 minutes this was going to be a great horror movie the potential is very promisingsadly thats where things end being any good the story turns into a cheap fest of loud noises to try and scare people with the bang since they cannot scare people with the images and story the ghosts are laughable and i mean it literally you do laugh when you see them special mention to darth maul who is depicted as a quite harmless character which can at most crawl at your back and say boo he doesnt feel like a threat and his physical appearance is plain lamespecial mention in the comedy section to the ghostbuster couple and the medium and her gas maskregarding the reviews for once as i said in the title i have to admit i agree with people giving it a very low score they are not just being douches and scoring it low to feel special it is really that bad people giving it high scores i can admit a certain  of the population liking it if they are easily scared and watch it for a dose of seat jumps but the amount of high scores is so big i cant but feel a bit suspicious about the source of those reviews considering there is little to no control to check if reviews are legit or just spammed by advertisers in this case it seems quite obvious to me something sneaky is going onin a word the movie is bad very bad paranormal activity 1  2 are light years ahead of this movie,astonish
to my absolute dismay i went and paid full whack at the cinema to see this film  not only have i lost the 1 and a half hours off my life im also heavily dented in my purse i foolishly listened to some people who thought it was really scary and worth it and i also took note of the 7710 rating on herewow some people really have no taste in horror either that or they just have money to burnthe film actually starts out quite promising however its very obvious that its made by the people from paranormal activity another hyped up load of crap the shots and even the set are very similar its starts off as a fairly modern horror the usual loose character developments the half attractive cast the fairly unconvincing actinghowever at this point i hadnt lost hope well that certainly didnt last longthere are a few decent scares in this film however it soon becomes obvious that the director is just out to make the audience jump the plot becomes ridiculous and the use of crescendos increases ten fold really its just good use of violins the first half and the second half of the films are complete polar opposites the second half takes a leaf out of poltergeists book the set of a meatloaf video and im sure george lucas will have something to say about the fact that darth maul shows up really its supposed to be a demonbut the make up is pretty much the same the scenes become totally ridiculous and totally ruin the work of the first 40 minutes of the filmin a quick conclusion this film is a bad copy of poltergeist certainly not worth a cinema viewingthe scares probably will not transfer well to dvd either save your money,astonish
this fails both in terms of writing and execution its a shame that innovation within the horror genre has been close to nonexistent in the past couple of decades especially in hollywood this is so simple and formulaic that it looks silly instead of scary we have a family where the dad and his son are able to travel from one reality to another during their sleepastral projection at the end the dad must battle his own repressed memories and fears to bring his son from the deadthe writing had some of the essential structural elements for it to work however part of the problem for me here was that the reality of the dead was underdeveloped which made it difficult to believe and become invested in the tension and the energy that i saw glimpses of in saw were absent as well it seems that james has lost his way somewhat horror thrives on the synchronization of musical patterns with the dance of the camera eye unfortunately the camera here is lifelessthis made a lot of money i wonder if the viewers will trust james next time but yet again i am not sure if we remember what a wellmade horror movie looks like25  formulaicps i wrote this before the sequel came out,astonish
new age astral projection vs religious possession mythology aside this film made 3 years before the conjuring is essentially the same story told from a completely different perspective and in a totally different way is to the conjuring what paranormal activity is to the exorcist despite both being made by the same director and starring the same lead actor they are worlds apart while the conjuring had slow scenes which you watched because it moved the film along and added tension the slow scenes in had me drifting off in boredom the budget of the conjuring was obviously a great deal more than but more than that had the overall feel of a music video or a bad trip some scenes were comedicnot intentionally i wont spoil the ending but will say james wan diffidently learned from his mistakes if your looking for a film so bad its good this is for you if you want a film you might actually find engrossing go for the conjuringid like to add that this has a sequel heaven knows why although it lends support to the theory that sequels are made not because a film is good but because it sells well they are not the same thing,astonish
as most of wans films this film is annoying me with two things the cuts which almost are all ruining the rhythm of the film and are very unmotivated and incoherent and the superficial acting its difficult to believe in the story when the acting becomes soso its not the actors fault because they are all good and have proved the self a lot of times so then again it comes down to the instructor or director if you wishthe movie is a good try and gives a couple of good scares but is made very unbelievable and therefore uninteresting this is done so much better earlier on in other films so you have to watch this before the others if you are to have a good experience with itthe strangest thing is that when watching the film you really think you have seen it beforeyou wonder if you have seen the film earlier you havent its just copying even ghostbusters are recognized here the film also has trouble in being serious another reason for it no to function when people at scared it looks like they are action and then it becomes unwillingly funnyi havent been too fond of the film ive seen by james wan they are all lacking believability and heart they are just to caricatured to me death sentence saw though it was the first and best and stygian they are all overrated due to this i certainly want more from my films than this and im actually afraid hell mess up fast  furious 7,astonish
this is on of those films that starts off really good by adding a creepy sense into the film  as well as giving reason to feel for the victims  into a nonsensical over the top messthis film starts off by building the suspense of something truly frightening haunting this family which does a very good job you start to wonder how they are going to really hit the climax of the film then it starts to turn into an over the top rip off of poltergeist and exorcist everything that made the film actually creepy and disturbing turned it into a three ring circus that killed any momentum made for the victims to be in danger as well as its creep toneits disappointing because this film looked as if it wasnt going to need hokiness as well as things popping out of nowhere to really get the viewer interested in watching but the second half of the film negates that and over does it ten foldoverall  very disappointing want a true scare watch the blair witch project,astonish
inisidious is not particularly scary but lets be honest 90 of horror films dont scare us anymore if thats what it takes for you to give a thumbs up to a movie then this wont be the movie for you nevertheless its well made and well acted its a simple retelling of the haunted house genre thats not about the house in this case the house has some unwanted inhabitants because of this familys little boy who is being surrounded by evil deities i wont go into the explanation for why this is one because its too cheesy to be believed and two because it would take too longaside from that i still enjoyed the film the entire movie consists of boo moments i admit i jumped several times but towards the end i became a little desensitized what made work for me is two things because i never knew what was going to pop out at any given time i was always on the edge of my seat second rose byrne as the main character was believable and sympathetic with a lesser actress i probably wouldnt have enjoyed it half as muchso you havepros exceptional acting good pacing spooky atmosphere good heroine ending with a twist cons those jump moments become repetitive explanation for the haunting is kind of hokey and borderline ridiculousbetter than average but becomes repetitive and predictable at times 6510,astonish
i like horror movies but i am not the kind of fan that will fawn over any poorly lit and scripted serving of it i want to see a storyline i wanted to be driven into a nightmare and scared but i am not willing to forget what makes a film good for a few excited jumpsi wanted to like this dud i am reviewing i did i went with a good friend it was a premiere at lincoln center in manhattan the director writer and actor were there it was sweet and personal but the movie is just blahdidnt like it it felt laborious theatrical and clichridden the directing was choppy the director never found the right groove it seems and he was trying so damn hard i could hear it it dragged and it went on endlessly if it werent for the loud bouts of sound effects i would not have found a rhythm at all the acting was unconvincing and listless ok rose byrne had moments of clarity including the two extra heavy handed comic relief atrocities that popped up for no apparent reason than a technical need for a diversion to liven up the sea of dull i didnt care for a single character i pretty much wished them dead and over with not good the storyline was way predictable part paranormal activity part amityville part poltergeist and not in a good way ugh just dull didnt get scared except for my popcorn running out,astonish
no really why this movie was awful the only reason that i can see why anyone would think this was any good was if they saw it in a movie theater and even then it would be because of the over the top loud scary sounds ya know the gotcha sounds the one where you could even be watching a sitcom in a room with a bunch of buddies but if it was dark enough and out of nowhere a loud sound came you would jump that is the only reason how i could see anyone associating this drivel with a scary movieto summarize if you do not like utter fail movies such as paranormal activity and blair witch you will hate this so dont let the skewed rating fool you,astonish
i dont understand why everyone is saying this film is so amazing is just a typical commercial horror film with cameras everywhere bad acting too many over the top and cheesy specialsound effects and a lame story  particularly the convenient last minute rescue by the kids dad and the predictable ending youll have it figured out by the halfway marki thought paranormal activity was much scarier because they kept it simple  you only got to see what the main characters record on their camcorder theres no major special effects or soundtrack and no bad acting this produced a better atmosphere more tension and a more believable scarier film plus you had no idea how it was going to end,astonish
yes i admit in the very beginning about 20 or so minutes into the movie it appears rather suspenseful and the movie appears to be going somewhere however after these 20 minutes are up you might as well turn off your tv because what comes after is just ridiculous i know people say this film is terrifying and that it doesnt use slasher film elements to be scary but come on a man with a poorly painted red face as the antagonist is just laughablei even found myself laughing at the horrendous acting i mean to say that if i came into my sons room and his bed and all the furniture was scattered and broken and there was a bloody hand print on the sheet i wouldnt just breath heavily and look a little flustered like the parents in this movie i would be absolutely terrified same goes for when the mother sees the man walk through her bedroom in the first houseregarding the further and the ridiculous walk through the father goes through to get his son back this just proves that gets worse as it progresses i watched daring to believe that this is what people regarded as a terrifying movie if you are a true horror fan do not see this pathetic attempt at a horror movie perhaps if you are 15 or under you might appreciate this film,astonish
after years of hype for this movie and my love for rose byrne i finally caved in and accompanied by my younger sister sat down to watch with reasonably high hopes due to several positive reviewslets just i was quite disappointed rose byrne and patrick wilson pulled off near flawless performances and the cinematography was very well done however it wasnt even as remotely horrifying as some had said it was cheesy for the most part the first 2040 minutes is relatively scary if attention is paid properly with small jumps that can successfully freak you for that moment but as the story unfolds so does the cheeseball honestly this movie is really nothing we havent seen before just a highly overrated beenthere donethat special effects horror filmi wouldnt say this is an awful movie not even close to that but it definitely does not live up to its popularity and is something you should be able to get a good nights sleep afteralso i am a major fan of horror films but usually avoid films with paranormal themes as they scare the absolute daylights out of me for weeks but this one is pretty safe and ordinary paranormal activity will scare you a lot more than thisi wouldnt not recommend this but just for the sake of your satisfaction go in without any expectations and let it serve you with its original purpose,astonish
now im not saying its the worst movie hands down but many movies that are worse than this one dont receive as much attention and almost realise themselves how awful they are fails to do this and the fact that it completely mocks the horror movie genre as a whole lands it as the worst movie that humanity has ever spawnedso lets look at what happens nobody dies nobody is really particularly injured theres a single instance of blood from a handprint that is neither that of the child nor that of the demon there is some random system of underworlds that is designed solely for this movie that neither makes sense nor is particularly original half way through these two guys come in who are ghost detectors and theyre pretty much a comedy duo throughout much of the movie the woman is the main character but then at the end for no reason in particular the man takes centre stage after having been barely in it to turn the movie into an action movie the final showdown being a fist fight yes a fist fight with the demon who apparently wants to cause mass destruction but cant beat a guy who works out too much at fisticuffs it wasnt scary it wasnt believable it wasnt interesting it was a constant parody of itself and i couldnt help but feel a little bit awful after i had watched it seriously please please dont buy this movie,astonish
maybe it is just me but scary movies are better if they seem real thats why i loved paranormal activity and why the second half of this movie disappointed me for example the scene where the physic describes the demon is very intense because despite of its description our imagination creates our own demon of course when i saw clearly the demon i was disappointed we always fear what we dont understand and if we picture a demon who appears as a man with red and black makeup it looses that scary touch that was the part that bugged me the rest of the movie is very enjoyable filled with some unpredictable scares i recommend you see and most importantly form your own opinion,astonish
the term horror has been used in movies for the past 115 years since its gruesome birth on december 24 1896 at the theatre robert houdin france in the form of le manoir du diable the devils castlesince then there have been many classics such as the exorcist the shining and more recently saw and horror movies have gone from strength to strength scaring their victim audience even after the movie has finished so with the added bonus of this film coming from the makers of paranormal activity and saw it promised to be a true horror classicthe film starts with teacher josh patrick wilson and his composer wife renai rose byrne moving their family to a new home where everything seems finehowever within a few days their oldest son dalton ty simpkins has an accident and whilst in a comatose state an evil presence appears to consume the family homeunfortunately over time many good things eventually come to an end and with the birth of comes the death of the horror movie despite a positive start with plenty of jumpy moments the film rapidly lost life with the storyline being too far fetched and the director trying too hard to place fear into the audience with ticking clocks and creaking floor boardsthe addition of subtle humour that seems to be an ever increasing factor in most modern day horror films was unnecessary and ridiculous props that should be scary only added to the pain of an already agonisingly poor horror filmthe movie did have some scary moments with a certain camera scene that builds great suspense and the fear inflicted on the audience when seeing a ghostly face by a babys cot and the performances from patrick wilson and rose byrne were very convincing but unfortunately could not save the second half of this filmit also had the typical scenes audiences have now seen over and over again like the voice through the baby monitor when noone is upstairs and before long you can predict exactly what is going to happen and how it will all endfor the horror film rookie this may be a great start for you as things will only get better from here however for you veterans out there this will no doubt be the final nail in what was once a terrifying coffin,astonish
i decided to see after a number of friends had told me how scary the film was im a major horrorparanormal fan and couldnt wait to watch and prepared to be spookedthe film is based along the storyline of a little boy who is stuck in a coma but is actually discovering a new dimension called the further in which a demon is slowly but surely trying to possess himthe coma part of this storyline really started to scare me but then the storyline became ridiculously overexaggerated when the audience were then told he was visiting another universe which is run by demons and parasitesthe events in the house were scary such as the scary coincidences that happened eg the baby monitor and the bangs doors opening alarms going off etc and also the younger brother claiming he was scared when his brother who is in the coma walked about the househowever the scenes that followed by trying to contact the demons were not scary and in fact i spent most of the time during these scenes laughing at how ridiculous the storyline had become and also the fact that you could then see these demons which only looked like a very low par costume and mask the appearance of these demons which seemed to be like mannequin dolls zombies and xmen type characters did not even remotely scary  but only made me giggle friday 13th from 1980 had better costuming and this is 2011the ending was predictable yet you cant understand why and how it actually happenedthe only good point i can make about the movie is that the acting was quite good what a shame they were made to act in such a mediocre film its a shame because could have been so much better had it followed the same sort of idea as paranormal activity demons that are invisible and you can only hear and feel them which is what i believe most demons to be likeif you want a real spook dig out your good old fashioned traditional movies such as friday 13th the exorcist the exorcism of emily rose dont waste your time on this film its over 20 i cant get back from the cinema that i could have spent on a lot of better movies on amazon,astonish
genre is horror but movie was horrible what a load of nonsense worse creature designs and makeups ive ever seen those other world environments suppose to be scary i could do more scary stuff myself in my home with a box of scrapsproduction design was terrible they tried to be scary so badly it looks funny people with halloween costumes coming out of closets i actually laughed out loud when i see this total waste of time worst horror movie ive ever seenmusic was also really bad i think because the lack of production design they tried to scare audience with the loud nonsense noises awful music personally i love horror movies with good music  like silent hill check out the apparition for example not a super good movie but music was great good music creates fine atmosphere and makes everything more catchy this movie is also lack of thatsave your money for something else instead,astonish
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning josh patrick wilson and rose reni lambert move with their young son dalton ty simpkins into a new home however after dalton suffers a fall his parents find him trapped in a coma he cant seem to break free from worse shortly afterwards spooky events take place around the house causing them to relocate againonly for these events to follow them causing them to face a terrifying truth about their son that will force them to go above their realm of belief to save himif does nothing else right which it doesnt it does create a terrific unnerving atmosphere that fits its status as a horror film perfectly not only in the opening titles with the jarring skin crawling soundtrack but the impressively grey drained cinematography in the set up that follows with an impressive use of no sound to hammer this homesaw director james wan shows more restraint and ditches the bloodgore excess and concentrates on setting up the ground work for a decent horror picture sadly he fails to create characters we can care about or a story that is in any way engaging leaving it to degenerate more and more into preposterousness which robs some of the admittedly eerie scenes of their effectivenesshorror is one of those genres where if its done right things work wonders but when it doesnt its just a complete mess which sadly is the case with atmospherically and even visually its perfect but sadly all the other components fail to come together and despite being a short film it feels like a big slog to get to the end ,astonish
after having enjoyed watching the funeasy going scream 4 with a friend recentlyi felt that due to there being not much word about any other horror films coming out during the summerit seemed that this was going to be the main horror for the first half of the yearover a week or two after scream 4 had been outi started to hear that there had been a huge surprise at the box office from a small low budget horror film which was leaving scream in the dustintrieged by the attention that this film was gatheringi decided to check my local cinemas to see if any of them were going to show the film soonhappilyi discovered that the nearest cinema to me was going to screen the film in a weeks timehaving booked my ticket for an early showingi sat in the theatre feeling pretty interested about seeing what all the attention that it had received was aboutalthough i was not prepared at all for how scary this fantastic film would bethe plotwhilst renai and josh lambert try to unpack all of the furniture for there new homethere three kids seem to be feeling a little uneasy about the house which is probably due to them needing time to get used to there new environmentone night their oldest son dalton begins to hear some creaking sounds coming from the attic this leads dalton to decided that he should go up to the attic to try and discover what is making all that noisewhen he opens the entrance to the attic dalton discovers that the light has been left offas he walks up a very olddusty ladder to turn the light onone of the steps suddenly breaksand leads to dalton falling hard on the floorhearing a loud thudjosh and renai run up to the attic to find dalton laying on the floorluck ally he has only gotten some small cutsafter having checked that he is okayhis mum and dad help dalton down from the attic although whilst they are trying to get dalton to relaxhe becomes very nervous about something weird which he claims he saw in a shadowy corner of the attic the next dayjosh goes to

an extremely nasty ghostjosh starts to suspect that these ghosts might be playing a huge part in his sons comaalthoughthe more josh goes looking deeper and deeper into the world of the ghostshe begins to discover some terrifying information about his past view on the filmas the opening credits to the film started to roll on the screeni noticed that the people who were listed as the screenwriterdirector of the film leigh whannell and james wanwere the two main people behind the fantastic low budget horror thriller film saw part 1this lead me to expecting that this film would be very similar to the latter saw filmswhich were filled with a lot of shocking gory momentsinsteadwhannell and wan show an extremely surprising side with this filmwith the first half an hourshowing a pretty chaotic familywhich wan along with some very good performances from rose byme and patrick wilson cleverly uses to slowly build up an intense supernatural atmosphereafter having created a fantastic atmosphere in the first 30 minuteswan and whannell unleash some truly nerve wrecking momentsthat are guaranteed to make you jump out of your seatas if you have had a strong electric shockunlike quite a few recent horror films that turn that suddenly turn the volume of the score up to max to achieve a very cheap scarrewan instead wisely uses joseph bisharas creepy score to keep a strong mood of terror as the film builds up to its next shockthe main thing that really impressed me about how wan paced the musicwas that due to there being no hint at all about when the next ghost would pop outit led to me being more terrified than i have been for along time with any filmalthough it has to be said that the ending of the film does lack a bit of logic how could josh get worn out and the second half also noticeably has some strong elements of banjong pisanthanakun and parkpoom wongpooms 2004 horror film shutterwan and whannelle are still able to create an insanely intense atmosphere of terror and dreadwith the final pichure in the filmbeing one that is still able to run a tingle of sheer horror down my spinefinal view on the filmthe scariest film i have seen in ageswhich is also brilliantly writtendirected and acted,astonish
i have been looking forward to this movie for months so when i finally saw it i was afraid i would have drastically high expectations for it but when the film ended i was pretty well satisfied lets start with the positives it is scary it does what its supposed to do i jumped i hid my face its realistic kind of the family actually moves house ive never in all the scary movies ive seen seen this happen its got some good cast members and crew behind it now the negatives the music is crudely used i know its there to help build suspense but its loud and distasteful the film doesnt allow the audience to imagine anything when you see whats haunting dalton youll most likely laugh overall i liked it for an aussieish film it was pretty good horror films are hard to get right and i think james waan  leigh whannel did a pretty good job,astonish
i just ended watching this movie and i would split it in two parts1 from the beginning of the movie to last 20 minutes or so awesome bone chilling creepy tense unexpected bone chilling again amazing acting is great music fits perfectly and reminds on old school horror and thriller movies why there arent more movies that use violin to create scary atmosphere in one word little masterpiece filmed with rather small budged congratulations mr wan and crew in this part of the movie i decided to write the review just to prolong the time to go to sleep2 last 20 minutes or so in here all went down the drain atmosphere and tensions that were so carefully built were ruined or at least i felt like that there are too much scenes and happenings which are unnecessary and scary factor went away but never mind first part compensated it allseems that i dont need to prolong my sleeping time after all good night and enjoy one great and scary movie after all,astonish
im sad to say that i was extremely disappointed with this movie because honestly it wasnt scary at all i watched it with my girlfriend and throughout the movie we couldnt stop telling each other how much it sucked the whole movie had the feel of an episode of american haunting it felt like watching a half developed remake of poltergeist follow my voice come into the light carol ann granted there are a few jumpy scenes if youre the jumpy type but in no way shape or form would i call this a great horror movie those that find this scary probably peed their pants watching scream 4 i would go into detail but i dont want to spoil the chilling experience smh,astonish
as a horror scareyoutokeepthelightson and guaranteed bad dream after watching movie buff its been a long time so someone like me goes into this movie with very low expectations the further come on every aspect of this movie advertises cheese and interestingly they kept some cheese in there something they could work on the name tooregardless you get a lot more then what you expect youre swept away into the typical our house is haunted and it really scares me leadstayathome momactress honey you have nothing to worry about dadetc the spooks come on quick and they crescendo at a good pace never letting you down if youre like everyone else in judeochristian postpost modern western civilization then there is that belief stuck in the back of your head that there is something going on and there could be something like this happening somewhere ie ghosts demons what have you do exist after too many wobbling cameras weird walking dirty girls whos hair always covers their face for the first 80 and paranormal activities abounding this movie steadies the lay of the horror genre by cutting to the chase quickly and starts the actors running with good oldfashion im keeping the lights on after im done watching this fun right place right time not necessarily a perfectly orchestrated piece but it is something to keep for the archives,astonish
at last after poltergeist 1982 the only spooky yet horror film ever leave the scary effect on me so far this is the next horror film manage to do the same the story might be a bit slow on the beginning but not that slow but its picking up after the first 30 min i can go on watching this film even if its play for more than 2 hours good enough to make me wanting for more love the idea of different kind of horror im not a coward person for all that i know but this movie had made me scared scared enough to make me ask my husband to accompany me to the toilet thumbs up but not recommended for younger audience since the entire film from begin to end is scary might be disturbing for some kids gonna watch it again,astonish
so there is this lovely family in the suburbs but there seems to be a dark secret is it the house is it the family the one good thing about this movie is the rather ingenious wordplay inside the title itself on the other hand im not sure of this director and above all this screenwriter warrants any form of praise if you like your food premasticated then enjoy this rehash by all means it looks like the writer or director has plundered the kitchen of the friday the 13th franchise the shining and above all the poltergeist family saga so hie thee to a cinema in your friendly neighbourhood if not however stay away use a safety zone of at least 10 miles,astonish
despite several implausible gimmicks in the script about astral flights into the further does the job of keeping the viewer glued to the screen as the shocking incidents begin to pile up before the surprise ending delivers a final blow patrick wilsons performance gives nothing away with regard to the films last bit of shock value hes simply the husband who cant believe all hes expected to deal with when lin shaye shows up to rid the family of its cursed monsterone of the more obvious effects is the stark use of music for shock impact but used in connection with whats happening on screen it does manage to deepen the sense of explosive terror leigh whannells clever script fairs better in the storys first half up until the arrival of a team of specialistsbut its then that the horror elements reach their peak  possible spoiler aheadits just that the astral aspects of out of body experience dont carry much weight in the way of credibility and the voyage into darkness toward the last fifteen minutes is a bit over the top by the time its overactingwise its fine with good work from wilson rose byrne and ty simpkinsbut its lin shaye whom youll ultimately remember in a very intense and believable performancefor thriller fans this is not the blood and gore type of thing some may be expectingbut an intelligent thriller that plays its mind games with the viewer in a fascinating way its handsomely produced and shows no strain from its more modest budget limitations i found it an extremely effective thrillerwarning youll only be able to enjoy the second half of the film if youre willing to accept the startling premise of the further,astonish
wow this is the first movie that actually scared me i have a love for scary movies but had yet to find a movie that gave me chills would make me jump and just scare the hell out of me the premise of the movie was creepy and just the events that happen in the movie were great i was holding a wad of napkins from the buttery popcorn and by the end they were a solid cylinder from me squeezing the crap out of them by the end of the movie ever hair on my body was sticking up and chills were running through my body just an awesome movie with a great story linei hope there is a number two or even just another horror movie made by these guysto be honest i want to go back tonight to watch it again and againand again i cant wait for it to come out on dvd so i can watch it as many times as i want,astonish
showcases what the real horror really means it gives us both creepiness and goosebumps at its best if i were to ask its 100x better than paranormal activity and saw and lastly it will surely gives you sleepless nights what i loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you not gross you outif you are highly suggestible or prone to nightmares do not see this film but if you are truly a fan of a good ghosthaunted house story do not miss got to be one of the scariest movies of all time it was an absolutely brilliant horror which still stays with me now the day after when opening my cupboards outstanding,astonish
this followed the formulae of most modern day horrors excellent eerie build up suspense and scares in perfect equal measures you have no idea where its all going then half way through the explanations come and it all goes in the same predictable direction this film really excelled itself though i can accurately tell you the exact moment the film takes that familiar downward turn its when the family move from the massive eerie creaky house to the small suburban bungalow i suppose its to lull us into a false sense of security the bungalow is light airy modern its daylight no nasties can get us here oh but here they come actually its not the move itself its the entrance of two comical ghostbuster type characters with weird and wonderful gadgets to seek out those ghosties they then call in their grandmotherlike boss to do the real psychic stuff and to give us the longest explanation of the spooky goings on that ive ever heard in a film it was here that i started clock watching and annoying everyone around me by shifting in my seat if you want to be chilled and left feeling you need to put furniture behind the front door leave the cinema when they start packing the van if you want to predict the end and be left squirming in your chair for a further 45mins then stay to the end,astonish
i have to say first off i am a fan of james wan that said trying to give you an impartial review is impossible this movie is good on so many levels i was very impressed that a pg13 movie was as entertaining as this i like the whole premise of the movie without giving anything away a boy falls into a coma for no reason when they find out the reason for the coma it is interesting how they make it work i would definitely recommend this movie for anyone its just a fun movie towatch hats off to james wan,astonish
i thoroughly enjoyed saw it was suspenseful and fun james wan was almost hitchcockian in his approach to an extent i enjoyed its sequel and this would be thanks to leigh wannell who starred in them but doesnt ever seem to receive much recognition for the writing it should have ended there but what are you going to do the market is what it is right given that sees the two guys back together and after the rather lacklustre paranormal activity 2 and the torture porn of late i was looking forward to a film that would provide a rare opportunity to enjoy some intelligent and genuinely frightening psychological terror to an extent they succeedfirst the good credit must go to the film for some great casting im a big fan of patrick wilson see hard candy and even the ateam for evidence of his ability and rose byrne who are great as this perfect couple and very busy character actress lin shaye a nightmare on elm street my sisters keeper and snakes on a plane to name a few of many has great screen presence the problem is they are under the direction of somebody whose intention with the film falters halfway through meaning they find themselves either doing things that do not make sense seem silly and absurd or worst of all they are wasted by being given very little to do this is a particularly bad crime when you have someone in your film with as much to give as barbara hershey black swanwan and whannell spend pretty much the first half of the movie providing a haunted house setup the initial haunting the house move not really a spoiler given that the trailer told us what the twist of the story is and the events that take you to the pivotal point of the film are all done very slowly some would argue a bit too slowly but its good to see him taking his time with the creepy setup not since the exorcist has there been a horror movie i can think of that has been paced in this way it causes a restlessness in the audience and a desire to want the story to push forward which of course heightens your anticipation and makes you more uncomfortable wan is very good at the classic vibe he actually manages to do what paranormal activity did but better he tips his hat to many other classic of the genre a bit too heavily at points but it remains very solid and creepythis only emphasises the disappointment we feel when the film reaches the part of explaining what has happened and sets up what will occur in the second half whether it was whannells choice to change gear or instruction from on high to get away from the paranormal activity similarities same producing team we cant know but whoevers it was they should regret it the explanation of things feels like a bad reworking of poltergeist and the previously scary techniques are replaced with hamfisted effects and dodgy makeup too much is shown and due to the look of certain aspects of the piece it starts to become a bit laughable the on screen events becomes sillier and sillier and we reach a point where the tone becomes one of creepy computer game rather than scary horror film there is an introduction of comedy into the film that is completely uncalled for and though genuinely funny the jokes could not be more out of place they ruin all the atmosphere that has been created and you know it is going downhill this is also the point where we have stopped being scared and this is a problem for any horror film hurtling towards its final act with the audience having been lost some time agospeaking of the final act it is just absurd and in thinking about the film afterwards you begin to realise just how many loose ends there are how many plot holes are left open and then the question of whether it is all for the sake of a sequel comes to mind given that paranormal activity had one it is hard to imagine them not pushing for one here which is a shame because this should have been the brilliant oneoff psychological terroriser the first half promised so heartily and not the silly theme park walkthrough it becomesall this said james wan has some talent as he has proved and i will not give up on him just yet worth seeing on the big screen in a room full of people for some of the jumpscares but otherwise is one to rent,astonish
caution may contain spoilers well where can i start the effects costume house set and music played a huge part in the movie for me i can easily say this movie made me jump around 20 times and i was actually counting and i actually screamed at one point most of the theatrecinema had either their hands over their eyes or over their mouths or ears in my case i had my hands over my eyes and ears i was slumped so far down in my seat that after the movie i couldnt get up and had to ask my friends for help at the first jump and right at the end of the movie there were a few nervous laughs and someone was crying at the back i could honestly say i walked out of that cinema with jelly legs from being so shaky all the way from start to finish it scared the living hell out of me and when i got home i jumped at everything i saw or heard and hid behind a cushion with my dog until my mum came to bed at 12pm the old woman and the twins with the freaky smiles scared me the most i dont think ill be watching it for a while now and this is a lot coming from me as i have watched practically everything even for my age so as a wrap up i strongly advise you to not watch the film on your own and dont watch it at all if you are fainthearted or have heart problems its truly jumpy and if you are under the age certificate please try not to watch it until you get older as it will easily give you nightmares for a week just rememberdont be fooled by the low age certificate,astonish
ive waited a few weeks for my local multiplex brighton to show a movie that wasnt aimed at preteens and along comes which preteens wholl have to wait for the dvd will probably enjoy more than i did since its about as scary as a good episode of dr whois a mishmash of ingredients a bit of paranormal activity a bit of amityville horror a bigger bit of the exorcist and a whole lot of poltergeist the mixture is fairly well brewed with quite a few makeyoujump moments and adequate performances though barbara hershey is wasted in a thin role and the lady medium reminded me more than somewhat of the late queen mum the lighting inside the two haunted houses is almost as dim before the weird stuff starts as after and the glimpses of the further the afterlife has been rebranded are a bit like the ghost train at a funfair with things jumping out of near total darkness at the riderviewerits a relief to have a horror flick that doesnt rely on grossout gore but this is only a scaryish movie it doesnt hold a black candle to sam raimis drag me to hell,astonish
the first half is great if i were rating this on the first half alone it would score an 8 or 9 but then wellhaunted house movies are overburdened with clichs these days and this one is no different yet the way in which the atmosphere is generated from the outset is extremely skilled and considered the camera angles the buildup the inspired use of music and sound all combine to create a successfully creepy and nervy ambiance the scene where the wife sees through the window a short figure in black dancing to tiptoe through the tulips gives the nape of the neck a good tingling for a moment the triggers within the script are cued immaculately timed just right for the right unnerving effect it kicks off and sustains an unswervingly solid creativity for the first fiftypercent of its running timeeverything is cleverly crafted until this critical midpoint wherein a decision must be made about the reveal the moment for exposition when the audience begins to take delivery of what is going on and why the makers opt for the most campy hokey misguided direction to take and the whole construct catastrophically falls apartthe introduction of the two ghostbusters rejects paranormal comedy nerds is utterly jarring they have lots of homemade electronic spiritdetecting paraphernalia to talk about and a standard slacker animosity for each other then the little old psychic lady a physically normalised version of the eccentric shortstop from poltergeist steps in and dons a gas mask for a sance she rattles off lots of mindstupefying mumbojumbo about the afterlife and out of body experiences that absolutely ravages the fabric of credibility that the film has established next were off to the astral plane the realm of the dead and its really very badly realised  a sort of emptier darker version of the real world with grinning painted mannequins and lots of alice cooper eye makeup the downhill plunge all the way to the oh like i didnt see that coming  yawn shock ending is astonishingly abrupt and irreversiblewhat starts as a genuinely disturbing paranormal chiller suddenly and sharply devolves into a banal lowrent version of the cell or dreamscape and my interest almost completely evaporated its such a shame that the trajectory of the premise didnt continue and deliver the expected payload in the second half seldom have i seen a film go from near genius to total bilge so completely utterly and irredeemably its a real shamethe lesson is when its time to reveal whats been going on these filmmakers should really try a lot harder in future to make what comes next as good as if not better than what has gone before the foundation was there but the roof caved in and wrecked it,astonish
i thought this movie would be crap because it was made by the same person who made paranormal activity but no this could possibly be the scariest movie i have ever seen it has a good story too there were points in this movie where i jumped and screamed in this movie not for the faint hearted if you watch this movie do not bring your girlfriend because she will leave you straight away from the amount of times you scream there was a point in the movie where they were just talking nicely and then right behind the fella there was a big black and red monster standing right behind him and i nearly crapped my pants this movie is a really good watch because it has a good story and will scare the balls off you,astonish
its been a long time after paranormal activity that a horror movie has done it againscare the socks right off your feet so tie ur shoe laces on this one first impressions are the budget of the movie and feel they givecomplete oppositesfor such a shoes string budget they got the real moneys worth in the output it has the paranormal activitypoltergeist combo without the regular hollywood treatment of cheesy camera work and dialogits fresh and good back to basic horror the leads are convincing we can immediately step into their shoes3rd footwear referencenot intentionalits just the flow what is really good  the chillthrill music camera work and focus on main story no deviation watch out for hidden stuff allover the movie cluesand references and any sneaky stuff that moves was it time well spent experiencing something slightly different  yes memorable unique scenes  yes is it iconic  maybe not,astonish
i saw this movie because of the reviews saying that this was the best horror movie since poltergeist wrong huge mistake whoever wrote that review must have not even watched poltergeist this was boring and had few scares my friend who i just recently got into horror movies even said it was sorta ok she loves the scare but there was none the main demon looked like darth maul and there was only one good shot of him while he was grinding his fingertips im glad i saw it but not happy about it and the horror movie of the decade i wish i could have been smoking what you were check out let the right one in the original not the us remake,astonish
i absolutely love scary moviessince i was only a little kid i would bribe my mom to let me watch themi have to say that this movie was one of the best if not the best movie i have seen to dateit had all the regular things you expect but they took it to another levelwhen the movie started i was kinda worried because i had dragged my sister with me and if it was a dud id never hear the end of it but by the first half in i had bruises on my arm from her grabbing mei screamed more than once and have to admit only to you that i did cover my eyes onceok twiceyeah i who loves scary movies covered my eyesif you havent gone to see this movie yet because of those horrible commercials you may have seen on tv check out imdb trailers or moviefonesim glad i did,astonish
i rarely go to see horror films in the theaters anymore mainly because 90 or more are complete garbage they are only there to give a cheap scare and feature bad acting and awful scripts this movie gives some cheap scares but it also gives more than that it features images that have been stuck in my brain its not all quick jump scenes but instead it also has scenes that scare without having a blast of music or a quick run across the screen this is a film that wants to and almost transcends the genre of typical horror fare but kind of falls into a middle ground between trashy horror films and well thought out horror films either way it is still one of the best horror films to come out in the last few yearsafter their son falls into a mysterious coma josh and renai lambert begin seeing and hearing frightening things in their new house they decide to move and still mysterious creatures inhabit the house after calling in a psychic they learn that their boy is a skilled astroprojector and in his sleep his soul traveled too far from his body and was trapped by malevolent spirits its up to josh to think back to his repressed childhood and astroproject himself to find his son in a horrifying place called the furtherthis horror movie has something that most recent ones havent and thats likable lead characters that the audience actually cares about unlike typical kill em off horror flicks this film develops its leads enough for the audience to root for them instead of rooting for their death the writing wasnt too bad and the decisions the characters make dont usually come off as completely idiotic often in horror films the characters never seem to remember the scene before and stay in the house for another night and while there is a little bit of idiocy going on here the characters seem real for the most part and dont forget previous scenes of terror just to keep them conveniently in harms wayhorror is the genre here so the question is is this movie scary i would say it definitely is the atmosphere is tense and even when nothing is happening and we arent waiting for something to happen things can be really creepy a scene where patrick wilson is looking at drawings is enormously creepy and never does a jump happen or does the film make you believe one is coming a few images here have stuck with me and when they appeared in the film they were both genuinely startling and disturbing where they stay with you much after the movie is over and this film is consistently scary even the chaotic musical score was scary and fairly memorable and i havent had the music in a horror film stick with me since maybe the sixth sense rottentomatoes has started writing sillier and less reflective summaries of their movies since they hooked up with flixter and this one is a great example of how much i disagree with them they refer to the third act as shakyi would actually say that was the most original and interesting part of the entire movie the astroprojected world is an example of how this film transcends the typical horror movie its so creative and understated at the same time its dark and creepy but also surreal and artistic and the creativity of the third act makes this movie feel more like the original nightmare on elm street or poltergeist than say one missed call the dream world is dark and hard to see but that only makes it all the more fascinating and the whole trip to the further is worth admission price alone its an original aspect of a notso original but nonetheless effective movie it was thrilling to see such a competently made and genuinely scary movie in this ever dwindling genre i highly recommend this one for a good and scary time at the movies with a film that surely wont be soon forgotten like so many others of the genremy rating  out of  100 mins pg13 for terror and violence and language,astonish
i was really looking forward for a new horror movie from the stable of james wan as a huge horror fanatic i was thrilled to learn about the premise seemed good the actors were top notch and the production team outstanding untilspoilers aheadthe first half of the movie was great atmospheric exciting and full of tension but when the second act the plot kicked in i thought what the actual hell are you freaking kidding me ghosts with greasepaint on them a stage that looked like a high school theater play this took me all out of the movie it went from a good thrilling movie to a mediocre school playi know im gonna hurt some fanboys feeling but come onno this wasnt my cup o tea i need my horror to be more gruesome more realistic and more exciting all in the second half of the movieso if your 12 then maybe this movie is up your alley but for any horror loving adults this might be not for you,astonish
i saw this first on a dvd in 2011 as a fan of james wan saw death sentence n dead silence i was excited to see this film starts off on a routine note  a family moves into a new house and are absolutely in love with it soon strange supernaturallike things start to happen n the son goes into coma after falling from a ladder in the attic sensibly the family moves into a new house thinking theyve left those occurrences behind they soon discover that its not the house that was haunted but their son was actually scary at some points there were several pretty chilling set pieces and the ghost designs were particularly creepy there is this one scene where the red demon is standing next to the sons bed n the granny inquires the demon man that really terrified me another scene was the one wher someone is walking behind the curtains while watching this scene i turned behind to check my window the scary moments are wellpaced and always effective creepy figures emerge from the shadows and appear in the background in an unpredictable fashion the soundtrack complemented it well the cast is remarkable patrick wilson rose byrne n lin shaye all gave good performances,astonish
ok if you are aged over twelve obviously you wont be reading this review as this is a childrens filmso this review is directed at the kidswow childrenyou are going to love this it begins with some clichd bogstandard offtheshelf stock horror movie music which sets the scene then we have the actual title appear in scary hammer horror style sorry you are too young to understand that referencethe hammy blockofwood performances from all involved will not bother you as you will not have yet understood what real acting looks like and the socalled storyline wont trouble you either as it moves along predictably like one of your enid blyton bookslook out for some wellsignposted scary bits you will know well in advance as the music will get really tense with lots of screechy violins get ready for a loud bit when the director hits you with something sort of dark it might make you jump so hold on tight to your mums hand she might be asleep at this point so wake her up and tell her something happenedabout two thirds of the way through it will go into an amusing final third where everything is what we call spooky and blurry with a man wandering about in a mystical place called further he has a torch which in true horror film style he shines mostly in his own face this might be the time to ask your mum if you can have an ice cream when i foolishly watched this film this is the point i left the cinema for refreshmentand never came backjust be sure to tell your mum if you intend to do the same stick to disney kid probably scarier than this,astonish
is totally in my list of favourite horror movie i will not say that this will be the greatest horror movie ever but the cinematography is great and makes the whole mundane plot seems interesting and manage to crap the hell out of mei hate it when some socalled horror movies use old cheap tricks like the creepy music or sound effects to compensate their poor performance i watched many scary movies and is the one that really made it sound and seems so real that it allows audience relate to it i was expecting to see some people died in horrible way where their guts and bloods are everywhere and floor splashed with red tomato juices youll never have to see that kind of scene in here they keep it as close as possible for you to relate in your real life and in your room while you are struggling to sleep,astonish
wow i just finished watching and my mind is blown the movie was simply awesome from the story and writing to the acting and surprise ending delivers on all accounts this isnt your typical haunted house ghost story instead its something new and unique that even the most seasoned horror veterans should be able to enjoy i found the film to be well balanced between storytelling and horror elements additionally the pacing was just right for me plenty of thrills and chills within though dont expect a brutal slasher filled with gore instead you will find a thoughtfully crafted ghost horror thriller that is sure to please watch it now,astonish
two stars is being generous maybe they could have done something with this movie but it ended up being very forcibly random rather than deeply obscure it got to the point about 20 minutes until the end where i was pretty far into some games on my phone out of boredom and i looked up like how is this still going what can they possibly torture me with for twenty more minutes but theyll find some more crap to throw at you dont worry at least the twist at the end is okay though entirely expected thats where the extra star comes in otherwise it would be onei consider myself a connoisseur of weirddisturbingcreepy movies this is not anywhere near being any of those things if you consider yourself a lover of deep creepiness who yearns for the movie that will leave you still thinking when you should be sleeping then you need to run screaming from this movietldr version why did i waste my time watching this i could have been staring at a wall,astonish
this movie is boring and painful to watch the acting is mediocre at best with the father in particular showing the emotional range of a clam the story is trite i kept waiting for some kind of kicker that would make the movie worth watching but was left at the end feeling id wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my lifethere are many bad horror movies made but most of them at least try to compensate for bad acting and stupid plots with lots of sex gore or both this one has neitheri cant believe theyre making a sequel who are the people who would actually want to watch this do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this and from the sequel,astonish
i am a horror aficionado ive seen the greats from the 70s and 80s i like most subgenres even the slow burners like the exorcist and the shiningi dont like criticizing films for the sake of it but i could find not a single redeeming quality in this movie to even acknowledge its simply bad there is a distinct lack of ambiance complemented by abysmal acting and a laughably terrible script youd think that somehow the film would compensate for this by being intentionally campy or having a sense of humor but it doesnt its just a forgettable sequence of events before the finale that spoon feeds you the missing plotthe characters are entirely forgettable and lacking any semblance of personality which could be forgiven if they were the canvas of an amazing mythos or served to somehow advance the story but even in that regard the movie fails entirelyi cannot understand why people like this movie at all save your moneytime and give this steaming pile of crap a wide berth,astonish
is a horror movie about an average family haunted with supernatural forces that possess a natural tendency to open lots of doors and make funny noises most fans of this subgenre will praise it not because it is an excellent film but because the ones that came before it are infinitely much worse have you seen the haunting in connecticutthe unlucky family in this horror film is the five members of the lambert family each of them is terrorized by a mysterious creature but most unlucky is young dalton who is in a deep sleep and would not wake up a doctor says that he isnt in a coma a psychic claims that his spiritual body is trapped in another dimension she likes to call the further daltons parents josh and renai are to say the least confused whether any of these explanations makes sense or not is not a major concern because the story mainly serves as an opening to provide scaresis conscious of the genres obvious clichs but it avoids some of them by conforming to an unhelpful alternative idea that is soon to be a clich itself characters living in haunted houses are often so traumatized by the ghouls that they forget about the possible action of you know leaving the house the lambert family makes the practical decision of abandoning their home early on in the film only to have their efforts thwarted when they are told that its not the house thats haunted but their son oooooooo so instead of one haunted house we get two haunted housesread more here httplocalmoviereviewcommoviereview,astonish
this is my first review at imdb and the reason im writing one is because of a review i checked here saying it was so scary that i would not get sleep and that it falls in league with the exorcistthis movie had so much potential to be a good horror movie it started off really well with me being haunted by the mere intro however inbetween you find yourself thinking  such a pity this is where it stops being scary  the actors were horrible the dad being the worst followed by the dads mother the psychic and mainly the kid in the coma they werent believable to the point that you can feel like youre watching someone act rather than feeling like youre watching a horror movie the movie falls flat when they introduce the realm of the further and start talking about astral projections the apparitions were funny and oh my god flaming lizard man takes the cake i actually started laughing when the dad enters the further i gave the movie a 310 because as horrible as it is the movie still has decent starts that will make u jump a bit other than that it will not leave you with nightmares or keep you awake in the night i can say now that i will be sleeping peacefully and i can even go to the bathroom with the lights off what a waste of time,astonish
typical haunted something or other movie strange kid only the motherwife knows about it dadhusband is of course clueless a teacher and staying away from home as much as possible affair with student who knows strange vaguely menacing mother in law also young family living in a huge house beyond any practical ability to own it the irritating thing though is the sound theres a crying baby practically nonstop through the first half hour and anything scary that happens is so loud and so oddly edited that its boring i think its going more for irritating than scary about halfway through the sort of give up and throw a bunch of new characters into the mix for no clear reason at all,astonish
the trailer is very good and makes you want to watch the movie although it spoils a few things so better to avoid if you can the first half in the first house is superbly done building up suspense making you unsure what to expect and basically making you focus on the corners of the screens away from the characters to anticipate what might appear this wheres waldo game starts in the credits where some of pictures have something that shouldnt be there or moving scares relied on creepy sounds shadows inanimate objects moving and quick glimpses of human shapes and faces where they shouldnt be so traditional stuff but it was creepy and i was buying it then not long after the start of the second half something weird happened as the more things got supernatural the less i was involved the less i was unnerved to the point of being quite calm near the end that big problem especially for a horror film supposed to be climaxing might have been caused by 3 possible things the introduction of comic relief nerd exorcists the shift from haunted house story to possession story and showing too much of the entities as in lingering too longspeaking of which some of the most memorable parts involved a redfaced demon appearing quickly where it shouldnt be and as a shadow later on near the end the more you saw of him the less disturbing he became showing the limitations of his design so we have a twoheaded beast film here the first half of the movie scarier more subtle even would be a 8 for remarkable the second half flashier less scary yet still entertaining would be a 4 for slightly below average the acting from the family was decent the acting from the paranormal investigators especially the old woman sometimes veered close to caricature jump scares werent cheap false alert ones and some clichs were intentionally avoided as heard in the extras there was some blood but not anything gory or physically disgusting the bluray extras all put together are a paltry 20 minutes long if you like that kind of film you could be doing worse than renting this one but i wouldnt buy it sight unseenrating 6 out of 10 good,astonish
is a strange movie i cant remember being initially so unsettled by a horror movie for a long time maybe white noise all those years ago the first viewing of paranormal activity perhaps but it soon descends into a ripoff of more than one classic horror and ends up being almost a word for word rewrite of poltergeist the eerie moving furniture the parent having to enter the netherworld to retrieve the child the ageing female medium that can see the dead and her two buffoon like cohorts that walk around with their ghostbuster wands walk to my voice only you can save him and so on at the end if skeletons had risen from an underground graveyard id have laughed out loud but thankfully there was some saving grace in the ending even there though its well enough done but its not a shock in fact id suggest that anyone who didnt see it coming is at best very new to horrorso why the 6 rating because its a product of its time its not original in fact its so unoriginal with regard to one particular film that it will be viewed as almost a joke movie to some but as a standalone scary film and especially if youre young or new to horror its quite creepy at first and a reasonable stab at the genre i do wish it had lived up to its start not been so predictable and not been so overtly a remake of poltergeist but i guess its hard to be truly original in horror nowadays,astonish
james wan and leigh whannell return with a love letter to the haunted house genre if you are well versed in cinema there will be very little to surprise you at first books off the bookcase baby monitors looking through cameras etc the build up is impressive but too familiar lingering shots down long corridors cutting to each family member sleeping plus a leaky faucet it gets tiring after a while as you can predict when things will or wont happen when stuff does happen it can be very effective the first major attack was awesome but it quickly gets annoying at the stupid actions of characters never do they call a specialist for their comatose son they never call the police etc they seem to accept the fact its a haunting just so the film can move faster we also get some contradictions in character where wilson is all brave and checking out the house and then he stops coming home at night the film often jumps into the unexpected with some subtle scares that people may not even notice this is when it works best as the camera moves around and there are images to notice but are not pointed out many times it became a great movie but then quickly dropped down into an average horror i respect the practical effects and the restraint on gore and for the kind of horror it is this is done very well its creepy and then darth maul turns up it goes from haunted house to paranormal fantasy but would i ever watch it again probably so,astonish
i would like to start with the things that may set you off in this film like the bad ass demon that is a mix from that red faced dude in the lame ass phantom menace nightcrawler from xmen a weird goat and krugers claws but it definitely worksnext the music the music has a huge role in this movie for instance in the beginning there was a shot of a window and a tree outside and i got really freaked out by the music next stop the people in the furter those were some really freaky characters with psychotic smilesthe cgis are amazing everything looks real and very scary the plot is nothing new and yet is originaldont know how that happened i havent watched that good of a scary movie in a long time the only thing that came close was the reremake of fright nightoverall will i watch this movie again  yes will i be freaked out by the end of it  yes,astonish
this movie is definitely one of my favorite horror movies when id first seen the preview i thought hmm looks like it could be scary but i got a lot more than i expected im not going over exaggerate but this is the scariest movie i have ever seen some might pick at it so they dont get scared but seriously just watch it dont expect anything good or bad of it the way things popped up and how they looked were terrifying and i typically dont get scared by movies and can predict most of whats going to happen but when i saw it in theaters by the 2nd half of the movie i was balled up in my sweatshirt especially when it was coming closer to the end was overall very good very scary in my opinion and had great freaky music but the only reason i didnt give this a 10 is because i thought that the characters seemed a bit awkwardly written is a nightmarish movie that still has me afraid to be alone in the dark at times,astonish
when this film came out there was a huge buzz around its material since the work stems from the saw writer and director being a huge fan of that classic series i was always interested what the duo would come up with next an impressive movie is spawned good choice of child actors and an all rounded mystery spoof made it worthwhilenow theres the negativeoveruse of basic sound effects such as a screeching door or the eerie creaks of floorboards made me feel less invested the fear factor was surprisingly minimal in comparison to the standards ive adored in the past with the likes of james wan in some of the quick shots thats the best two worded phrase i can use to describe them theres a poor use of camera work that makes it go from your standard cinematic look to some low budget poop the creature that possessed the child has a striking resemblance to darth maul and this is coming from a non star wars fan from the skin tone clothing and pigmentation a skinnier version to be more specific only with goat hoofs im guessing thats to give a more neolithic satan lookalthough i myself do not believe in the supernatural as im an atheist at least this movie challenged my perception somewhat in dealing with the subject matter of astral travelling granted ive trashed it quite a lot with its flaws as you read above with that said the plot did thicken from time to time and its not like i wanted to tune out in boredomso in conclusion depending on your personal standpoint of film knowledge or how far your willing to be a believer plays a big part in how much or how little you enjoy this piece for me i just hope leigh who by the way had a hilarious role and james come up with something unique in the future like their previous accomplishments instead of being 1 hit wonder inventors that end up going down the spooky jesus avenue of predictable outcomes cough cough toby hooper cough coughas alwaystake it as you will,astonish
the film sets you up in a very comfortable setting making you believe nothings wrong but it gives you a very bad sense because you as the viewer already know where the film is going when you least expect it things happen and its not the creatures themselves that scare you its the anticipation that they will scare you but theres a twist when the creatures or entities appear they dont scare you they tempt you to thinking that their about to do something horrifying instead they scare you later  im usually never scared of a film but this one gave me goosebumps the hairs on my arm never came down and my eyes were glued to the screen i highly recommend fellow horror film fans to watch this especially the classic horror film lovers,astonish
i really liked the first half of moviethere were two scene that made me jump in the movie and there were some really good tense and creepy scenebut half way into movie i didnt like were the story went i dont what to say anything as i dont what to ruin it for anyone who not seen itit kinda of borrows a lot of really good old horror movie that start with the letter pfor me its picks up just near the end of the movie again which i did not see coming at all really liked that scenethe acting was really good from most of the cast 6 out of 10,astonish
with a production budget of a mere 15 million and a worldwide gross at the box office of over 92 million an independent horror picture was famously and surprisingly the most profitable film of 2011 written and directed by the same team that created 2004s saw another hugely popular horror filmscreenwriter leigh whannell and director james wanthe picture is undeniably creepy and should manage to please most genre fans in it we meet renai and josh lambert rose byrne and patrick wilson both excellent here the parents of two young sons and a baby daughter and having just moved into a new luxury home their lives are upended when their oldest boy dalton slips into a threemonthlong coma and bizarre manifestations start occurring in their house convinced that their abode is haunted the lamberts move to a new domicile which appallingly only makes matters worse fortunately joshs mother nice to see barbara hershey still looking mighty fine on screen again is able to put them in touch with a trio of what the general population might call ghost busters leading to a battle royale against the clamoring otherdimensional demons who are attempting to claim dalton for their ownin a film with countless chilling moments and the less said about them the better i suppose for prospective viewers several stand out those photographs for example and those supercreepy voices heard over the baby monitor im getting a little prickly just thinking about them head ghost buster elise rainier well played by lin shaye almost steals the show with her alternately gentle and steely ways and her two assistants specs and tucker played by whannell himself and angus sampson provide what little humor and lightheartedness the film has to offer wan still early in his career demonstrates that he is already a pro at generating chills and suspense especially in the films masterful first third while joseph bisharas discordantscreechy soundtrack is as freaky as they come it might also be added makes the best use of a tiny tim song in this case his late 60s classic tiptoe through the tulips sincewell i suppose since tim sang therell always be an england for the isle of wight crowd in the message to love documentary indeed i find that i only have one quibble with this truly unnerving film which i sincerely regret not having watched on the big screen namely many of the scenesespecially toward the end as josh explores the furtherare woefully underlit while im sure this wasnt an issue in theaters on a normal television screen many of the fine and subtle details of this otherdimensional zone might be lost still the film manages to work even at home it is assuredly a powerful picture right to its stunning twist ending and does have a cumulatively chilling effect the film turns out to be well named ly you may find yourself being creeped out before you even know it,astonish
now i think everyone can agree that the last decade of horror movies has just been one remake and grossout after another nothing has lived up to the expectations of the originals as well as nothing original has come out its usually something weve always seen before however it really isnt the fault of the use of dilapidated old houses or mansions every now and then its more from the clichs and no feelings for any characters because the filmmakers have been mostly trying to gross us out instead of trying to make time to create people we care about as well as to do what horror movies should do and that is to scare us yet it was in 2007 when paranormal activity came out i caught a glimpse of the future of horror it replaces saw as the halloween movie to see and now we are at last getting something good from these places called film studios drag me to hell definitely kept things going in the right direction in 2009 and now we have horror movies are finally as well as unbelievably getting better and is just another reason why we shouldnt give up horror moviesthe story is pretty straightforward a family moves into this old house then strange things start happening as well as their son falling into coma of course you would think the haunting has something to do with it but you never know with these movies sometimes at first it looks like the same old kind of horror story you find from the masters of horror series but it progresses from that into a full blown horror movie that made me jump squirm and even almost scream even though i didnt scream i still said oh my god maybe a hundred times this definitely went beyond my expectationsbut its hard to find the perfect movie for its genre and there are a few minor problems one being that the strength of the film kinda lightens up in the last act but still maintains some of the eeriness of the rest of it my last complaint is that when the last act starts coming to an end you can pretty much guess how its going to end now with any other movie these would be the problems that could possibly destroy it and actually those rules dont apply to the film is held up by its eerie atmosphere that grabs you from the very beginning and the talented actors to relate to you by being normal peoplethe film is actually a collaboration from the creator of paranormal activity and the creators of saw you would think that such a collaboration would be disastrous but it actually was probably one of the smartest collaborations since wes craven worked with kevin williamson on the scream movies first two and the fourth there is no gore which surprised me considering the saw creators were in on it or even any blood at all the movie does what scary movies should do and that is to scare and not grossout so while there are some problems is probably one of the scariest movies of the year and helps create something original out of the so frequently used ghost stories with haunted old houses and thats what is so good about it shows that most of the time its not the setting or the story that makes horror movies bad it can be the filmmakers and no inspiration put into it so i just hope that this can be a model for other horror movies and show that there is originality in what was once an almost dead genre,astonish
spoiler at very bottom will be labelled as suchit takes quite a bit for me to actually consider a movie scary or even creepy very few horror movies i consider truly scary the only movies that i can think of off the top of my head that i actually found frightening were event horizon keep in mind i was 11 when i saw it the exorcism of emily rose and the ring anything else i found to be boring a rip off of something else or at very least an entertaining film but not scary the main problem is that most modern horror movies feel that they have to have something scary happen in pretty much every scene it gets so tedious and takes no time to build up tension then of course theres films like the saw series who think gore is scary its not scary its disgusting and uninterestingthen along came i chose to skip seeing it in the theatre when i heard that james wan director of the first saw was helming the project that being said i did think dead silence another one of his movies was pretty creepy but i decided i hadnt seen any ghost movies in a while and the worst thing that could happen was that i would get a laugh out of it so i picked the movie up on bluray cheap and watched it that night boy was i glad i did this film did everything right went against pretty much every clich i know writer leigh wannell said he had a list of horror clichs so he could avoid using them the pacing atmosphere timing of scares was all perfect also there was a significant amount of showing us lots of stuff but not really showing us which i thought worked amazingmy only issue wasspoiler belowthe need for a downer openended finale im okay with ambiguous endings but when a family has more or less literally gone through hell im okay with a happy ending but thats me,astonish
a fantastic original scary movie i didnt see it in theaters but i still jumped i probably would have peed my pants if i saw it in theaters the music is perfect and it is played through out the movie at the right to make it even scarier the movie starts out at a wife and her husband move into a house with their three children then the family starts to see ghosts and demons while i was watching it i thought of the amity ville horror and thought it was going to be another haunted house movie but then the family moved back to their old house and they keep seeing these demons then you know its not an ordinary paranormal movie its something more since its from the creators of saw you know there will be a twist at the end and there is just not a huge one like saw its more like a wow not an omg ending,astonish
it has been a long time since i got so scared by watching a movie this movie does exactly that scare the sht out of you and when you least expect it tothe plot of the movie is about a family which suffers from the ghastly happenings that follow after their eldest son falls into some kind of a coma how they struggle and how far they go to get him back is what the story is about the cast was good the effects were excellent and the direction of james wan was fabulous there are a handful of freaky jump scenes like i said before when you expect them the least well this you see in many moviesbut what makes this movie different is its atmosphere the art design was so haunting and bizarre this movie doesnt make you just scream a few times and leave you it stays with you it haunts you it comes to you before you get fast asleepall this it does with a little amount of goreactually theres really no gore when you compare it to other contemporary horror films this is what makes a darn good thriller and there is this climax which is utterly unexpectedthis movie is a must watch for any one who loves a good horror movie also you will know that this movie is successful when you look around and check your surroundings before going to sleepand you will trust me d,astonish
basically a reboot or ripoff of poltergeist the exorcist the entity the sentinel ect barbara hershey even has a part in this movie just so the director can acknowledge how much he is ripping off the entity overall a simple plot with plenty of jump scares and loud noises to add excitement to an otherwise lazy by the book horror film,astonish
very scary creepy throughout pretty good story amazing horrorthemed score contributed significantly to the creepy tone good acting 2 viewings,astonish
if youre really into horror movies and you want to get the daylights scared out of you and stay on edge the whole entire movie chapter 1 will knock your socks off this psychological thriller plays with your mind and knows how to get you frightened as the music of the film builds makes your skin crawl and the acting is so superb that you really get a feel for the situations to come during the blockbusterthe movie begins immediately with a group of violins playing high pitched tune to really set the tone for the movie as the tone stays the same for the entire movie and you will not be off edge at any point during the film the plot begins with a married couple named josh and renai lambert moving into a new home recently and their son named dalton going into an unexplainable coma as his vital signs are normal and there are no signs of damage even though he fell from a ladder in the attic the fact that the cause of the coma is unknown causes a lot of stress on the family and renai lambert specifically is looking for anything that could answer as to why dalton went into a coma then one day joshs mother lorraines friend elise then tells the couple that dalton isnt in a medically induced coma rather he had apparently been able to travel to other planes and dimensions he had apparently traveled too far to the point where he couldnt come back and that his physical body is here but his spiritual body isnt elise then states that the only way to get dalton back is to have josh go back into the further due to how he is also able to astral project just like dalton elise puts josh in a trance so that hes able to enter the plane known as the further josh eventually gets to the demons lair and finds dalton there and they both evade the demon attacking them and they both get back into their bodies and just barely get back in time after all of the action filled scenes towards the end of the film the film portrays a much calmer mood as the high pitched screechy violin music stops and instead peaceful music was playing this all abruptly ends with a cliffhanger when josh gets possessed and strangles elise to death and renai finds a photo of josh with a demon lady behind him showing that he is possessed and thats where the film endsthe music easily was the best part and made the movie what it is if it werent for the music that they used it wouldnt reel in viewers as well and it likely wouldnt get the viewers attention for the whole entire movie as did it continues throughout the movie keeping me on the edge of my seat in addition to show how good is in my opinion note that the director of also directed legendary horror movies such as saw and the conjuring  both of these psychological thrillers made an insane amount of money in the box officethe only negative that i had about this film was that they made some scenes a little too dramatic when they didnt need it to be like for example in one scene early in the movie they show the lambert family getting for ready for the day and the feel of the scene gave off a very intense and stressful vibe to it and it was unnecessary because it was early in the movie and there was no drama going on at allif you truly want to see a great psychological thriller that really plays with your mind and knows how to toy with it creating excitement the movie that would fit that desire would be chapter 1 the music sets the movie up perfectly with its skincrawling and eerie vibe the way the movie makes you feel the characters situations and overall how spooked anyone will get while watching this masterpiece its a great ride,astonish
is a 2010 paranormal horror film that tells one of the most thought provoking stories in horror history this is not your typical family terrorized by demon or poltergeist movie itself presents one of the most unique methods of storytelling by introducing factors that have feel like they have never been introduced before it james wan and leigh whannell did an absolute spectacular job on this project and is easily one of my all time favorite projects of theirs if you either love horror films or have an interest in them then there is absolutely no reason why you shouldnt check this one out youre just simply cheating yourself,astonish
this chiller opens as josh and renai lambert move into their new house with young sons dalton and foster and cali their baby daughter shortly afterwards dalton falls in the attic he doesnt appear badly hurt but the next day he doesnt wake up he appears to be in a coma but the doctors cant identify the reason his condition doesnt change and three months later he returns home to be looked after there soon afterwards renai starts hearing noises and then seeing things convinced the house is haunted they move to a new house the occurrences dont stop in fact they get worse leading to the lamberts calling in to professionalswhen i watched this i expected it to be really scary as it had been recommended by a friend who is into horror films i didnt find it quite as scary as i hoped but it had effective moments and a good creepy atmosphere the setup is impressive as it nicely suggests that we are in for a haunted house film before changing tack and giving us the real reason while this definitely isnt a comedyhorror there are a few good laughs that lighten the tone just before it darkens again the cast is solid patrick wilson and rose byrne impress as the lamberts and lin shaye is equally impressive as expert as elise rainier overall id say if you want gore this will disappoint but if you prefer creepymenacing horror like poltergeist or the more recent the babadook then id definitely recommend this,astonish
this was so stupid i was laughing at one point until about a little over halfway in i was thinking this isnt bad its not scary at all but its kept me interested however whens it gonna get terrifying alas it didnt get scarier it got dumber i dont know how these actors kept straight faces throughout this film i wouldve been laughing so hardsummaryfamilyweird stuff starts happening in houseoldest son becomes lost in the furthermom calls in some lady who can see the spiritspatrick wilson has astral projection abilities tooyada yada yadarequisite demon with sharp claws and hooveslots of running and spiritsthings dont make sensewait what ok more runningfollow voice of wifethey make it back safebut wait nope turns out dad got possessed by an old lady spirit when he was in the further who terrorized him when he was youngerhe chokes out lady who can see the spiritspatrick wilson tells his wife im here but all she sees is the old lady whos really a manblah blah blahcreditsoh wait yep they included the requisite jump scare after the credits rollgreat now theyll be sequels galoreweee whew for a minute there i thought we were in danger of somebody having an original thought but nope turns out were still addicted to mediocrity all is well in the worldaaaandscene,astonish
i admit when the movie started and when i first sawed the old woman in the beginning i thought the movies was going to be dumb but i was totally wrong this movie is scary and has a great backstory the plot of the movie is very original it is about a little boy who suddenly slipped into a coma but in reality his spirit left his physical body because he traveled too far into a place called the the further but at first his parents wasnt aware of this happening soon after dalton slipped into a coma strange things started happening around the house i noticed in this whole movie there wasnt no blood or sex but this movie still ended up on my top favorites if you love horror movies or even if you dont please check this movie out,astonish
this 2010 horror film stars patrick wilson rose byrne barbara hershey leigh whannell angus sampson and lin shaye this tells of josh lambert wilson his wife renai byrne and their 3 children who have just moved into their new home soon renai starts seeing and hearing strange things and one of her sons dalton ty simpkins ends up in a coma renai is convinced the house may be haunted but with the help from joshs mom lorraine hershey she hires her longtime friend elise rainier shaye a gifted psychic who is familiar with the spiritual world the further where dark spirits inhabit and daltons spirit is held prisoner with joshs help she tries to get dalton back whannell and sampson play specs and tucker paranormal experts who are elises assistants this isnt bad and the cast is ok the film does share similarities with poltergeist and the grudge but i still recommend checking it out,astonish
the classic retro horror atmosphere of this movie is superb for me personally any horror fanatic worth his salt should know that scary often comes from great direction and production not the ability to make blood splatter and this is where this movie does it for menot only has a great plot carried out by a great cast it also has an enjoyable feel all the way throughyou can be smiling one moment and wide eyed the nexta personal favourite i can watch again and again,astonish
is another one to follow this late horror film tendency which started with the conjuring to throw all the classic horror film elements onto the grill and shamelessly pretend to achieve something new or fresh actually not achieving anything at allas it starts you can already take your notebook out and start checking on your clich list old widow ghost check moving to an old haunted house check baby monitors check childs drawings check rocking toy horse check skeptical father kid ghost twins ghost gothic vampire ghost esoteric technicians installing monitors esoteric rites the only missing stuff was the monster of dr frankenstein the mummy and green slime dripping off the wallsafter all that mess you get to see the father go into the beyond to rescue his child from a pedophile bondage sex loving demon which instead of horrifying is ridiculous and cheesy as it can get and predictably an evil twist the end which of course is the trampoline production wanted to leave there in order to have a stating point for the obvious sequels because you never want to stop milking the cookie cutter horror films cowseriously this film is far from horror is mostly an exercise for cinema students on how much used resources and clichs can ruin the very fabric of art think of this how many changes should yo make to this film to turn it into a scary movie 9 or even an adventure time episode not many thats how not scary it is,astonish
is a decent movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic castthe movie is certainly not as scary as i thought it was going to bemainly because many people were recommending it to me and telling me i would be at the edge of my seat all the way throughbut to be honestwhenever something scary was going to happen the music and atmosphere let you know it was coming and made you feel too ready to be scaredi did really appreciate that this movie was filmed a lot like an old school horrorthe music is very hitchcocklike and it relies on its characters a lot instead of just a spooky atmospherecertainly unique for the horrors of todayits not an outstanding scary moviebut it is still at times quite thrilling and i would recommend to anyone looking for a good horror to kill some time a couple are plagued by a series of ghostly visions after their young son falls in to a comabest performance patrick wilson worst performance barbara hershey,astonish
when horror films decide to get into the other side discussion they need to be very careful ive enjoyed films such sinister and shutter because they let spirits be spirits and dont try to explain the unexplainable i know many of you liked the fact that moves us closer to the unknown by trying to visualize the other side but to me it backfired i do however see the idea and vision and i think the reason why its been positively reviewed is because of exactly that so credit should go to wan if should have been successful in its attempt there should have been a waaay more scary monster than darth maul a stronger build up the viewer should have asked himherself more questions regarding the plot before it was all spilled to us in a 3 minute monologue and there should have been stronger acting performances there is still one horror movie above anyone else a tale of two sisters and does not change that it is however a refreshing attempt with its moments hence 6 out of 10,astonish
this movie gives the paranormal genre a bad name its an insult really the warping of the classic spirits haunting people communicating with children and giving the other side a dumb name and insinuating theres more than one is just atrocious also too many people cant even figure out the plot line and when thats the case then you know the movie is worthlessthe fact that they have made a sequel means they know there are stupid people out there willing to waste money on trash its the same philosophy behind all the fast and furious movies the first two maybe three were ok but now theres what 7 enough is enough,astonish
i mean the whole ghosts were very poorly done was it lack of budget the special effects dudes werent top notch i dont know but they looked really stupid like a small town fair horror house on the other hand the demon well it was stupid too he really looked badly done with badly makeup in fact you could even tell a little bit the actor portraying him or that it was all makeup bad bad badbut this movie scared me because of something horror movie lack this days the sound editing was great superb really annoying and scary the sound was great but everything else the characters the plot the special effects and the funny ghostbusters dudes was bad bad badi rate this movie 210,astonish
i recently watched the film i found many parts frightening such as when rose byrne hears threatening whispering voices on the baby monitor and lots of other disturbing scenes was rated 14a which i think wasnt appropriate i think that it should of got a pg with sub headlines of disturbing scenes and not recommended for young children i think this because i have seen pg horror movies that are much scarier because they are actually realistic almost all of the disturbing and scary scenes were extremely farfetched and unrealistic which makes it less is frightening and has many scenes which make you jump but is great for a first horror movie and for ages 11 and up,astonish
is yet another one of those hollywood ghost stories involving a possessed child it follows a predictable format with minor isolated incidents gradually giving way to largerscale more pronounced apparitions and events before culminating in a fullscale onslaught of evil and its all rather sillyi enjoyed the first half of the movie its here where things are kept subtle and straightforward with effectively creepy scare scenes and halfglimpsed figures spotted lurking in darkened rooms so far so good but around the halfway mark the film introduces a trio of paranormal investigators and things quickly descent into poltergeiststyle farcethe problem with depictions of a hellish limbo or netherworld is that in order to make something scary you have to pretty much identify with the different fears of each viewer sorry but i dont find tussles with greasylooking hobos and darth maul from the phantom menace to be particularly frightening in fact theres something pantomime about the whole thingthe actors including the dependable rose byrne and patrick wilson do their best but at times in the latter stages they seem to struggle to keep a straight face while the ludicrous events increase in scale and speed its a shame that the whole thing goes to pot because if it had been handled more sensitively and with less sensationalism by the team behind the saw franchise then it could well have worked much better,astonish
its been a while since i saw a scary movie and recently while watching a trailer of sinister i came upon a title called and was eager to watch this movie and saw a lot of people posting lot of good reviews sayinwill ve trouble sleepin at night no offense but it seriously lacked the the quality to spook you outthere maybe max 1 or 2 scenes where you ve a lil hope of getting scared but thats it the movie lacks the depth that can portray itself as a horror genre movie the physicists and the investigators are absolutely ridiculous and at one point felt really lame  i personally think they tried doing something like shining but failed miserably i had great expectations seeing these reviews but honestly speaking i ve never been scared since grudge or juon anyways i dunno about other reviews but i personally didnt get spooked out the way other people have portrayed it if you are the kinda person who really wanted to get spooked out m aging stressing itsave your 2 hours of life and watch somethin bettertotal let down,astonish
is not a haunted house movie this is something that the movie tagline and all of its ads trumpet but it still treats it as a major revelation so for the first 45 minutes or so were forced through the umpteenth rehash of amityville with the same stock characters and cheap scares one would expect from james saw wan well thats not entirely fair  it avoids wans penchant for blood and gore but doubles down on loud noises and quick flashes of something that wouldnt look very scary in the light im fine with a bit of misdirection even an extended pretense at being a different type of movie  hell i loved audition  but when this lasts for half the film and is as bad as this is it has to be regarded as a failurewhen we finally get to the actual cause of the spooky events things pick up a bit its still not exactly a good movie but its a fairly entertaining one replete with longheld secrets and weird spirits creates its own mythology and its expectedly unwieldy but still more interesting than what it was before its still braindead but for about half an hour its thoroughly addictive popcorn farebut the characters are too generic and the baddie too vague to ultimately sustain interest and the de riguer twist ending is just tiresome what gets me is that its not as though the extended misdirection is even necessary for or builds suspense to the entertaining halfhour that is the peak of maybe wan wouldnt have been able to extend that second act to feature length but at least he could try as it is doesnt fulfill its ambitions and spends most of its time shooting itself in the foot the fact that this has been described by some as the best horror of the year doesnt speak well for the genre,astonish
oh my mother tried to warn me about you you smooth talking little pg13 number i had my guard up too i wasnt about to let your first and second acts woo me into a false sense of security after all this isnt my first rodeo you know i know better than this i really do you came on strong and told me everything that i wanted to hear you provided an easy to follow plot with plenty of tension and well acting you had me all figured out a couple of drinks later and im naked in a truck stop bathroom trying to find my cell phone and the faint hint of ether still hangs in the air i thought you loved me ok now that ive been to group and have the emotional tool sets to cope lemme give you my real review hold on what i meant to say is  let me preface my review i am in the business of horror movies i have seen the good the bad the weird and the batshit intolerable ones an homage to me at this point is useless most modern horror films are already homages minus the self awareness that makes them endearing  see my scream 4 review thus now beginneth the odyssey that is my mixed feelings on gets so much right that i cant seem to understand why im finding it so hard to look past its flaws opens with such an oppressive heavy feeling of dread that its hard not to be affected by the tone of this picture it is the tone of that automatically draws you into it it establishes a universe that is easy to believe and easy to live in for the duration of the film it is a universe very much like our own with a couple who could easily be your next door neighbors they are unspectacular and ordinary in all the right ways and add to the general believability that is one of s many strengthsmake no mistake works it works so well on so many different levels that it feels like little more then a cheap shot when i start to point out its weaknesses i love the paranormal for all its nerdy chicanery the world of the paranormal is still a fun and provocative place maybe it is my decade long inundation of this world that ultimately starts to pull me out of the universe you see i am more of a journey than a destination guy endings rarely give me the kind of gratification that getting there does dont let this disuade you from trying ladies ziiiiing the further the mystical pangea that connects our world to another for those unluckiest of astral travelers who reach it works better as an unseen threat the moment we enter the further we enter into a navigable world with rules guidelines and limitations it is here that s creep factor starts to drop off sharply one of the good things about is that it has come out in a time where the horror genre is so steeped in pointless torture porn clones that even when it comes dangerously close to ripping off some of its predecessors again sometimes an homage in all its flattery can still seem unnecessary when the plot device mimicked is a central crux to the story it is almost welcomein all sincerity there are many many good things about including all of the fine performances turned in from patrick wilson rose byrne and the rest of the cast including barbara hershey it is lin shaye that does a pretty good zelda rubinstein and makes her part one of the most memorable sad it is though i will always remember her from the farrelys brothers kingpin  what is it about good sex that always makes me have to crap s score is really the trump card here joseph bishara has brought the heebyjeebies and his agame giving every moment of the film a lush texture of anxiety and fear for those of you that miss the films finer visual points its hard to knock this soundtrack one of the better ive heard from a horror offering in years is memorable even if some of those memories may seem a little borrowed recommended,astonish
best horror movie of the year that ive seen is and example of how a pg13 horror film can work it isnt a bloodbath and doesnt constantly throw false jump scares on youthis film actually builds suspense and then hits you with something truly terrifying much like the paranormal activity franchise there were two really good jump scares in this film that made me scream one of them i even saw coming that is how good this movie isand the ending actually creeped me out i wanna know what happens to these people please fan fiction save me810,astonish
just happened i bought this movie and i watchrumor say that this show get high rating so i decide to watch but does not creep me out and make me close my eyes and not give me some thrill but it give me want to know the ending that it ok i give some short summary about this movie is about the father and his son has ability sleep walk to the spirit world dimension and some very nasty spirit want their body and his son trap in spirit world dimension only his father can rescue him if this movie transform as pc game like fear and silent hill i definitely play ityes this movie too fiction and very faking the boy acting so down to the drain i think this movie is not creep you up bot just some lame entertainment horror movie in the end i hope this movie is best if convert as game,astonish
i will say that most of these reviews are correct about it does borrow a lot from other films no there are no academy award winning performances no its not the exorcist all that being said for the so called movie review experts here on imdb lets remember what movies are for they are for entertainmentwhat this film wasnt was the waste of money some people state here come on guys this film was fun great camera work here akin to house on haunted hill awesome music combined with the odd camera angles makes for unsettling suspense i also liked the new angles on old conceptsthis movie ultimately does not take itself too seriously and that is important maybe thats what causes some fellow movie goers to go out of their way to rip this movie to shreds there are very serious horrors that are the comparisons the exorcist the sixth sense night of the living deadthese classics are for the most part totally humorless and damn scary does not fall into this bracket phantasm the evil dead nightmare on elm street poltergiestthese movies remind me a little of if you havent seen it its worth watching to judge for yourself people go way overboard with these reviews its not shawshanks redemption but its not superbabies 2 lol,astonish
he from the beginning the movie does a great job pulling out all the scary sound effects clichs for me the bit that had me on edge the most was the crying baby that would make even the hardest criminal crack though there were some good scary flashes i could stand to see more of the scary guy a bit and was a bit disappointed that no one died in the movie sorry the psychic woman doesnt count as a human being oh and by the way once you mention astral projection im thinking less about horror and more about a dd campaign where im rolling a d20 die to winnnnn she i like movie on the whole its unexpecting i did not expect they would move to another house i thought that the house was haunted the mother is beautiful the father is cute but i dont understand the ghost random ghosts like appearing from nowhere and especially the demon why the demon that is not related to a ghost story whatsoever but then again it kinda makes sense in the end in the end it gave me a kinda a creepkaiguo ok movie but nothing new kind of projection of several other movies ive seen before babies crying doors creaking know what i mean,astonish
the exorcist and poltergeist are obviously films which have burrowed themselves into the minds of wan and whannell and they have been reborn here into one chilling amalgamation spurred on by a jarring fractious musical score by joseph bishara and a memorable performance by lin shaye who plays a maternal but forceful spiritual medium with just the right tone and energybut also proves itself to be a genuine entry in the demonic possession film canon a unique sance sequence is both berserk and entertaining while the use of astral projection is a feature rarely used in horror movies and perhaps for good reason with the third act descending into silliness akin to a ghost ride set in an alternate dimension,astonish
this movie does have some jump scenes in it but i found it to be satirically hilarious the entire movie i was laughing and screaming consistently its absolutely bizarre and hilarious i cant imagine this wasnt a joke if it was this is brilliant if it wasnt oh well watch it anyway it was still funny definitely fun to watch definitely funny great movie to watch with friendsthe movie has kind of a cheap look to it and the costumes and special effects are absolutely terrible which just makes the entire movie more hilarious very solid acting unexceptional sound track dont think its not scary there are some very intense scenes but youre going to be laughing more than screaming enjoyable fun frightening can a movie get any better,astonish
i had quite low expectations for this film as i heard some reviews claim to be too lowbudget for a good scare film however i was interested as it was produced from the same people who produced and helped make paranormal activity and saw i then watched it with two friends and we were astounded from the very start there was little things little hints that lead to the climaxi think it has an interesting story as it starts off like paranormal activity became the exorcist somewhat and then transformed into poltergeist there were continuous situations that made me jump and eerie happenings that made me psychologically more aware i strongly advise you to see it but not alone there are twists and turns that present new light on the horror genre i think that will be the start of a brand new type of subgenre in horror,astonish
the first half of the film is a deeply unsettling experience the films particular strength is in its juxtaposing mundanity with the supernatural including some of the most nightmarish images ever seen sadly the plot fizzles out quite early on to be replaced by ineffective set pieces and while the performances are on the whole good later events lose credibility at times seeming comicalthe scares are mostly effective and although the plot does not hold up to later scrutiny it is commendable the film does not rely on gore to supply the shocksmuch to recommend it,astonish
i had heard many good things about this film in particular recently and considering the hype that many websites had about it so as most i began to watch it with an open mind with very little information about what the film was initially about hoping it would be a better surprise and my gosh it was some parts had cheesy fx however for the most of it it was a different storyline to most that i have seen of psychological horror one particular niggle i had about the film was the ghostspirits that were 1950s men and women for the costume and make up it was pretty shabby they were more like zombies than spirits and for the ending of the film it was quite a disappointment bad filming angles and lightingfx on the zombies other than that little niggle fantastic film great storyline great fx otherwise and overall a jumpy adrenaline based psychological horror to go in the pile of other greats ,astonish
from the start everyone was going crazy over this film everyone says that this was the scariest movie theyve ever seen i thought it would be the same when i first rented this i was quickly disappointed from the beginning it may have been different if the credits didnt take so long to go through the title in the beginning looked like it was from the 80s thats not the only problem i have with this moviethere were a lot of things that i feel if they were changed would have been scarier the music is just a bunch of broken violins that arent good on the ears they made the movie too predictableone bright spot was tiny tims appearance didnt make much sense but seemed to fit nicely if you are a horror freak maybe you will enjoy this for anyone who has told you this was the scariest movie ever thats going a little too far all in all it was great story to follow with a nice twist ending a few modifications this couldve been much better,astonish
james wans is an oddly disjointed film the first half is an extremely successful haunted house frightfest while the second half is an incredibly dense and illogical slog in any horror film of this type originality is not usually what youre going to get and you dont here either what you can hope for however is that the triedandtrue methods of creeping the audience out will be performed expertly which for the most part the filmmakers manage to do this is a composed and subdued horror film that relies on what you dont see as much as what you do to scare you surprising given that its brought to us by the screenwriter and director of saw read my full review at httpthemuddoctorblogspotcom201109html,astonish
nothing new amusing yes but it reminded me of the paranormal activity movies only without the real life experience created by the camera workdoes what it has to do at the right moments a few times i scared myself so much that i practically fell out of bed and awoke my girlfriend the acting was terrible i mean a bloodstain of a hand on my sons bed or strange men in my daughters bedroom would make me leave the house for good but i think the actors in this movie dont really believe in their own role they act scared but they dont mean it you know what i meanshortly a one time experience quickly forgotten excuse my bad spelling,astonish
i am flabbergasted that this film is getting the praise it is receiving i went into this movie only knowing that it was a horror film i had no expectations or preformed opinions i hoped i could have an open mind the beginning of the film gave it a feel of hitchcocksam raimi simple scenes black and white the worst parts of the violin being scraped at the sounds of a grand piano being smashed with a sledge hammer i applaud the composer of the soundtrack to which every bit of the three stars i gave are credited but the storycharactershorror fell flat almost immediately and soon after the fall the kookiness began it was all topped of with an attempt to bring in some unneeded comic relief i took the raimi approach but it was no use the director was serious about his choice to add this aspect to the film and wrong for doing soi hope no one hurts their eyes by going to see this film i can say if you would like buy a ticket to go see a good film and enjoy the first 3 minutes of this one while waiting for your film to start the music is well done but not well placed wasted on a crappy film,astonish
i saw this movie at a premiere and wanted so much to like it it started to build up quite nicely and then abruptly the movie takes a turn into hacksville driven by hamfist and his girl ms boringheavy handed introduction of comedy over explanation in your face scares which insinuate the audience is too stupid to get it on their own and an other realm which is boring as all get out even the supposed super bad guy was laughable because he looks like he was lifted right from another movie with all they could have done with the theme and the scare credit they had built up it was such a damned disappointment the best i can say it was like coffee which had too much sugar in it the thing that was supposed to accentuate it was overdone ruining itfinal analysis it did have a few shocks but they were muted in the end when they let the film go off target also the tagline on the poster gave it all away that is just poor judgment and quite sad to see,astonish
having read some of the positive reviews here i thought this movie would be scary i kind of had a bad feeling though as the opening credits rolled but i stuck with it the moment the ghost boy started dancing it became apparent this movie was trying very hard to be scary but failing in a big way it went downhill from there really a 50s biker ghost with gelled black hair a phantom menace style red face painted demon and later we had what seemed to be an attempt to imitate stanley kubricks shining style by introducing a scene where a few 1930s era ghosts sit on a couch and another ghost stood beside them with an ironing board ghostly whistling could be heard but no lips were moving this scene was supposed to be really scary but failed because it looked so out of place and the ghost makeup was just plain bad the creepy smiles on the faces of the ghosts were just plain sada previous reviewer stated that the acting was superb i suspect that person was either a friend of the director or had exceptionally low expectations the acting right from early on struck me as being somewhat inept the characters were poorly developed and you didnt really engage with them emotionally you didnt know enough about this family to really care one way or the otherwhen the ghost hunters were introduced it became clear this movie didnt know exactly what it wanted to be serious ghost movie or farcical comedy you see the ghost hunters were intended to bring comedy relief into what was supposedly an otherwise scary movie this failed because these two nerdy investigators were also lacking in decent script lines the attempts at humour from the two techie ghosthunter nerds failed as dismally as the movie did to scarei would class this as dmovie it falls way below the level of competence needed to create a bmovie the d represents dismalmy advice to you would be to ignore any favourable reviews and give this movie a miss unless of course you like watching dmovies i can recommend a much better low budget horror death of a ghost hunter the end scene in particular kind of sticks with you and makes you reflectif you want truly scary horrors then look to the asian ones like shutter not the american remake,astonish
when the movie opens up after the longest most boring intro ever we are shown several short choppy clips of what is supposed to be a normal family moving into a new house like every other scary movie out there however with horrible acting camera shots editing and special effects this movie is almost worse than drag me to hell is pretty much a comedy i laughed so hard throughout the movie because i realized that they were actually trying seriously to make a horror movie well obviously they failed the best demon they could come up with is literally a spiderman version of darth maul except this guy spends his time making puppets and sharpening his claws while holding children captive in the further going into the movie with high hopes that finally a decent scary movie was coming out the scariest part of the entire experience was the trailer for dont be afraid of the dark before even started i do have to hand it to the director though it was an original idea a very unique plot but it was ruined by cheesy lines and acting do not waste your money to see this movie it is not scary at all except for a few moments of loud sounds that make you jump,astonish
i saw a sneak preview of at lincoln center last night there was much ballyhoo with the director writer and stars in attendance the film was talked up as being the next big thing in horror and as one of the scariest movies in years sadly the film didnt live up to its hypethe story of the film has family moving into a new house where weird things begin to happen when one son falls into a coma and the weirdness begins to increase the family decides to change houses yet again unfortunately the problem was never the house and the weirdness moves with them i could tell you more but should you want to see the film yourself i think you should have some pretense of being surprised which is hard since the story is so worn out youll know way before everyone else what is going on the film is being marketed as being a film with no false scares and that is true to some degree there are no false jumps anywhere in the film unfortunately there arent that many real scares anywhere in the film at all there are jumps and starts but few real scares its not that they arent there its simply that director james wan under cuts everyone of them by adding an exclamation point of very loud music with almost each one the two creepiest moments the first a figure behind a crib works because the noise doesnt come until after weve seen the figure for our selves the other is a small figure in the background as rose byrne walks past it is scary in a did i just see this sort of way the rest of the scares are undercut as if wan doesnt trust the audience its terrible and tiringif that wasnt bad enough the script or at least the film that was cut together by wan he edited it is derivative and unimaginative the plot is basically a combination of poltergeist the entity psychic killer and any number of really cheap films from the 70s and 80s watching the film i was struck by how so many elements seemed to have been taken from other better and worse films i kept thinking that if this was like movie x then y would happen and sure enough it would almost nothing in this film seems original even one of the creatures seems a copy of darth maul in star wars even worse where most other horror films have occasional moves by the characters that are clearly stupid illogical or the sort of thing that any rational person wouldnt do this film is full of them the plot hinges on repeated and frequent trips to the well of character stupidity including a move at the end which assures a sequeli wont talk about the how unintentionally funny it ishow can anyone feel this is the next big thing yes i applaud the lack of gore and false scares but outside of that what is there to keep your interest watching the film i was mostly bored i wanted to walk out but i waited to the end hoping that the film would pull itself together it never happened and i walked before the director qa i didnt care and anything i would have said to them would have been very impolitethat said the film does have moments there are a few moments when the film creates tension and some truly frightening images but they are wrapped up and hidden in a film that looks like it was made by a someone who was making his first film not someone whos made one classic horror film saw and few near missesif you must wait for tv,astonish
is it just me or do mainstream hollywood horror films nowadays suck ill start this off by saying its very possible its meafter all ive seen pretty much nothing but rave reviews for movies like sinister the conjuring 2 and the purge and ive hated them all in fact hate is too strong a word for it requires a certain level of passion that i cannot find myself to waste on garbage like this which i find incredibly boring before ending this paragraph i will say that i did like the first conjuring but i digressthe story here is extremely basic and clich the eldest male child in a young family falls from a ladder and subsequently into a coma the mother starts to experience strange anomalies in the house things out of place moving chairs and more of the likeat her wits end she does what any woman desperate for answers would do in a rational worldseek out the aid of paranormal investigators and psychics soon it is discovered that her soon is a master at astral projection and is not really in a coma but rather trapped in a dangerous dimension where an spirit is attempting to usurp his body just so happens his father patrick wilson was once a master at astral projection as well and in order to save his son has to travel to the same dark dwelling where malicious spirits lurk and bring his child back before and inevitable case of possession occursnow that synopsis could probably prove appropriate for 90 of the supernaturalhorror films that have come out in the last ten years i couldnt help while watching it but think my god i could have written this script when i was 12 years oldi initially had become interested in because so many reviewers made claims that it was perhaps the most terrifying film of the decade and what with a pg13 rating i became interested because it obviously had to rely on tactics other than gore to so thoroughly frighten the herd maybe the vast majority of the population who watched arent really die hard horror fans like myself but even so i was fighting to keep myself awake thats how incredibly boring and dull i found this filma lot of the positive reviews praise for its use of sound and disturbing imagery i suppose there referring to the screeching violins and smiling men and women in corpse paint i mean the thing is so clich that if i were to teach a class on how to make an unoriginal and boring horror movie i would choose and sinister as first pick candidates to display the finer points of boring the audience with conventional and lame techniques to scare weak minded peoplei guess i shouldnt really be surprised all the good horror movies seem to be coming out of spain france or britain nowadays and the few that come out of the united states are indie flicks like dead girl or excision the days of classics like hellraiser alien and event horizon are clearly long gone hollywoods found out what makes moneycheap thrills and forgettable plotsoh and apparently patrick wilson helps too,astonish
not that i didnt expect it to be a clich totally predictable low budget film even knowing this i still felt tempted to rent it just because i feel the need to watch as many horror films as i possibly can in my never ending search for the perfect one i have yet to succeed although i have gotten close on very fewthe dialog is torture itself not to mention the poor acting of the cast id say the best actor was the kid in the coma when he was in that same state yet another disgrace to the horror genrefilmmakers enough of the creepy kid drawings enough of kid possessions kids are creepy just by themselves no need to enhance there creepytud if your going to recreate a demon entityevil spirit diabolical beingetc please give us something that hasnt come out of a 6 year olds bad nightmarewe demand fear,astonish
is one of todays really funny and newthinking comedymovies although it had its scary moments the acting was humorous and the story was like five other movies blended together what a refreshing touch the plot was predictable and all the way from the start it had major fails deamons appearing before anybody was possessed and so this is no horrormovie but it was a great laugh indeed this is a pile of crap unless you really go for a humoristic film if you like scary movie 1 this is definitely a movie for you even though i might say that even scary movie has its moments way above the scariest in this film fail fail fail way way overestimated,astonish
i found out that this was made by james wan the director of saw i loved saw and thought i would check this out i have to say it was a waste of time the movie isnt scary at all nor is it original its the run of the mill story of the wife being home alone quite a lot and she starts seeing things and of course the husband does not believe her at first until he sees things too so they get some mental woman in to help get rid of the spirits its the same rubbish weve seen a million times in the past and i dare say we will see again in the not too distant future if your bored then by all means check this rubbish out but i can promise you there are far better movies out there id suggest you avoid,astonish
when a kid sees eerie creatures in the night the parents do the usual thing  they comfort the kid and blame childhood fantasy but when the kid slips into a coma and other people in the house start seeing things they may have been wrongfilms like this are a dime in a dozen and they usually pick one of the more classical films and take whatever they can from that one this one is no different and leans very heavily on poltergeist 1982 its still rather different from that one though so its ok its better to copy creatively than to create badly after allthe tension build in the film is quite good it starts slowly but gets under the skin eventually attempted shock moments are there but are completely ineffective and might just be designed to be like that but they dont disturb anything as the film rolls on and picks up speed it becomes a pleasant watch but never goes above that level so all in all slightly better than run of the mill7 out of 10 dark intentions,astonish
rather than focus on gore and torture like the saw films james wan focuses more on fearsome demonic forces to terrify viewers gets all the things that scare us the most and puts it into one film eerie fast paced music horrific demons and astral projection there are more than a few things that go bump in the night and day in wan uses the day time as a place for demons to show their face as well as we see the horrific red faced demon more than a few times and a man in a black coat as well as a small dancing demon which makes us wonder what the hell is going on until we realize that were getting scared by the eeriness whannells script is great leading the actors in the right direction of making us anxious and wans direction leads us to time and time again become more and more frightened with whats to come in every single scene with out ears covered and feet up off the floor with fear of a loud noise or a hand coming out from under the seati am confident this film will scare even the toughest of moviegoers because james wan has made this film so we can get scared putting a twist on the haunted house genre and let me tell you he has succeeded on every level,astonish
this movie is scary i started to tear a bit after a few scares and jumps the atmosphere gives the movie a dark droned black unhappy but horrifying feeling and it has so many scary moments i would recommend this movie to anyone with the urge to be terrified lol first of all this movie is not for the young ones it contains very dark and evil themes that might scare some the movie is very entertaining and very good the acting is superb everything about this movie is great its an old idea put to a new perspective i would go see this again just a warning for anyone with very high standards it has 1 clearly said f word but yes not everyone cares about that type of thing just know this is not a movie for children,astonish
going into this film i didnt set the bar very high i was expecting the same predictable horror junk thats been playing in theaters for a long time everyone knows what i mean unnecessarily graphic scenes bad music underdeveloped characters etc however i was pleasantly surprised by this movie is a serious improvement from the filmmakers previous work paranormal activity sawwhich i found very dull has all the good elements of classic horror characters that the viewers sympathize with dramatic music and a build up of tension that will make your skin crawl the plot is engaging and reaches its climax with out dragging i was also very happy that the script was not cheesy but rather quite real the entities that are shown in the film are creepy without being ridiculous and are also not shown too often the best movie to compare to is of course poltergeist while the plots concern the same issues has a more believable story and a darker edge to itmy only complaint is the very end of the film which is written almost as if the creators are hinting at a sequel shudder the heroic but very human father saves the day only to be corrupted by an evil spirit i found myself wishing that the family could have a happier ending after all the crap theyve been through overall is a great suspense film and the only one that scared me in the last ten years,astonish
well like many horrorsi was a bit unsure of how scary it was actually going to be considering the rubbish that has been released in the last decadebut havent said that i was quite excited as i heard people saying mostly good about the movie i went to see this movie last week one word amazing loved every last shiver classic music really the movie went very well with it reminds me of hammerhead horrorsbrilliant i got a shiver as the first title came up very good acting lots of jumpy bits and a thrill through out highly recommend to watch it unusual story line very gripping was nice to see a horror with a good story line most movies you get they start off a story line and then the rest is just blood and guts galore and always the pretty young girl survives for of course the sequelvery predictablebut not this movie this one has you on the edge of your seat,astonish
in all seriousness this has to probably be the scariest film i have ever seen in my entire life and i have seen many horrorsnot only is this movie incredibly jumpy throughout but it plays with your mind in every way if youre afraid of scary old women and little girls in horror films id love to see your reaction after you see this the acting is also pretty good considering there are little known stars in thisi saw this about two weeks ago and still find it hard to sleep now some of the scenes are not only scary but disturbing particularly the end sceneall in all if you want a good scare and unsettling sleeps watch this you wont regret it,astonish
to be honest i think the only people who didnt like this movie are the stuckup wannabe critics who like to sit in their rooms and mock everything because it makes them feel like their opinion matters there was not much to dislike about this movie the acting was not bad the effects were pretty good and appealing to see and i liked the fact that for once a recent horror film did not involve unnecessary blood and violence it relied on actual suspense parts of it were funny as well the only thing that may have lacked a little was the way the plot was put together parts of the story were truly obscure and almost seemed a little rushed but if unlike said wannabe critics you can use a small amount of suspension of disbelief and do not need everything to make sense because you have no sense of imagination you probably will actually enjoy this movie however if your response to movies is usually ha that sucked i could pull a better movie out of my ass im awesome youll probably hate it and come write a stupid review about it in my opinion one of the best puttogether directed and acted horror movies of recent times not a mustsee or instant classic but a solid watch and a fun time,astonish
is brilliant i entered the cinema having absolutely no clue as to what i was in for and as the film started i began doubting the movie as the music was a little over the top for my taste i wouldnt of seen the plot coming in a million years im not going to spoil any of it for you because i am extremely glad that i didnt know what to expect before seeing this film i went through so many different emotions throughout the duration of the movie and loved that it was so fresh and really did the horror genre proud its been an incredibly long time since ive seen a horror movie that i left satisfied with well i left the cinema with shivers down my spine as the music started again and the massive red block letters of appeared on the screen the ending will leave you in a state and i can confidently say that if youre the same as me its like watching a whole movie about your worst nightmares as a kid i definitely recommend this to anyone that has missed watching a movie that gives you the shakes makes your pulse race and leaves you terrified a definite 1010 from me and a guarantee that ill be having nightmares tonight completely worth it,astonish
i am truly a haunted housethriller fan this film had it all i enjoy being scared by a film this hasnt really happened lately other than a few moments in paranormal activity was as scary as they come and not in a conventional way i thought the film did not have the typical theres some one in the mirror bathroom scene which frankly i thought was incredibly refreshing was scary because the writers were talented enough to make us as an audience care about the character development the first half of the film was full of jumps and scares and they were done in such a way that they made you even more terrified for example at one point in the movie the characters think they are being burgled or that someone has entered their home this makes the fright factor even bigger as sceptics are more susceptible to real scares like a burglary in a strange way i found the first half of the movie fairly believable as much as you can believe in ghosts and demons obviously as the film progressed i just got more and more scaredas did the rest of the cinema audience to the point were i didnt quite no what to do with myself or where to put myself i did in fact have to peep through my fingers at one stage i have read a lot of reviews about and they mostly say the same thing scary brill 1st half great second half not so great the important thing about the second half of the film is this yes it got a little silly yes it didnt leave much to the imagination but truthfully the first half of the film reeled me into such a state of horror that i couldnt have cared less about the silly factorof all the reviews i have read that have disliked the last 2030 mins of the film almost all of those said that they were still scaredif its frights you want and literally a heartpounding 2hours watch thistruly a triumph,astonish
wow what a great movie i am horror fan i have seen so many movies in my life every movie i watched by now wasnt even close to this onethis is masterpiece of horror movie it has all the elements that one movie need to have just perfectthe best thing is that from start you gonna think that its something similar to any other horror movie but as the story goes more and more you realize that it is so greatit keeps you attention to the end its not boring at all not for a minutesimply this one you must watch especially if you are horror movie fan,astonish
although iv always been a fan of the horror genre im obsessively critical of it and therefore find most of them blanduninspiringbasic and completely unscary this on the other hand proved different throughout the entire film i was on the edge of my seat and was jolting in fright like a hyperactive jack in the box the thing that got to me about this film was the lack of gore in iti have noticed that gallons of blood in horrors is a lazy and rather boringbackdrop for a lot of directors to compensate for lack of a good story andor script like hostel for example however this movie managed to keep suspense tension and shock to the maximum with minimal blood due to excellent camera work convincing actinggreat timing and a perfect score that sent a chill down my spine on every bass note a rare gem in that it also managed to keep interest to the very end without lowering the bar to the clichs of the slashers and other b rated horrors by having no nudity what so ever and hardly any profanity which allowed the viewer to be consumed with the full weight of the suspense without any distractions i would fully recommend this film to any hardcore horror fan however i would suggest you sleep with the light on if you watch it at nightthe film has a way of staying with you well after watching it a masterpiece of suspense in my opinion and well worth going to the cinema forif you dare muhaha,astonish
for what this movie is it is a perfect movie anyone who would say this is not a good entertaining horror film is operating on a personal agenda the bottom line is go see this movie so the filmmakers can make more movies like this for the people like me who love them everyone else steer completely clear of the entire production and any like it please for it be you who want our thrill rides to disappear and be lost forever only to make more room for the countless bloated over budgeted real d and cgi infested crapfests that survive only because fat suits have billions to burn on marketing and promotion it is the little engine that could scare the bejees out of you that will be profit by word of mouth at the box office and long after in rental and dvd sales so please if you heart these horror films as i do go see this one on the big screen and get those goosebumps like never before to stand at attention until laying to rest fully satisfied that films like this will never die just their criticsnow here is why we love itis an absolutely horrifying film a sledgehammer to you senses and a tattoo you will not easily remove anytime soon on your nerves i want to see it again right now i want to own it so i can look into madness on pause and view nightmarish fiends violently attacking innocent human beings in slow motion this movie is a dance with something unimaginable but the same time made seemingly possible a beautiful family is at the mercy of a malevolent crew of demons and it does not matter how or why but they must wage war to survive and what a fantastic battle it is the bumbling stumbling ghost tracker crew must not only explain discover and draw out the adversary but also defend itself against it and folks the good guys do not always win anymore in these great low budget freakshows that offer absolutely no apologiesyou will get no blood not one drop what you will get is uneasy and restless from the eerie sounds of footsteps whispers creaking doors banging piano keys and ear piercing violin strings set to shadowy walk bys that happen so fast you will leap from your seat so high you may think you have entered an astral plain yourself so prepare yourself and get a good grip because unlike the moron that sat behind talking and giggling you will keep your eyes wide open your mouth closed you will not be disappointed in what you see,astonish
demons can always be frightening but in this case it was just pure sinister i have been looking forward to this film for some time and my expectations were high i realised 1 minute into the film that i may be a little disappointed hell no great film beautifully directed and my god i was scared not enough to have to look at the floor every ten minutes but it was just so sinister and colourful if i were to pay an excessive amount of money for a thrill like this then i would do it at least twice go and see this film you will not regret it if you want blood gore and guns in a horror then u will hate it its creepy and corner of the eye stuff one thing i loved about this film was the characters and the acting was terrific they pulled it off having a full on demon lurking in the house along with other horid people that would just scare the s out of you i will be getting this on blu ray dvd as it was great,astonish
its so easy to make a horror flick but difficult to make a great one that scares the pants off you and stands the test of time there are so many being churned out at the moment a lot which just go straight to dvd they can be made on the cheap and generate a decent profit for that reasoni saw today and thought it was very refreshing it is incredibly bold in the way that it plays with the genre in the beginning were led to believe that this is just one of your average straightup haunted house flicks but as the film progresses it takes many twists and turns it seemed to touch on the scifi genre a bit as well which i thought was brilliant this couldve ended up being quite hokey but the screenplay is well written and the lines are delivered believably although some people seem to have an issue with the acting i also thought the score was superb very old school finally a score which is substantial in the mix like the good old daysi can understand why some may not like it as it challenges conventions and expectations but surely we need new films to be doing just that one last thing this film scared the hell out of me,astonish
the is simply the best horror movie by the great james wan movie is exactly paired with perfect scary music effects director used his evil mind to scare us where we will exactly relaxed and not expecting something scary there are so many wow horror scary moments in this movie thats the main advantage in it movie has very good story with a exact point of view while character explaining how they live in it no confusing and very straight forward explanations by characters about whats happening in the moment if you say i am not afraid of horror movies and if you believe you can watch any horror movie alone think again and watch this movie super horror thrilling experience after a very long time director james wan made a perfect horror moviedont watch it alone but to feel full horror thrilling experience better watch it alone best horrorrrrr movie after a very long time,astonish
i went to go see this movie with a twelve year old friend of mine and as we walked into the theater we missed about 510 minutes of it so i dont know how to explain how it begun but this movie was scary three children and a mom and dad and one child falls off a ladder and gets hurt the night after the parents try to wake him up at breakfast and he didnt wake up so they took him to the hospital three months later and they were regarding the boy suddenly their family experience demons and stuff which appear to be the spirit of the child and then the mom plans to move they have these people come in and try to figure out whats wrong and most people are afraid of the demons coming out of him and i didnt understand this until the lady came up and explained why the kid was sleeping for a long period of time the family try their best to get the child out of his own world and get him back on earth so that he could wake up so they had the dad sleep to get him backwhen i went into the theater to watch a movie about astroprojection me and my friend were scared to death it was scarier than poltergiest i mean what like a sleeping film of poltergiest well yeah i also thought it had a reference to inception too you know the new movie yeah both of these create new worldspersonally at the beginning i found it to be kind of clich but then i got over it and enjoyed it a lot the acting was superb the script had enough details to even scare adults and the storyline was justbut id be darned i wouldnt recommend this film for anyone under 14 it would be too scary and kids would have nightmares i hope i dont there are very little comedy and mostly serious moments of the family trying to wake the kid up710,astonish
i really liked this movie has some great parts that will make you jump a little i was scared watching this movie if drag me to hell scared you in theaters then this one will too i also love how they made a saw reference in the movie i love patrick wilson ever since i saw him in angels in america and hard candy docyourself a favor and give this movie a shot i really dont think you will be disappointed the movie flowed really well and just as long as you pay attention and arent brain dead everything should make sense are the end there is a daemon that looks a lot like that red from black faced character from star wars too haha,astonish
to start off the movie had basically no direction there was no story nothing that grabbed me because nothing truly happened until about the middle of the movie and even then nothing truly made sense family moves into house baby cries a lot creepy noises next thing you know a child randomly lands into a coma for what reason the house is haunted says the mother of the childrose byrne what random comas scary stuff come on guyswhat annoys me the most is that the main characters get spooked by noises before they even truly heart or see anything are they unaware that its an older house they tend to make noises then a fat ugly guy from the matrix shows up scares the mother they move into another house but oh wait your house wasnt haunted it was your little boy because he decided to wander a little too far into his dreamland referred to as the further so the dead are trying to posses his body as this scene was paying in the theater i was praying this was a joke and hoping that it wasnt heading into this ridiculous direction but it did it was pathetic the characters or beingsthat were meant to terrify me in this movie simply made me laugh they were hilarious lookingalmost like a childs cartoon or an old cheap horror movie from the 60s the scenery and surroundings were not scary the house wasnt even frightful overall there was nothing deep about this film that would draw you in to even understand why whats happening is happening or even make you want to know everything is surface nothing truly makes sense either there is absolutely no connection to anything thats going on overall this movie was a poorly conceived idea and very disappointing coming from the makers of saw ive read reviews with people saying how terrifying it is and ive read reviews saying that it cant be criticized for copying other films but maybe thats not entirely a good thing it was clearly never tried by other filmmakers because the idea sucks it took what was meant to be a horror film and made it into something mystical and unreal and personally i believe the overall idea of a scary film is to scare the audience correct if you make a film appear unreal it will be feared by no one therefore defeating the purpose i recommended this film for the age group of 1216preferably little girls who are easily terrified by bugs this film couldnt possibly strike fear in anyone else fail,astonish
i dont really know where to begin with this movie it has been one of those movies that i never got around to watching and then completely forgot all about it well recently i finally got around to watching this film and i have to say by the end i didnt know whether to laugh or to crylaugh because the movie was absolutely shockingly atrocious or cry because id wasted a part of my life watching this garbage that i will never get back20 minutes in to the film i thought that it was going to be really good the story was set really nicely and then i was just waiting for all hell to break loose well it didnt what followed was an hour of utterly ludicrous loud noises aimed to scare the living daylights out of you by having a really low volume for the dialogue and then hitting you with 1000 decibels of noise it got old very very very quickly at first i thought it was just me imagining noises being more loud than usual in a horror film but i realised that was the only weapon this film had up its sleeve the storyline turned into something that even a few days later i still chuckle to myself about the effects were some of the worst seen in film since the 70s and the scary things in the film were so terrible they actually made you laughbasically the entire film was over an hour of trying to deafen you by playing over the top loud noises when something scary was supposed to be happening and masking the fact that what you were actually seeing was not scary but funny if you play the supposedly scary parts of this film without the sound you will literally burst into laughter about what you are seeingpeople are reactionary on here and review things straight after they see the movie which is understandable however it has been a few days since i watched this film so i have had time to think and evaluate this movie with a clear mind and i can genuinely say this was one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen and one of the worst movies in general i truly dont understand the hype surrounding this film on here and how well regarded it is and the director i have read the second installment of this joke film follows the same concept of loud noises to create cheap scares so i will definitely give that one a miss how they can make 3 of these things says everything about hollywood and ,astonish
may contain spoilersthe first half of the film was terrifying i thought the scares were so effective and the suspense was high the film succeeded in showing enough but not too much and the ghosts looked scary but as the film shows more of its ghosts and demon it ruined everything the first half worked for the demon looked awfully like dark maul from star wars and having it sharpen its nails in a room full of dolls and puppets with tip toe through the tulips was so cheesy and by then i lost interest also when it showed the ghosts more and actually had them fighting it just took the realism and scariness from the film it just did too much for me im the type that likes my movies to have many scares but it cant be too much and this film just went off the rails the conclusion was suspenseful and i knew right from the end there was going to be a sequel no matter how long they took to announce it hopefully its sequel will be an extended full movie of this films first half,astonish
so boring the cure for insomnia so many people liked it because theyll watch anything in these times leave it to the reality show generation well like the old saying goes theres no accounting for taste and when will films every be in color again so much grays and darkness its monotonous already and that mother in the film by the way annoying and trying to pretend she could sing she didnt even have a good speaking voice when she comes down the stairs in the beginning of the film i thought she was the boy for a minute in those kid pajamaswhy are actors so unappealing and dull in the last decade,astonish
the whole movie is ridiculous the acting is atrocious and the storyline is even worse this movie is so bad im not even going to go into fine detail i wouldnt waste my time the only thing this movie has going for is the scene of the demon which i thought was pretty creativetrying to sit through the cringeworthy dramas of the poor kid and even poorer acting made me feel like they put zero effort into casting and just threw together the first people that seemed interested i wouldnt even class this as a b movie or a c this shouldnt have gone anywhere near cinema or dvd this horrible waste of time and money should have gone straight onto freetoair tv at 3am where barely anyone would get to see iti honestly dont know how the producers of such a great series saw thought this would workavoid it unless you love being disappointed,astonish
there are moments in films which make you respect it and there are moments in it which make you lose all respect for the movie in s case its the latter whether it be atrocious screenplay consisting of the characters having to explain the whole plot to you or the main antagonist making you laugh several times in a supposed horror film this film had too many bad moments to render the whole thing unwatchablethe acting was below standard the plot had too many irrelevant bitsthe only thing scary about this film is how so many people gave it a good review in this sitedont watch this movie unless watching horse crap movies gets you off,astonish
i just saw id have to say more like ludicrous i could not believe how bad this movie was since i liked wans saw and dead silence more or less this movie has nothing to do with those this is really slow with stale acting that left me wondering how you could believe in any characters at all there was not one moment when i was scared i just cant believe anybody would find it scary besides maybe a 2 year old every scene including the medium and the further world is something weve seen in other films and done a million times better its just a bad uninspired rehash of every horror clich of the past 20 years i thought paranormal activity was terrible but its starting to look better after watching this i had big expectations but this thing really tried my patience you could figure the whole film out after 20 minutes but it plods along showing the obvious not recommended,astonish
josh lambert patrick wilson and wife renai rose byrne are happily married and have three kids then after moving into a new house one of their kids dalton ty simkins falls into a comafor no reason at all they take care of him at home but then scary things happen rose starts hearing noises and seeing strange people around the house they figure the house is haunted and has affected their son they move to a new house and quickly realize its not the house that is hauntedpretty good evil spirit story i avoided this like the plague when it came out because of the pg13 rating all the pg13 horror films ive seen except for the ring have been boring and stupid this was praised by critics so i decided to give it a try on dvd it was much better than other pg13 horror films it is well made and acted and there were some very scary momentsbut its far from perfect for one thing after its established the couple has three kids the other two seem to disappear completely when they move to a new house also it has those incredibly annoying jump scare moments whats even more annoying is the writer and director said they tried to avoid using them theres also at least three fairly long sequences with people wandering around in dark houses and placesand these scenes are deadly boring and bring the movie to a screeching halt and i hated the terrible its not over ending still it did scare me and the acting is good across the board especially by lin shaye its also nice to see barbara hershey in a small role soi give it a marginal recommendation,astonish
i found this movie bland in its genrethe same clichs have i seen so many times before not that it was all bad the plot didnt carry all the way through but the cinematography was not quite the best but it kept me captivated for the length of the moviei watched this one with my girlfriend and she didnt even once seek protection from me so decide for yourselves i would recommend you watch this moviejoonas ylitalops this is just ridiculous,astonish
started out as a standard haunted housepossessed movie and was doing a great job of it it was using a simple but effective formula of slowly building up the scares something that a lot of new horror misses is the fact that the anticipation leading up to the scare the suspense is where the movie is made the first half of the movie did this very effectively then all of a sudden they tell a short and thrown together back story as to why everything is happening the way it is and go totally in a different direction the second half of the movie is mostly gimmicks with one obvious twist after another and even gets hard to watch at times while the first half of the movie is almost great the second half is quite awful another great example of an opportunity missed,astonish
after seeing the trailer i must admit i found myself excited and looking forward to seeing this film unfortunately the trailer is just about as scary as the film gets that aside it is a very well made film and i found it hugely entertainingthe story itself is decent enough haunted house different realms possessed child it borrows a lot from other films but still manages to stand out as original which i really like ill avoid explaining the story here as there is a synopsis for thatthe whole pretence of the story is that the child is lost and may become possessed by an evil demon who i will come to in a second that in itself creates a race against time scenario with lots of freaky characters and many excellent opportunities for jumps and scares which this film capitalises on at every possible occasion unfortunately that is the only horror in the film jumps and scares refreshingly there is no gore and surprisingly there is no actual possession of the child that is something that is totally over done in modern horror films mark kermode talks excellently about paedophobia he actually wrote a thesis largely about the subject and that is something very prominent in this film you only have to look at the poster to see that even though the scares dont actually come from the boy himself the whole notion of a possessed child seems to put the wind up us and has scared the hell out of us since the exorcist and even before thatinstead the film creates a wonderfully refreshing character that is a sort of medley of lots of others which is homage to the overall thread of the film the film itself borrows lots from other classic horror films it owes massive debts to poltergeist the quirky seer the use of technology for tracking ghosts comedy between characters etc and it takes other elements from previous films such as the hole and paranormal activity the demon itself in my opinion is a medley of jeepers creepers and freddy krueger the demons lair very much reminded me of freddys in wes cravens new nightmare as did his metal claws and hideous appearance the jeepers creepers homage is in the use of tiny tims tip toe through the tulips throughout the film as a sort of trademark or soundpiece signalling the presence of the demon there is a particularly chilling scene that uses that song where the demon is sharpening his claws which was excellently done if a little silly i also really think that the film makers should have focused a lot more on the demon its good to introduce the other characters that wanted to possess the boys body but sticking to just one character and developing him would have greatly improved the film in comparison imagine if a nightmare on elm street featured four or five different characters all haunting their dreams it just wouldnt have been as good and would have diluted the horror of the film i feel that this has happened here which is a great shame as the demon himself is pretty scarythe last third of the film does admittedly get quite silly as the protagonist is travelling through the further to find his son and there are hundreds of ghosts and ghoulies breaking into our realm more casper than the exorcist its all jumpy and funny but ultimately it just isnt very scary also the film seems to end rather quickly and runs out of steam rather than completes itself there are questions why did they throw in the old woman character so quickly at the end what happened with the demon in the boys room rather than answers to conclude the film which leaves a disappointment post viewing where there should be terrorthe film overall lacks something to make it genuinely scary and that is menace in paranormal activity while not overtly scary there was a presence of menace that provided genuine terror and an overall seriousness to the film lacks that overall feel with its use of computer graphics the inclusion of very funny it must be said comedy and its over reliance on jumps to compensate for the lack of horroris an entertaining riot of a film and it contains some wonderful set pieces a gripping plot brilliant homages to some classic horror films a decent script and solid if unremarkable performances from its cast but as a horror film it just doesnt stand up as scary however when you consider that it had a smaller budget than the first saw movie it really is an achievement one thing i loved about this film is that it avoided the use of gore and instead compensated with the use of jumps which is far more skillful respectable and enjoyable than a boring bloodbath it also managed to be wonderfully entertaining so it must be said that is a good film that is well worth a watch although it relies heavily on influence from other superior horror films it pays homage to them rather than outright ripping them off allowing it to stand alone as a brilliant modern horror achieves something that while not exactly what i think it intended to still achieved something which is more than can be said for most low budget horror films of recent times hats off once again to james wan,astonish
is weird d its not what i would call scary but the maker of paranormal activity has done thyself proud for jumpy bits good plot and a lot of typical horror features i would give it 710as a negative the piano sound upon the jumps is annoying and if anything to loud the plot is also very predictable but with a nice twist at the end although sadly also predictable but the camera work and lightning create and excellent effect of a horror genre and the classic horror build up is seen throughout this moviethe story is unique and astral projection is not often visited within movies i would recommended seeing this movie as it is worth a watch even with its few flaws hence my generous rating of 710 good job,astonish
the movie starts off with a believable story line albeit copied mostly from nearly every new horror film made these days scary house etc there are some genuinely jumpy bits where the main success of these are down to the camera work directing and music rather then the use of outlandish special effects which i preferhowever the plot takes a completely farfetched turn that i was hoping wasnt going to be the answer and that kinda ruined it for me however there is a a nice twist at the end that brought the rating back up a little biti would recommend it for watching it with your girlfriend if you are after an easy scare but not if you are expecting a believable story linestarts well ends well just a few dodgy bits that are hard to swallow not bad by any accounts,astonish
expecting an old fashion style haunted house movie and thats what the first half was  great suspense fabulous score and lots of jumpy moments the second half becomes more fantasy horror with ghouls more than ghosts but in places its just as scary playing to fears with dolls and puppets there are also a few nods to saw as this film shares james wan as director so look out for those the end is probably a little bit drawn out maybe 10 minutes longer than necessary but the final scene is actually quite good i didnt leave feeling disappointed although i wouldve preferred more haunted and less demons the performances were good and solid particularly from patrick wilson underrated in my opinion and rose byrne as well as the from the kids its worth a watch and was pretty well received from the 3 out of 4 of us who went today,astonish
just came back watching this movieand believe me i was not expecting the goosebumps and shocks this movie delivered james wan managed to scare us in this low budget movie when i came out the theater i had a smile on my face as i was happy after a very long time we got something new and stylish this is definitely not a movie for weak hearts this movie is kind of creepy that makes for a great night at the movies if youre into that sort rose byrne delivered a descent performance i was totally not expecting what i got to see by chance in short this movie delivers the jumps which you expect from a nice horror genre a movie not be missed and one my favorites now,astonish
i read some reviews here before watching this film and at first glance this movie seemed to be very promising however i didnt feel very scary while watching this film because the plot was easily predictable and primitive at timesthe costumes and special effects were not too sophisticatedwhat rescued this film from disaster is an incredible acting by patrick wilson rose byrne and ty simpkins they are the reason this movie was worth watching but due to flawed plot i am forced to get 4 point away from this filmthe problem with these kind of films is that closed space ie haunted house was used so many times before in other horror movies that the more you watch such movies the more silly they look i love such films as paranormal activity or blair witch project as they are original in context of other horror movies a lot of already seen details are not scary anymore moviemakers have to think more to get an interesting horror movie now,astonish
greetings again from the darkness ahh the lost art of horror films i dont mean slasher films or gorefests i mean real horror films the saw series falls into gorefest and its collaborators director james wan and writer leigh whannel team up again for a more traditional horror film  one designed to scare the viewer rather than just gross out societythe film opens as patrick wilson and rose byrne move into a beautiful old house with their two young sons and infant daughter by beautiful house of course i mean terribly creepy with nooks and crannies creaking floorboards squeaky doors and an attic designed by satan the mom byrne quickly realizes things arent just right with this house and as is customary in horror films the dad finds some lame excuse to work late so the mom and kids can be haunted without himthere are some bits and pieces from classic horror films like the exorcist poltergeist amityville horror and yes saw but not the gory stuff remarkably this film is rated pg13 which means the filmmakers really have to tell a story  and they dothe mom gets so desperate she begs to move they do guess what things arent better so motherinlaw barbara hershey says she knows someone next thing you know two goofballs that look like they should have their own cable show are in the house confirming something is definitely amiss so they call in their boss unfortunately the great zelda rubinstein poltergeist passed away so our expert is played by lin shayle she does an effective job explaining astral projection and the next thing you know all hell has broken loose nice work ladywhat makes the film work are the characters the setting the atmosphere and the really nice buildup of suspense and drama sure i think there were some details that could have been handled much better for instance the other brother looks like he is going to be a factor but instead all of the attention goes to ty simpkins as dalton simpkins was seen recently with russell crowe in the next 3 days also more of the backstory with hershey and wilsons childhood could have proved very interestingstill i will say if you are a fan of horror films this one is worth seeing if nothing else you will absolutely love the opening credits with their haunted images and smoky font its a bit of a fun challenge to find the image in each of the opening sequences just make sure to finish your popcorn before the movie starts that stuff is too expensive to be tossing across the aisle when you jump,astonish
astral projection out of body experience is the real heart of the paintbynumbers horror sideshow a family keeps moving from haunted houses until it realizes the demon is in their child not the houses and the other demons want him saws james wan directs this sometimes amusing hodgepodge without saws bloody business or a modicum of innovation at least it has the guts to avoid overdoing the cgithe demons who seek the body of young dalton lambert ty simpkins because he astral projects and leaves it frequently are the motliest crew i have ever seen from desiccated brides to downright devils with tails a posse of poltergeist fiends not quite as alarming as they might be in dawn of the dead or shaun of the dead for that matterthe haunted house evokes images of the haunting and just as cheesy as that film is this one even the exorcists darkly painted violence is here with a priest in tow never comes close to the fear i felt in the descent or the interesting layering of characters in 28 days later but it has its scary moments and even humoryes the nerdy fixers are funny the technicians that is who use a variety of outdated machines to film and capture the dead seeking the bodies of the livingwould have worked as a comedy,astonish
as a big horror fan i was really looking forward to this movie watched it at the night in the cinema so a perfect scenario  a new horror movie at night  at the big screen well it was not what i expected the first hour was quite okay and i was looking forward to the finale that seemed to be really good but the last 30 minutes seriously it was just a major letdown maybe it was because my expectations was skyhigh but it doesnt matter either way i cant just ignore the fact that it was just plain bad my friend beside me said after an hour that the movie became more and more complex and just absurd the plot was just too overkill and the movie did not live up to anything at all it was not entirely bad but compare this to paranormal activity which i found great is just pathetic had one scene in the entire movie that was a bit scary but since ive already seen it in the official trailer yeah you get it the monster in the film was pathetic it looked like a fiveyear old put it together in paint is that the best you can do with all your computers in 2011 ive seen better looking filmmonsters 1970 as a summary 1 not too bad acting but the storyline just fades away and becomes more and more absurd 2 smocked with bhorror movie clichs like hands in drawers clowns ugly monsters you name it3 worth watching if youre really bored but i dont recommend it 510  expected a lot more,astonish
cant help smile and built up some interest when i saw this movie and especially when it had a weak 7 in the scales as wellso i gave it a honest try the film starts up decent and at least try to build up some story and excitement despise the stiff and rigid acting of the boys parents somewhat of a eerie and creepy feeling is noticeable when the are exposed to the strange sounds in the boys walkie talkiebut it doesnt develop so much from there actuallyyou can say as when the medium women appears and starts telling about the boy being astral travel etc it just going downhillshes pretty stereotype as wellthe last 2030 minutes the film maker expects the watcher to be pale in the face relaying on bluntsharp noisemusic effectsamateurish made spookfaces and fastflashes in the dark this film borrows a great deal from classics like poltergeist etc but just doesnt have the right feeling and craftsmanship to pull it off,astonish
it seems that nearly every year a movie about an evil demon possessed murderous kid appears in the theaters id read some decent reviews on the movie so i decided to go and see it for myself and to my surprise i was the only person in the entire room i shouldve taken this as a warning sign but i figured it was just because it was a weekday so i sat down and prepared myself for a supposedly scary movie well what can i say about it two words absolutely ridiculous the acting was barely decent and the plot line was very awkward around the time tiny tims tiptoe through the tulips started playing i felt the urge to either laugh at this movie or get up and leave of all the songs they couldve picked for this movie they chose the one that had nothing to do with the plot line at allsave your money for a decent movie trust me if you watch this you will be disappointedthree stars out of ten,astonish
could have been a great horror film everything happens very well in the movie from the beginning to its half the main character doesnt take long to realize that her house is haunted her husband tries not to believe it although he knows that something wrong is happening very obvious things happen but are treated as obvious and not always as a clich and that was interesting because the characters discover what is happening and do what must be done to find solutions instead of dying one by one or keep the whole movie discussing with the catholic church but when complex explanations start to appear justifying the mysteries all the good qualities expressed earlier in the movie are brought to the drain the film then turns into a b horror movie with infant arguments for a subject that could have been very interesting if well developed the makeup is more laughable than frightening if fresh makeup was supposed to be frighting for sure would be a blast i was very curious about this movie it took a lot of my attention in the beginning but in the end i was regretting seen it because its disappointing,astonish
i was expecting big things from this film when i saw people saying it was the scariest film theyd seen in their life i thought this is gonna be good i watched with 3 of my friends and we laughed i thought the start of the storyline was good and then it just got stupid the ending was the most ridiculous thing in the world the actors were ok it was such a let down i wish they would have developed the storyline more as it had the potential to be a great film and it just didnt deliver so disappointed there were a few jump scenes and the scene where the man with fire on his face was sharpening his nails was just plain stupid i hate clowns but i found myself laughing at them in this proves how good the film was i would give this film 210 and say anyone above 12 could watch this boring film,astonish
wow this was the finest horror movie i have seen after evil dead this is one of the greatest horror movies madeinitially during the beginning of the movie everything looked the same just as any other horror movie i have seen but then this is a whole new concept in horror movieswatch it to believe it the acting as well was good but i think the movie is made up of an innovative concept which is new in horror movies and which works  i would give it a 8 those who love horror moviesplease watch it,astonish
ive been a horror film for ages but ive never been that scared before  this film is like somebody collected all the best and scariest bits of best horror movies that have been made so far and even those arent made yet the acting is very good and believable despite the fact that the actors are not hollywood starsyou are not bored in the film even for one second yes  it does use ideas from other horror films made so far but it only contributes to the film the directors gave their best to make the film and yet they made a masterpiece for those who are horror fans and not only this film will remain remembered another horror masterpiece has been born i dont think its for people with weak hearts enjoy,astonish
thank you you have finally done it you have finally made my night ive waited for a movie like this forever and a day its been so long since ive been scared out of my mind it takes a lot ive been bored with horror movies for so longalways knowing whats around the corner or the cheap scares no not this movie the music oh my gosh creepythe shadows the lurk around the corner and the demon wow i have nothing bad to say about this film cinematography along with the sound effects music and its 70s classic look the title  nice again finally what its all about go see this film,astonish
i went into this movie with very little information except for what was shown on the trailer i expected a cheesy pg rated horror movie that lacked anything new boy was i wrong this movie worked on every level for me good story good acting and some very good scares i liked the initial saw movies and dead silence so i should have had more faith in james wan and leigh whannel one other aspect of the film that worked was that they didnt use humor just so viewers could take a break from storys focus they did have some humor but it was minimal and didnt last long you can tell that not only do they make good horror but they are fans as well only a fan could bring home the scares the way that they do nice job,astonish
this movie is without a doubt one of the best horror films that weve seen in years and i wish it had been rated r just to keep the annoying brats out of the theater i cannot express enough angst towards the immaturity of unsupervised morons talking texting and getting up constantly during an interesting and clever film such as this regardless though the content is not enough to make me truly think this film should be r just make it r anyway to stop adults from having to put up with this kind of nonsense oh yeah the movie    awesome ive seen it twice already and it is still fun and engrossing experience i love the look of the demon and his minions i love the awesome and frightening set ups to the spooky games these forces play and prey on these people the overlapping of the dimensions is really great and interesting it had a twilight zone feel in places that really worked with the situationmovies like this work so much with peoples imaginations if they have them    the more imagination you have the better this is because it gives you just enough to be amazed by these ideas    and inspired,astonish
what else can i say at 51 theres not much that scares me in the way of movies since ive seen about every scary movie thats been made but raised the bar and did it with a lot of hearti can always be reassured of the entertainment value in a movie based on the caliber of actors who choose to be in that movie and since barbara hershey signed on i knew i was in for something with depth and meaning as well as a unique way to tell a ghost story which this movie is and much more its how i chose the black swan another of barbara hersheys which i also thoroughly enjoyed smart actors like barbara and robert duvall gene hackman and others of the same caliber have never disappointed me in the movies theyve chosen throughout the years theyve been aroundlet me just say this movies portrayal of the paranormal is so uniquely creepy tense and realistic in ambiance timing and photography that its a big notch above paranormal activity i constantly got chills over my entire body literally with how its presented and the plot is so unique with a great surprise ending,astonish
with such a horrible plot even worse acting and super low budget effects i am not sure how anyone would like this piece of trash i can only assume they are either mentally challenged or being paid by the producer of this terrible movie i am not sure what is worse sitting through the first 30 minutes of the movie listening to a baby cry or sitting through the last 30 minutes of the movie listening to the horrible generic scary music and watching the terrible effects they must have spent 500 onstay away from this garbage it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,astonish
wow i read about 5 reviews 4 were apparently on drugs and 1 said it was cheesy hokey and of course not very good so i watched it it was cheesy hokey and of course not very good two of my favorite actors could not even pull this off cheap costumes ridiculous story and absolute horrible directing made it a comedy not a horror movie the director is an idiot there were a few scenes that built you up to be shocked and then because of the timing it fell short and you laughed like a comedian telling the punch line of a joke out of sequence my wife and i laughed all through the movie it is worth watching if you want to make fun of something but if you want to get scared the evening news will do a better job,astonish
lets start by saying im a fan of horror and thrillers of the sort i started watching this movie and i was pretty excited as i was looking forward to a decent horrorthriller movie half way through it i was feeling pretty nervous and tense the characters were believable the plot was quite thrilling had a few scares and i liked where it was going then it all spiraled down pretty fast instead of horrified i was feeling giggly it suddenly turned into a b flick all over the place the plot got loose the make up and characters design was horrific and not the good kind it was predictable as hell and all around ridiculous thatss too bad because it had a pretty good potential and it did feel for the first half of it at least like a new take on the genre that was all over pretty soon and things bot baad to put it simply,astonish
i have seen a very large amount of horror films such as this one the whole haunted house setup the possessed child et cetera having said this i expected this to be just one more amityville horror kind of movie yet i heard good words about it and i went to see it with a couple buddies it got me from the start the eerie music the creepy scenes everything yes it was ultimately a clich as many movies similar to this have been done but in a way made a name for itself in being nearly perfect with timing lighting the music the setup etc it was original on its own it was one of those rare horror films where instead of delivering constant cheap scares and suspense buildups that result in merely a cat from behind a door or something like that it had real intense moments where you will be squealing and jumping from your seat popups come at completely random times where you are 100 vulnerable and are not expecting it and boy does it get you good when the elderly lady is describing the demon to the father and mother in the kitchen scene and the demon suddenly appears behind the father out of nowhere snarling i screamed and so did my friends not only random popups but subtle ones too that have you thinking and freaking out at the same time from start to finish this film will have you reeling and a more than satisfying ending that will you keep you up for days not completely original but definitely a mustsee for horror fans its probably the scariest movie i have ever seen,astonish
i went into this movie without a clue i thought it was going to be another haunting of connecticut with how the cover looked but i was wrongreally wrongin the beginning i was first confused then i was nearly crying in my seat because of how messed up things became always keeps you on edge and it always seemed to get me once i let my guard down if something lingered too long i would relax and the second i did made me wish i did not the ending was pretty good because it gives you a sense of accomplishment before taking it away from you within minutes very good take on horror flicks like this i really enjoyed myself and i would most likely see it again its something all horror fans should enjoy if you like this style of horror and can take you oldgeezer blinders off and enjoy yourself for once in awhile,astonish
this movie will give u creeps while watching it and for many more hours after watching it it is certainly one of the most scariest movies made and what makes this movie brilliant is not only the visuals but also the plot and the sound is outstandingthe acting is brilliant too if u want a good scare watch itwill give u plenty of goosebumps and jump out of the sofabedseat experiences so before watching it dont forget to keep your necessary supply of water and snacks near u because once the movie starts u wont be willing to bring any for maximum effect keep the lights off,astonish
this is top quality horror it creeps inside you and gives some serious scares when couple joshpatrick wilson  renairose byrne move into a new house with their young children one of their sons has an accident while exploring the attic the next day he doesnt wake up and the doctors are baffled by his brain activity which is not usual for a coma things in the house then start to turn very creepy the likable wilson here is the family man back to playing the nice guy we saw in lakeview terrace  watchmen as opposed to his comedic villainous role in the recent ateam byrne here although playing a worn and stressed out mother still manages to look good and demonstrates her range also impressed with lin shayemagda from theres something about mary playing it straightthis is a highly originally and engrossing horror and definitely up there with recent crowdpleasers like drag me to hell and paranormal activity see it at your peril,astonish
this movie is one of the most frightening movies i have ever seen before i start my review let me suggest you to watch this flick in the cinemas or at least with a modern home cinema equipment to be capable to appreciate all the noisy sounds creepy atmospheres and the brilliant score i might also warn you this movie is nothing for people that easily have nightmares you have to like the feeling of getting scared to watch this movie i was almost crawling out of the cinema at the end of this dark ride because i had so many moments of scary fears and i my heart pumped like a rattling machine gun but i must admit that i somehow like this feeling and when i got out of the cinema this feeling got away and the film didnt haunt me or kept me from sleepingas you might already suppose this film is not your usual horror slasher or gore movie as it works much more with images and sounds its a supernatural movie about demons and ghosts but that wont stop you from getting addicted from the bottom to the top to this intense and dark movie it starts all very slow just to get more and more profound and scary and to end with a big bang and a little twistthis is a movie full of ups and downs the sound rises the camera moves into a dark room and an actor opens a door or looks somewhere and you expect something scary but nothing happens at all you get used to it the music slows down the actors breathes and feels relieved when suddenly a dark scheme appears and almost freaks him to death in a moment of relative tranquillity thats whats so strong about this movie even if you know what happens and what the strange things mean or look like you never know when they appear how they appear and what happens next this movie plays with wrong expectations terrible fears and emotions i have rarely seen anything that was as scary as thismy only reason to not give the top rating is that the general idea of the movie is nothing new and could have been even more original but the rest is great from the camera works over the realistic acting to the brilliant score in times of saw 7 or scary movie 4 this flick is a true relief it helps to vote up the reputation of a genre that has become too commercial gore and ridiculous in the last few years and should get the status of a future classic this movie might be the renaissance of a whole genre and is on one level with the scary classics from the seventies and eighties and unites the old and the new generation with its creepy approach this is the first big cinematic highlight of the year 2011 dont miss the chance to watch itare you ready for a dark ride,astonish
i first of all saw the trailer of this at the movies when seeing another movie the trailer definitely caught my attention but then i saw it was by the makers of the first saw and paranormal activity which im a huge fan of both of those films and thought this i definitely got to seei went to see it and came out extremely impressedthe story was original and captivating it has mix of poltergeist and paranormal activity i was nearly disappointed when the story mentioned about possession because it has been used so many times but when i found its more than that with the boys ability it immediately grabbed mevery interesting use of lighting effects which made the scenes even more tensethe acting was great and very convincing and made it easier to connect well with the charactersthe soundtrack really gave me the creeps it even freaked me out on the opening titles even during when the scare scenes built up more and more i even tried to find a way to break the silence by moving in my chair or even making a slight coughthrough out this film you really had to look all over the settings when the scare scenes because you just notice things nearly at the last minute like it did with paranormalthe special effects were great there wasnt much but it use appropriately when it was needed for horror fans like me this is definitely for you trust me you wont be wasting youre money,astonish
with the makers of the original saw and paranormal activity behind this i was very intrigued to see how they would deliver a new angle to the haunted house premise the result a deliciously neat scary and tense if not a bit ridiculous ride which should please most horror fansis creepy for all the right and wrong reasons yes its very tense in parts and the supernatural forces that overpower the house are enough to make even the toughest of people jump out of their seats but when old women start wearing gas masks to talk to spirits and ghouls start looking something like darth maul youll start to find it very creepy indeed it also features two idiotic and notsoamusing policemen who really dont fit in place for this horror film and should belong in a scene from something like ghostbusters and the final part may seem a bit farfetched and ott however even though it may drag on in parts is better than your average standard haunted house talethe film does very well on the shock factor and never have i been in a packed cinema where most of the audience scream out loud and fix themselves solidly to the screen for the 98 minute run james wan certainly knows how to satisfy his audience and insidous will certainly play on your imagination even if it may be for all the wrong reasonsso if youre a fan of the genre and like films such as poltergeist paranormal activity and the amityville horror thisll be perfect for you as its simply great hauntedhousehorror and it wouldnt be right if the makers of saw didnt include a final twist at the end well watch this until the very last scene and youll be in for a subtle treat im sure a sequel will be soon to follow 610,astonish
i went to see on the back of the released stills of the movie which showed promise  i have usually been let down this time i wasnt i really enjoyed it it also succeeded in making the audience cower in their seats making girlfriends cling onto boyfriends arms nervous laughter after the scares and most importantly having the ability to stay with you long after it has finished plot is standard with a little twist man and wife with young family move into haunted house you think slamming doors voices strange faces its all here toss in the psychic woman the gadgets to capture changes in temperature and you have the usual set pieces influences are very obvious but never directly copied as definitely makes its own stamp in the haunted house movie genre what can also normally disappoint me in some of these ghost films is the ghosts are never shown enough here they are and although some of the ghosts miss the mark there are some genuinely frightening moments it also manages to keep interest as it switches from a creepy movie to almost a monster movie for me it did lose its tense edge when this happened but at least it never got boring for gore hounds and torture porn horror fans this is not for you  it is more poltergeist the fog and the shining than saw or hostel as a big horror fan myself i would recommend it as a fun scary ride,astonish
very affective horrorpoo your pants movie  literally will make you jump outta your skin even the title screen is haunting ive been a manic downloader for all scary and nasty horror films from the banned list to the top 100s etc but ive never been as on the edge of my seat cacking myself as i was when i went to see try to refrain from reading any spoilers about this movie and dont listen to the bad reviews all be it the story is a little flawed but that concludes the bad aspects of this movie try and see it at the cinema it makes the experience so much worthwhile i made my missus come to the cinema with me to watch it and now she cant look in any dark corners  shes well freaked still and its been a few days this movie is so scary so make sure youve been beforehand because its never pleasant for the person next to you when youve shat yourself ,astonish
wow is as the title says  gripping intense and scary the plot is about a couple renai and josh lambert played by rose byrne and patrick wilson who moves into a new house with their 3 children two sons and a baby daughter having moved into a new home they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging however one night the eldest child dalton bumps his head after falling off the ladder in the loft and is soon in a coma three months later after the accident creepy stuff and paranormal events begin to happen as ghosts can be seen and breakins happen they ended up moving into joshs mothers place but the events still happen in that house soon they find out that the house is not haunted it is actually their son dalton this is the scariest film that i have seen since the 1st paranormal activity film this film grips you from beginning to end as the scenes and the soundtrack set the mood and the atmosphere of the film which is terrifying and negative the film is also creepy and throughout the film the suspense builds up as you dont know what is going to happen nextand i was the only in the theatre who did a couple of screams overall the film succeeded in bringing the audience something scary suspenseful funny emotional and frightening all in one film which i have never seen with them combined verdict 910,astonish
rose byrne and patrick wilson move into a new house following which their middle child dalton falls into an unexplained coma then scary things start happening  noises people seen out of the corner of the eye bloody handprints on sheets so they move and the phenomena continue so wilsons mother calls in specialist help two comedy paranormal investigators and a more serious psychicmystictype personthe story is essentially poltergeist told with a paranormal activitytype vibe although there is no found footage pretence  this is a straightforward fictional supernatural storyit is maybe a little too leisurely in the setup but once it gets going and canters along quite nicely there are the requisite number of made you jump moments and the story is quite good fun and well told the small cast all do their jobs quite well and the film deliversincidentally is it unreasonable of me to infer a connection between the fact that the demon is very reminiscent of the phantom menaces darth sidious and the films title ,astonish
the first minutes of made it look like what i had thought it would be a decentmade horror film with decent thrills although not very original by the end i sorta was in love with this film and heres whythe films basic premise looks like another ghost story but its actually not like that as it goes on different images and figures pop up which i thought was better than just having ghosts while its true the basic plot of the film is not very original theres something quite original about how the film goes about it i mean i have not seen a horror film like this if i recall in any past years with a climax this overboard i say that in a good way yeah the final act has been criticized for going overboard but i thought it made the film standout even more it really does have the tone of a rollercoaster it sorta reminds me of the haunted mansion ride at disneylandultimately i strongly recommend this film if anything it is loving in its ability to play with loud music creepy if not scary images i didnt find the film scary to be honest but i had a blast with it and there are so many odd scenes that years from now i will be seeing over and over again on youtube i am surprised that it has done as well as it has with the mainstream moviegoers since i would have thought they would have dismissed it as dumb especially in the overthetop approach at the end,astonish
it really has been a while for a horror movie to make me jump and to be honest the first fifteen minutes did make me wonder if this movie was going to be any good and yesit did in this case the slow build up does benefit the tension and for once they actually put in characters you like not that you learn to know them well but at least we do care for them which of course is crucial in movies like thiswhen events start happening it is asked of you to put aside logic which you will be rewarded forso while is filled with creepy and scary moments it is not always super scary but after a while it does get very thrilling and tense and it doesnt let go must watch,astonish
i think this movie had a good storyline definitely some jumpy moments and freaky stuff going on i especially loved the addin of barbara hershey from 1982 the entity and the historic references the only thing that turned me off was the near ending i was good with the premise of a happy ending i could have even dealt with a twist but i didnt like the chokekill of a certain character no spoiler and thats where it all went down hill but overall well done and worth the price of admission good acting some hokey laughable stuff onthe edgeofyourseat moments and ghost busters to the rescue a must see on the big screen if not then make sure the lights are out i advise a dark room with a candle burning for the full effect,astonish
so for three years of my childhood i lived with my french mother and chinese father in the andes mountains under the tutelage of a peruvian shaman so i know a bit about astral projection and i wont bore you with all the intricacies of how much this film gets wrong its the equivalent of making a movie about space travel where rocket ships are sent into orbit on the power released by lighting a fart on fireon that note this film is the best comedy of the year not a ghost to be found here and theres all kinds of comic mishaps involving astral projection and lost soulsi give it a big thumbs up for making me laugh so hard but my monkey apparently was nonetoopleased and decided to astrally project himself to a dutch whorehouse insteadwhat can i say different strokes for different folks,astonish
you definitely get what you pay for when you see loud booms a unique premise and quite a few good scares its definitely one of the better horror films ive seen in recent years it beats the remakes of friday the 13th and a nightmare on elm street by a long shot but still doesnt match the intensity brought in a film like frozenthe plot renai and josh lambert byrne and wilson and their three kids move into a new house which looks like it was built some time in the good ol days the eldest of the three kids dalton simpkins ventures up to the attic to explore resulting in him falling off a ladder and hurting himself when josh cant wake dalton up the next morning he takes him to the hospital where we find out dalton is in a coma after he hit his head when falling off the ladderafter three months dalton still hasnt woken up he is now in the lamberts home for in home care now a number of paranormal events have been occurring renai starts to see different men at night some resembling demons and others looking like intruders it begins to be a nightmare for the whole familyi dont want to go into too much of the story because i feel the less you know going into it the better i saw this because i heard a few people online say its the scariest film ive seen in years i thought id see it on the big screen to top it off it was very effective and very eerie in its own right but not a lot is accomplished in its hundred and two minute run timewe never get a lot of questions answered in the film its almost like battle los angeles why is the audience bribed of information many dont care but for someone like me i want to know pretty much every answer to my questions but its a horror film i must really sound stupid for wanting background informationis not a slice em dice em fest so dont go in expecting from the makers of paranormal activity and saw to go very far director james wan took a little paranormal twist with this and doesnt give us tiresome torture porn or bangs and booms as main scares he adds bite to his barkstarring patrick wilson rose byrne barbara hershey andrew astor and leigh whannell directed by james wan,astonish
i find it hard to believe that so many people think this movie is fabulous and soooo scary what did i just watch the same movie strangely the answer isyesyes i did i had to go through 5 pages of reviews on this site to finally find some people who also were unimpressed with this filmim not even bothering to go into the whole plot it reminded me of poltergeist but no where near as thrilling and suspenseful no where near the buildup was so damned slow and the plot wasnt very good either it was a totally average kind of horror movie maybe not even average i thought it was kind of stupid people were laughing in the audience not good when its not a funny scene on the screen it wasnt scary or suspenseful i dont understand how people can call this movie frightening and unsettling its totally not either of course i didnt think paranormal activity was scary suspenseful or very goodi guess if you liked paranormal activityhave at it and watch this if like me you though pa was totally over hypedthen dont watch this itll be a waste of your time,astonish
first half was good it was fun and intenseeverything after the nerds arrived was cheesy unoriginal and plain stupidthe only thing this movie has going for itself are loud violins and boo scenesconclusion a movie to bring your girl to and have her hold on to you as you laugh at the horrible costumes and idiotic scenes if you are looking for something with a deep storyline or something to keep you awake at night skip this if you are looking for a ton of jump scenes and an idiotic plot line then by all means go see this movie dont expect a good plot or anything of the sort though,astonish
i was expecting a lot more and actually got more laughs out of the movie than scares  some of the scary characters were a bit ridiculous to me only major problem i had was the makeup and costumes needed a lot of work for me when i actually could see the grease paint on their faces i was pretty disappointed they looked more like clowns then the dead or then anything really scary at all  it had a great concept and good story line good music just needed a little help in the make up and costume department if they could just have improved those it might just have been a home run for me i wanted so much more from the makers of the movie pretty much make up costume department failed the makers hereif there were done more more realistic and eerie it might just have taken it to a whole other levelit is worth seeing however,astonish
that was the not one of a kind wurst movie ever made acting is horrible story line is horrible video fx is horrible camera angles and lights are horrible end is horrible so if you take those as a credit of a horror movie this is the best one otherwise wtf i just watch but interestingly looking that low budget horror movie makes hell lot of a box office sales either people are craving to watch bad movie or level of iqs of this planet hitting the rock bottom i do not want to believe that anyone can suggest to watch such thing unless as a bad joke i cannot stop myself to get angry to watch and waste my time on this really i am so not believe that wait till the end,astonish
now the last time i was freaked by a film was wolf creek so now having watched im not going to sleep without always wondering what made that noise no blood and guts and amazing camera work some truly scare the barnacles of you scenes especially the figures lurking in the shadows type effects not all the frights happen at night there are moments of humour thank god as they give you brief respite from the chillsthe acting is pretty good really especially the husband and wife i know one thing for sure id have moved out immediately seriously quietly ly creepythis movie actually had the hairs on my neck stand up and quiver,astonish
im writing this at 1133 pm on sunday night after watching im telling myself im writing the review now because i want to get it done before i forget the details of the movie the reality is im doing it now because i dont want to walk downstairs in the dark or brush my teeth in front of a mirror where something could suddenly appear behind me i have to thank for turning me into a wussy scaredy catsupernatural horror movies especially those that involve some kind of demon are one of my favourite genres ive watched all the ones i know about which is a fair few the exorcist remains at the top sinister is a fantastic recent example and is another example of the genre done rightthe thing that makes most effective is that its very well put together  good acting great and creepy as hell cinematography believable script eerie music and jump out of your seat sound effects in some horror movies where one of these parts is off it can let the whole movie down in all parts are done very effectively the end result is a film that will have you on edge the whole way throughunlike some horror movies  the worst recent example being mama  the characters in are not stupid when renai rose byrne  very effective in her role realises her house is haunted she wants to leave  immediately josh the father also believes seeing a room destroyed by the powers of the ghost is enough to convince him the house is haunted these nods to rationality make the movie believable which is always going to be a challenge when dealing with this genre my rule of thumb is that if by half way through the characters are acting how i would act  im as scared as they arethe story itself is a nice take on the genre especially the last 20 minutes i sometimes get really frustrated with these movies because the characters are never given a way to fight back in this isnt quite the case which is a nice changefinally  the twist at the end is terrifying it is exactly what i didnt want and yet kind of did but deep down was expectingi really enjoyed and cant wait for the sequeljust give me a few months to recover from this one,astonish
i did not like this movie at all i thought the beginning was great and i thought it was going to be another paranormal activity kind of thing but when they started on the little boy being trapped in astral projection kind of just ruined the movie for me also the hands coming out of the drawers and the demons standing there i would rather see drawers being thrown at someone by an unseen presence or reflections in the mirror by a demon this movie does not have any kind of scare factor whatsoever and i would never recommend anyone to watch this movie the directorswriters of this movie i dont think were really all there why would someone create that i dont understand how a little boy being trapped in an astral world would be scary this would be more of a scifi movie than a horror movie,astonish
as a connoisseur of paranormal cinema  especially films dealing with haunted houses ghosts parapsychology etc  i was eager to see ultimately the film is a major letdown but it does deliver a handful of satisfying moments which underscore the movies unfulfilled potential all in all is an inferior though not entirely worthless entry into the subgenre at the very least it functions as a case study for us to examine what does and does not work in the art of storytellingfirst of all and more than anything this movie had an amazing concept two parents are put to the test when their childs spirit is lost through astral projection doesnt that sound awesome not only does it work on paper but it couldve and shouldve worked on celluloid too mainly i think the poor execution is a result of the filmmakers overall approach to the subject matter in trying to cleverly lead the audience along on a shyamalanesque guessing game why wont dalton wake up what are all these entities the filmmakers succeed in boring the audience through the entire first act and half of the second not to mention ruining potential replay value in the processwhen the explanation of events does finally occur the already amateurish script resorts to a formulaic monologue so transparent in its delivery of exposition that i have to wonder if the writer even bothered with a second draft it wouldve been more honest on the filmmakers part if the medium character just looked directly into the camera while telling us about the place that i call the further im joking of course  never tell the audience something when you can show themanother gripe i have is the parapsychologist characters aka the comic relief nerds i swear these two belong in a tv commercial for progressive insurance or best buy or something dont get me wrong i love the general idea of bringing in parapsychologists and their inclusion unlike that of the stereotypical medium was both useful and praiseworthy but having a couple of hot pocket eating comedy characters show up halfway through an otherwise serious horror film is incongruous to say the least by themselves they were pretty entertaining but that kind of humor simply didnt belong in the film as is it felt forced and unnaturalthough perhaps the biggest error in the script  the most ridiculous unnecessary convoluted plot twist  was the revelation that daltons father was an astral traveler in the past but somehow forgot and then passed on this forgotten ability to his son as if genetics had anything to do with it would it not have been more dramatic and less convoluted if for example the father or even multiple characters had to learn astral projectionwell in spite of all its flaws does occasionally follow through on its concepts promise an unsettling atmosphere pervades a number of scenes and the spectral realm itself is effectively rendered with soft greens and blues which dimly illuminate the lingering impressionistic fog although rather trivial in the grand scheme of things this visual approach does provide a requisite moodiness to the latter sequences and this mood is further augmented by the surreal presence of virtually motionless entities some of which resemble idyllic 1950s suburbanites while the effectiveness of these elements makes the aforementioned flaws all the more lamentable by highlighting the films lost potential they also happen to accentuate the movies pseudolovecraftian ending thereby giving at the very least a strong outroif however the filmmakers had been more up front with the audience regarding the films concept perhaps by opening with an astral projection scene they could have spent more time exploring various themes while simultaneously intensifying the drama instead the film sacrifices an intellectual approach in favor of a more generic treatment which heavily relies on mood and horrorpops for most of its running time too bad  it could have been so much better,astonish
now if there is one thing that freaks me out most in movies it is horrors that involve children in any way so when i sat down to watch a movie from the guys and gals that have given us paranormal activity revolving around the story of a possessed child well lets just say i had my diaper at the readyfollows a textbook family the parents josh patrick wilson and renai rose byrne that have it all as they move into their new suburban house with their 3 beautiful children however all is not as it seems as one of their sons dalton ty simpkins after slipping off a ladder while exploring in the attic falls into a coma strange things then begin to happen as objects move mysterious voices are heard and you catch things in the corner of your eye after this activity drives them from their new home they enlist the help of a paranormal psychic elise lin shaye and the horrifying truth becomes evident it is not the house but dalton that is haunted as with most horror movies i find they only tend to scare me until i know what im up against ie keep the monster hidden and let the suspensenot knowing get me grabbing for my cushion this movie was similar in that respect with the majority of the scares coming in the first two thirds before it began to fall away slightly this was more than enough though and will give you the jumps that you are looking for if you decide to go and see itconsidering what the trailer gives us i was quite surprised that it took so long to get to the realisation that it was in fact the boy that was possessed rather than where they were living it is a good 50 minutes to an hour before this is realised which irked me somewhatthe inclusion of the two bickering paranormal activity assistants was a well thought out idea as it gave a break from trying to scare you injecting a bit of comedy into the fray and enabled the audience to be lulled into a more relaxed state so that when the next scare came you were off guard and less than ready for itapart from the scary evil entities horrors are made or broken by the music or lack thereof that accompanies the suspense and the cinematography does not disappoint the music leads to the creation of an intense tension that stays with you throughout most of the movie and lingers after it finishes and the cinematography is also top notchdoes serve up moments of actual horror that had me keeping an eye out for anything out of the ordinary several hours after the film had finished it is a far cry from james wan director and leigh whannell writer other collaborations of the saw series and despite using a tried and tested framework they made the movie original it will probably be one of the better horror movies thats released this year but then again i doubt there will be much competitionfor further reviews feel free to check out httpwwwfanaticalaboutfilmscom,astonish
ive never been a fan of hauntedhouse stuff so i wasnt expecting much here and i wasnt surprised at the mediocrity of this filmthis is a stupid story about a couple whose older son is able to astrally project so that he wanders around the spiritual world while his body lies in a coma at home the only way to free this kid is to send his father into the ether to retrieve him er oki gave this film two stars rather than one because it succeeded in producing a little tension as spooky things started to happen around the house these occurrences are more creepy than scary and they get old fast after a while they are downright dumb a redfaced character that resembles a devil ive seen scarier images in a coloring booka big problem with this movie is that it tries to be funny amidst all this ridiculousness and fodder this does no more than create cognitive dissonance and irritation in the viewerid never have sought this film out but it was screened as part of a horrorfilm class that im taking though presented as a good example of sound artistry i didnt find compelling even on that frontwhat does it say about our culture that a movie like this spawned three sequels now thats something to be scared aboutps dont be fooled by the appearance of barbara hershey in this films castno ones acting in this film is particularly interesting,astonish
firstly before someone curses at me for the rating my true rating is more of a 6510secondly i will say im a very big fan of james wan i support all his work and think he is a very talented personnow onto the review this movie starts out like a haunted house film and it does a decent job at having an eerie feeling its nothing too original and its pretty cheesy but its fun then it gets muddled they add a strange twist that its the son that is an astro projector and his empty vessel has attracted a bunch of spirits and demons then come to find out the father is one too and has to pull his son out it gets very muddled despite this it is still an ok movie and kinda fun however i think its one of wans lesser worksi still recommend it for a few viewings,astonish
well it was kinda good but i was expecting much more than that,astonish
wish i could give 10 rated to this absolutely absurd movie the screen play was creating mixing into a blender1 the shining2 the others3 ghostbusters4 pans labyrinthat the end the final result is a no flavor smoothie with no color and consistency the characters are so poor the cheap production and the lack of authenticity makes me believe that patrick wilson must be facing terrible financial problems in order to accept to participated in this thing,astonish
it was interesting and with sensible storyline it has sequel and thats great,astonish
this movie had comedy and some of the scariest things i have ever seen this is probably the scariest movie i have watched my whole short life,astonish
never sleep again is a closer title this movie was great and terrifying in almost every way the creepy demons and dead people may be watching and following you was creepy enogh with great costume for the old lady spirit and if that wasent bad enough you will be scared to go to bed at night in fear of astral projecting away,astonish
pretty good ending could be better but overall it was a good horror movie need to watch the other movies,astonish
after watching the movie i wasnt impressed i figured id get on here and see what other reviewers had to say that might change my mind a little as well as what some interesting facts were that could maybe influence my negative opinion to a possibly less negative or even forgiving one i didnt want to just type my first impression having not really thought about it all too much for it to be nothing more than a negative unhelpful rant of garbageunfortunately nothing changed my opinion everything reinforced itim a huge fan of patrick wilson but this movie is by far not one of his best examples of his acting talents he looked just as bored as everyone else on screen the movie drags on as monotonous as it possibly can while providing many overly obvious jump scareswhat bugged me the most was how some of the imagery in this movie had the potential to be so much more impactful if it had been treated a little better the only thing that will stick with you after this film is tiny tims tiptoe through the tulips and even then i dont know how grateful youd be for that because its truly obnoxious theres clearly a reason why theres so many memes out there of this movie not because its so scary or genuinely demented but because its a joke instead of being tuned in for the scare of a lifetime viewers will spend their time amazed at how theyve all of the sudden became a psychic due to newfound abilities to know whats going to happen in the movie ages before it happenswhen it comes to the ending of the movie it was so lazily done it feels more like a glorified worldstar video that should be on reddit than it does a tension packed twist ending it had me in disbelief that james wan directed this the same james wan that would go on to handle the conjuring so well and had brought us saw had made this colorless lifeless garbage that was on my television right now how disappointingif you havent seen this movie dont bother its nothing more than an overhyped laughing stock that tries and fails to be the poltergeist of its time even then if you still insist grab some friends and some beers and get ready to indulge each other in some mst3k style banter as one cannot hesitate to poke fun at the garbage fire that is this movie if you have a hard time finding it to watch check the 5 bin at walmart im sure itll be there,astonish
booo a badly make up demon wants to posses your childyou know james wan we know this movie since the 70sat least in going to give props to the guy he knows how to handle a camera the technical aspects are quite good but the story,astonish
there is nothing scarier in this world than chapter 1,astonish
this movie is laughable and pathetic not scary at all just totally horrible and awful i wasnt scared i only laughed at it because it was just so cheesy and absolutely pathetic and stupid worst horror movie ive ever seen i dont understand why everyone is saying its scary if anything its nothing more than a mediocre comedy flick,astonish
its so scary so intense how one can find it in 2019 while it was made in 2010 even anabelle is less scary than this,astonish
3 years before the conjuring they had already made itthis semblable example of a dark supernatural thriller trying to pass as a horror is just as heavy handed just as obnoxiously cliched just as simpering with its bland normative characters learning the hard way that ghouls just wanna have funwith its less than original black and brownish filter making it feel even more factory produced than it already is the occasional atmospheric moment makes me want to try and put my guard down and enjoy it as an oldschool horror but every time i want to meet this picture half way it does something to make me just go f you movie whether its an inyourface effect using a sudden burst of strings to kill a frightening moment seriously thats the horror equivalent of a laugh track or any of the many cheap scareslike conjuring they bring in the paranormal experts thats why its a paranormal thriller not a horror theyre more focused on world building than actual chillsit feels more like a simpsons halloween special so often that i wonder if they should have just made it a horror comedy but it takes itself way too seriously to be taken seriously by the end the only pleasure i could get from it was to laugh at its own expenseeven its ending which has real potential wasted its own potential by clumsy executionthis decade has been the best decade ever for horror but this is everything wrong with the horror of this decade this didnt annoy me as much as the conjuring but it was pretty dang close,astonish
less scary and a little boring storyline but a good start to the series the second is better and the 3rd and fourth are awesome and way more scary i just love elise,astonish
the build up to when everything goes down is a bit slow but i think necessary in amplifying the emotions you feel in the last sequences there are jump scares though what i found to be most terrifying is the imagery  imagery being one of the motifs of the story as well initially using drawings and photographs and then to dreamsthe music feels a bit cheesy but works and it was a fun movie with solid composition,astonish
when the ghostbusters and the poltergeist lady showed up because it seemed like such a screaming left turn in terms of tone and i still think the abrupt comic relief was maybe just a little too much to ask of the audiences suspension of disbelief but after seeing the whole movie i feel more inclined to applaud the bravery of these choices than to decry them for being unconventional if filmmakers are going to make heavy demands on an audiences credulity i vastly prefer that they err on the david lynch of side of the line than the michael bay side,astonish
this has to be one of the greatest supernatural haunting movies in the last twenty years,astonish
most horror movies are either cheesy or have interesting twist this is the first one ive watched in twenty years that is actually scary,astonish
easily one of the scariest movies ive ever seen even now that ive seen it a few times it still gets me every time youll be sleeping with the lights on for a week after seeing this,astonish
shows that you dont need gore and grotesque violence to make a scary movie what makes this movie scary is that as a viewer you imagine what terror the family must be facingmovies about spirits are not new yet makes it feel fresh with unique theories of the paranormal and the spirits whos malevolence are obvious due to their appearance what adds to the unsettling feel is that theres something humanlike and subtle about their appearance that makes you imagine what horrific fate they must have had also the settings were very atmosphericthe strength of this movie is that it pulls you into the story it makes you believe the story could be possible because a lot of attention was given to adding depth to the characters when needed but also leaving room for mystery when it was needed it was all well pacedits simply well written directed and acted,astonish
suspense is good climax is good and the characters are passable i liked the old lady unfortunately things happen to her that made me a little disappointment the idea of a demon harboring a young child is definitely scary and the demon itself without the special effects which suck looks scary theres a certain jump scare that gets me still to this day the idea of the further is definitely creative however elements of it dont work sometimes along with a certain sequence of events it was very rushed also there was a weird decision in the film where they didnt want the old ladys help it simply didnt make sense however i liked the movie ok 710,astonish
a good thrill ride for younger audiences not familiar with the likes of poltergiest or wans favourite 1991 tv movie the haunted,astonish
the story centers on a married couple josh and renai lambert and their 3 children strange things start happening and quickly begin to escalate their son dalton enters a comatose state in the real world after a fall while his astral self is in dimension realm called the further a realm between life and death the boy then becomes a target different supernatural entities are trying to claim and inhabit his body though some a stronger and more aggressive than othersthe cinematography has some very unique and interesting shots the scares are quite good building up over time adding suspense but there are a few jump scares and loud musical ques the visuals and atmosphere are what ever eeriemade by the same dude james wan who made another horror franchise the saw series8  10 itsa scary boi,astonish
maybe its because i find supernatural stuff less intriguing as a nonbeliever in ghosts and demons or maybe its because ive seen a lot of the stuff in this movie done before is why i didnt like this movie i think personally its both though this movie does have some cool sequences and interesting creature designs it just doesnt save it from the mediocre plot,astonish
i really like  since 8 y ago scare me a loot i dont remember well about all but 810,astonish
the set up is familiar but is still an incredible low budget horror patrick wilson rose byrne and lin shaye all give great performances its well filmed and james sams direction is incredible resulting in some amazing sequences that slowly build tension very effectively the unique horror world is well explored and the humour works,astonish
james wan did a very good movie  it is best than other horrer movies like scary movie etc the music is so scary and visual effect is awsome ,astonish
its complicated to make a comment on this movie it got great sound effect which scared the s out of me but as for the plot theres a lot more space to improve to be more coherent,astonish
this film is really entertaining there are more scares than fears you have to look closely at the details because there always anticipate what is going to happenthe only bad thing is that is a long film but at least there are always things happening aroundin resume i recommend it if you want to have a moment of tension,astonish
its been quite a while since ive seen a movie this scary it doesnt solely use jumps area but also horrendous and blizzard looking visuals which made me scream a few timesthe plot was good and easy to follow but aso wasnt too predictable in my opiniona great movie and a classic in my book,astonish
wan and whannell have in effect ripped pages from the poltergeist playbook and stripped the formulas down to oldstyle gothic scares has no higher ambition than to scare the audience and it succeeds much of the time,astonish
ultimately works because of mr whannells script which manages to be inventive and unpredictable despite its paintbynumbers formalism,astonish
the first good surprise of 2011 in the movies emerges and it left the man behind the first mortal games james wan the director works with mastery of the clichs of haunted house films and creates a truly frightening work something that has not been seen in contemporary cinema for a long time anyone who sees only the trailer or the synopsis has no idea how much the film evolvesat one point the film has a touch of poltergeist of tobe hooper and steven spielberg but takes its own original course wan takes control of the situation and timing of the moments of fright which take the audience by surprise countless times is sure of chills and disturbance during its duration as for demonic elements of the film impressive as james wan balances the subtle and exaggerated with skill,astonish
just watch it its very good scary james wan has really placed an indelible mark with his style on modern horror arts  crafts is the new victorian haunted house that can bee seen everywhere after this film american horror story lights out etc now hes directing aqua man for whatever reason just a bad move saw was bad too so this can be added to the pile and the conjuring though are his best films to date keep making horror,astonish
so this guy moves his family into an amazing arts  crafts period house which is completely unattainable under a million  letting his wife stay at home writing her music and taking care of the kids while he works then she suddenly starts giving him grief over seeing spirits give me a god damn break karen just take care of it dalton is going through puberty hes gonna start seeing some things just set up some flood lights in his room keep a shotgun by the bed ive got papers to grade,astonish
it took me a while to watch and its follow ups with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list decided to finally watch them all with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings also with an appreciation if not quite undying love for horrorhaving seen it is not a horror classic or at least to me it isnt and it is understandable as to why people dont like it especially if overfamiliarity strangeness and silliness are not for you personally was warts and all worth the toooverdue wait and it is not hard to see why it has appealed to others there are a lot of merits executed very well for one thing llooks great especially for horror films released in recent years too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap it looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting the music when used is haunting and not overbearing recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regardscript is not too awkward and is structured coherently with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour the direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material the story takes time to unfold but doesnt get dull actually really admired the restraint of the first half meaning that the film started off incredibly well is genuinely scary with a great atmosphere with actual tension suspense and dread in a palmsweating and heartpounding sense at its best while not relying too much on jump scares they are there but have build up and were surprisingalso liked the characters more than expected the leads were ones worth caring for didnt get frustrated with them wish for more personality or annoyed by them the ghosts may be overused but have eerie presences and didnt look that cheap to me the direction is assured and the performances are strong from particularly an intense lin shaye and patrick wilson handling his character growth believably rose byrne is also as professional as ever on the other hand the restraint does decrease later on and things get a little too overthetop in some of the second half very unsubtle overstuffed kitchensinklike things do get silly at this point too and less logical making the sense go out the window the second half is still intriguing and creepy the film just worked much better when restrainedit has been said that is derivative definitely agree with this the overfamiliarity from running through as many modernhauntedhouse clichs as can muster and having parts similar to other horror films is all over the film and makes one wish there was more freshness will admit that the final twist is a shock but instead of being unnerving of ingenious it came over as out of kilter wacky and not easy to take at face value the whole ending in fact felt rushed summing up enjoyable and effective but the divisiveness is understandable 710 bethany cox,astonish
was looking to watch some horror movie on internet downloaded this one by chance i wasnt disappointed what makes this movie creepy is there are different ghosts and you never know what they will reveal in the next shot,astonish
this is seriously one of the scariest movies i have ever seen in my life i remember i took my date to see this the weekend it came out and after viewing it we both didnt sleep that night not to mention i was surprised at how scary it was being that it was pg13 this is almost a masterpiece based on the ending alone ,astonish
i love going back and watching this movie i guess everyone has different taste but what creeps me out about this movie is the music and compared to crap thats been coming out recently its pretty goodi think the whole idea of dreams is interesting because you dont know what goes on when your asleep and i love the idea i watched this movie the first time in 9th grade i believe it was in our classroom and we turned the lights off and it was awesome feeling you know i just realized what makes things scarierwhen people around you are scared when people around you are screaming and hugging each other it puts more of a fear into you or me but when people around me are chill and quiet it rubs off its fun to be scared together even if its just pretendit sets the atmosphere idk i guess i like it because it brings back good vibes im sure everyone can relate,astonish
original intense horror moments really feel it with great sound effects and medium scary characters,astonish
i struggled a bit with this one to be honest this might be the worst james wan movie ive seen so farhe plays like always with horror movies clichs but in this one they are boring i was bored its possible that i just miss farmiga just perfect rose byrne is actually pretty good good in bridesmaids excellent in the small roles on the xmen movies she does fine but its less memorablehaving said that it picks up once they finally accept that ghosts existsand then it picks up again with the final twist which i didnt see coming it just didnt work for me anyways when i say that it picks up is that the movie starts to go faster not necessarily better i didnt love the first slow half and i didnt love the scares of the second half,astonish
this represent my opinionfor all movies i rate i mean the following10 exellent movie 8 good movie but less than exellent5 you will not regret watching2 wasting time,astonish
feels a lot like an oldfashioned horror film instead of blood and gore it relies on suspense and the unknown to create a sense of fear it takes a while to get going and the final act will disappoint some its a bit bizarre but it if youre in the mood to be scared this movie will do the trick,astonish
this film was pretty creepy to begin with when you actually saw what was scaring the characters it looked terrible like something from a kids movie sometimes what you dont see scares you the most,astonish
i honestly dont know how this movie has such a low score even lower than the descent which is a cheap summer teen screen blah anyway im a huge fan of horror real horror i appreciate being scared in an honest way not by cheap jump scares like almost every horror movie made these days so naturally i go through a lot of bad horror flicks before i find a good one in every hundred or so when a movie has the ability to make my hair stand up numerous times with no jump scare involved it makes it into my blu ray collection this one made it in there as soon as it was released i went and saw this in theatres and my hands were cold and clammy the entire time i felt exhausted leaving the movies from being perpetually scared for a couple of hours this movie has some of the best suspense ive experienced in years right from the opening credits while that eerie high pitched note plays youre immediately put into an unnerving mood then the way james wan actually scares you with true horror making you feel scared without needing to pull cheap jump scares to do it like in the scene where the demon is in daltons room when the mother is describing her dream all you can see of him is the figure in the dimly lit room which is scary enough on its own then she asks what he wants and all you see is the demon slowly point to dalton with a slight crackling sound as his arm moves thats it no jump scare no cheap effects just pure dread thats horror and thats what most of this movie is likethen theres the score the sound effects they use from yesteryear such as the slamming of random piano keys in scenes that scare you just hearing that jarring sound scares you enough and ill never be able to listen to tiptoe through the tulips the same way again ever,astonish
i love the horror genre i love being scared unfortunately most of todays horror movies dont have that effect on me anymore this genre is being beat to death by cheap jump scares really bad acting and recycled plot lines i still search for the few good ones amongst the bunch and often come out empty handed it seems one good horror movie will come out every few years with a bunch of really bad ones to fill the gap between them hows the saying go you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince its like that but with movieswell was one of the good ones no scratch that it was one of the best horror movies ive ever seen to date right from the beginning with that unnerving low volume tone playing during the intro i was already feeling anxious i went and saw this in the theatre and i can honestly say it was the first time ive ever actually been scared at a movie my palms were cold and clammy the entire time it wasnt just a heart racing kind of scare during the scary scenes but a kind of scary that makes you uncomfortable even between scenesunfortunately they continue to cheapen this film by releasing terrible awful laughable sequels just to make a quick buck so i dont recommend even seeing them just watch this one james wan director used to be better hes mainstreamed however how many spinoffs of the conjuring must we endure,astonish
honestly none of this wouldve happened if they let the kid die,astonish
i really loved how it flipped the haunted house concept where it isnt the house specifically thats haunted but the demons from the other world it was a real boo fest where characters were appearing and disappearing throughout the house a good old fashioned horror movie like the others or poltergeist,astonish
this movie introduces the viewers to parallel world of souls that functions in a different way a series of mysteries unlock when dalton is ill and patrick is sent to rescue his son on the way to rescue his his he encounters the dark side of his own past and has to face the consequences the part ends on a horror note when elise realizes the truth about josh but gets killed thrilling and exciting story will surely give you sleepless nights,astonish
many thanks to mr james wen who directed this very nice filmand thanks to all executive who have been able to make such a highquality film,astonish
7610 a bit of a repetitive bore until it embraces its delightful goofiness there is a certain amount of relief when you find out that the movie is not taking itself too seriously and it allows wonkyness to work in its favor aside from the magnetic lin shaye the enthusiasm of the actors seems to reach only the pointy ends of a dollar bill which is neither offensive nor surprising plenty of fun jump scares likely to cause popcorn explosions and otherworldly scenarios riding the fine line of enjoyable ridiculousness will keep you entertained,astonish
thrillers these days leave a lot to be desired and arent very memorable mostly because of the acting which in turn is made horrible because of the script considering this i went into this movie with low expectations despite going onto imdb to gather the overall score and skipping the reviews butthe film was brilliantly written and cast really well it was suspenseful with low lighting brilliant and had me jumping out of my seat at every turn if not turning my volume down if you like a good and truly scary movie then this is iti cant wait to see the sequel though sequels are generally known to be worse than the original but i will give it a go and see how i like it im expecting big things from it so itd better no disappoint,astonish
i just watched for the first time and ive got to say that its really entertaining a horror film thats packed with frights and fun and a horror film that does not feel like a pg13 flick incredibly amazing performance from horror legend and icon lin shaye as elise rainier and frighteningly eerie performance from joseph bishara as the lipstick face demon cant wait to see the other chapters,astonish
this is by far the scariest movie of a decade and honestly i dare to say its my favorite horror movie of all time i like psychological horror movies and this one goes into every core of your mind there are just few horror movies that i truly admire the exorcist and the ring are these 2 i thought there wont be anything that could possibly beat these two but i was wrong is terrifying in every way possible it just creeps you out the sound the story  the characters everything connected so well and so intelligently  if youre having second doubts about watching this movie dont doubt anymore this is the horror movie that will make you go to bed with your lights on  oh and dont even try to compare anabelle or the conjuring with this one holds these two in a pocket,astonish
horror movies tend to be weirdly rated the conjuring the exorcist these movies werent half as good as this movie i feel this is one brilliantly done horror movie i love horror movies and always critique and at times even make fun of decisions made by characters i felt this movie was genuine the decisions seemed realistic the scares were real scares when you watch a horror movie and you want to really watch it for the genre you probably do something like what i do switch off the lights in the room put on the earphones or the speakers and watch it somewhat close to the screen if you do that with this movie haha well lets just say you wouldnt be going to sleep right after you finish its really well done and is one of my favourite horror movies of all time,astonish
is about a normal family that have just moved into a new area a few weeks later tragedy arises beyond the family as reenae and joshs son dalton falls off a ladder ending up in a coma since that incident the family have been experiencing horrific and terrifying monsters aiming to cause pain on the family after hiring a group of professionals we actually find out that dalton was never been in a coma his physical body has remained on earth but his mental body has been taken over by the monsters and it trapped in a place known as the further we also find out that josh has also been in the same situation as he has been dreaming of a creepy woman dressed in blackthis movie is scary i need to point that out now the director has done an amazing job on making this movie terrifying i struggled to go around my own home at night with the thoughts of the monsters in my mind the music and the jump scares are also fantasticall of the actors do a fantastic job of portraying their characters but the star of the film for me is lin shaye her character is by far the most likeable throughout the whole movie but everyone does a great job this movie is one of my favourite horrors of all time its the only one i have seen in the series so i cant wait to review the next 3 i recommend this movie to all horror fans as you will be creeped out,astonish
i got to see this movie just recently on br at a video night with friends all of them had already seen it but were up to see it again so i guess for them there was value in a 2nd viewingnow the positive  i liked the characters  even the kids a rare thing there was actually good chemistry and a good storyline somewhere the movie itself felt quite by the numbers though there were jump scares but not too many or too annoying ones  little shaky cam and overall a suspenseful atmosphere  quite appreciatedthere is not much i outstanding i can say about this movie but also nothing dreadful it was a good time that did not disappoint but was it scary  maybe i am a bit numb for those horror movies i am more affected by suspense and strangeness than outright scares  so no it was not scary  at all but i do not feel scared by demons or ghosts at alli can recommend this movie for a video night as a filler  but not as a main feature,astonish
nothing more to say nothing more to say nothing more to say,astonish
this movie is so freacking scary it doesnt make sense its does go for the worst towards the end  the red demon isnt scary in so scenes and he becomes mess up but the whole rest is so scary you guys dont understand  the supsence we have at the start  the fact of never getting attacked or anything just lots of strange shitt happening makes the movie even scarier if you dont want to sleep watch this movie,astonish
james wans 2010 its a very effective and creative horror film i like james wan films i think saw its better than this and the conjuring films are also pretty good its still really enjoyablemany of its concepts are pretty interesting and even if its not that original i will say that it plays with many ideas that i found to be amusing the music its perhaps the best part about the film its such a great score and while i do like the movie i think this music deserves a better film it sounds like the soundtrack to a modern day horror masterpiece and its far from a masterpiece but its not bad in any way i enjoyed it but i think james wan has done better work in his career still quite a good film,astonish
on the surface the different dimension horror genre is so far fetched but when you look deeper at you see a trend of similarities after the film aired movies like the conjuring and sinister were created because of this movie and although this is the most modern of classic horrors it is probably the most influential this film takes large motifs like children photographs and spirit hunters and uses them together in the plot to create a very intense film those motifs are now famous and this is why this movie created the different dimension horror genrewwwchorrorcom,astonish
i went into really excited i love james wan and i think both conjuring movies are incredibly welldirected thrill rides although is considered to be one of the scariest movies in recent years unfortunately i felt that the scares in this movie were really cheap and the characters were too thinalthough the conjuring may not have the greatest characters that movie is so welldirected with such incredible atmosphere and pacing that it was a nonstop thrill ride the scares were legitimately frightening and were not just loud sound effects unfortunately the scares in are more like the latter they are all accompanied by an earsplitting noise that honestly annoyed me every time it happened there were some scenes like the scene in which the ghost is standing behind the crib early on in the movie that were ruined by the ridiculously loud piano bang noise that scene would have been so much creepier if the ghost was shown just standing there in complete silence having the loud noise only distracts the viewer from what is really scary about the scene if the jumpscares were only occasional i probably would have been able to disregard them but it got to the point where practically every scary scene involved a loud jolting noise and there were few subtle scenes in between the creepiest moment in the movie was when joshs mom showed him the pictures of the old lady demon standing beside him that was an incredibly scary scene and did not include a headacheinducing bang the creepy subtly was enough to make the scene work the characters were also very bland i would have been able to overlook the cheap nature of the scares if i felt emotionally attached to the story but i didnt we were supposed to care about josh because of his past encounters with that old lady i suppose but it was set up really poorly in fact the beginning of the movie was really weak in general the characters were first shown in really sloppy fashion and i never really felt hooked like i have in previous james wan moviesthere was a lot of creativity in this movie though the third act in particular was quite entertaining and the ghost dimension had a great atmosphere it separated this movie from typical haunted house films the designs of the creatures and ghosts were all great although i must admit the main demon creature looked far too similar to darth maul and it is incredibly obvious that james wan ripped off that design thats not to say that it isnt scary though i also hate the fact that the movie ended in a cliffhanger we never got any resolution to the film and they might as well have had the words tune in for part 2 show up on the screen at the end despite the creative elements in that third act to be completely honest there were too many similarities to poltergeist and it should have been toned down by a lot it didnt feel like a loving homage so much as it felt like it was ripping it offoverall is just ok i was incredibly disappointed with the lack of truly scary scenes in the movie and i hope that james wan never reverts to the techniques he used here5510 grade c,astonish
first of all the director tried to do everything to made this a perfect horrorthrilleror even masterpiece according to some people  but failed at every deptall james wan r filled with very unnecessary jump scare scenes this1 is not an exception also it will be followed by some nonsense sequelso watch out familyfather bloodline with a sp giftevil spirit following themghosts in the new house they moved in  oh anything left dear director sir  1 st one which seems to be unique but only to writer audiences already watched it in poltergeistthey added some of their nonsense in itthey tried to frighten people with red demon which actually made me laugh when he climbs like spider man on the wall  a psycho evil killer spirit following childs father with a secret desire director tried to create some nonsense craziness with this psycho worst part of the movie goes to end in a diff way rather than happy ending  which is not enough to save itonce a wise man said a bad can ruin your day  so watch it at your on risk,astonish
movie reviewis dark and intense with some very scary and creepy character moments is visually haunting the tone vibe and atmospheric visuals of the film is thrilling spooky and very terrifying jump scares scenes and sequences are chilling and genuinely realistic is a well shot horror film with strong solid performances and direction james wan direction is strong and patrick wilson and rose byrne are amazing in the film the film is little slow in the beginning and takes time to build itself few scenes are slow paced some sub plot seems little rushed but all over is a well made horror filmplease note that this review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film and does not represent others thank you,astonish
despite the fact all his vital signs are normal a little boy has lapsed into a comatose state after encountering something in the attic of his parents new home handsomelymade ghost story with some shudders though director james wan and screenwriter leigh whannell keep the audience on edge by mechanical means loud noises door slams an earsplitting security alarm and an incessantly crying baby the only aural effect that shows any ingenuity is a 60s recording of tiny tim singing tiptoe through the tulips which is scary all by itself the family at the center of this thriller are cookiecutter dull while the plot developments are derivative and carried out listlessly followed by a sequel in 2013 and a prequel in 2015and one fears theres more to come 12 from ,astonish
ive only seen bits and pieces of this movie its not scary at all the main monster looks like darth maul in star wars the phantom menace which is the least popular movie in the saga the trailer was the scariest part of the movie i bet seeing 47 meters under will be more scary,astonish
im a big fan of horror director james wan but this is the first time ive watched one of his movies and felt underwhelmed the saw franchise were much more complete horror movies and the conjuring remains one of the creepiest most disturbing films ive ever watchedis still quite scary but unlike wans other films it didnt have much of an effect on me maybe its because the plot didnt feel believable or that it relied a little too much on jump scares towards the end whatever it was i just didnt enjoy as much as i was expecting theres nothing wrong with it it just didnt wow me like wans other films,astonish
the premise is pretty good although it put me in mind of poltergeist with the whole having to go to another world to save someone or the classic part of amityville 8 with the final attic scene this was a very promising storyline however it tries so hard to be realistic from the off then trails off into fantasy land sigh i really felt for the characters originally struggling with their young son who suddenly one day after a fall is in a coma cue distraught mother and absent working late aggro father refusing to believe that the house is haunted after weird things suddenly start to happen before finding irrefutable evidence  who does not look at their kids wall and see drawings when trying to find out what has happened to them they spend a good deal of time in his bedroom but never spot a massive clue some scenes genuinely had me freaked the shoes and the little boy dalton walking around while in a coma was very eerie the creepy guy stood by him pointing the house in the further with the very odd family but the main demon well not so much didnt even look scary a pierced darth maul esque face with blue eyesthe classic cloven hooves under furry legs and razor sharp teeth showing hints of a forked tonguehmmm sure it was at the point where he is filing his claws on a sander surrounded by puppets in some phantom of the opera worthy setting that i felt the movie had lost its way slightly also the wholecreepy psychic woman who knows more than she lets on mothers propheticflashback dream and of course the token over exuberant paranormal investigators made me think tired clichs but they did manage to make some scenes more realistic in this attempt at leastso a few too many clichs and cookie cutter horror scenarios later the hey im a psychic somethings up with your house you know that cause i pause mid sentence and give that look but dismiss it solets look round hereohyep a ghostlets break it to the family person x not i refuse to get help you are full of it oh no wait my badthe house is falling apart   ok maybe we should do this lets call a spirit astral bodyooh geez that escalated quickly its gone wrong and spirits are attacking us lets go to the other world to save someone and follow someones voice back pauses for air the one saving grace drum roll twist at the end hurray and yes ever the hard to please vieweri humbly admit i didnt see this coming or fully grasp it pretty open to interpretation  however having now seen the next 2 instalments i have to set it only goes from bad to worse 3 is barely viewable and 4 who knows,astonish
is a stereotype horror film filled to the brim with cheap shock drops and a story lacking depth or interest there are some impressive moments of lighting vs framing but it doesnt flow and becomes too fantastical and mystical to be grounded and real the climax conflicts with the main body of the film where it is attempting to ground the surreal and paranormal but then sends the world of into a hellish scene which is so flamboyant it is more comedic than horrific falls victim to showing too much of the shadowy villain and leaves little to be desired with so little left to the imagination it becomes more boring than anything else,astonish
this movie did not promise much but it ended up deserving my congratulations traveling out of the body sleeping or hypnosis is a rare theme in horror films and has given body to the film in an elegant and solid way the film does not allow us to have an immediate perception of what is really happening and this helps to lengthen the suspense and mystery around it which gradually becomes more intense grabbing the audience james wan the director made his reputation with the saw franchise which i do not appreciate for being too graphic apparently this director is truly capable of doing horror without resorting to liters of false blood lin shaye is the most notable actress in the film with a strong presence and a charisma built on experience and talent but patrick wilson in the role of josh was also at ease and made a good performance in harmony with rose byrne the film has an interesting ending although without the intensity that we could be expecting another thing i find pleasant is the use of cinematic solutions that are alternative to the avalanche of special effects that we are used to as it was done for the evil entity or when it was decided to show the further as a dark and misty place the sound effects a classic haunted house setting and a purposefully gray cinematography do the rest and make this movie worth remembering refined and elegant the film still uses some usual clichs in the horror and haunting films but does so in the right way and so convincingly that it ends up being another plus point in this great quality film,astonish
the truth is that i was surprised and much and for good a scary movie that is scary it is not the fear of the scare that if you take the sound away there is no fear no it is fear well done it puts you in a world that you believe it takes you to the dreams and it does not fall into the ridiculous one but that gives you you are astonishedthe film moreover is made with courage is not afraid to let you see things normally scary movies hide everything and then get you on loose planes what you have to be afraid this is not the case with this movie you are watching on the screen what is happening and this way it gives you even more fear in the spoiler area i will comment morethe actors are very well even those who are made up do not fall into the ridiculous the other way around they scare you because they take you to a world you do not know and it is scarythe photograph is very well used because it is beautiful and in the dream uses it very well to tellthe management is very good it does not bore you it upset you and takes you the planes are beautifully designed composed and designed to be scaryfear and intrigue goes up and up and does not decayspoilerthere are plans like one in the living room that you see what is going on in this room we see a character who enters walks through the room and as it passes a ghost appears and when the ghost disappears again in others you see how the actors see things moving in others you see how the actors go towards what is scary and not seen in loose planes,astonish
hi like your review just would make a correction about your statement that almost no great horror movies had music on contrary every great horror movie had great music score as every major movie should have im talking about music not loud sounds combined with tense scenes which would scare about anyone i know but has nothing to do with the atmosphere of the movie most of new movies are made like that and horrors are no exception music was and is great part of those great horrors and i kinda miss that in new ones im no fan of horror like im no fan of any genre i just like good movie my point is that good music gives a movie a whole new dimension which nowadays unfortunately happens on very rare occasions have a nice day mate,astonish
it is not a bad movie but i dont see how it is super scary there are a lot of jumpscares and i have seen it before it reminds me of poltergeist i had to skip some parts in the film because it was dragging for too long it isnt the scariest movie ever it has a good story good acting good cinematography but too many jumpscares and im tired of it i love james wan but in my opinion this film is just not that scary the red face demon is kinda creepy i got to admit and i look at the song tip toe through the tulips differently but this film doesnt really make me scared when you mention the name and i dont think i could watch this movie for the second time its like a watched it once but dont think i will again kind of movie,astonish
is one of james wans first horror films since 2004s sawi would say that after this filmwan got the confidence to go ahead with the conjuringfurious 7 and the upcoming live actionaquaman is your typical storya family move in to a house and are haunted by evil demonsbutthis has a very interesting story and itsnot gonna spoilbut turns out to be a kind of bloodline thing with the demons lin shaye stars in this and does a brilliant role but sadly as we all knowdies in the ending has a very good story but by nowthat story is just worn out cause lots of people have used it nowfamily haunted and it turns out to be a bloodline thing between father and son is a awesome horror filmgood storygood acting from patrick wilsonconjuring and lin shayetheres something about mary,astonish
horror movies have taken a whole new turn into being terrifying this is not your average horror movie where there is a killer and a group of teens who get picked off one by one this movie brings something forward that other paranormal movies have never done before the young child in this movie does not get possessed by an evil spirit like in the exorcist and this is not just another paranormal activity this movie contains something many parents can be afraid of when their children go to sleep and make them worry if they are ever going to wake up tells of a young boy in which there are several different things that bring it together such as the characters in the movie and the biggest component the sound and setting is the peculiar tale of a child who has special dreams and can leave his physical body however one day he just never wakes up for starters yes this movie may seem corny or lame to some viewers but this movie is a genuinely ghastly experience this movie takes a parents love and protection of their children to the real test it makes them think of what can really happen when they are helpless and cannot do anything for their child or newborn there are two key characters in the movie elise the psychic and josh daltons father elise has an amazing performance and the way she brings forth her shaky and bloodcurdling words just makes the viewer realize how serious the situation really is then josh really shows how sometimes parents like to be in denial when they are scared he denies all of the bad things happening around the house until they affect him but also refuses to listen to his wife renai he does not take the time to process the severity of the situation and do what is best for his family the son dalton could have been sold better yes the child seems scared but on the other hand the acting seems fake and uninteresting renai is virtually useless because nobody listens so she just freaks out urges the necessity of help with her voice going virtually unheard if there was anything that really made the movie it would definitely have to be the setting and sound the house in the movie is constantly quiet unless there is talking there is no wind nor creaks or squeaks then out of no where there is a flurry of violins or pianos when the scene is getting intense there is whispering on the baby monitor when there should be nobody in the room i do not think i can stress enough that one of the most creepy and uneasy parts of the movie is how they can take such a harmless song and turn it so evil and scary tip toe sounds like a childrens song about carelessly frolicking through flowers and playing by an open window however when combined with the eerie and empty setting of someone home alone in a house this song creates true anxiety especially when it starts playing on an old gramophone on its own then towards the end of the movie this song starts playing when the evil entity is keeping the young child hostage in the dark place in daltons dreams or the further the unknown plays one of the most important roles in the movie along with the sinister atmosphere when the psychic elise has to contact dalton she puts on an old gas mask with a hose running from the mouth to her analysts ears you never know what is being said until you see what he writes or draws in one scene they are in daltons room and elise sees a black figure and its the same one johns mother saw in a dream who said it wants dalton then in another scene daltons brother says he is afraid to sleep at night because dalton who might i remind you is in a deep coma gets up and walks around during his slumber throughout the movie it gradually gets less and less interesting disappointingly in all honesty the plot could have been better and as i said before even the cast could have been more carefully chosen there was really only one true amazement in the movie and that was the ambiance and atmosphere from all the sounds and the way the movie makes you feel i feel as though there could be something here in the future of horror films if they continue with this style so why not travel with me into the further,astonish
at the first i was a little bored everything was convenient and predictable but thats normal after you watch several horrorparanormal movies the story was great okay it can be a rip off but we didnt saw that side of what lays beyond they could take this place much more interesting some fewer points the things that supposed to be scary werent the man with flames on his face seemed to be from a 50s horror store everything was predictable which was a bit of a bumsome good points great story good cliffhanger good actingfor the story of the movie the 68 rating is accurate for the lack of scary i would give this a 4 so i think a nice 5 rating is good enough i watched several movies which had more worse ratings and was much more scary,astonish
i think it was poltergeist which set the template for modern horror ie family finds out house is haunted doesnt believe it does believe it calls experts and then resolution like so many other post eighties horror films follows that formula to the letter however whereas most are pretty forgettable this one has just about enough scares and creepiness in it to make it worth watchingits hardly worth going into detail regarding the plot as im reasonably smug that ive summed it up sufficiently in my opening paragraph patrick wilson and rose byrne play the mum and dad yup theyre happy successful and have three children they play the parts well from everyday doting parents to disbelieving and supernaturallyharassed protagonists and they do nothing to make you not want to root for them especially when one of their children slips into an unusual coma and his housebound ever after but thats when the haunting beginsinstead of being sucked into the tvdimension hes stuck in another afterlife and spirits want to get into our world via him those dastardly spirits including one that looks like darth maul from star wars the phantom menace  so its nice to see the poor sith lord can still get work after that depressing inclusion into the scifi franchise follow the family from house to house until the mandatory local paranormal expert is called in to sort the spooks outcue the resolution i wont spoil it as sometimes the family wins and sometimes they get horribly murdered and it ends on a downer but once again the resolution follows like i say this is horror by the numbers but its good enough to watch if youre a horror fan then youve probably seen better but thats because youve probably got classic horror films among your dvd collection however you probably wont see many  recent  horror films that create a creepytense atmosphere give it a go,astonish
this movie is right up my street i like to have some goosebumps in a movie slasher movies dont do it blood splattered all around is gross but not scary most movies have a few but this one is really creepy lots of jumpoutofyourseat scares this one is right up there at the topgood story and well acted there were a couple of characters i would rather had been left on the cutting room floor but they were minor and not a big botheryou want to watch this one with the lights on i watched it in the afternoon and dont scare easily but this one did it for me dont want to see it at nightmore please rock solid usually mikey,astonish
is an american 110minute movie from 6 years ago it was fairly successful in terms of awards box office and critics so that it should not come as a surprise that several sequels have been made already the director is james wan saw and the writer is his longtime collaborator leigh whannell i personally thought this film had ups and downs i am a fan of horror films that have an unknown danger attached to them like the blair witch and this one does as well which i liked after a supernatural encounter at the attic a boy falls into a coma and the rest of the film is about the parents trying to find out how to help him all in the process of dealing with more and more supernatural forces coming to the house where they live inwhat i did not like about the film was the sound work good sound effects are crucial for a film in carrying a story as well as elevating the material sometimes but here it is the opposite obviously the sound technicians wanted to make sure they get recognized as the volume is so over the top compared to the people talking some audience members may like it but for me it does not elevate the scare factor but just becomes really annoying apart from that the sequence with the dad in the parallel world was not really necessary and i did not find it as memorable as others perhaps all in all wan and the cast made a good job by channeling aspects and performances that have worked well in horror in the past and even if they brought nothing really new to the genre they still did a decent job i would not say that despite the cliffhanger ending i am too curious about the sequels but this first film is worth watching i recommend it,astonish

a young couple leads a quite and dull suburban life with their children quite suddenly certain occurrences strange noises things falling off start to take place tragically the couples younger son collapses and falls into a coma the doctors cannot find any probable cause and eventually the kid remains in this condition and stays in bed all the time unresponsive to any external stimulusweeks later the mother sees a strange figure of a man entering in the boys room but suddenly disappearing the mother of the husband intervenes and suggests that a psychic medium professional may provide help the psychic a very sympathetic and eloquent middleaged woman comes in and after reviewing the household and premises suggests that the sick boy has certain abilities that make it extremely vulnerable to evil entities moreover the kid has fallen victim to such entities who captured the kids mindspirit and do not allow it to regress back to the real world there is a disbelief from the couple but eventually they agree to allow the psychic with her partners to start a procedure of bringing back the boy from the other dark sideis a very good film refreshing well balanced very scary and brought certain new elements in the horror genre in particular the importance of the spirit world in our everyday lives and related beliefs which are cherished more in the americanindian societies and also in far eastern asian mythologies there is some resemblance with the old film poltergeist directed by tobe hooper and produced by spielberg but i thought that poltergeist indeed a very good film went in a different direction and did not go too far inside this spiritual world of the dark side directed by james wan instead took such a path and gave us a terrifying viewing experience,astonish
so regretful about not having watched it so soon never thought it would be so frightening and i watched it alone in the middle of the night but i believe it wasnt the only reason what i got scared it didnt happen with jessabellei really like the theory about the gift traveler and the astral plane its amazing and at the same time fearful i want to experience it but im not ready of what i will encounter there and what about my own body what if some demonic soul tries to get inside my body see it really scares me to death wow the characters are all greats especially lin shaye im not just agreed to the award but she is indeed great the expression of her face is wondrous and the same goes for the music the story the appearance of all the supernatural beingsthis movie is just not trying to surprise you with the music or the visual effects but it really really scary in the true meaning i really love this movie just as i love the ring dark water and the conjuring cant wait to watch the next chapter oh im so left behind,astonish
a rather clichd and predictable below b grade horror movie but i wouldnt really call it a horror movie some kid gets lost in a spirit dimension after astral traveling out of body experience which we discover about 23 of the way into the movieof course how or why would an innocent kid ends up in a demon infested other dimension is not really clear but then its a horror movie right so theres no way hed end up in some happy fantasy land full of lollies ice cream and cakes so the tired old theme of demons possessing the young and innocent though in this movie the kid isnt really possessed just that his soul has wondered too far from his physical body and the panic that if he doesnt return soon his physical body will be taken over by a demon so where are all the angels and why dont they ever take over a kids body such is the clich of horror moviesa demonmortal combat where a mere mortal often outwits and beats the devil unless of course the producers plan on a sequel then the demon wins or survives to fight another day ie act in another movie and yes theres two sequels of this mediocre movie having said all that theres worse out there but i wouldnt rate this much above 4 0nce again i got sucked in by the imdb rating above 6 perhaps i should watch some movies that have a rating under 4 might find a gem,astonish
a familys idyll is undermined by a perplexing incident involving child dalton ty simpkins falls into what they perceive to be a coma but father and mother josh and renai lambert patrick wilson and rose byrne so realize that he has the uncanny ability to astral project himself during sleep the ability of his soul leaving his body after leaving a house they moved into because of eerie noises disturbing sights of disrupting apparitions unsettling voices and daltons condition doesnt improve their situation at allit only worsens as those from a limbotype afterdeath known as the further want to use daltons body to enter the world of the living if they dont want to forever lose their son the lamberts will need to enlist the aid of psychic elise the great lin shaye inheriting the best role of her career and her two paranormal investigating cohorts specs leigh whannell writer of the film and tucker angus sampson barbara hershey also shows up as wilsons mom lorrainejames wans ode to poltergeist and its ilk even offers a hideous redfaced black bodied demon which kidnaps dalton and awaits josh josh a school teacher growing weary as his wife is in regards to the condition of a dormant dalton will need to head into the further to find his son much in the same way carol anne will need her mom to do the same in poltergeist you have paleskinned ghouls seemingly frozen in nonmotion only to creep up on josh when he turns around while journeying into the further might remind you of the look out behind you weeping angel stone figures on doctor who the homemade gadgets specs and tucker pull out to investigate are a real sidesplitter they are fashioned by toys household items and everyday devices particularly the gasmask head piece elise wears while communicating to specs what dalton says inside the further the bickering and attempted oneupmanship between specs and tucker is part of their abbot and costello shtick and charm their partnership with elise itself is rather amusinghow they seem like such an unlikely trio out to help others stuck in a situation few would accept as factualwan followed his saw formula in the bleak ending you also see this in dead silence as perhaps someone who came back from the further might not be who they appear the sound effects and music cues are a wan necessity it seems the titles in big red letters and the violins striking up aloud are a trademark of the franchisequite a recognizable aesthetic the lantern light josh uses as he moves through the further really is a nice touch such as when he encounters those in this afterdeath but there is a lot of darkness and the decision to show as little of the demon as possible gets a bit disappointing it is shown just enough to prove how unpleasant it looksspecs drawing of it based on elises description is a good little scene though the pictures by dalton also offer an affective visual evidence josh needs to motivate him to disavow his skepticism elises fate is horrifying and somewhat unexpected the further offered wan and whannell plenty of room to create this completely unique worldfor the most part it can be quite equal parts spooky and frustrating considering the darkness the ghost photography is an obvious homage to the japanese horror boon of the late 90searly 2000s as josh is linked to dalton in regards to his own ability to astral project the way the ghouls emerge and pop up at unanticipated times are essential tricks wan relies on throughout this film seems to be a like it or disapprove of it affair i guess im somewhere in the middle6510,astonish
raised the bar high for future directors of scary movies james wan keeps that camera on people long enough to see and understand their feelings he also knows that too much sometimes is just too much its the quiet and the suspense that freaks us out because we just dont know when something or someone is about to strike a comatose child garbled static concerned and irritated adults they all add up to us forgetting its a tale of possession and the supernatural we become invested in the future of these people and the ultimate fate of the young boyits always dark in just about every scene with people both on and off the screen straining to see if we can believe our eyes ghosts appear threaten us leave enough clues so we cant doubt the reality of their existence but what is worse than knowing others might just think we are crazybyrne and wilson are very effective as the afflicted parents theyre young and the films believability factor increases because they look like modern people who wouldnt be acting irrational unless something bad and special would be truly be invading their lives i like how so little time is wasted in dialogue and much depends on their reactions to all the supernatural happenings the film actually picks up steam as they move to a new house and things just happen to get worseso well put together is the movie that i could ignore how much it borrows from other movies from the rocking horse to the marks left behind by others to the anachronistic music and the appearances of the mysterious children it doesnt matter because we have a good director putting it together and veterans like hershey providing supportenjoy the transformation the decline of reason and the futility of what we always thought would work and dont despair theres plenty of originality too and everything works when the mood is just right,astonish
i do not agree with this movie is for ages 15 i have seen many horror films and this is definitely the least horrific one i have seen we all have different scary levels though but to me this was not one best horror films i have seen or one of the scariest i would say this movie is specifically for ages 12 and up i would say this is a good movie for sleepover or friend gettogethers because it is not too scary i would not consider this movie for families i would give the movie a 6 out of 10 for having to draw many conclusions and not having a very strong plot also this movie is very low budget with not many good scary scenes,astonish
is the kind of film that gives me hope for the horror genre this film at least lets me know that there is still potential for horror movies to be well made have original ideas and most importantly be scary one thing i enjoyed about this movie is the score a really talented group of sound designers worked on this film and it really shows from the bright flashy title card to the music cue set whenever something scary happens this score has already become classic and several other movies have utilized this same kind of score leading me to believe that this movie had significant influence on the horror genreanother thing i really enjoyed about this movie is the quality of scares this movie really has a good idea of how to set up suspense and payoff the demon in this film is good too even though many make fun of his uncanny resemblance to darth maul the way they present him is fantastic playing tiptoe through the tulips along with keeping him in the shadows for the majority its all very scary the rest of the ghosts in this movie are cool too this movie really isnt afraid to show you whats supposed to scare you which i give it huge props for director james wan has shown in the past that he knows how to present the scares well and it clearly shows in this flickthe acting in this film is good patrick wilson always does a pretty decent job and he does so once again as the lead josh im always a fan of rose byrne and she does a great job here showing her diversity as an actress i really enjoyed the two nerdy guys too specs and tucker their comic relief kind of comes out of nowhere and isnt really necessary but i enjoyed it none the less the rest of them are ok lin shaye i find to be a little hokey at times but its very passable the child actor is pretty bad but what can you really expectthe plot of this movie might be its best aspect however i love the idea of the further and astral projection is something that isnt touched upon very often in films so thats really cool the idea of going into a realm the further that is filled with troubled spirits is really great and offers some great tension the last third is where i find the most problems with the film though the scene where josh fights the demon in front of the red door is stupid the fact that he can defeat this thing just because hes the one alive is just silly if thats the case then why can the main demon kick our main heros ass without a problem the other thing i really didnt like also involves the main demon its shown throughout the whole movie that this thing is super powerful and the further is a plain of reality where this demon can move to wherever his wants this is demonstrated when the demon seemingly teleports behind josh in his lair but this demon multiple times lets the kid escape when he could easily catch him the suspension of disbelief is shattered when the demon tries to grab him under his bed instead of just cornering him then the demon who is fast as hell is outran by a kid its just silly and its the reason this movie isnt a 1010in conclusion this movie is awesome this movie is sure to make you jump and make you turn on a few light after its over the scares are good the music is brilliant and the movie immerses you in a story you wont want to missand the ending is cool worth a watch if you want to get scared,astonish
is one of those movies i avoided i dont jump on fads i am very hipster when things dont fit into my nerd realm that goes hardcore for movies was one of those scary movies that came out and blew up i hated this trend of the next scary movie banking at the box office when my idea of real horror was passed over it seemed like every year there was a new scary movie or a sequel to a new scary movie they were all a year or two years apart have to bank on that hype right right from the start i was going in with a negative sense of view but i thought that if i was watching it then there was something about it that appealed to me the film stars patrick wilson and rose bryne as loving parents who start experiencing odd occurrences in their new home when the events escalate they move to a new house and realize there is something more involved its a haunted house story with a twist from the start of the film you can tell even with the budget james wan as a director is talentedit is the exact duo that brought us the saw franchise james wan is behind the lens with leigh whannell writing and acting technically the film looks great there are some inventive shots and the ending haunt is staged very well but the story feel like its been done before there are all sorts of elements from multiple haunted house films if a film could be called a mash up i would give this film that title wilson and bryne do their best with that they have the story fails them when things start to ramp up everything of the why is explained by a newly emerged characterthere is a back story to why this is all happen this is not explained until nearly the end of the film its newly introduced characters that wrap up everything in a nice tight package some of the back story is shown but not much it would have been nice if these piece of the story were scattered throughout the entire film i wasnt really scared as the boo scares werent stage that well it was more of putting things for the audience to jump instead of building tension the most entertaining and well executed sequence was the endingthere was a nice twist at the end that on its own would have sat very well but knowing that there is a sequel comes off as strategically place for a sequel to be made there is just too much hype surround this film and for me it didnt never had the chance to live up to it seeing sinister and the conjuring from james wan i know there are good haunted house films out there that live up to the hype i can only describe this film with a quote taken from a user on reddit i think the reason so many people like it and praise it is because it is so bland it feels safe its the movie the average moviegoer can go to not get too scared but still say that they love a horror movie well said,astonish
2010 dir james wan  cast patrick wilson rose byrne lin shaye barbara hershey ty simpkins genuinely scary haunted house movie that regards those traumas that never leave a family moves into a big house only to discover that their son has fallen into a coma type state doctors analyze without result so he is brought home under life support patrick wilson plays a father and school teacher rose byrne plays his wife stay at home mother who works on returning to a career in music and song writing she soon hears strange whispers in the baby monitor then strange images of ghostly figures appear at her urge they move but problems still persist a spiritualist is brought in and she informs them that their son isnt in a coma but rather his soul has travelled and is at the mercy of demons director james wan previously brought us saw so he knows how to present a scary atmosphere here again he gives an ominous house of creaky noises and frightening visuals wilson and byrne hold strong we learn that wilson passed down this trauma to his son but hasnt any memory of his younger incidents it is unfortunate that this film takes the cheap route where the demons are seen as triumphant lin shaye plays a psychic type figure who seems too much of a joke in her methods that will ultimately be fatal barbara hershey as wilsons mother is limited yet plays a crucial role that moves things forward this is a kid who braves the nightmare while awaiting parents to brave the same nightmare while not the best of its kind it will creep up on genre fans who will expect the obvious score 6   10,astonish
this is one of the scariest pg13 movies i have ever seen i was constantly scaring my girlfriend by grabbing her shoulders at the scariest parts and shaking her that was fun but i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to be super scared and also doesnt want to sleep for a few nights i couldnt sleep for at least a night without waking up almost screaming of terror i watched this on halloween because we wanted to watch a somewhat old movie it was projected on a sheet hanging from a tree and we were all scared to be outside with anybody except our group of about 10 people thats how scary it was anyway best movie i have seen in a few months you should watch it now,astonish
belongs to the modern brand of hardsell horror movies the ones that try to frighten with loud sound effects jump scares and creepy kids it feels the need to wow us with a frenzied conclusion and a lastminute twist as if it was tailor made to show up eventually on one of those youtube compilations assembled by a twentyyearold who hasnt seen any horror movie released before the year 2000but within that circle fares better than others like paranormal activity and the conjuring two films that it brings to mind its competently shot and directed and manages to provide some good oldfashioned creepy suspense the ending of the film goes off the rails in a way that i like getting so weird and out there that it actually worksby far the creepiest scene for me involved a little boy dancing to tiptoe through the tulips ill never hear that song the same way againgrade b,astonish
sorry i cant understand how anybody above the age of 18 can enjoy a film so below average the camera work is mediocre the lighting is simple the cast is mediocre and the movie is boring compared to recent movies such as it follow its a rip off of a rip of poltergeist etc ty simpkins is at least in this film totally amateurish fi the scene where rose byrne is looking through he photo album simpkins is totally overchallenged his mimic the position of his head just simply do not fit the role and he looks at least twice directly into the camera such a scene has to be reshot  or deleted from the movie every tv cast is better sorry and flapping doors are no means to create suspense if the director doesnt take the audience serious,astonish
all the other reviews here seem to be torn between 1 downvotes and 10 praises which i find both in most cases as good indicators for poor reviews so ill try to just lay out what i liked and what i disliked about this moviehaving seen and loved the conjuring a couple of weeks ago a friend told me to go and watch which i just did coming from the same director both movies share a good portion of their recipe a somewhat haunted house elements of classic horror like poltergeists and exorcism mixed with more or less modern technology and last but not least a nice share of subtle comedystarts out great theres not much time spent on building up the horror youll get your first scares within the first 5 minutes or so and they are done very well and very unexpected it plays with the clear portrayal of monsters but just for the glimpse of a second as well with blurry shadowy characters wandering in the background weird noises opening doors and the constant beep from the heart monitor of a kid in a coma make up a great mix for a horror flick ill be honest i jumped in my seat a couple of times and had a good laugh about it its a very enjoyable kind of horrorbut after about 30 minutes or so something changed to avoid spoilers ill put it in general terms the introduction of somewhat comical characters would have worked for me what bothered me most was the added amount of cheesiness i still cant point my finger at it but it starts to get so clich at every aspect that even the portrayal of demons and ghosts which i liked in the first place gets spoiled by it it kinda felt like the author suddenly realized his paper is due tomorrow what was built up with care and sweet horror in a calm environment lost itself in a disposable teeny horror given explanations and actions didnt feel very satisfying and there were a lot of loose strings leftlong story short i felt honestly sad about the outcome of this movie it started as a well made horror shocker and ended up like cheap bohorror as scream and the likes,astonish
is an amazing film that doesnt follow other films in its genre firstly i love the fact that this film just seemed to forget all other horror movie clichsand how most of the jump scares just come out of no where there arent many massive build ups to them either secondly the music in this film is beautiful you cant hear it unless you want to and it raises the tension by a lot however in my opinion i would say that the acting sent very good and renai reminded me of wendy torrence from the shinning in the way that if she isnt crying she just seems to be yelling or holding someones face to conclude i adore this film and james wan is one of my favourite directors but he just needs a new cast new manager,astonish
this was a wellmade horror movie that built slowly increasing the tension as it went a family is plagued by unseen forces causing one of their children to slip into a coma when they contact an expert they find out ghosts and demons are trying to posses them and the father has to enter the shadow world to get his kid back there were some pretty effective moments such as the scene in the fire demons lair this movie has some quieter moments with deliberate pacing but also goes over the top in a way that makes it stand out it has a sense of theatrics such as the loud flashy title card at the beginning the ending is a cliffhanger but after viewing the second movie i dont hold that against them its not like some movies that leave things wide openthis ending had very specific plot points the sequel needed to follow up on the mixture of low key and flashy scenes distinguish this movie from most current horror and i enjoy watching back many of the well done segments,astonish
fear is not something i would consider to be experiencing watching a poor american low budget horror film such as fear is to witness to the ultimate depravity of lucifers kingdom first hand to see malcharon the chief of hells armywield his blood covered limbs to torture another undead child in front of its grieving mother to see beelzebub the lord of the flies command his swarm to devour the rotten flesh of the dammed for eternity to see adramelech president of the senate of demons drive his fiery spear through the unbeating hearts of the tormented to see beleth gather his 85 demon legions to his trademark brass fanfare embarking on a violent sortie to sodomise new arrivals fresh from the ferry of kharron the boatman to see all this this is fearbut this film is ok,astonish
has a number of things going for it a stylish credit sequence with an old school giallo feel to it and enhanced by the creepy still images a gorgeous house as the setting for the first part of the movie which builds some great atmosphere and a spookily discordant stringedinstrument score though it has a tendency to overwhelm the action on occasion there is also an excellent jumpscare about halfway through that caused me to call out involuntarily as i sat watching the movie in my empty living room unfortunately the shift in action from the haunted house also sees the movie lose its way the characters proliferate but fail to add depth and as rose byrnes woman on the verge storyline fades into the background so does any sense of compelling narrative the action takes an unwelcome baroque turn and the attempts at humor do not add to a series of sequences that commit the grievous sin of failing to be even remotely scary after a promising start the disappointing second and third acts feel like they have been pasted in from another movie altogether,astonish
another movie that i should have watched on the big screen  unfortunately i discovered in only 2 years ago this movie has every horror flick clich in it  yet it some how wins where other have failed  the cast is incredible  the plot is not too original but nice all packed with nice wrap that the director delivered this movie is one of the scariest movies ive seen so far and im sure that if i watch it two years from now it will still get me at every pun i strongly recommend this movie not only to the horror fans  and even the toughest horror fans will sure have their dose of adrenaline while seeing ,astonish
theres an episode of its always sunny in philadelphia called the nightman cometh where one of the characters makes a misguided attempt at seducing a woman by writing a musical the show revolves around a young boy who gets his soul stolen and dragged off to another dimension by the titular nightman a demon with slick black hair and cats eyes who hides in the shadows its not very well written poorly acted and inevitably winds up being a total disasterwhy is this relevant you may ask well because the plot to is remarkably similar sure its not a musical and the acting is generally rather good but the story of a young boy dropping into an inexplicable coma during the night because of a demon with slick black hair and cats eyes dragging him off to another dimension is uncomfortably close to charlie kellys ham fisted calamity that being said if youre not familiar with said comedy you might still find intriguing but only if youve not seen any horror films before it does a pretty good job of setting up the tension in the early going but soon loses its way once you realise that it doesnt have many original ideas it might not be about a haunted house but aside from the fact theres one point where the protagonists move it sure plays out like one considering the demons spend most of the film doing little more than the occasional cackling or running past an open door its also hard to feel scared by themin fairness though isnt awful the early scenes work quite well the interplay between rose byrne and patrick wilson does make them seem like a convincing married couple and the two bickering paranormal researchers are actually quite entertaining however it just feels like it was put together by a committee who wanted bits of the amityville horror and poltergeist stitched together by the time the finale comes round youll be humming a song about the dayman fighter of the nightman guardian of the sun master of karate and friendship for everyone,astonish
if im going to be perfectly honest i found this film absolutely terrible im not quite sure why everyone else seems to have absolutely loved it even finding it scary enough to put in their top 5 let me start by saying im a total horror movie newbie the only horror films ive seen before this were the woman in black and the cabin in the woods i scare very very easily and i did not scream a single time during this filmthe characters were bland and flat the parents josh and renai had no chemistry the best actors in the film were the children who sadly played very minor roles despite the fact that they portrayed dalton as the main character no offence to patrick wilson this is the first film ive seen him in but is he capable of forming a facial expression other than mildly worried by watching this film youd never know the dialogue was also extremely stilted and felt completely unrealistic what totally made me mad was that horror is supposed to be the genre the most capable of following the rule show not tell and half the movie was a pseudomonologue detailing every characters life story and persona struggles seriously did they even try the budget for this film was supposed to be around 1500000 but the villains looked cartoonlike and exaggerated in a way that made me laugh more than it scared me honestly completely disappointingthe film was a bad mixture of greys anatomy in terms of dramatic beetlejuice and hocus pocus  which i love independently but should never ever be mixed togetherthe trailer scared me more than the actual film which congrats i guess,astonish
takes a very different and original approach to the typical haunted house theme we have seen countless times in movies let me start off by saying the atmosphere throughout the movie is amazing the way they combined creepy music with disturbing imagery is incredible and the filmmakers did a great job in creating this also great performances by basically everyone cast for this movie i also find it quite amazing when a horror movie can disturb you with a minimum amount of blood and this movie shows that it is possible to do so i do think the movie has its flaws though one of these is borrowing the basic idea for the movie from poltergeist in which the little girl gets pulled into this spiritual world and the parents are trying to get her out of there also there are one or two really unnecessary jump scares in the movie but mostly james wan knows how to build tension and execute these very well because most of the jump scares in the movie are rightfully earned and my issue is just with one or two props to the crew for creating such a creepy and original movie with a pretty small budget of about only 15 million but i think the small budget helps the movie in overall creepiness from the lighting they used to the practical and great makeup the spirits have in the film great job i also loved the fact that a minimum amount of cgi was used which helps up the creepiness i had a lot of fun with and aside from a few issues it is mostly an original and creepy horror movie,astonish
ive watched a lot of movies before many of high drama ones many of intensive dose of action and many fascinating scifiction movies but no movie has induced me to write a review about like this movieis one of the most strange cinematographic works ive ever watched the drama side of the movie is awesome most of scenes you cant predict it and every prediction you build doesnt keep alive for more than 5 minutes and then be broken by the following scenethe horror side also was accepted for me its not that fascinating one but its accepted and not that bad and also the sound effects worked well to make this movie more horrificbut what made me so sad is the level of the production of this very strong scenario there were many meaningless scenes and a lot of shots which were very terrifying but the actors didnt get terrified and vice versa there were many other scenes which were extremely underacting and failure to get me engaged withone another good thing is the 20 minutes which was acted in the lost world when josh tried to bring his son to the real life that extraordinary idea which i didnt watch in any horror movie before but still there were many scenes which didnt get performed well and many meaningless objects and ghosts in that worldalso there were many scenes which could be made better than that trivial way which ridicule from our minds like that one which elise spoke dalton and specs translates what she said to the dad and the mom and also like that scene in the lost world which the dad just said to the ghost get away from me and push it away and the ghost disappears and what made that scene more ridiculous was the reply of elise in the real world when she said to him you are stronger than them josh you can win if he was the strongest why he suffered to get out of that world and why the whole storyline originallyalso one of the most admiring scenes in the movie was the paintings on the wall of it was very expressive and a very good way to exchange the thoughts in silencethe last thing which i liked was the end of the movie which was extremely unpredictable and not that ordinary one which drawn in our minds that the father will be the hero one and save his son and all things will be alright finally this movie is still worth watching but i hoped that the director was at that professional level which he produced the conjuring withnote  watch the chapter two it may change many of these thought it may be completely different,astonish
let me tell you a story a story about a couple dudes who love their horror me and my brother had this thing for several years where we watched a horror movie almost every night some nights even two we loved ghost movies maybe the most so we were always on the lookout for those then one night we got a hold of this one we hadnt heard of it but we gave it a whirl as i said we watched a lot and a lot of what we watched was pretty bad but his one oh it just blew us awaythere are plenty of reviews on this one so i wont go into too much detail but the thing with is not that its a revolutionary movie youve never seen the likes of before it is that it does what it tries to do so very very good the stuff that happens is just cool and creepy the scene with the record player and the creepy song in particular it just has these small details that not everyone gets and these details are what makes this a horror classicin a haunted house movie a very important part is what kind of creepy stuff happens not everyone understands this a common mistake is to pace it wrong in it is very well paced and the incidents that happen are really cool and it is genuinely scary scary movies never really scare me but this one gets pretty closegoes to show that there are still excellent horror movies to be made and that on a budget of one million dollars james wan you know your damn stuff,astonish
i love horror movies and i must say that this movie was a great horror movie the story line the cast and everything about this movie was great it is a must watch this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat this is a movie that you could watch over and over i wouldnt watch it alone if you are the type to be scared easily i would not recommend for small children of course this movie leaves you wanting to watch part two and three the acting in the movie is great the effects and etc are also great there isnt one thing bad that i could say about this movie great horror film this movie was well put together,astonish
so im new to this whole site and this is my first review but im trying to give you a decent onefirst off if you dont like the precredits you wont like the endingthe story starts pretty normal haunted house style nervous mother annoying kids working father mother sees and hears stuff and its really pretty suspenseful spoilers from now on if you watch this movie and you dont want it to drown itself in hilarity and rather want to keep a memory of a decently scary movie then stop watching at the point where elise describes the demon sitting on the ceiling seriously from that moment on everything gets really stupid and looks like a bad musicalthe film really switches from a serious ghost movie to charlie and the chocolate factory and why can the ghosts suddenly enter the real world at the end of the film why do they need a body then  not really consistent,astonish
after hearing what people had to say about this movie i was interested in seeing how great this movie was after seeing it i wanted to regain the hour and whatever minutes i spent watching it not a single jump scare was scary because they were all predictable ive noticed watching this one and only staying to watch the first 20 minutes of the 2nd one they are familiar to the conjuring and annabelle with overly done sentimental endings usually great demonic movies the exorcism or the rite main characters die and you see how the demon is affecting the persons voice skin personality not random occurrences of a demon out of the blue in the end only voicing opinion but all in all if you want to be scared this is not the movie you want to watch,astonish
i had watched james wans the conjuring before this so i had high expectations i am a fan of found footage horror films but the conjuring was one of my favorite commercial horror films the start of is always good like in annabelle which he also had directed james knows how to create a very uneasy atmosphere was a scary one but as usual at the middle towards the end it gets fastpaced knowing that the mysteries are being divulged plus the repeated overusing of loud distorted scary orchestra sounds can sometimes be annoying like it is trying too hard to scare near the end of the film it doesnt get scary especially since the demons face is explicitly shown it looks more like watching an adventurefantasy film overall i enjoyed this better than annabelle but this film is short of scenes that would have made it more wellremembered,astonish
i love the 2012 horror film sinister sinister is one of the best horror films of the 21st century that ive seen when my friend heard this she recommended i watch so i figured what the hell i might as well check it out the trailer looked very interesting and it seemed like it could be a lot of fun to watchwell im not saying that was bad but i just dont understand why its so popular i sorta fell asleep three quarters of the way through it it certainly wasnt original by any means much of its plot had me thinking back to the paranormal activity franchise and the conjuring 2013 the acting for the most part was good the soundtrack was okay but not very memorable what else can i say it just wasnt a movie that ill be remembering and i doubt ill be checking out the rest of the franchise,astonish
the opening kind of fooled me for me thinking that it was dalton as like any other hollywood horrors nowadays the story builds the characters for quite far too long then the main scares come and again just any other recent hollywood horrors the scare strategy remains the same build up the smaller scares with medium length build up and peak them with sudden appearances that dont last more than two seconds this lets the audience off as to when the finale comes and then the finale builds with all those lengthy thrills with strings of those previously thrift sudden scares with sometimes a twist here and there but this movie contains one good twist to the opening scene and the nice additional element of fatherly sacrifice the ending is predictable as most hollywood horrors leave a wide room for a sequel or at least to keep the scare in the hearts of the audience for long after they exit the theaters the acting is actually quite good this movie shows rose byrnes capacity to act in almost any genre patrick wilson still retains his usual successful cocky man even though his character now is only a schoolteacher,astonish
is one of those movies i avoided i dont jump on fads i am very hipster when things dont fit into my nerd realm that goes hardcore for movies was one of those scary movies that came out and blew up i hated this trend of the next scary movie banking at the box office when my idea of real horror was passed over it seemed like every year there was a new scary movie or a sequel to a new scary movie they were all a year or two years apart have to bank on that hype rightright from the start i was going in with a negative sense of view but i thought that if i was watching it then there was something about it that appealed to me the film stars patrick wilson and rose bryne as loving parents who start experiencing odd occurrences in their new home when the events escalate they move to a new house and realize there is something more involved its a haunted house story with a twist from the start of the film you can tell even with the budget james wan as a director is talentedit is the exact duo that brought us the saw franchise james wan is behind the lens with leigh whannell writing and acting technically the film looks great there are some inventive shots and the ending haunt is staged very well but the story feel like its been done before there are all sorts of elements from multiple haunted house films if a film could be called a mash up i would give this film that title wilson and bryne do their best with that they have the story fails them when things start to ramp up everything of the why is explained by a newly emerged characterthere is a back story to why this is all happen this is not explained until nearly the end of the film its newly introduced characters that wrap up everything in a nice tight package some of the back story is shown but not much it would have been nice if these piece of the story were scattered throughout the entire film i wasnt really scared as the boo scares werent stage that well it was more of putting things for the audience to jump instead of building tension the most entertaining and well executed sequence was the endingthere was a nice twist at the end that on its own would have sat very well but knowing that there is a sequel comes off as strategically place for a sequel to be made there is just too much hype surround this film and for me it didnt never had the chance to live up to it seeing sinister and the conjuring from james wan i know there are good haunted house films out there that live up to the hype i can only describe this film with a quote taken from a user on reddit i think the reason so many people like it and praise it is because it is so bland it feels safe its the movie the average moviegoer can go to not get too scared but still say that they love a horror movie well said44 out of 10,astonish
seriously was this actually meant to be scarywhat even happened in this film i saw it and i dont even know they tried to combine ghosts demons creepy kids astral projection darth maul and possession into one moviehorrible acting and a plot that feels like it got randomly generated coupled with stupid characters with no semblance of intelligence or likablenessalthough the first 20 minutes was good and the first 40 minutes was moderately scary the rest had me cracking up when darth mauls face from star wars started making guest appearances all over the house and when the creepiest music they could find was bloody tiny tim this and the twist ending that made me want to throw my tv at my dad made sure that i will never watch 2,astonish
this film falls under what i like to call commercial horror that being produced by a large hollywood studio for as wide an audience as possible in that i guess its a success where it does not succeed is providing the horrorsavvy viewer with anything new or interestingthis film and its directorwriters borrow from other films in the genre the sixth sense the shining the others poltergeist but any seasoned fan should be able to guess where and when the scares are comingthe first half creates a decent tone but the tired horror clichs tend to skirt away any real tension and the overuse of sudden jarring musicalaudio cues jolts the viewer more than any of the imagery its as if they didnt think the movie itself was doing a well enough job of conveying the frights so they decide to hammer you over the head with loud noise to indicate that this part is supposed to be scary get it the cast seem to be more horror stereotypes or caricatures rather than real people we can identify with and even patrick wilson who is usually very solid gets a little cartoonish towards the end things start to come off the rails in the third act as the film struggles to find its identity especially when it cant decide who is really the villain ripoff darth maulgoat man or the ripoff woman in blackif you are a horror newbie you might enjoy this but for the smart mark viewer youve seen this before and executed better in other filmsis anyone else really tired of unresolved open endings that allude to an obvious sequel i know its about trying to milk the marks for all you can but i think it leads to lazy writing and this film is proof,astonish
is just different in an excellent way i didnt care too much for the sequel but this original is one i recommend to friends and anyone else who likes an intelligent horror movie that actually does have a creepy plot its got good acting nice effects without overdoing anything itll make you jump even if youre an experienced horror movie watcher like myself because it has the scares where you wont expect them to be and when you expect to jump you probably wont this is what the horror movie genre should be all about ill be looking for more from this director,astonish
even though this movie came out in 2010 the first collaboration i saw between director james wan and actor patrick wilson was 2013s the conjuring they worked together on and this movie carries some similarities in story as an audience member i appreciate how james wan captures and maintains the flavor of normal people being attacked by evil intending supernatural forces seeing leigh whannells name in the opening credits is always a bonus for me as i have appreciated all of his work in the horror genre since he first put saw on the map back in 2004in we are introduced to josh and renai lambert and their three children adjusting to their move into a new house their oldest son dalton inexplicably falls into a coma which doctors cannot accurately diagnose and then we are slowly given the explanation as to what has really happened to dalton the story further unfolds as we are told and then see firsthand what it will take to bring dalton backi got a good scare out of this movie but found the plot development to be a little slow in the beginning also the character of elise the older woman who serves as a conduit between the living and the spirits that travel the netherworld came on suddenly as too intense and one dimensional but overall those are small complaints in what was otherwise a solid scary movie,astonish
after many years i said to myself lets go back to my great love of the past the horror cinema ive tried looking around and ive heard good things about this movie too bad it was a great disappointment i have not found any real inspiration in the story and direction flat acting etc  the previous time i have tried something similar i have found the myst that is a great horror movie of course there are also good aspects the photography some scary characters and yes in some parts the film scares a little bitthough honestly i do not understand the comments of people terrified by this film lets say that the story holds up decently until a little more than halfway through the film anyway for those who have not seen it yet do not trust too much in my opinion maybe you will like it thats why i end up wishing you a good vision,astonish
i watched thinking it would be one of the scariest movies i would ever see ive read so many good reviews and heard great things about it but honestly its an average horror movie not bad at all but not spectacular either the story is good and not predictable if you havent read any spoilers there are definitely some great jump scares and a few pretty creepy scenes i think the actors are doing a good job in this film especially rose byrne but heres the negative thing the demon that wants to take control over daltons body looks like someone dressed up for halloween far from scary especially when you see him crawling like some sort of lizard if they had come up with a really creepy demon instead of this one the movie would definitely get a 9 star rating from me but this funny looking creature kind of ruined it all together i do think is a nice movie when youre really into horror its not like you will really waste your time it just could have been better,astonish
obviously this is trying to emulate and recreate things that have worked in the past and is very oldschool in its approach but not the whole way through because towards the end this does take a bit of an unexpected turn i think it does so successfully but there are quite a few out there who would disagreeso while there are movies out there where you can decide after a couple of minutes what you think of a movie and if you should continue watching this might either surprise you badly towards the end or actually make you think that it is better than you though to begin with horror especially one without much blood or violence does rely on scares  this has a few very good ones,astonish
james wans borrows like almost every hollywood horror flick the clichs jump scares and ideas from all the commercial horror movies from the past decades however it manages to successfully build a mysterious eerie and dreadful atmosphere patrick wilson and rose byrne headline a cast that delivers a good portrait of the haunted family with a first half that sets the bar high very high that will leave you at the edge of the seat and afraid of dark the final act tough begins too soon and drags for too long taking the movie through a fantasy outcome that is doubtful and perhaps too literal it is a nice chiller tough and those are getting rarer by the day well done visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more also like us on facebook to follow all our reviews,astonish
i had actually looked forward to this one but this wasnt quite the successful scary movie the tag line that goes with this one its not the house was even on the dvdcover and is simply a spoiler but oh  inspired by that eddie murphy bit leave the housethen why josh mother waits so long to take action when all the while she could have seen things coming its a mystery to me and about the sance with the older woman suddenly josh has the gift as well so he was the best option to get dalton out of the astral world in the first place  rendering the preceding sance rather useless but hey its a way to get a film to clock 103 minutesand there were some more little questions i had about this and that but id be perfectly able to turn a blind eye if a horror film is otherwise successful ie bloody atmospheric scary and or such but honestly i dont know what all most of the hubbub is about one scene in the astral world with the toys and those clumsy ghost busters were rather okay thoughall in all doable just this once,astonish
you may be a superhero buddy but youre not invinciblebegan with a lot of promise and several scares but midway through the film it began to lose its appeal and it went downhill from there james wans the conjuring was one of the best horror films ive seen this decade and i can see how certain elements from this movie especially the first half involving the haunted house elements were perfected and used with greater effect there wan knows how to scare audiences creating an eerie atmosphere and uses the camera effectively despite the interesting premise i did have some issues with the characters which wasnt a problem for me in the conjuring patrick wilson was great in that film but here i felt he had very little chemistry with rose byrne there is one scene where the alarm goes off and he finds the door from the main entrance wide open he closes the door and sets the alarm on again only to hear it go off a few seconds later and find the door open again despite everything that is going on in the house he still doesnt believe his wife and thinks shes overreacting even if he didnt believe the ghost story then at least he shouldve called the police because someone is forcing the door open and sounding off the alarm i just found it hard to believe he would go back to sleep after that the characters werent developed very well but the scares still worked during the first half of the film unfortunately the second half doesnt live up to the standards set during the first half the final act instead of being scary ends up being laughable and it is a problem i find with most horror movies nowadays which dont know how to connect the gran finale with the suspense and the tension theyve been buildingjosh patrick wilson and renai lambert rose byrne have recently moved in to their new home along with their two boys dalton ty simpkins and foster andrew astor and their baby daughter strange things begin to occur in the house and one afternoon dalton suffers an accident in the attic he seems to be fine but when josh goes to wake him up the next morning he doesnt awake the doctors cant explain why but somehow he seems to be in a coma they decide to bring dalton back home as he remains in coma and strange things continue to happen renai begins hearing voices through the baby monitor and finding blood stains in daltons sheets she begins seeing strange presences and her son foster claims to be hearing dalton walking through the hallway at night convinced the house is haunted renai asks josh to move again and so they do at their new home strange things continue to happen so joshs mom lorraine barbara hershey decides to intervene she had a similar experience with her son josh when he was younger and gets a group of paranormal investigators led by elise rainer lin shaye to come intervene that is when things begin to get a little freakier one of the major problems with this film is that screenwriter leigh whannell who worked previously with wan in saw and dead silence by trying to stay away from the clichs of the genre takes us to unexpected places during the second half of the film for instance he thought it would be great if the family left the haunted house instead of staying there like in other horror filmsthis shouldve been a good thing but wan was creating such an eerie atmosphere with the classic haunted house formula that somehow it backfired here the creepy moments that were beginning to scare me completely abandoned me when we got to the new home and the paranormal investigative team began their astral projection talk this really took me out of the movie and truly disappointed me the scares were gone and everything became sort of laughable i think the reason why i really loved the conjuring is because wan went back to the classic formula and stuck to the haunted house elements which were working so well for him during the first half of i dont think this is a terrible film but the ending was so disappointing i dont really feel like watching the second film,astonish
i finally got around to watching this movie the other day a lot of my friends have been talking this up as one of the best and scariest horror movies they have ever seen and while i can honestly say i jumped a few times i just dont see how it was that scary now dont get me wrong i liked this movie patrick wilson and rose byrne both did fantastic jobs pulling off the desperate parent roles and the little bit that you see him act the kid was pretty good too i thought the directing was very good as well wan did a good job the film was dark and gritty and the jump scares were pretty decent but in the end that is all that it was to me a few good jump scares and dark lighting and i think that thats biggest problem with this movie there is something lacking in the writing which is sad because im a big fan of whannells other work with the saw franchise but i seriously think he dropped the ball on this one while the story certainly wasnt bad it wasnt great either it seemed to rely to much on jump scares and never really builds much tension as i said earlier i really did like this movie but i just dont think its as great as some people say it is,astonish
from the director of saw  the conjuring had the potential to become one of the most brilliant  genuinely frightening horror films of the 21st century but despite having all the ingredients which are used to nearperfection in the first half the movie ends up being a huge letdown thanks to the tumble it takes down the road during the following halfthe story concerns the lambert family who have moved to their new house with their two sons but soon start experiencing mysterious incidents in the house things turn for the worse when their 8year old son inexplicably falls into coma and when the doctors are unable to revive him the parents turn to a spiritualist who warns them of the danger their son is in as a demon plans to take possession of his comatose bodydirected by james wan the manner in which he sets up the premise  builds up the tension in the first half with expert use of controlled camera movements sound effects  silence is worthy of praise but after that wan simply loses his grip on everything as the promising  brilliantly executed first act is completely destroyed by its ridiculous second act thus turning an effective horror into a plainly stupid onethe performances are quite good camerawork  editing works in perfect harmony for a while the background score gels pretty well with the events sound effects is one of its biggest strength and james wan proves his knowledge when it comes to scaring the audience yet the high standards this film set before the halfway mark is never matched or even challenged by its next half thus resulting in an overall frustrating experienceopening with a promise of greater things to come developing its suspenseful  dreary atmosphere with precision craftsmanship and yet missing what was up for grabs by failing to capitalize on the boost provided by its first half really had a chance at cinematic greatness but one wrong route around the halfway mark ultimately ended up wasting that opportunity for good a heartbreaking disappointment,astonish
isnt a horrible movie its a fair horror movie but if you watch it expecting something new and groundbreaking because you read that in a review you will be disappointed if youve seen any horror movies made before the 1990sthere is nothing new here nothing that hasnt been done before its basically like poltergist and friday the 13th had a baby tiny tim provided the soundtrack and darth maul makes an uncredited guest appearanceits an ok horror movie and if you typically like horror movies then youll probably enjoy it the acting is fairly good the story is as plausible as any horror movie without being overly complicated,astonish
a family is seemingly haunted by spirits from another dimension which leads to their young son going into a coma the longer the boy remains comatose the worse the haunting gets a medium is brought to solve the issue who discovers that the boys spirit is trapped in another dimension known as the furtheri havent watched very many horror movies at the cinema mainly because there arent many top quality horrors out there now but the pull of a doublebill and the fact that this is made by the creator of the saw franchise dragged me here for this and for about half of i was pleased i made the decision to gothe first half of the movie is terrific the characters and the haunted house is all setup nicely you have accomplished actors in rose byrne as renai and patrick wilson as josh at the helm and pretty good child actors like all good horror movies the chill factor is amped up creaking staircases dark doorways scary apparitions  its all here and its all very good ill be honest i was a little scared theres something quite unnerving about watching a horror movie in a dark cinema it certainly adds to the ambiancethe second half though is ridiculous as we start to understand what is going on and what these apparitions are the film starts to descend into absurdity the monsters arent really that terrifying once we see them properly and the story becomes far too mental for my liking the best bit about the second half is the introduction of medium elise lin shaye who is a breath of fresh air similarly the characters specs leigh whannell also the writer and tucker angus sampson bring some muchneeded comedy to the proceedings these three characters keep the film watchable but doesnt stop it getting ridiculousis definitely a game of two halves  the setup is nice the payoff not so much however there arent that many great american horror movies out there so if were using its peers as a comparison then the film is definitely one of the stronger offerings out there if youre able to tolerate the absurdity of the second half then i think youd enjoy the terror of the first,astonish
this review may contain spoilers personally i find supernatural horror to be the creepiest of all the sub genres of horror because it is something that we dont know how to handle if at all it exists in that sense is as scary as it can get without being too gory or visually unappealing director james wan proves that you dont need tons of scary makeup and mutilated or bloody or zombielike people to give a fright sure there is some makeup used for frightening effects but the scarylooking people in addition to the tight story make for a good scare the haunted family with the apparitions and scary faces popping out from every corner of the house the husband josh played by patrick wilson not believing the wife renai played by rose byrneswhen she tells him about the apparitions thinking shes imagining things yet eventually being forced to move to another house because the wife cant seem to control herself the son dalton played by ty simpkins unconscious and doctors unable to explain the coma he is in are all routine ingredients of a horror flick thats as routine as it gets enter elise rainier lin shaye and her team of paranormal investigators and the story becomes gripping initially dismissive of elises observations josh eventually relents when he tallies some of his sons drawings with elises findings what follows is even more thrilling as joshs past is revealed and he tries to save his son but like with every good narrative the best part is at the end do not miss the end patrick wilson and rose byrne do a good job as the parents but i felt that byrne needed a little polishing of her acting skills not that it handicapped the movie in any way though patrick wilson and rose byrne look good togetherit would be interesting to watch them in a romcomlin shaye gives a very strong and highly laudable performance she clearly has the responsibility of the movie on her shoulders and does complete justice to her role ty simpkins surprises you when he is not sleeping which he does for half of his screen time with his acting there is also a touch of humour the director tries to provide with elises teammates as they try to get one up over the other the writing is tight and keeps you hanging for more the cinematography is almost perfect the sound effects and music add to the spooky aura of the film with the supernatural genre the writing sometimes tends to go awry and writers end up with more twists than they had initially intended for writer leigh whannell sticks to one theory and pretty much keeps the story linear and free of messy twists and turns all in all is a good scare if you are a horror fan its definitely worth your money,astonish
these are my brief thoughts with all the love people give this movie it attracted my attention luckily i found it on sale and bought it surprisingly there wasnt to many scares but there was a lot of suspense and creepy moments nothing i lost sleep overthe plot was just fine nothing mind blowing the characters were not very interesting but they served their purpose the music was few and far between you either get loud screeching or upbeat songs that the ghosts listen to why do they listen to music who knows now we get into the demons first we got this darth mauldevil which looks like a generic picture of a devil you can tell they werent too creative then we got smiling ghostsdemons that a cant help but smile right back i mean they look so stupid you cant stop yourself from laughing and the scene where the lead actress gets licked by the ghost just looks ridiculous they pretty much failed to scare me with the supernatural beingsthe film wasnt great but it is worth at least one watch when it comes to smiling demons i think ill stick with the evil dead,astonish
a young boy falls into a coma like state and his parents try to find a cure is there something supernatural in play the movie is watchable because its well directed and paced the shock tactic scares are effective the story is quite logical in a horror movie wayliked the cast rose byrne as the frightened mother is good as always actually a bit like her role in damages barbara hershey is a surprisingly good non irritating mother with a sympathetic slant patrick wilson is good too as the fathera fault is that it was a bit too dark lighting wise at some partsits a non gruesome but scary horror movie looking forward to the sequel as it keeps you wanting more,astonish
director of saw and paranormal activity james wan returns to the horror genre with an at times intensely frightening paranormal movie which is undone by a few too many overthetop moments which make the movie unrealistic and the scare factor evaporateslet me elaborate the first half of the movie is chillingly scary and builds up atmospheric tension superbly the second half of the film is a little disappointing and it is much less scary in comparison to the first half of the film other than the occasional shudder in the movies climaxjosh wilson patrick wilson is a teacher whos family moves into a new but spacious modern day home however he and his wifes life rose byrne is made a living hell when son dalton ty simpkins is being possessed by an evil spirit cult leaving him in a coma like statethe story is gripping and the acting is consistently excellent from each casting member patrick wilson is particularly good as the desperate father willing to attempt anything to save his son his performance has an emotional presence and he portrays a realistic microcosm as a man in this particular situationoverall i found  at its best  a terrifying and well executed piece on the shoe string budget at its disposal however as the scares begin to evaporate so does the realism and the ideas become a little looseprobably deserved of a score of seven,astonish
this is a great horror film at first i didnt think that this film would be my cup of tea but as the film progressed it grew on me more and more the acting in these films is usually bad but this over exceeded my low expectations by a large margin the producers did a great job on this one as they included little signs that built up suspense an example is the subtle use of the colour red that made me know something of a demonic nature was going to appear at first i thought that it was going to be blood but considering the rating i doubted it my beliefs were confirmed when the devil creature was seen and it gave me quite a fright overall personally i would advise watching this film if you are fan of other similar titles eg the paranormal activity series,astonish
i sat alone in the dark watching and came out with somewhat mixed feelingsthe set up was good and the initial build up and tension as the story slowly unfolds with good atmosphere and some good jumps that allow you to overlook some flat acting and clumsily written dialoguei wont comment to much about the plot so as to avoid ruining it for those interested in seeing it but i will say its nothing ground breaking and for those that are familiar with the more suspenseful style of horrorthe main issue i have with is the last quarter or so of the movie it does a really good job of raising the tension and then loses it all for the final actthe whole feeling of the movie changes and the atmosphere is lost to the point that anything that is supposed to be scary isnt and feels like its just relying on cheap jump scares and the plot loses it too and falls into a couple of very poorly executed twists one which isnt obvious but is rubbish story wise and the other youll see coming a mile away and groan about afterwardsin summery would recommend the first three quarters of the movie itd probably be fun to watch if you have a really jumpy friend or something like that but dont expect it to floor you or anything,astonish
if you are looking for a true horror flick not a slasher film or some scary  comedy flick but a true horror film then check this one out have to give it 810 because its been since the original exorcist that i have truly been creeped out the story itself seems familiar at first a family has a problem with a haunted house seen it 1000 times right not so fast the story develops into something reasonably unique and gives us a plausible plot good story line throughout the film it moves along quickly and is well directed and edited great visuals music and acting this should be the new model for horror best horror film in the past 30 years imo,astonish
this story about whether a child or a house is possessed or haunted began with some believable acting and some genuinely scary happenings in the first 20 or 30 minutes and i believed it was really going to be a terrific film like david cronenbergs the brood or frailty but when the central idea was revealed before the midpoint it became a silly exercise in quick glances of demons and ghostly looking people that reminded me of halloween scare houses or carnival dark house rides and by the end i was bored and reduced to occasional chuckles and whispered jokes to my friend watching with mefor anyone to suggest this is one of the scariest films ever they either havent seen many or they scare awfully easily to be genuinely scary a movie must make the viewer buy into the happenings not just see a lot of scary faces with loud noises the idea itself should have suspense and dread this film also had the clich of an older lady probably a medium explain all the hokey happenings as though this were a well known phenomenon i could list at least 20 scarier movies going back to the 50s and 60s than this disappointingly dumb film i gave it a 4 because of the first 30 minutes which were a 7 but the last hour and ten minutes a 1,astonish
i watched this for the first time the other day i was expecting a crappy wannabe horror film ive been through the jokes of movies that dare call themselves horror such as step father chernobyl diaries deadly silence and my least favorite the house at the end of the streeti was expecting to see a lot of the same mystique the whole what was that when everyone watching knows it was the bad guy this film actually was done a lot differentlyi was surprised to learn that this was done by the guys who made saw knowing full well the twisted minds that the kings of all horror films instead of the barrage of visual horror used rather effectively in every one of their films they use psychological more often than not and do it rather wellhow ever this is not the best film to walk off the movie lot yes its entertaining yes it does succeed in scaring you but its another one of those films that you can go with out seeing and still be okay how ever i am excited to finally see proof that there is still hope for the horror genre after all,astonish
i just watched this movie tonight and wow it was great it wasnt extreme scary being a pg13 movie but for a movie with that rating it has a lot of scares the suspense it build throughout the movie is great it does have the odd creepy moment but it is mostly just pure scare it is nothing completely original but considering the budget it had and the rating they did an excellent job with what they could there was no grossing out scenes that are gory at all very clean movie that way everything i expected the movie to be it was and more at first i thought it wouldnt be that scary with a pg13 rating but it proved me wrong about that quick it is the best scary movie i have seen in a very long time i would recommend anyone that likes scary movies to watch thisnote if you can watch in the dark on big tv with surround sound it makes it even better,astonish
was quite a creepy movie indeedthe plus factors are the music some truly scary scenes the performancesat least of the creepy characters lol and the directionpatrick wilson as josh lambert and rose byrne as joshs wife are convincing as a harried couple struggling to get their child back whos trapped in another dimension and also brave weird spooky happenings in their house i also liked lin shaye who does a stupendous act as a paranormal activity investigatorit was an average ending though theres a twist which viewers may not expect but i just felt the turn of events in the end could have been trimmed it dragged a bitverdict still quite creepy better than movies like the 2005 amityville horror,astonish
this movie will scare the hell out of you indeed but mind you it has an unsatisfactory ending its not that the good guys will win in this i hate it this was the same in grudge where we were left to wonder why and how will the evil end  name itself is so scary i loved the experience on a blu ray rose byrne is so cute its a must watch  that wicked background music is so evil its real scaryits advisable to watch it in daylight because its a real scary fright night u will get shivers in some scenes that is the camera is moving in the living room and all of a sudden something appears and the music is like a explosion and it gives you a mini heart attack i hope you all enjoy it,astonish
i just saw this movie about 1 hour ago i searched for it and found that this movie is already 2 years old no wonder there were only a few people in the theatre as you see i am not a native english speaker one of my colleagues asked me what meant i told him it means something wicked inside but looks good outside after telling him that i was not so sure so i typed define on google and google said1proceeding in a gradual subtle way but with harmful effects the effects of stress 2treacherous crafty an alliancei thought i was wrong now at the end of the movie there was a literally thing i did not expect too much about this film i just thought it was a regular househaunting movie but the second half of this movie was more than i had imagined even though i am an atheist and do not believe afterdeath world this movie surely was scary and exiting if you are bored and want to watch something exiting watch this after you will watch through at the end of this movie you will think watch,astonish
it was a horror film i get scared pretty easy but i did not get scared in this film and i think that it was because the director made it in a way that the film carried the spook and yet was watchable so that viewers focused more on the story than the spook often horror film buffs watch horror films to get the kick out of it of getting scared out of their wits this film did not scare me out of my wits it allowed me to watch understand and absorb the story that was being narrated through the motion picture and i liked it a well made horror film in a while is what i would call it it was not just sensational horror drama to give adrenaline the kick that a lot of horror film buffs want the performance given by rose byrnes was outstanding it absolutely was something that new actors should learn from overall i had a great time watching this film it was far from disappointing for a horror film fan and i hate gore horror films,astonish
im not sure about any of you but the use of the song by tiny tim in this movie was absolutely priceless whenever a horror movie can give comedy relief and snatch it away from you directly afterwards there are many easter eggs in this movie that you can find if you look around the scene instead of looking directly at the subject that gave my friends and i a good time as well rewinding the movie afterwards to find as many as we could if you look at the chalkboard in the classroom there is a picture of jigsaw youre welcome  it didnt get in the way of the movie and sometimes made it a bit more creepy but it was still a joke among us the spirit investigators were also a laughing stock of the movie the evil spirit we made fun of also he didnt look scary at all in fact he sort of looked a bit like darth maul the old woman however was a bit more scary is every freaking evil spirit a pedophile even the women come on i had been told by many of my friends that this movie was the scariest movie they have ever seen the only horror movie i had ever seen was i am legend but i had played a lot of horror games such as silent hill prior to watching this so since i am legend wasnt scary at all i wanted to actually have a scare from a movie i logged in to netflix and watched it with a few pals and we were pretty stoked the only problem is this movie wasnt really all that scary it was very predictable as well i pretty much pointed out everything that would happen before it did this movie also had a horrible misunderstanding of the astral plane it got nearly everything wrong you can come in contact with evil spirits yes but can you get possessed by one no can you get lost in the astral plane no this is because your spirit is tethered to your body it would be like having a dock as your body and a boat tied to the dock as your spirit if too high of tide ever came in you could pull yourself right back to the dock and thats what your spirit does you can research more about that for yourself but i found that many people didnt want to even think of about astral travel or lucid dreaming after watching this movie because they were scared this would happen to them i think its horrible that they chose to represent the beauty of the astral world in such a horrible unrealistic manner i was quite disappointed with that decision all in all it was a mediocre movie it lacked good scares had too much comic relief in it too many easter eggs and a stupid representation of astral travel however it was a new original idea to make a movie about astral travel much like inception made a movie about lucid dreaming i just wish they didnt choose that topic to make a horror movie about because nearly everything was false,astonish
i saw this for my birthday in 2010 and i wasnt sure i was going to like it as i am not too horribly a fan of possession movies and by the trailer this looked to be one i am glad it was a different kind of possession movie i loved that it wasnt just about possession but it was a true haunting it felt like a fun house a haunted house it was just awesome in theaters because everyone in the theater was jumping and exclaiming when the jump scares came around and not in an annoying way i will say i loved it more in theaters than watching it at home i liked the big in your face scares when they are smallersize wise it is a little harder to get into but that is true of most horror movies i suppose,astonish
the first 40 minutes of this film are exceptionally good besides the lead actresss performance i could tell she was acting her facial expressions bared no emotion while investigating the noises in the house or the things she saw out of the corner of her eye everything in this film is decent again aside from the acting up until the investigation team shows up from there it goes downhill the two girls seen while tucker was looking around with the special lenses in the camera are unbelievably fake and provide no scare whatsoever the explanation of astral projection seems rushed as well as when joshs mother reveals the photos of the old woman that would show up in the background of near every photo token of him before the investigation team arrived this movie was great afterwards not so much after they take hold of this situation everything seems rushed and loosely put together now another thing that really bothered me while watching this film was the way it was shot rather then use a separate camera for shots of for example josh running up the stairs after renai it appears that they instead chose to just swing the same camera around and then follow him up the stairs i felt as if the happenings in this movie where filmed by a guy with a camera very much like the ones in paranormal activity the ending twist seemed predictable as i figured that either josh or renai would be possessed by one of the demons in the house i do have mention my favorite scene in the movie my favorite scene is when renai is throwing the trash out in the new house as she walks around the house to the trash can  the music on the record player changes and a little boy is seen dancing to the music when i saw this i did jump a little the designs for the main demon remind me a lot of darth mal from the star wars films or rather is facial features it does provide some good jump scares and i think the story in decent as well id definitely suggest checking it out,astonish
some things in this movie were so well done the ghosts at times could be very terrifying not just in making the viewer jump but also just scary to look at the main characters are really well developed and all have their own personality unfortunately the plot bores the viewer to death in the second half i was incredibly disappointed in the direction this movie took and i felt like from second half on i really had no interest but for the movie to end its a shame because the first half really had some scary moments and it was gradually scarier and scarier what i enjoyed about the scary scenes was that i felt as if they had more substance than most movies they were not the enjoyable but cheap thrills of the paranormal activity series but rather strong visually and psychologically though i will never understand why the movie took a turn for the worse i do think the movie is still worth seeing and it is perhaps someone elses cup of tea more than it is mine,astonish
it actually kept me on the edge of my seat had a few creative twists but is not too dissimilar to many horror movie gone back the idea of entering the other domain was interesting i wish i was recording this onei had chills for much of this movie and many worthy surprisesthe acting was very good the plot largely recycled but this the unique twists worth watching again not excessively gory but definitely kinda creepywill keep me up tonight and probably make for some interesting dreams if you like something spooky this is it,astonish
yikes i havent seen a movie in awhile that both jolted me multiple times and creeped me out for a long time simply with its worldview the worldview being that pretty much everyone goes to a dark creepy hell after death and there is no god also the scares do not let up from the opening title screen to the end of the credits plus the soundtrack including the use of tiny tims annoying but innocent sounding tiptoe through the tulips shot my blood pressure up for most of the filmquick summery josh and renai find their son dalton in an unexplainable coma immediately after this the hauntings begin and become increasing violent evil and horrifying they hire a medium who tells that that dalton is not in a coma but has had an astral projection outofbody experience and his spirit has wandered too far from his body and is lost in the netherworld or the further as its called in the film as such daltons body is unoccupied but alive tempting spirits and demons to possess him in order to enter the world of the living some to simply live again and some to wreck havoc josh is told that he also possesses the ability for astral projection and thus he must be the one to enter the netherworld to find daltoni agree that there are two halves to the film but i strongly disagree that the second half killed the first the first half is a typical haunting film slamming doors strange figures moving around at night malevolent spirits etc the second half goes beyond strange phenomena and has josh actually go to the other side to get dalton this sounds a lot like poltergeist but the further is not a bright light filled with creepy clown dolls and giant skulls no this a completed dark parallel universe filled with creepy corpses in suspended animationuntil they are disturbed by the living and attack there is also a demon that i think is the weak point of the film the face looks like darth maul like spitting imagelook it up but he has a long forked tongue like venom from spiderman and a body like the hell knight from doom and doom ii look it up not that scary but the lack of lighting and music are creepy enough that it makes up for darth maulvenomall in all a very scary movie that i probably wont watch againit makes you jumpy and uncomfortable from beginning to end if you need a good fright night movie this a good choice,astonish
in checking the user ratings for this film im finding that my initial suspicions about younger viewers hailing this film as one of the scariest of all time to be based on age im over sixty and i saw the exorcist during its original release in 1973 let me tell you that was one scary flick my son whos thirty five thought this film was right up there in the fright department but i wound up pretty much hohumming my way through the entire thing so my theory here is that ones susceptibility to being manipulated by a films gimmicks decreases with agethere are other things working against the film as well for one the tone and mood of the set up was filmed too colorfully for a horror film virtually all of the scenes occurred during daylight hours so any attempt at suspense was dissipated by lack of atmosphere there were a couple of well placed cryptic elements like the misplaced box of sheet music and the bloody hand print but their impact seemed negligible in the larger scheme of thingswhen the theme turned to astral projection and out of body experience i felt i was watching one of those scifi cable channel documentaries thereby relegating the story to a ghost hunters exercise rather than a horror flick turning the principal disbeliever patrick wilson as josh lambert into an active participant in the demon hunt seemed sort of contrived and the disturbing finale was a little too late to save the picture over all inattentive viewers might miss the nuance of the final minutes of the story for me that was one of the few hooks that forced me to think about what had happenedone interesting observation as i discussed this film with my son was his reaction to the background music provided by tiny tim with his version of tiptoe through the tulips when herbert khaury recorded that song it was nothing more than a novelty tune done in falsetto that made top 40 in most markets because of its use in the picture my son thought it was a truly creepy song and couldnt reconcile himself to my description of its origin for my part i tried to see it his way and in a way i guess he could have been right but then id picture tiny tim and the whole thing fell apartfollowers of out of body science will probably find the ideas explored here to be presented well enough to validate some of their own ideas about the concept for myself i thought the depiction of the demon was rather well done but it was too little too late to make the picture truly horrifying the effectiveness of the ending will probably be lost on most viewers as well unless you take the time to rewind the last couple of minutes like i did trying to make sense of what happened and who or what made it out of the further,astonish
so many people tole me that this film is a waste of time that i never bothered to see it i happened to be in a library where the film was available and i took it out i cannot say that it is completely awful nor can i sayas a wholethat it is a good film however it is not a film that is under any good direction it opens to a very gothic feeling in an old house that makes you comfortable with the idea of a haunting gothic is a very hard thing for americans to pull off sometimes southerners get it right but hollywood aways fall short in that area not so in the beginning of this film when the family moves to the new home i felt that the drama was intense well done and well acted however the change from the gothic to the drama was a bit too much of an atmosphere change i get what they were trying to do but it did not workfinally in the last act when astral projection is added to the plot line and we are conveniently given a back story of how the father had been able to project himself astrally as a child they became a b movie at best the scene where the father goes into the old house in his astral form began creepy and i regained my hope that we may go somewhere good here noas soon as he enters a demons lair the film goes right in the garbage the demon is laughable and at that point as the demon sashays around what looks like an old fashion cat house to me i gave up and let the film run out its time,astonish
is a classic piece of work released in 2010 it follows the horror slash chiller path representing a genre that has failed cinemas for the past 10 years  certain horror movies have made a significant mark in cinema history dating back as far as it1990 halloween 1978 friday the 13th 1980 and a nightmare on elm street1984 those few of many classics are fine examples of the word horror as they were successful in frightening the audience leaving visual implants into the brain of the average viewer if you are still thinking of a movie that scared you mentally and physically before you go to bed at night that movie had done its job if you find yourself watching it for the next 20 years or so it is indeed a classic similar to my examples above another example dalton lambert ty simpkins falls suddenly into a catastrophic coma following an accident in the familys abandoned attic the parents josh and renai are bewildered to the result that follows as dalton is hospitalized before being transferred home to be treated further morethe coma appears far from basic as several months on reveal dalton is no closer to being revived it is when spiritual happenings occur throughout the house that renai rose byrne begins to question the possible relation to the apparent haunting and her son daltonjosh patrick wilson is your typical male ideal father although he is paranoid for the safety of his son he does not believe in paranormal activity the films disturbing plot is seen through the eyes of renai and josh as we watch their creepy situations come to life as dalton lies lifeless in his bed both parents are caught up in haunting visions and disturbing sounds as whatever it is stalking the family home it appears to be coming from daltons roomin a desperate bid to seek and rid the house of the evil spirits renai invites paranormal doctor elise lin shaye in a last ditch attempt to convince herself that she is not going insane the inclusion of lin shaye proved a touch of class as the result of her inclusion is highly memorable offering a more darker feel than her character elise had intendeda haunting tale with a slight twist looks and feels awesome the movie is shot with a dull shade of grey giving off a depressing feel to what seems ever so real there are some jumpy scenes that will guarantee the awakening of the average viewera great introduction with a snip of relation to the vintage hammer production with a frightening violin tune that the mind will struggle to erase once the movie comes to a climax without saying too much about such a clever and tense concept it is a plot that should be truly revealed in a dark room by yourself taking into account what we have seen over the years finishes top with one of the best horror movies of the past ten years the last movie released that blends into this category is drag me to hell by sam raimi also a must see for all horror fansdid all the right things for me it had me shook in a disturbing way a way that makes me want to witness its crafty work over and over againdid you enjoy my review check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog  httpgerrysreviewsforthosecuriousblogspotcom,astonish
now before i start this review i would like to add that you should ignore whoever has made this movie yes the saw franchise guys are behind this and dont get me wrong i had my suspicions but trust me there is no gore what so ever in this filmnow that is cleared up lets move onto the story it starts with a family of two parents with two young boys and a baby girl they move into this house that isnt your standard haunted house it actually looked quite nice while the family is getting used to their new home young dalton one of the sons decides to have a look in the attic after the door opens on its own he tries to turn on a light but falls in the process but is there something else in there he starts to scream and mum and dad come to the rescue but the next day he falls into a coma with no apparent cause soon strange things happen around the house that could well be affecting dalton and the other childrennow i thought the writing in this film was brilliant it delivered a great scary horror with a great story which is hard to come by these days with most going all story no scare or all scare no story the latter being most common the characters are well developed you start to care for them the action starts straight away with a cheap but brilliant opening sequence even the demons are well made and are all extremely unique from the fire demon to the dancing boy and what an endingthe first half of the film is very suspenseful but does not make you want to look away from the screen it makes you freeze in fear of looking away and seeing fire face the jump scares are not cheap at all and are delivered brilliantlyoverall this is a brilliant scarefest for those who want a bit of story with their heart attack,astonish
the film creates suspense very effectively through the lighting and sound that being said the suspense of the same violin screech or twang or bass sound becomes increasingly less effective by halfway through the film they were largely more annoying than anything else at the beginning of the film there is a nice mix of light and darkness but this is abandoned in the last 13 of the movie ominous shadows and rooms give way to the sporadic flashlight and in tandem with the unending screeching of the violin it made me angrier more than anything else jumpy cuts led to some jumpinyourseat moments as you would expect overall i think the movie is executed better than the horror films were used to mainly because its a call back to the time when horror films were about suspense not violent bloody mutant or alien murder compared with the films of today i would say it was above average but if you compare it to the older titles of the kind rec comes readily to mind you will be far less impressedi sat down to watch a suspenseful movie and thats pretty much what i got however i wont be watching it again and i wont be suggesting it to anyone,astonish
the amityville horror 2005 previously my favorite horror movie is now second to and its unpredictable scare tactics my two favorite scenes were 1 when the apparition walked back and forth across the window suddenly appearing in her room 2 main characters encounter with the spooky family in the further realm and their creepy widesmile scene i really thought some of the scare tactics were brilliant and surprisingly original not to mention eerily realistic before i even knew i noticed some similarities between this movie and the paranormal activity series of course there were prime contributors from the series that also worked on ,astonish
this film was much better than i expected these days its really hard to make something original and actually scary too many horror moviesor movies in general copy heavily from previous movies and rely too much on special effects to carry the movie is the exact oppositerelies on a really good storyline old school scare tactics and a great set of cast members to carry the movie basically the story revolves around a young couple and their 3 children that move into a new house only to start seeing strange paranormal things going on one of their sons dalton ty simpkins falls into a deep comma for no apparent reason and doctors cant explain why dalton is eventually moved back home still in the comma but paranormal incidents still continue to occur but at an increasing dangerous pace daltons mother renai rose byrne senses the evil presence in the house more than anyone else she then convinces her husband josh patrick wilson to move outbut the strange paranormal activity only follows the family to their new home the couple then enlists the help of elise rainier lin shaye a modern day ghostbuster of sorts to help them rid the house of the paranormal activity along the way though we witness a couple of plot twists that are for the most part nicely done and effectivelet me just say lin shaye is not a wellknown actress but she shines as elise rainier and helps set the pace for the climax of the filmin todays terms the movie had a really really meager budget  a paltry 15 million so its no wonder theres a big lack of special effects that most modern horror films rely on but dont be too disappointed this is one scary movie think poltergeist director james won does a terrific job of creating fear with some really creepy moments throughout the movie a malevolent voice shouting from your babys monitoring system only to see no one there when you get to the room a shadowy dark figure with clawlike hands standing in the corner of your sons dark quiet room or how about an evil entity cursing your very existence while your assistance scribbles down his every word in a wild possessedlike manner scary stuffthe only draw back to the film is once the action speeds up and the plot twists start coming into play it sometimes comes off as farfetched and some elements toward the end are unnecessary however overall the movie is great and the ending is to die for literallycheck this movie out its a must see,astonish
this is a well directed family in a haunted house movie that really has an air of creepiness the main characters put in convincing performances and there is a strong air of menace attributed by fine camerawork and direction as it pans every room in expectation of something sinister in the offing it has a realistic normal everyday feel as the newly arrived family carry a few anxieties on settling in the father being a teacher busy with marking exams the mother of three left to cope with unpacking manage the kids and prepare the house the creepy atmosphere leaves you feeling spooked and on edge and the strong sense something invisible and menacing is watching the occupants of the house within the house i dont think ive ever seen a film where i am actually believing that this really is a haunted house it permeates throughout and is totally convincingif you want to be scared out of your wits this film will take you there this is a house that looks and felt haunted and there are many heart stopping jump out of your seat moments this truly is a spine chilling film i watched it alone in the dark not a good ideaone downer is you are left wandering if the male investigators were in the right prffesion,astonish
i really enjoyed this movie it was very scary and kept me covering my eyes almost the whole time it seemed to be a mash up of numerous famous horror movie plots however it still did a great job putting them altogether although some parts were a little eye rolling i think this is one of the best horror movies i have seen in a very long time this movie had serious suspense and scares without requiring lots of gore or cg i really look forward to what james wan puts out next especially considering what he did with the limited budget for this movie  i recommend any horror fan to give this one a shot i thought this movie was so good i actually created an imdb account just to review and recommend it,astonish
i had heard that would care my wits out apparently it didnt its not a good movie nor a good horror film it had some good moments but nothing serious the only spooky moment is at the end and it lasts only for 5 seconds the plot though was based in a pretty good idea watch it just to understand how marketing works and how a mediocre film is promoted like the scariest movie after the exorcist oh please it only scared me as the grudge 2 and on how i see it grudge 2 wasnt a film to make you scared but to make you bored acting was pretty good and music was also pretty good plot 7 acting 6 scary moments 3 directing 4so here comes a 510,astonish
going to give this film a 10 the dvd case looked crap was watching it on a subscription service on my wii so thought this film would be awful but i started watching it the first 10 minutes were slow but ok then it really got going im not going to ruin it with spoilers but this film is not what i expected very scary for me and i like horror i was really fixed on it really enjoyed it jumped a few times and grabbed my face in horror at some scenes scared me more than paranormal activity i highly recommend watching this but not on your own great with a group of friends at nightgreat ending definitely going to watch number 2 which hasnt been made hopefully its coming out in 2013 ,astonish
i watched this movie on netflix not too long ago and i want to say i do like horror movies but most movies supposedly pertaining to that genre in the last ten years have sucked so when i heard about the hype i thought it would be very enjoyable the movie is made by the guy who created the saw series james wan and i liked the first one but the rest were dumb to me i was eager to view this and i wasnt disappointed but i feel the hype was undeserved with some calling this a horror masterpiece and allthe movie starts with a family moving into a house and the young son of the family falls victim to demonic forces and lays in a coma as a result that nobody can explain strange things start happening and eventually the parents call in paranormal investigators who explain to them the son is in a dimension called the further which his son is lost in and only the father can rescue him as he had experiences as a childthis movie i felt would have horror clichs and i feel it was wearing movies like poltergeist and the exorcist on its sleevesbut the movie does have a few good genuine scares and it does manage to build suspense but i felt the demonic figure in this movie looked a little fake and the last forty minutes of the movie was predictable and not as good as the opening halfbut by all means its an above average horror movie and audiences will get what theyre expecting,astonish
either way you look at it this is a love it or hate it movie as a horror movie you will love it for giving you the chills you expect or you will hate it for giving you nightmareshaving loitered in the horror genre long enough i am always skeptical when gauging a films alleged fright factor this has more to do with personal expectations rather than what the film promises through prerelease trailers when this film starts the credits have names disintegrating into ghostly smoke to me this animated effect is hugely similar to the light hearted scoobydo episodes or even bill cosbys ghost dad within just a few minutes i realized i underestimated the films potential to induce hair raising chills perhaps this is director james wans way of saying think you can handle a scary move wait till you see this then wan threw me off course again having scripted directed and initiated the saw franchise i was prepared for some blood and gore along the lines of a slasherthriller and no way was i expecting a true horror story amazingly wan goes on to offer a horror movie with minimal use of blood and even confines the content to a juvenile rating of pg13 but dont let this rating misguide youhaving recently shifted to a new house the lamberts barely start to unpack before facing increasingly disturbing occurrences things take a turn for the worse when their eldest son slips into a coma after a minor fall doctors are baffled by daltons rare condition and after three months without respite renai and josh bring their son home thinking the house to be haunted the lamberts move again only to realize that the problem is not the house but that malevolent forces are using daltons body as a gateway into our worldalong with screen writer leigh whannell wans success lies in the screenplay and its execution for me his use of the triple s formula is what really works here at the fore is a well written script with clever homage to old school classics like psycho wan has also used the element of suspense skillfully amplified by moments of deliberate silence you just know something is going to happen but not knowing what or when makes it all the more intense his final s is the choice of soundtrack or score ominous and jolting are the two words that come to mind cinematography is another area he gets right combined with the soundtrack angles of filming and just the right amount of lighting cinematography here creates the right atmosphere for the storyaside from the technical bearing human elements play the part to perfection this is where most horror movies go off track relying on effects and sound editing to do the job as daltons parents rose byrne and patrick wilson dish out some plausible portrayals with lesser screen time but with as much prominence are barbara hershey and lin shaye in custom made roles although each plays vital roles in the film shaye has the edge as an occult specialista common problem with hollywood horror movies is that every now and again a hotshot film maker thinks heshe has what it takes to outdo the previous hotshot film maker who thinks heshe did a hell of a job in scaring the audience think about it how many times has a haunted house demonic possession or a halloween themed movie been remade no doubt with each remake the makers assume superiority over the previous releases for the outcome is not entirely original some scenes of the house are also reminiscent of alfred hitchcocks psycho even with the well written script the ending appears to have a lot more going on than the first half possibly wan and whannell attempted to through everything they had at the audience including a dark caricature of the ghostbusters i am not entirely convinced if this was a right move but i can say with certainty that if this movie is meant to scare people people will be scared even if this story was not made into a movie it would still make a compelling tale by a campfire,astonish
i have high expectations upon watching this film for ive been hearing a lot of buzz about it the movie has the concept but it failed to deliver a good and unique type of movie its quite disappointing the makeup of the demonic thing that supposedly scare you will turn the movie into a comedy flick acting of the casts is just okay nothing surprising the movie is predictable i really wanted to find a strength in the movie but i cant think of any besides the storyconcept it might have jolt value for some but to tell you honestly its not really that shocking its just okay nothing really special,astonish
after thousand of recommendations to this movie i finally rented it and watched with some friends many stated this is one of the scariest movies from the last years and i must ratify that art direction and directing itself are quite professional making the atmosphere become scary enough for you to feel like turning the television off the colors are contrasted and confusing james wan accidently shows some random and creepy faces in the dark when youre not ready for this so you can imagine how many jumps this film may provoke so thats it the execution of this film is brilliant now i must complain about the story if this plot was at least original i could easily give it an 8 but it is not the get go plot is just like the strangerss with too few differences the table reunion scene is too similar to the others and skeleton key the masks are too similar to saw which is understandable since wan is the writer of that franchise all in all is a good movie when comparing with the rest of 2011s but would be much better if the plot wasnt so saturated six is a fair rating,astonish
i am watching this right now and have started writing it before its even finished just to calm my nervesso far it has been terrifyingit starts out a little slow but then the chills and goosebumps begin it is an edgeofyourseat scary believable horror not like those cheesy predictable films so common in this genre the first scary scene is where the mother hears voices on the babys monitor the sound effects and incidental music are brilliantly done as are the lighting and camera work all work together well to create a tense ethereal creepy feel to the entire film the acting is good enough not to distract away from the feel as sometimes in movies this is wont to happen and likewise the script is in keeping with the overall sense of the terrifying unknown realm the producers give the film a little bit of comic relief in the idiosyncratic features of the two specs who visit with the psychic woman but have timed it perfectly to give viewers a real ride through an array of human emotions with full effect just when your heartbeat has returned to a normal speed the film sets it racing once again the film is paced well and remains engaging throughout its entirety,astonish
one of the scariest horrorfilms i have seen in a long time a mix of orphan dead silence and the haunting in connecticut only even more scarythe movie takes it time before the scares start but once they do be prepared to sleep with the lights onthe only daemon that wasnt scary was the one that looked like darth maul but the rest of them was plenty scary do not watch insidous alone watch it with friends and during the day not at nighttimeexcellent horror the way all horror movies should be,astonish
ive been keeping myself away from horror movies and such since i usually always end up being disappointed did however intrigue me and ive been wanting to see it ever since i was at a screening with my girlfriend and saw horrible bosses the director james wan has previously impressed me with titles such as saw dead silence not that good but a classic itself and thusly decided to rent the movie and watch it the haunted houses and questionable children is something that have been recycled throughout many many movies but if they still work and impress in this day and age its usually a mixture of both visuals and the actors talentthe movie actually impressed me as i found it to be really really good the first seventy minutes or so with no trace of hollywood destroying the movie something ive seen and experienced with many movies that couldve been great gothika drag me to hell silent hill you name themhowever as soon as josh played by patrick wilson is about to travel to the further i knew i was up for a major disappointment when you build a foundation for a horror movie that based on a recycled idea and actually pull it off make it interesting and make the jumpy moments innovating and actually new to the genre its not a great idea to destroy the last thirty minutes of the movie by having one of the characters in the movie fight a ghost with terrible cgi effects its not a great idea to have one of the demons crawl across a wall with once again crappy cgi effects its further not really bright to squeeze in various demons and ghosts into a closet and make a terrible attempt at scaring the audience in a manner that probably wouldnt even scare a twelveyearoldthe movie piled up and simply became too much it felt really rushed towards the end and turned from being a perfectly enjoyable and intriguing psychological jumpy horror flick to being something that hollywood once again completely destroyed since i actually enjoyed the first seventy minutes one might think that 510 is somewhat unfair i do however not i tend to remember the final moments of a movie those are the one that usually sticks with me and if they in one way or another destroy what the movie has been trying to achieve i almost always end up unimpressed,astonish
i couldnt wait to see this film and i wasnt disappointed i thought it was brilliant i have watched it twice now and i cant tire of it it is an intriguing story and well acted by all i couldnt help but compare it though to an updated version of the steven spielberg film poltergiest really really enjoyed this one well worth the money and a watch in a darkened room from james wan the director of the original and best saw movie this is an excellent very creepy movie about a young couple who think their new home is haunted but they realize as they move house and the ghost follows them to their next home that its not the house thats haunted a very well acted film patrick wilson from watchmen and x men first class and damages star rose byrne are both very good as the young couple this has elements of both poltergeist and paranormal activity though without the camera this film proves that you dont need to have lots of blood guts and gore to make a good horror film though if youre one of those people that love lots of blood guts and gore then you will probably hate this movie as there is hardly any tension builds right from the start all the way through to the finish excellent,astonish
ive seen a lot of horror films and many of them made jump almost out of my seat most of them being well known classics and a few of them were not so well known the last horror film to make me jump was before seeing was called whisper i saw it three years agowas a huge surprise for me i just rented it at the rental shop and went to watch it without even checking whether it was rrated or pg13 because i didnt really care at the time however its not a gore fest or one of those annoying teen horror movies its actually a really good scary haunted house horror very well acted by the cast with lin shaye playing one of the most memorable characters in the film brilliantly directed by james wan and the script provided by leigh whannell makes a big effort to dodge all the obvious and annoying genre clichsoverall horror fans ought to be pleased with this film as it delivers enough scares and never really resorts to cheap thrills and to be honest after i watched the film i thought it was probably rrated so to find out it was actually pg13 came as a surprise as i figured it couldve been too intense for a low rating,astonish
im a real sucker for a good scary movie but most of the time they are to bad to watch making a movie that really scares people is a gift and over the years there is a whole stack of producersdirectors that didnt take that seriouslythe summary for this movie is a bit of a letdown so i thought i would see the very next bad horror movie in a rowit was actually a big surprisea storyline that can live up to my expectations scary moments that gave goosebumps and made me jump up from my seat that hardly ever happensand actors who i can relate to as normal human beings who get into a situation that you can refer to as abnormalin fact i liked the most that the makers put in some humor what makes it even more a good film life is all about relativity and humor is by far not used enough in movies that call themselves scarythe only thing that bothered me were the much to overdone and loud sound effectsit didnt need them to make the case and it started annoying me after a while you should get scared of what youre about to see not of what youre eardrums will experiencethe actors are well casted and i truly enjoyed this film,astonish
with the saw franchise at its depressing and three dimensional end a horror sized hole in hollywood has been created with hoping to fill it follows the story of a family who are looking to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called the further with quite a unique concept does deliver and above all scarethe effective technique to show as little of the villain as possible in a horror film applies to all too much this isnt a problem for the 1st half of the film as the majority of the first 45 minutes doesnt include the main bad guy only his ghost henchmen when the main villain is eventually revealed to us the shocking effect of his first appearance quickly wears of as he is showed time and time again if they had just held back his screen time he would have been much more scary and shocking unfortunately this villain who was supposed to be the main centerpiece of the scares turns out the be the main centerpiece of the laughssaying that i thought that some scenes where absolutely terrifying showing sparks of genius at timesespecially at one point which has to be one of the most unsettling scenes in horror film history  in my opinion i won spoil it all ill say is tiptoe through the tulips the scares are partly down to tempo of the film it takes a while to get started but once it does the scares hit hard in some clever sequences this creates a really tense atmosphere that had me in hysterics however i couldnt help but feel let down after the film as the terrific scares in this film are ruined by the ridiculous and unrealistic plot as the plot gets more and more silly throughout the film new characters are added which just increases my annoyance 3 characters enter the film who provide no scares or suspense whatsoever they just drag the film down and pull the viewers away from the suspense by providing awful comedic valuethis film provided terrifying moments at times but the disappointing lack of realistic plot dragged the film down if this film had maintained its suspense that was created by the ghosts in around the 45 minute mark this film would be a real winner and one worthy of attention i want to give this film a 8 stars but the lack of plot silly characters and unconvincing tame bad guy means that i have to give this film a 7calum russell,astonish
does what it is supposed to do scare people and it is effective at that little task a small boy travels in his dreams but goes too far and cant get back that leaves an empty vessel to inhabit and the tortured souls that want that vessel will do whatever they can to prevent the boy from coming backsound scary it is some of the dialog was a bit predictable there were three scenes that seemed rather trite aside from those small missteps though this movie scared me very effectively i might ad dont watch it alone itll make you start to look into dark areas of your house,astonish
i was really looking forward to watching this film the trailer looked good an interesting take on child possession good intensity built in the first half  helped by the obvious denial of husband that something was not right in the house liked the seeding that he had a past that was obviously going to emerge as the story unfoldedand it did but what spoiled it entirely for me was the appearance of two lone gunmenghost facers types thanx to x files and supernatural respectivelywho for some reason seemed to be there to give comic relief intensity gone enter the medium poltergeist here we go again and the film begins to unfold mechanistically static stills of the ghostsfrom the endless camera flashes show these literally as cheap shots rather than well crafted and wholly conceived imagesjoshs past was an interesting take but the whole thing totally overwhelmed by a young director who i dont think was able to take his genre seriously compare this to whedon or mcg who seem to be big influences who would never allow a gag to reduce the awful intensity of the momentthe description of the raison detre of the creatures in the documentary reel was mindbogglingly pretentious an example of how to talk up mediocrity,astonish
the best way i could describe this movie is just what i wrote in the summary it started off so scary and creepy i had to pause multiple times to collect myself and get ready for the inevitable the ending however felt so disconnected from the beginning that i felt like two directors were making this moviespoiler alert at the end of the film so many questions ran through my mind why did the writers decide to make the father have the same problem and have to go in to save the kid why when he was under was it so simple to get to the other house barely a journey and looks all planned why was the demon not doing anything with the kid other than conveniently placing him in the middle of a big room with an ankle chain that was ridiculously easy to remove i mean the ending just completely didnt match the first half of the movie i had such high hopes for this movie because the first half had me on the edge of my seat to bad the ending placed me firmly back in it ,astonish
76 actually but this movie wasnt high budget and you can tell its kinda b movieish but really good with a budget of 15 million dollars its pretty low however its pretty decent it kinda combines poltergeist though defiantly not the extremely high budget paranormal activity and the exorcist all into one with a little of its own elements overall good movie i just hope they dont ruin it with a bad sequel it obviously needs a sequel i just hope its not a bad one another thing is that its rated pg13 what yep it has a pg13 rating and its still scary ive always praised pg13 horror movies because 1there is either very little violence or none at all 2 its scary without being gory to where youre not flinching at every kill scene but every time theres something scary youre just numb 3every scare is specific and finally 4 it actually has to be i dont know scary to be in the horror genre,astonish
from director james wan saw death sentence writer leigh whannel saw iiii dead silence and producer oren peli paranormal activity 13 comes a tense eerie hauntedhouse film in the same vein as classics like the changeling the haunting and poltergeist with its minimal special effects goreless style and creepy atmosphere it raises enough goosebumps to leave you awake at night pondering whats behind the door or under your bedthe film stars patrick wilson and the gorgeous rose byrne as josh and renai a young married couple with three young children as they move into their new home renai is a singer and musician and a stayathome mom for their infant daughter while josh teaches at an elementary school during the day at first their life seems perfect before something happens to one of their sons dalton who mysteriously slips into a coma before strange events begin to plague the house at first its just disembodied voices and strange noises but as the activity becomes more and more violent they decide to move realizing that the house is haunted however when these events follow them to their new home they consult a paranormal expert who confirms its not the house thats haunted its their catatonic son dalton and the spirits want his body and his lifethe film is a remarkable feat in modern horror while most studios churn out silly slasher films and watereddown cgifilled remakes is a true classic ghost story with a touch of fantasy towards the end and feels very fresh and unique compared with the films that pass for horror these days it is confident to take us to dark places where the simple sound of a footstep will make you gasp instead of throwing rubber gore in your face it really eats at you and builds tension terrifically i also am very happy that there are no fake scares in the film no cats leaping out of closets or characters surprising each other if something happens that makes you jump its a spirit and a threat there are no fakeouts which is gutsy on the part of the filmmakersthe cast is all very good wilson and byrne are fantastic and really convey the emotions of a distressed couple lin shaye as a paranormal expert is a delight barbara hershey as joshs mother is believable they are all great the child actors try but arent quite as good but i will give them credit as they are very young and are doing well for their agesthe direction is top notch it isnt too slow nor too flashy its very calm and deliberate the music is also fantastic and reminded me of a lot of classic horror scores it reminded me of william castle films to be honest which i loved the script is tight and works although it does become bogged down in the middle when we learn more about whats going on everything functions perfectly for the most parti will say though that dont expect the whole film to be a hauntedhouse ride as the second half does delve into a bit of fantasy which i quite liked and turns into more of a roller coaster ride than a chilling tale in the finale but i still loved it and was still cowering in fear the whole timeas a horror fan and a believer in the paranormal was a treat i loved it despite one or two shortcomings and feel its one of the best modern horror films ive seen a great 9 out of 10 pop it in turn out the lights and prepare for an eerie spooky ride,astonish
alright might as well talk about the newest movie ive seen and that movie would be honestly i liked this movie no joke i found this to be a really good movie though as i look back on it it really was suspenseful even though its scares were all jump scares gee havent seen that before speaking of which i felt like this was kind of a remake of poltergeist but in a good way i actually started to like the characters and the story it really is like poltergeist except all of the flab of it was cut out of it but thats not all it not only felt like poltergeist but it also felt like paranormal activity thank god i saw that before this and nightmare on elm street the good version now when i saw the trailer for this the plot was already explained but i forgot it woot barely any spoilers and that it was being directed by james wan the director and writer of the first saw film and producer of the rest i felt like this was going to be crap but i was wrong i recommend this film to anyone whos a fan of horror or to take a date with in case they get scared if you know what i mean its definitely the best horror film thats come out since paranormal activity 2 saw that too cant wait for the 3rd film though after all i said its not bad but nothing special i only said that since its a good horror film unlike red riding hoodoh god why did i sit through that,astonish

follows a young couple josh and renai patrick wilson and rose byrne the couple have two sons and an infant daughter and have just moved into a new house renai doesnt feel comfortable there and later has several experiences with a man appearing in her daughters room and outside her bedroom window the couples eldest son dalton then mysteriously falls into a coma which the doctors cannot explain after the supernatural incidents become increasingly frightening the couple move into a new house and it follows they find a medium named elise lin shaye through joshs mother barbara hershey who tells them that their comatose son is the reason for the paranormal activity and that he has become a vessel for the dead who reside in a dimension she calls the further what ensues is a struggle to retrieve daltons astral body and return it to his physical onejames wan and leigh whannell hit it out of the park with their smash hit saw which has turned into one of the biggest horror franchises in history with lessthanstellar sequels if you ask me they followed up with the underrated puppeteer horrorfest dead silence and here they take a turn at a good oldfashioned ghost story thats anything but oldfashioned the film toys with classic concepts of ghostly women in black demons possession and alternate dimensions but is perhaps the first film to deal with the concept of astral projection  that is the ability of the soul to leave the body during sleep and enter alternate planes of existence its a concept widely discussed by psychics and mediums but this is probably the firs time its ever been dealt with on filmin other regards the film borrows ideas from many others in some instances it feels like a 21st century poltergeist with elements of the amityville horror and the score is eerily reminiscent of that in stanley kubricks the shining but in spite of the draws the film makes from other classics of its genre it very much feels like its own movievisually speaking i have to say that the film stands out the most in this arena the ghosts are presented in a lifelike manner and the characters featured in the further have a gothic mannequin look to them the visuals are startling and the appearances of the ghosts are disturbing and surprisingly realistic the sets have a stolid sensibility to them with pallid and dreary colors that add to a sense of dread that is felt throughout the film the menacing demon that is the pinnacle of the supernatural activity is visually simple but for that reason alone he is even scarier the acting is allaround respectable with patrick wilson and rose byrne leading the film and the presence of classic actresses barbara hershey and the quirky lin shaye lend the film even more credibility writer leigh whannell also surprised me playing a nerdy paranormal investigator quite well the films ending was expected on my part but by all means it worked standout moments the sance scene the ghosts in the further and the woman in blackoverall borrows a lot but also makes its borrowings very much its own the story has some fascinating elements and contains some genuinely frightening moments the visuals alone are dazzling and surrealistic and for that alone id say this film is worth a watch with all of its elements put together it feels off in a way but one has to wonder if it is supposed to if anything its a respectable and interesting effort in a genre that is slowly becoming anything but interesting 710,astonish
what we have is a story of a normal family suddenly thrust into a disturbing situation in which their son dalton ty simpkins falls into a mysterious coma the doctors have know way of explaining w a r n i n g  this review contains spoilers explanations that could spoil it for you so if you are thinking about seeing this film please dont get mad at me for spilling the detailslittle do they know that there is much more to this endless sleep than meets the eye as they seeking outside assistance explore the spiritual and paranormal implications of astral projection and out of body experience few films have delved in toim seriously wondering whether to recommend this film to ghosthorror film buffs or not one good thing about this film is that it took you way out there in the weeds as as far as a new form of weirdness in most reviews though most would point out that the first part of the film should have just been erased and trashed in lieu of the fact that thats about when it started to pick upunfortunately thats about the time where someone falls asleep in or out of the theater there are a few campycheesy things in the onset of the film that just arent too awfully scary for the average horror movie goer however james wan succeeded to chill in the theater to give the creepy suspense going with the music in dolby surround sound but didnt work at home as mucharound the time that first lady showed up the motherinlaw lorraine barbara hershey thats when it got pretty stupid like we are supposed to know that this person was the motherinlaw not that didnt make much sense just as it didnt when the motherinlaw started saying ive seen visions and dreams now if you drop that part  pick up with the kid in a coma with the parents freaked out about the socalled psychicparanormal bug patrol led by elise ranier lin shaye then we got somethingapart from a few inconsistenciesgoofs like the screen door on the house door vanishesreappears  dalton moving his hand lying on floor in a coma this film could possibly be ranked as up there with tobe hoopers 1982 film poltergeist which was produced by steven spielberg and starred craig t nelson jo beth williams  6 year old heather orourke who played the child name carol anne who got somehow physically abducted by apparitions from another dimensional plane of course there really couldnt be anything more spooky about the poltergeist films since carol anne who was played by heather orourke actually died during the filming of poltergeist iii in 1988 she suffered flulike symptoms the symptoms were a result of intestinal blockage which ultimately claimed her life the whiny screaming of carol annes name which is either spoken or screamed in poltergeist iii 121 times would truthfully unnerve anybodyin the case of we soon find a few things that we can sink our teeth into such as the creepy guy that constantly wants to play an old vinyl recording of tiny tims tiptoe through the tulips  the fact that the father somehow has the same power of leaving his body while asleep i forgot to mention the scariness of the infrared viewmaster machine along with sance that goes bananas whats not really explained in this film is to why there are actually physical beings that are able to totally appear from this socalled further area  cause audible issues as well as trashing up the place,astonish
because the movie is from paranormal activitys creators i expected a lot more was a good movie not boring at all but it wasnt that scary the main spirit with the red face was scary when you saw it in the dark in the corner but in the end when it was at close you could see it was just a dude with painted face and that kind of ruined it for mei think i was tricked little bit cos i thought that kid was going to be possessed and then he would be the one freaking out the family the boy was possessed like 15 minutes in the end if i understood right creators should have kept it simple possession story and not mix it up like they did and by the way the trailer wasnt that goodactors were great specially rose byrne played her part as renai lambert really well the ghostbusters guys werent that good they tried to be funny but it didnt really workthe end was unexpected i give credits for that i was so sure that there was going to be happy ending but i liked how it turned outanyway it was good movie not amazing and i dont think that i wasted time watching it still it didnt get in to my top 10 horror movies,astonish
one of the first things you will notice about this film is creative camera work the camera follows the characters around at different angles hides things from the viewer that are scarier when revealed later stays in one spot while the character dashes around alternates between closeups and security camera style flyonthewall anglesthe film also approaches the normally illdefined take our word for it astral world as both mysteriously creepy and eerily welldefined the usually stonestill ghosts may remind doctor who fans vaguely of the weeping angels the atmosphere and setup throughout the whole film are excellent boosted by background music that is usually a frantic violin solo calling back to classic horror films now my only complaint for the film the demon that is moreorless the character that best fits the term antagonist is sketched out in the psychics notebook as a figure that was dead black at the limbs but whose tone faded into a bloodred by the time it reached its face i expected something similar for its true revealed form the actual revelation well it appears darth mual went to this place when he died and he replaced his severed legs with those of a goatthe ending in my opinion is perfect no one really expected that josh could make the old lady go away by screaming go away but it was surprising when we expecting a twist for most we expect the triedandtrue the villain succeeded after all bit saw that a kindof background character had succeeded in crossing over and best of all just as renee is turning around the film cuts out we never see the faceoverall definitely worth a try,astonish
lets face it its tough to come up with a new horror idea thats remotely plausible better to achieve a compromise regarding the suspension of belief or as does pay homage to other fine movies this movie borrows heavily from poltergeist with some nod to the shining and maybe even beetlejuice rose byrne is great just very convincing neither too low key nor overthetop hysterical lin shaye was superb nothing short of a scene stealer barb hershey great scream right from the school of karen black patrick wilsons performance is a bit short maybe a little too passive wouldve liked to have seen sam rockwell in this role but the scares which are truly an art form are cleverly conceived and executed  really cannot ask for more in the horror genre nowadays unfortunately the last portion of the film  the netherworld  is under achieving and not up to par with the first 80 minutes but i must still give a thumbsup,astonish
with this film i feel very much as though its reputation precedes it i sat down expecting 2 hours of pure terror not fully believing i would be able to sit through it allmany people have said that this film is a cross between saw and paranormal activity due to one pictorial reference which you can try and find however i feel a more apt comparison must be between drag me to hell and paranormal activitythe basic plot line is of a family whose son has the ability for his soul to wonder out of his body while he sleeps one night he wanders too far and demons begin to surround his body to possess it whilst his family fight to bring it back the concept of the film is very clever but however could have been done slightly better i feel that they may have also misinterpreted the word as nothing really crept in without being noticedthere are many jumpy moments a very scary looking demon and a bit of a cheap reuse of sets towards the end in spite of all this as horror movies go it is not gruesome or particularly macabre but a good plot with moments of brilliance mixed with entertainment oh and it also has one of the best unpredictable endings because we all saw the button switch coming in drag me to hell but youll just have to watch it too find out,astonish
i didnt go into it with high expectations ive learned not to do that with horror movies anymore especially ones that are touted as the next fill in the blank once this movie got rolling though i became very excited the first half was excellent it was tense atmospheric and downright creepy i am admittedly a jaded old horror snob i havent been legitimately scared by a movie since i saw the exorcist for the first time when i was 9 on the same token i do not judge a horror movie by how scary it is i judge it by the atmosphere and whether or not the writing and filmmaking capture and hold my attention if the movie can get a few jumps out of me in the process thats a fun plus but its not the sole criteria by which i evaluate anymore to his credit wan really showed his chops as an editor and director in the first half of the movie whannel seemed to have put together an excellent story that melded the horror with very real horror especially if youre a parent the music also added a lot to the feel it wasnt your standard synth drones that have become the hallmark of every horror flick made after 1970 they actually had real orchestral instruments and some great dissonant violin that made my spine feel all twistyyes it was all very derivative the first half was basically a hybrid of the exorcist poltergeist and flowers in the attic but it was so well executed that any unoriginality was forgivable and besides if youre gonna rip anyone off you may as well rip off the best the first half of the movie presented believable characters in a scary situation that was made scary by what you didnt see or what you barely saw and did not overrely on rubber monsters or obvious cg effect that ultimately detract from the overall chill factor it was a total throwback to classic horror movies that had me on the edge of my seat with excitement not just excitement for what was happening onscreen but excitement for the genre as a wholethe latter half of the movie became a straightup cartoon all the great setup and intensity that was established in the beginning was pushed over like a house of cards it started with an outofplace overtly comedic pair of overthetop nerdy ghost hunters one of whom uses a modified viewmaster to see ghosts i st you not when lin shayes psychic character came into the picture i had some hope lin is a veteran actress who really knows how to control the screen and her character seemed interesting enough she even flirted with the idea of sending her two ghostgoobers away which made me think ok cool the comic relief was here to lighten the mood so that we could be once again slappedaround with the horror stick when we were just getting comfortable alas that was not the case and the jar jar binks was of the film was in it for the long haulthe rest of the movie did the exact opposite of what the first half established it took all of the ghosts and brought them into the greenfiltered light of day in all of their overlymadeup glory the whole thing took on an atmosphere similar to the spookhouse that the local ymca puts on for halloween but the thing that makes the spookhouse fun and scary is that you are actually in the middle of it stumbling around in the dark and wondering who is going to pop out at you next didnt have that same value since it was just a guy on a screen stumbling around in the dark and the camera angles made it pretty obvious when and where someone was going to pop out at him frankly it was boring now dont get me wrong the inyourface monster atmosphere can work in a movie it worked for the evil dead movies it works in slasher movies heck it even worked in the contemporary version of thirteen ghosts but the thing that made it work there is that the threat existed of the monsters actually doing something to the person whose face they are getting into when monsters gets all up in your grill they have to spew something or attack or try to swallow your soul or something the ghostsmonsters in basically just popped up in front of the hero made a funny noise and an ooky face then backed off it was like a haunted game of whackamole ultimately it came off as more silly than scary and totally invalidated everything that the first half of the movie worked so hard to set upwithout spoiling anything the end was playedout as well it just served to keep things mediocre at least a good ending would have justified the mediocrity of what led up to itlets try to end this on a positive note the first half of the movie was excellent the music was great i give props to the director for using human actors lighting and camera tricks to tell his story and not falling back on crappy cg the first half of the movie shows that there is still hope for the hitchcock school of horror and even in her sixties barbara hershey is still gorgeous so good going on all of that on the whole i give this 25 stars out of 5 it had a boatload of potential but sadly fell flat,astonish
i was pretty excited about this film didnt get a chance to see it in the theaters but all of the reviews i read talked about it being a really good horror film that keeps things simple im not a fan of stuff like saw hostel and other torture porn kinds of stuff i enjoy a good ghost thriller haunted house kind of thing blair witch the others the shiningso the positives first i thought the first half was good nothing particularly ground breaking but nicely paced and staged the opening credits are cool and when the title hits i was reminded of suspiria and other off beat 70s horror pics the simple hints that were dropped at the beginning dad isnt in any of the family pictures kid draws odd pictures that mom and dad think are cute but obviously are a little too weird to be ignored served to create a bit of an ominous atmosphere the weird events that happen at night are staged well and provide some good startling moments i was excited to see where it was all headedduring the 2nd half things seemed to turn a bit odd and honestly kind of comic i thought the set up was good with the grandmother and psychic providing some interesting weirdness to the explanation of the kids coma as an extended astral projection where his soul was trapped by a demon the initial stuff in the kids room with the psychic describing the demon and the subsequent sance with the gas mask and such was really good and staged well though it got a bit goofy at the endonce the dad projected into the dark world to rescue the son things just kind of went down hill everyone said this last 30 minutes was the scariest stuff but it was just like some kind of bad carnival ride the mannequin looking people murdered by another mannequin looking woman the weird guy with half a face that the dad eventually just tosses across the room that was kind of dumb but then when we actually encounter the demon hes like an even cheesier version of the demon in jeepers creepers and thats hard to do sharpening his nails while weird music plays another example of a scary villain that isnt scary once revealed fully people need to watch alien to see why less is more in the monster department plus honestly the demon looked too much like darth maulso there isnt actually a battle between dad and demon dad just runs like hell gets lost in the dark finds a way back to the house and then suddenly theres the witch woman who hounded him as a child the solution dad stares in the mirror and yells yep he yells at her just a throwaway scene and then of course when all seems right with the world guess whatdad is actually now possessed by the witch and is going to kill his whole familyfade to blackso its fun and i think plenty of people will find the whole thing frightening but i just dont get why some people think this is the scariest film theyve ever seen but hey to each his own i suppose,astonish
starts out very slow with loud annoying music and laughable credits essentially the plot is a blend of poltergeist the shining the exorcist the amityville horror and other movies that deal with possession hauntings and demons i kept expecting barbara hershey to be playing the same character she did in the entitywhich this movie has elements of tooif you can get past all that there is a good chunk towards the end of the movie that makes it at least interesting i will warn you to turn down the volume on your surround sound system before the last scene ends or you will feel the makers of this film trying to ear and face assault you with their huge end title and screeching sound as the film ends,astonish
i can just barely understand why someone could find this film scary i had really high hopes for this too high it would appear rose byrne was a nice surprise to the line up and did not displease as for the rest of the acting i was not impressed at alllord christ the music over the top ill admit i did jump a few times at the eardrum bursting violin madness its not the ghosts that make you jump i didnt mind the first 30 odd minutes but it all starting going downhill from there and even faster downhill when the father dropped into the further he didnt exactly fit the bill for a psychonaut astral travellerunoriginal and poorly put together,astonish

this is my first review so dont be too harsh p when i first saw this film on imdb and the good reviews of it i was thinking that this might be pretty damn good flick and yeah it was enjoyable but not nearly as good as the first reviews here let you understand im really a great fan of horror not completely relying on cheap scares and blood and gore good suspense and real fear is what makes a good horror movie for me it doesnt need anything else to be good this film delivers this or at least somethe first part of the film was really good it was steadily building up the suspense with small things what really got me here was the jump scares though i was genuinely freaked out for example when the guy was standing over the baby the sound effects were also great and they built up the atmosphere and the tension really well acting was also very well done in my opinion characters were realistic enough to get a sense of their fear and emotions this far i really thought it would be a great movie but then something just went wrongwhen these two nerdy guys came in with their fancy equipment i didnt really know what to think it was some kind of comic relief in a pretty odd place actually it wasnt just odd place i didnt think it fit the movie at all although some lulz were given to them and then there were was the summoning thing which was okay and interesting to watch even though it really wasnt that scary but then came the astral traveling to the further and everything just went downhill from there if i would have seen the movie only from that point onwards i would have given 1 star without a moment of hesitation the idea behind it was okay but the implementation was just horrible it looked like some cheap ripoff from pans labyrinth with some lame waxdollghostthings thrown in it not to mention the demon which was just some guy with red face paint and sharp nails not even remotely scary even some extra cheesy cgi would have been better than that i dont even want to talk about the escape from the ghosts the whole thing would have been so much better if it would have been even close to what pans labyrinth tasks were but then again its probably not fair to compare this movie to that even though i noticed very conspicuous similarities between the twowith all that said i want to say that this was not a bad movie at all its not a masterpiece but its a great way to spend the night with your better half  even though the second half wasnt all that great i still enjoyed it a lot and its definitely worth watching and much better than your average horror flick,astonish
the producers made their homework they searched what people found scary in other films and then added the old woman in veil and dead family from the others weird toy maker clown face from saw big scary guy with a mask from various knife yielding murderer films such as jason  halloween little bit of elm street etc kidnapping vessels idea is from the skeleton keythe film is clearly very similar to poltergeist with the little expert old women and the ghostbuster geeks trying to rescue a little kid trapped in the further the film changes completely in the middle from a haunted house film to a weird fantasy world film like pans labyrinth overall it was an interesting entertaining and scary film i like it,astonish
i am a big fan of horror films and have seen many over the years i had heard good things about before sitting down to watch it so i did have slightly high expectations going in i must admit the first half of the film was reasonably effective and did a good job of setting the scene for some decent scares yes elements of the story have mostly been seen before but i was still enjoying the movie unfortunately the story started to get rather silly during the second half and the whole astral travel thing left me a little disappointed however the worst feature of this film for me were the ghosts themselves  they just werent that scary i mean from the darth maul look alike to the ugly bride with a seriously bad makeup job i was not so much scared as i was amused i almost laughed out loud not good for a film that held such initial promise i was left shaking my head when the credits finally rolled not the worst horror film by a long stretch but it could and should have been so much better if you are after an effective scary film may i suggest any of the following the exorcist the grudge the changeling george c scott the others or the descent 710,astonish
another one of those child is abducted by evil spirits movies cant they come up with an original idea in this reason everything is fine but unexplainably boring in the very beginning of the movie then all of a sudden dalton falls off a ladder and spirits move outside of him for no reasonhe is fine and can walk to his bed but unexplainably goes into a coma then for months the house is haunted but the idiot father cant see it they move into the new house and they see it is the kid not the housefor no reason two of the people they hire are comedians not serious actors the computer guys there was also a martha stewart looking lady this movie was not scary at all but the only difference between this movie and other generic scary movies is this one goes inside the kidsdads head to the other realm other than that it was the same thing you have seen beforein the end the martha stewart looking lady for no reason takes patrick wilsons picture,astonish
well  to say this movie contains every ghost story horror movie clich ever used would be an understatement but  for me that is exactly what made it entertaining to watch i still cant decide whether the creators were using every trick in the book on purpose as a joke or if they really thought they were making something new and shocking i would put my money on this whole thing being a big joke because i know these guys can make scary movies if they want to i am rather surprised at how many reviewers say this is the scariest movie they have ever seen i suppose if you have never seen a single horror movie in your life this might make sense  but for those of us who have seen poltergeist or the shining you absolutely know exactly what is coming around each corner of this film right down to the piano strikes and violin shrills when something jumps out at you as other reviewers have said  this movie starts off pretty strong and seems to really try and build an eerie atmosphere  but by the films midpoint it sinks into just plain silliness and becomes almost slapstick comedy by the end what other reviewers are not saying is that not only does the movie quickly sink into a world of silly clichs  but it also seems to lose all of its budget to me it seemed like the production quality suddenly drops off and starts looking like a cheesy straight to video horror movie from the 1980s ghosts are clearly just stage hands in white face makeup surrounded by smoke from a fog machine the final 10 minutes when all hell breaks loose has one of the most non shocking endings ever if you dont see it coming a million miles away then you are one of those people who has never seen a horror movie before this one in conclusion  this movie should absolutely be marketed as a horrorcomedy if not a straight up comedy every moment that was supposed to make you jump with fear instead made me convulse with laughter so if you are looking for a good scare  dont watch this movie  but if you just want to be entertained and have a good laugh then by all means check it out,astonish
i was the last member of my group of friends to go and see this movie as i was busy when they all went to see it i went with my girlfriend and another couple all of my friends when asked about it had said it was the scariest film they had ever seen i took this on board and read some reviews on imdb the night before every single one of them said this was a classic horror film or a film that will leave you having nightmares for weeks i went into the cinema weary that this would be correct but everyone could not have been more wrongthe film was not scary at all and all so very anti climatic the first and only moment in the film that i jumped at came quite a while into in when the figure appears behind the babys cot and despite it coming rather late into the film i braced myself for more to come this was not the case and no more jumpy moments came the film dragged on quite a bit and the writers could have tried to insert more scary moments i also read that the music choice of the film made it even more scarier but again to my disappointment this was not the case there was nothing special with the music and sound effects and at the part where the father found the son in the further the music did the complete opposite of what it was meant to do instead of creeping out the audience it completely lightened the mood and to me resembled that of a toy factory and a very childly filmi normally get scared very easily at horror movies and so was expecting to get embarrassed in front of my girlfriend at this one but this did not happen it was very disappointing and did not live up to all the hype that surrounded it and is most definitely not the scariest horror film ever i would not recommend this film at all,astonish
the movie overall was average i wouldnt go out my way to watch it though i went into the cinema feeling like it was going to be one of the scariest movies of all time what i had heard and it just didnt reach its potential the story line was poor and was all got abit stupid and cheesy the first 30minutes are ok but after that it seems they ran out of ideas i would say paranormal activity it better than this because this looked fake the ghosts didnt look very real and all just seemed like bad acting on the other hand the director does know how to make it tense also they say its a horror movie but i didnt see much blood or any gory deaths  hardly any deaths was a cheesy movie with a poor story line with poor acting,astonish
i could tell from the opening credits that james wan was copying the style of the evil dead here in certain places he also seemed to be copying kubricks eerie style as used in the shining i saw one scene reminiscent of the climax to nick roegs dont look now the first half of the film was pretty good it built up nicely as the threats to the family increased the baby monitor with the threatening noises on it was one of the few frightening scenes the intruder in the bedroom was just daft as was the dwarf running around the house the demon character was like a mexican wrestler or darth maul from star wars the bit where the dad goes into the further and back into the house was plain daft the ending was poor as well overall the material was there to deliver a really good horror however it just came across as confused i dont think that its a good sign when horror films are pg13 takes a very skilled director to create scares within those confines,astonish
do not watch this movie theyve managed to blend every possible horror clich into one single film which is no small feat i must concedeits the most obvious collection of teenager scares of all time  poorly written awfully acted and dont be mistaken its not the story that sometimes does scare the audience but the sudden bursts of sound blasting your brains away when the director wants to have you scaredand yes he did scare me for i got pretty afraid that the soundtrack onslaught on my speakers would cause damage to them so i turned off the whole thing and went back to my bookawful ,astonish
this movie literally gave me goosebumps all over my body as well to my girlfriend who couldnt keep watching as she was so scared as a matter of fact everyone in the cinema was scaredwhy it already started with the credits they were scary with insane sound effects for some reason i just knew it would not be an ordinary horror from the people who brought you paranormal activities and sawthe development of the story was great starting with the procurement of an old eery house it kept everybody thinking it was the house who brought the unexplainable things to happen but it was far more worse than that the creatures in it keep popping up in my mind even two days after seeing the movie the final part of the movie was the most frightening with extraordinary confrontations of the creatures that haunt the familywow i finally have hope for the horrorgenre again after seeing so many badhorror movies these days i finally found one that gave me goosebumps and keeps me hungry for moregreat movie and a must see in the cinema because of the special effects and sound effects,astonish
well after going through the other reviews i am kind a scared to right what exactly i have thought about the moviewell it started very well till the point where the alarm went off now alarm went off husband running around the house with an iron bar and wife was staying in the kids room without even trying to call the police well i am a bit realistic freak what would you do call the cops or wait for your husband to be a hero or get killed second point when they moved into the new house where did the 2nd boy go did not show him for a bitthe ghost catcher lady said the husband was scared to take pictures when she said that the wife looked really surprised well you are married to someone for years who does not have any photo since child hood will raise some questionsand also the grand mother knew her son had the same problem but she did not think it is important to share that specially when they moved house because it was haunted and strange things were happeningat the end the whole devil trying to get into the real world scene was more funny than scaryanyway i normally do not analyze too muchcome on its a movie but when i sit down to watch a scary movie i do not expect devil to look like a joker from a circus or more appropriate he looked more like darth maul from star warsafter this time i am never watching a movie reading reviews from imdb to be honest i would be really scared after watching this if i was 10 year old,astonish
ill get to the point and say that the first half of this movie is really well done from the opening credits to the creepy string music reminding you of when horror films were actually good the acting is strong and there are even scenes were the characters are strongly developed everything sets up nice and it has that creepy houseghost story feel to it mixed in with a little bit of intrigue the jumps and scenes are queued on time with the music and the subtle scares are really this movies shining moment actual suspense and fright minus the gore that so many scary movies have been pushing out latelyall this sounds like a great movie right well dont get your hopes up like i did somewhere along the half way point this movie goes downhill drastically it wasnt just a personal opinion either because i heard similar murmurs from fellow viewers needless to say by the end of the movie the plotquality decline and what could have been a great scary movie for the decade amounted to nothing more than a failed attempt that left me wondering why the directors would make some of the choices that they did,astonish
typical christian mythology horror we actually left before the end of the moviethis is sort of a weak mishmash of older horror movies that were good poltergeist exorcist amityville horror the story starts very slow and the characters are not well developed spoiler when the family changes houses because they think their old one is haunted nobody in my group caught on to that for a bit near the end the demon who was in sort of a demonic projection room suddenly appears with a boom and omgtheres a closeup of a cloven hoof to let you know that theres a bygollygee demon there we all busted out laughing thank goodness we only paid for matine tickets wait til this comes out on dvd to see it it really should have gone straight to dvd,astonish
i was about to give up on then there was a rather creative sequence about halfway through that carried me to the end of the movie weak as it wasi guess its quaint to suggest a horror film should have any kind of modestly believable back story that gives some credibility to the events nowadays you just turn up the volume and have the cast start screaming it may be past the stage however where we should credit the movie makers for not thinking up any real story this is a family values scare flick so we dont get any nudity or threatening sexuality the male lead had a part in the classy studio flick little children a few years back but i guess hes still waiting on another one barbara hershey is the baby jane veteran star slumming in the nonsense you get a typical shocker ending thats shocking because it totally contradicts what the movie maker just told you happened funny such things arent very shocking anymorecomic relief guys are not funny but the spook hunter lady was likably nonactorish like a substitute teacher who somehow wondered onto the set there is a certain silly spook house quality to the movie that is kind of likable the use of the late tiny tims novelty hit tiptoe through the tulips is kind of funny tiny tim was scarier though then anything in this movie,astonish
there was a review on friday from a 13yearold who saw the movie with his mother the kid was spot on with his review regarding the music the music was great for this movie it reminded me of the olddays vincent price movies the opening credits were attentiongetting after that the movie fell into sleepmode the kid did mention that to him the movie was scarycreepy but for adults it might be just scary i thought i would give it a try expecting to see a good movie i would say that if you liked paranormal activity iii and from years back the blair witch project then you would like this movie had i known it was made by the same folks from paranormal activity i would have stayed home and saved my money the movie is so slow to start the story line was oh so predictable if you watch movies of this genre and have done so for decades then you can pick up on the story line in a heart beat the ghouls were not scary reading that the movie was made on 800k explains a lot about the cheap look to it  just like the paranormal movies why did i bother to even see those movies i thought the first one was factbased my nieces talked me in to seeing the second one and they were bored back to i could hear restless movement in the movie theatre people were bored only a few jumped here or there if youre scared easily this is the movie for you if you like something thats fresh moves at a good clip and keeps your mind active this isnt the movie for you,astonish
this movie had so much potential it started off well similarities to poltergeist but then it went to far to extreme its shows to much of the ghosts and spirits the reason why we fear these things is because we dont know much or anything about them its the mystery of the unknown that scares us but with this movie you see so much of the bad guys its as if they are actually alive and the demon was a bit silly a weird wacky demon that makes puppets in a way this movie started off like any great horrors do but then this morphed into an episode of are you afraid of the dark and i was looking forward to a good flick i even went to see it just from reading all the reviews from here shame on you  they just dont make horror films like they used to,astonish

you can not you just can not ruin this way a movie which had started damn well i hate when that happens the first hour is perfect good atmosphere good suspense theres some real goosebumps moments there are also some clichs such as the medium that intervenes and tells her version of the facts the woman immediately believes her and bursts into tears while her husband calls her a charlatan and kicks her out of the house  is there a ghostpossession film where this does not happen i have not seen one yet but overall the quality is excellent the explanation of the medium about whats going on is compelling and intriguing the action in the house and the sance are exciting and then the disaster begins puppets of all kinds black metal musician like freaks that pop out of nowhere and lick the face of the childs mother and then the apotheosis of crap the astral travel of the father a character so obnoxiously characterized and with a fixed grouperlike facial expression in the world beyond there we have demons fought by means of punches and shoves other ridiculous puppets the ghost from his childhood which can be defeated and made disappear just by screaming 3 times go away the world of demons that is just their house with some fake fog and strobe lights and finally the pathetic attempt to a twistend the latter is just the rotten icing on a vessel of sh that was poured in place of chocolate to cover and completely ruin a cake that was getting very very good the first part deserves an 8 the second a 3 by an average it makes 55 but im still angry so i give 4,astonish
in order to fully enjoy this movie experience i think it is best that you watch this movie alone and in the dark if you are like me and enjoy being scaredthen this is the way to gothis was a great moviethe actors were very believable and not idiotic like the majority in horror filmsughthe father btw really hotgreat choice overall there are so many jumps and scares in this film the only horror movies that scared the crap outta me are this movie and the ringbut only bc i watched it alone and in the darkit was def difficult to go to sleep that nightenjoy horror movie lovers,astonish
ive anticipated this movie for a few months now and despite that it has a unoriginal storyline and is at times even a little corny the opening credits will make you think of a lame haunted house ride its the best horror movie ive seen since paranormal activitythis is not because of its originality because frankly it is not actually its the unoriginality that makes this a very scary movie it uses tested scare tactics to create a suspenseful atmosphere and a few bodyjolting moments without it being ridiculous overdone like in drag me to hell i was slightly disappointed that the ending spun a little out of control but it couldnt bother me so much that i thought of it as a bad movie afterwards basically i expected a scary movie i got a terrifying one what more can you ask forits very easy to dismiss this movie as one with a flimsy storyline or just plain ridiculous but then you would miss the point of this film its not meant to have a great storyline its not meant to be original its just meant to scare the crap out of you for a very very long hour and a half and on that last point it solidly delivers,astonish
when i saw the trailer of this movie i was very keen to watch it and when i saw the movie i was amazed at first i had different mind set that its just a pg13 so no more great horror will be there but i was wrongthis movie will really make you to feel your nerves nicely done and great horror although not rated rallover i must say a must watch and great milestone in the list of horror movies so far this movie has everything to be entertained thrilled suspense and fearedcheers,astonish
i was sceptical about watching this movie as a friend had told me it was awful but after watching it myself i found it thoroughly enjoyable the scary scenes were jumpy and genuinely creepy and the choice of song tiny tims tiptoe through the tulips worked really well and gave brilliant effect before watching the film i googled it and found a lot of hype about the red faced demon which looked terrifying from the images on google but when watching the movie the demon itself is not scary at all the old woman from joshs childhood was very creepy and at the start of the movie i literally shut my eyes overall a really enjoyable horror flick and a pleasant surprise,astonish
i went to see about two hours ago now its so scary there is hardly any special effects but it is so jumpy i could hardly watch tbh the makeup is fantastic in this filmi dont think im going to sleep well tonight all the other people in the cinema screamed or reacted at least once even the credits try to scare you and if your jumpy like me then it probably will is not subtle it tries to get you scared and worrying what going to happen next there are certain scenes which will take me a long time to get over there are some funny moments to balance out the scares as well which relax you a little bituses scare tactics which have been used before over and over again but this is one scary film i was dreading each scenei do not plan on seeing this film ever again i may in the future but i dont know this is one film you have to see in the cinema because the rest of the audience react with youthe music is very creepy as well and the final half an hr or so just doesnt stop with the scares i give 9 out of 10 its very scary  it has no gore really but that doesnt take any thing away from the experience go watch not on your own though,astonish
this film was a bit of a shock to me i was expecting a run of the mill scary little movie but what i saw was a genuinely creepy film with some real scares now ive been watching horror movies for a long long time now and i love them there is something primal about that feeling of unease and terror that accompanies real scary films this film has it the acting is good great main cast with brilliant support a nod to other films and a blink and youll miss it jigsaw reference the direction is awesome and the team behind the original saw prove that they know how to make a good horror movie on the whole if you like feeling uneasy and being scared then this could be one for you my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed this film from behind her jumper and a cushion that sort of scares is rare indeed,astonish
how often does a film come along that is actually scary so many films try yet all they end up offering is a couple of jumps and maybe a bit of gore so films now days maybe jumpy and disgusting making you want to turn your head away but its not the same as being actually scaredthere have been moments the end of the ring original being a stand out moment but really did do the jobok i was alone at night with the lights out which helps but the first hour of the film might well be my favourite hour of horror film ever its a shame it kind of turns in a circus although an extremely frightening one towards the end it all of a sudden became like a weird comedybut i think this is the intention its everything i had hoped drag me to hell would be straight out of the 80s as cheesy as ever but very scarywatch this film if you like horror films and have been looking for one to scare you as much as nightmare on elm street did when you were a child or maybe thats just medont take it too serious tho you might find a few holes in the plot,astonish
darth maul from star wars is the main bad guy and all the ghosts are old people theres 1 good jump scene about 30 minutes into the movie and the rest is downhill a theater of 16 year olds didnt even scream through the moviethis movie couldve been great but was extremely poorly executed the entire climax of the movie was a joke the protagonist was essentially told hes invincible while in ghost world looking for his son the viewmaster scene couldve been good if they didnt flip to two girl ghosts from the 1800s why not something scary and creepy looking the only scary ghost in the entire movie the undertaker was severely underutilized and disposed of by the protagonist by a bruce lee double chest karate chop the directors couldve expanded the final scene of the movie by 1 still of a really scary ghost and left a lasting image on the audience but they inexplicably didntthe idea was creative the execution was horrible my girlfriend fell asleep in the theater enough said,astonish
this movie is a lazy odditywhen i saw this the young energetic and crowded audience responded accordingly squeaks and giggles distracted as the hackneyed script ticked all the relevant boxes relying heavily on clich excused as references to classics the faded palette screechingstring score and stereotyped characters offered nothing new  but so what this is a fun horror movie right nookay it avoids cg and splatter but that doesnt automatically single it out as the kind of movie to creep inside your head and have you keeping the lights on in your bedroom for the next four nights as a weak reworking of superior hauntingpossession classics this poorlyacted weaklyscripted movie is a vehicle for jumpgags alone granted a couple of these gags are inventive if youre a fan of the genre but the final 30 minutes had me yawning and patiently waiting for a probable conclusion with the inevitable twistso you might as well avoid this unless you have a seriously bored rainy afternoon is a dull placeholder for those who remember the awe naked fear and fascinating paranormal intrigue of poltergeist,astonish
5510darn this movie was not scary i read into all the good reviews here and was biting my nails as the movie began i was so tensed and stressed out even before it began i watch horror movies all the time with regards to this movie if you are 8 years old you will be scared no doubt but not for adults and i even saw a bunch of 8 yr olds walk into the theater and then i knew something wasnt right it was more like taking your kids to the carnival to see some scary looking clowns my husband and i were bored half way through we just wanted it to be over the script started out pretty well but the writer went overboard in this day and age no soul would believe the things which the folks in this movie believed theres got to be a decent scientific explanation to everything you cant just close your eyes and vanish into the further,astonish
i had high expectations for this film and so when i got offered free tickets to the preview screening in sydney then i jumped at the chance sadly having seen it i now wouldnt recommend it to anyoneit starts out well enough and there are a couple of make you jump moments within the 1st 30 mins or so but it then very quickly becomes a very frustrating and unintentionally funny film with nonsensical decisions being made and scary moments just becoming repetitive and obvious cliques also the acting by the father is particularly bad and there were audible groans in the cinema i watched it in whenever he tried to be dramaticthe few good ideas and good characters in the film are quickly over shadowed and moved aside by the bad ideas and bad characters meaning no tension really develops and you are never drawn into the atmosphereto sum it all the finale of the film caused huge amounts of laughter in the cinema rather than building to a scary climaxavoid,astonish
if this is the best james wan can do his directorial days are numbered it seems hollywood has a habit of churning out crappy horror films make anything to earn a buckthe topic of this film isnt new at all astral projection i had seen a film of this sort long ago it was called out of the body 1989 it was about a man who unknowingly goes out of his body in his sleep and kills beautiful women then i saw the blue man 1985 this one was about a dissatisfied montreal director of tv commercials is taught to astrally project himself by a mysterious woman but soon he finds that he does it against his will when he sleeps and while he does it he commits savage acts against those in his life then i saw the poltergeist trilogy of films and the nightmare on elm street a seasoned horror film fan i have watched horror films going back to the 30s nothing is new to me this film is especially made for newbie horror movie lovers who have no experience at all and for whom this film is made thats where all the cash comes from i pity these suckers who spend their hard earned money on this filmplot of film a family of five husband wife two small boys and a baby move into a new house their youngest son has the habit of astrally projecting himself during his sleep and wandering the realms beyond until he gets trapped in a faroff place called the furtherthe boys father has the same inherent ability he has to go into hypnosis project himself astrally and rescue his sonthis was the biggest mistake made in the film all of james wans films have terrible endings this one is no exception verdict either watch it online for free or rent it cheap or borrow the dvd from a sucker who has already bought it and now plans to use it as a frisbee,astonish
i want to preface this by saying i am a very big horror film fan ive seen a lot of horror films and i have great respect for the genre having said that this is one of the worst horror films ive ever seen in my life i paid 150 to see this at the theater and i want my small change backthere are so many weak points in this film its hard to begin with just one ill begin with the weakest the directing now im a fan of wanns original saw and dead silence was even tolerable at points is just one big whiff the decisions the characters made at points were so unbearable that i contemplated just leaving the theater early the part that has stood out to me to be one of the worst parenting moves in the history of film was when the mother finds the sheets covering her son with bloody hand prints on them and she just waits for her husband to come home to deal with it no calling the cops no getting her family out of the house just wait outside on the porch with whatever did that inside with her son alone for her husband to come home another point was when her husband is doing his outofbody experience or whatever were supposed to just forget about that and be surprised later in the film that his son can do it too lastly what bothered me about the directing was when the husband is in his class room and wann and the doll from saw are written on the chalk board this is just flat out classlessness not only am i pulledout of the story but im not thinking of the film at all im thinking of how pretentious the director is for having those in the backgroundthe acting was just so atrocious that i cannot even begin to describe how the actors tried to look scared its like they just graduated from acting school and were going over the script in their heads thinking okay i have to be angry or scared now then cue the clich lookthe last points im going to gripe about will pertain to the directing again these are things ive heard the most when people have complaints about the film the sudden shift of what the film is half way though the first half is a sortof paranormal activity with a bigger budget then the second half is dead silencehaunted house experience the first half was the most fitting for the film since the film is named the second half came out of nowhere and wasnt called for by any justification i compare it to dead silence because of the way the dead peoples makeup and movements were done its as if they just walked off the dead silence set and walked right onto the set this sudden change in the pacing and tone of the film made it seem like it didnt know what it wanted to beall in all i cannot recommend this for anyone this is just another sad excuse for a horror film that unfortunately got popular which means there will be sequels to suffer through,astonish
titles that spontaneously spring to mind when reviewing are poltergeist the haunting and the exorcist now youll have to admit that there are far worse movies in the genre to get compared with is another collaboration between the multitalented writeractor leigh whannell and the multitalented director james wan the duo was previously responsible for the original  and undoubtedly still the best  saw and the creepy ventriloquist chiller dead silence especially compared to their goresoaked debut feature saw is a completely different kind of horror movie its a mature and effectively slowbrooding horror story that thrives on atmosphere intelligent plotting and a few imaginative themes that will keep even the most experienced and knowledgeable horror fanatics intrigued the story opens like thirteen ghost movies in a dozen do a happy young family moves into their newly purchased dream house but not much later their oldest son  presumably due to a banal fall from a ladder  slips into a mysterious coma that perplexes all medical experts renai the mother is convinced that somehow the new house is haunted and soon after begins to hear eerie noises through the baby monitor and see ghostly appearances in her boys room she manages to persuade her husband to move elsewhere but when the strange paranormal occurrences continue they get the professional help of a spiritual medium she discovers that the son isnt suffering from an unknown illness but that hes gifted with the ability to explore alternate dimensions during his sleep only  he stepped across a dangerous boundary this last time and moreover his gift seems to be hereditary admittedly the first full hour of is rather uneventful and very vague but wan and whannell nevertheless succeed in keeping you confident that the wait will be worthwhile you just sense that it wont be another routine and clichd hauntedhouse thriller the ambiance is similar and the clues point in that direction but the films admirably comes with an innovative twists on the supernatural themes the last half hour is very powerful and contains a handful of truly efficient jumpy moments albeit still without gore or expensive special effects the last five minutes actually even qualify as the strongest horror finale ive seen in a few years the acting performances are decent great to see barbara hershey again and the setpieces are well selected i can only recommend this movie,astonish
this movie was terrible it was like a stupid comedy with bad acting and whats up with the darth maul dude you would esprit obi wan to pop up somewhere and chop him in half when the movie went into theaters the this movie must have been laughing their heads off if you want to see a good scary movie this is not the right one for you i just wasted 100 minutes that i can never have back dont waste your time and money i can think of plenty of movies that were way scarier that this load of crap it was almost as funny as drag me to hell which was not scary i would rather watch the last airbender than this again i just cant believe that i stayed up until 1230 to watch this movie and now im gonna have nightmares about how much sleep i missed,astonish
as a hardcore horrorfan i had begun to lose hope in the genre over the last few years what with films such as scre4m being churned out of the mixer i can honestly say that after seeing this gem my faith has been restored the film takes time to build suspense for the viewer meaning the action takes a while to kick off however once it does you are somewhat thankful that it took so long throughout the film the writers use different styles of scares ranging from your typical something jumping out of the closet to a sharp violin solo to creepy spinetingling imagery this meant that you literally had no clue where the next jump out of your seat moment was coming a feat not upheld by the majority of the genre today despite james wan responsible for saw directing there was not a spec of gore or a hint of tortureporn involved in it this made it feel fresh and proved how films can be scary without having to sling intestines at us in 3d the film however was not perfect the last 20 minutes of the film act as a metaphorical gust of wind to the pyramid of cards that the first hour had built up some poor attempts at cgi and a flurry of pointless cheap thrills make it seem that the writers lost their way a little bit near the end the whole concept of the film although fresh in modern horror terms is not as unique as the writers would have you believe which in some ways is not so bad however some fans may feel ripped off there was also a degree of light humour provided by leigh wannell and his partner which distracted from the fear slightly altough i personally welcomed it overall the film is suspenseful and immersive taking the best parts of films such as poltergeist shutter and paranormal activity and making a brilliant piece of cinema this is almost certainly a mustsee for horror fans especially those who havent felt a true scare for a while,astonish
so i saw and i gotta say this is the scariest movie ive seen since paranormal activity if not scarier the reason for being scarier than the masterpiece paranormal activity is because the subtle scares detailed demons and truly scary situations is just like the older movie poltergeist only much better patrick wilson and rose byrne both play excellent roles in being worried parents and very dramatic characters the ending is truly interesting the musical score was excellent the acting was superb i mean what is there bad to say about this movie go see it as soon as you get the chance its truly excellent and very scary,astonish
i saw the trailer for this film i thought wow this looks great but so did the trailer for drag me to hell a couple of years back and that was shocking however did not disappoint this film blew me away from the makers of saw i was expecting a lot of gore and cheesy lines instead i was shown a masterpiece the opening credits were like a style icon in the land of film the mixture of eerie music black and white visuals and red graphics sets the mood for the film throughout feature it uses the good old conventions for horror films but instead of paranormal activity where it was really cheesy the slamming of doorscreaking of floor boards and the rocking of a rocking horse all fits in a new fresh way that will make the audience jump  it made me jump and i never jump at horror films the end of the film starts to feel like a game the lighting setting are amazing and i felt completely immersed in the whole style of itoverall if you like old horrors then this is a new contemporary horror film that has a great nod at the classics and is amazing,astonish
about as scary as a bunch of kittens playing with a ball of wool,astonish
well it tried this james wan dude thinks himself as the king of horror and stuff but he aint the simple fact that he worked on those saw films makes me loose respect for him those things were ridiculous so obviously the saga was a bit hitwas a suggestion from a friend since we like similar movies then i saw that patrick wilson and james wan i didnt know about his connection with saw yet were int it and since they worked in the conjuring which is pretty good i was expecting something goodill admit that i forced myself to watch it until the end no it wasnt scary wan s vision of horror is simple you look now and see nothing you turn around and boo im behind you and violins playing in the highest pitch possible thats not horror thats justannoyingthe entire film is a collection of clichs and is completely predictable it begins with the common formula oh were a young family struggling to make ends meet while pursuing a dream were good and kind parents of some little children in spite of the difficulties love keeps us together weve just moved into a new house so i hope nothing bad happens but of course bad things do happen and the first thing the mom thinks is that the house is haunted duh obviously uh and even never going to church she calls in the local priest after all all priests know of demonic possessions how to guide people through the problems and whenever you call them theyll come right away yeah i dont really think that priests have much to do on their daily livesso the clichs never end you already know whats going to happen on the next 10 or 20 minutes why did i watch it well i was curious it was late at night and i didnt feel like browsing and picking movies againit sucksmost of the clichs are the basic problems from the past reappear the children are the targets the mom suffers and nearly goes insane the father is skeptic at first but then believes her the child already knew about those things and had been drawing about it for a long time and no on never noticed it some tech dudes walk in with cameras and other instruments in order to pick up and electromagnetic fields the ghosts leave behind the old lady shows up and is an expert in the subject and can talk to the other side where the dead reside and suffer forever the evil dead want the childs mind and of course theres a demonwow being dead must suck pain and suffering forever having to fight a demon to win a healthy living body just so you can inflict pain upon othersand it goes on and on and on until it reaches its predictable end,astonish
i decided to watch since i was blown away by james wans other series the conjuring the conjuring was one of the best movies ive seen so i thought id watch james wans earlier movies i had heard about a very long time ago but i never thought i should watch it until recently i was very surprised by how good was i was expecting a creepyish movie revolving around inhouse hauntings but it was much more than that had an amazing plot and was also much more frightening then i expected the movie revolves around the idea of astralprojection an outofbody experience that makes you feel like your physical conscience is disconnected from your body some real mountaineers who hike through lowgravity zones describe this the movie displays a boy who can do this at will while sleeping although something about this ability ends up bringing a lot of fright to him and his family i found the movie very exciting and suspenseful while also being interesting  enjoyable there were a few jumpscares that made me jump and the movie as a whole was quite scary there were some extremely creepy moments that i still vividly remember i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies my final rating is 910,astonish
a movie critic cohort on my blogroll darren at movies 101 pointed out to me yesterday that had a ridiculously low budget of just 15 million we were discussing it in context with a film he was reviewing with a small budget as well it is true that money can buy an awesome production but there is still a lot to do with a little money definitely fits in that categorythere is no set criteria for a great horror flick in my opinion i rate them based on what they try to be and let me say this its fairly easy to detect what a horror movie is trying to be there are saw formulas and others for movies like paranormal activity id say there are probably a handful of classic themesformulas and two handfuls of ones that have emerged in the past 2030 years follows the formula of cheap camera scares and ingenious sound effects and they are used well everything else in the film including ghosts is minimal the creepiest scene in my opinion could have been aired on the twilight zone in the 1960sthere may be minor spoilers the rest of the review that doesnt mean its not graphic its far less so than saw which was made by the same people but its not for very small kids like 07 still it is a minimal movie that relies on the creepiness of strobe like scares and a ghost story that really never goes anywhere  until the end i loved the end there is a twist that made me smile for sure if youre looking for a great horror movie without the gore and not as much stuff jumping out as paranormal activity this is a fun one to get your blood going i didnt like some of the writing choices for example i thought the boy came into the house with a feeding tube far too quickly after being in the hospital i also thought the story was way too slow and not much was developed until a certain point it could have gotten to it much earlier for my taste for that reason i took off just one star and still rated it very high as a great horror film,astonish
of course when you watch a horror movie that contains sequelsyou know that the original is never going to change as the scariest original masterpiece ever when i saw the traileri was amazedbut not really scared when i saw the moviei was amazed and scared quite ironicright wellit surprised me quite a lot compared to the sequelswhich were really goodbut the original will always remain as the best horror movie of 2011 there were quite a few good horror movies i have seen throughout this yearbut was the one that terrified me the most after i saw this moviei was doing research on the director james wanand i saw he was a horror directorwhich amazed me due to how many movies i know and loved of his movies the movies i know he made was saw dead silenceand a few other movies made in the future that i also loved so james wan is considered to be the next wes cravenand he is just my idol james wan really knows when not to mess around with horror filmsand i am deeply honored by his line of work,astonish
finally a supernatural movie that delivered for so long the genre has disappointed me with cheesy camera tricks and scares but has reinstalled my faith in the genre this has great scares a great story line that will keep you watching the lamberts son falls into a deep coma medical science cant explain it the hospital allows the lamberts to have their child at home while hes in a coma but soon ghosts demons poltergeist and the supernatural start to arrive turning the lamberts house into a living nightmare they attempt to flee but soon realize this goes beyond a simple haunted house,astonish
this is my second scary movie i have seen during my lifetime even i am just fourteen years old and after i watched this movie i cant sleep at night but i was still interest of 2 and 3 then i watched but i still think the first one is the best the 2 contains too many unimaginable and unexplained things that make me confused and i was so disappointed of 3 because it makes me bored and it is not that kind of interesting but it didnt make me feel dislike of these movieso many times i was scream like a baby the sound that i cant believe but i made it i was so surprise of directors imagination and i saw the red door appeared in all of the three movies thats the important thing that connect the stories together the red door led them to the storyat the beginning of the stories lambert family were moved to a new house to get better life but one day everything is change dalton has fell down from the ladder then fell in a deep sleep a coma he slept about three months and return to home and the unexplained things happened after that this make lambert family uncomfortable and scared renai thought this is a haunted house so they moved but the things kept happening they ran out of places to go so they found a person elise who was work for this she said everything is not because of haunted house is dalton dalton has a unique ability a gift that dalton can leave his physical body and able to travel places to see things when he sleep at night things that living people not supposed to see the places called the further the further is a world far beyond their own yet its all around them this ability is handed down by josh dalton left his body so long time the body becomes a empty vessel so the other invisible things smell it and come and try to enter it thats why the house was haunted and josh travel to further to find his son dalton and he succeed but the story havent end yetthis film was so true that i felt i was inside the movie i like the world called the further even it was so scary to make me scream after watched this movie i have a question is there further in our life i know it was a baby question but i dont want to know the answer because i dont think i will able to sleep if i know the answer at the end of the movie a horrible thing was enter joshs physical body he killed elise this is a foreshadowing of next moviei like this movie very much i think it is more better than the first scary movie i watched the conjuring i am scared to sleep at night after watched but i will still watch other good scary movie if i have enough courage to watch perhaps there is 4 coming soon,astonish
this is a true horror movie one that will leave scared to death by the the time it ends all the actors did a good job here from rose byrne bridesmaids to patrick wilson little children and lin shaye who plays the paranormal investigator this movie is full of really good jump scares stunning and scary visuals good dialogue a touching message about family and overall just a shocking scary thrill ride this movie gave me chills when i watched it it truly is just really scary especially at night when i watched it and the way they ended it oh my goodness the ended just leaves you shocked and scared to sleep alone at the same time you dont really know what to think at the ending which is good it was a cool twist 910 for being truly scary and well written,astonish
josh patrick wilson  renai rose byrne lambert along with their baby and two other children have moved into a new home but not before long renai starts to experience strange incidents these incidents for the most part just get ignored but things change dramatically when their son dalton doesnt wake up one morning seeking any help they can they turn to elise rainier a spiritual psychic and learn that their son has the ability to astroproject and is actually trapped by a hideous demon in a realm known as the further desperate to get their son back josh has to enter the further to get dalton back before its too lateis a really good and a very creepy movie the first 30  40 minutes are a wee bit slow to be honest with not much happening but even though its a bit slow it does build the story  tension up nicely leading into the last hour which is where it gets much better it doesnt really rely on the jumpboo scares either  although there are a couple of good moments of those  but plays more on the psychological scares of just making you feel really uneasy and creeped outand it works greatthe main demon is done really well and even though you dont see a whole great deal of it you definitely see enough for it to freak you out this works really well because with a lot of these kinds of movies its what you dont see that can actually scare you sometimes the thing that scares you the most is your own imagination and this is what plays on it doesnt rely on gore or intense violence either its just a really good creepy psychological horrorif you enjoy creepy horrors such as the conjuring sinister and the amityville horror then you should enjoy put the lights off turn the sound up and sit back and enjoy,astonish
people talked about this film like it was the scariest movie ever made the truth is actually the opposite it is a typical modern horror a demon in the house someone is possessed they seek help from some exorcist blah blah blah the jump scares were predictable and if anything they were funny the characters were one dimensional and boring the special effects and makeup were cheesy and ridiculous very disappointing for the people who made saw in conclusion i think if you have never watched a horror movie before and are below the age of 9 then this film will give you nightmares if not expect to yawn a lot if you want to watch unoriginal jump scare ghost movies then i would suggest watch sinister or conjuring this will disappoint you,astonish
the plota gripping story of a family in search of help for their son dalton who fell into a coma after a mysterious incident in the attic little do they know that there is much more to this endless sleep than meets the eye as they explore the paranormal and rediscover the past the key to getting their son back once and for allomg what a mess i am shocked at the good reviews for this garbage got the movie is truly a insult to our intelligenceyes parts of it are intense yes parts of it are scarybut its a total mess hard to follow darkly filmedand in the end the plot is just plain dumband the last scene is the biggest slap in the face you will ever witness in a motion picture i wont tell you what it is but it leaves no doubt that there will be a third installment of this garbage,astonish
a young family moves into a new home and while their son dalton is exploring the attic he has a mysterious accident and falls into a coma renai and josh lambert must then fight to keep malevolent spirits from trapping dalton in an unknown realm known as the further is definitely one of the creepiest eeriest supernatural horror thrillers ive seen the whole idea of the unknown lucid dreamland aka the further is unsettling because its not too hard to imagine it existing it may even be real has mastered the balance of jump scares and suspense to be able to mark this movie as a psychological horror not only is this movie creepy as hell but its also an indepth look at what could be happening when were asleep id say the closest counterpart to would be the conjuring meets inception,astonish
omg the devilmonster entered joshs patrick wilsons body whats going to happen next is the first thing to come in my mind after watching this movie believe me this movie is so indulging that you cant stop yourself getting that thought its equally terrifying right form the beginning yes i have never seen such a spine chilling opening sequence ever in any movie the way it is presented the color tone sound effects etc really signal that something terrifying is about to come music composer joseph bishara and cinematographer john leonetti have done an excellent job in this regard unlike other films in this genre it is very well written and deftly handled and for a horror admirer like me this movie satisfied my thirst after a long time i have seen a lot of horror movies and consistently look for some really terrifying horror stuffs and finally i got this one it forced me to cover my eyes with hands several times though some of its out of the world concepts like astral traveler and the further will bother you like what is all this crap but once you accept them you are really going to enjoy it also there are certain moments in the movie that draw disbelief like one can really question how can the lady send anyone into the further or how can voice from the present world reach the further but stuffs like these are unavoidable in any horror movie even the best ones have them you will also find some weird stuff like the demon lives in a house works in a 2 storey office outfitted with antiques and listens to music but who knows maybe this is the way they live overall is certainly good but it can entertain you only if you are ready to live in the alternate reality offered by it,astonish
id possibly even give an 810 its very very scary it certainly deserves higher than 68 but cest la vie thats the public for youi have only one major criticism the producersdirector need to learn about dynamic range in sound whilst i dont mind loud bumps for making you jump these arent so much loud bumps as soooo loud its what what i cant hear you what  this it does after pulling the childish trick of having everyone speak quietly so that you turn up the volume then blows your eardrums during a scary part cinema systems can handle it by themselves its immature pretentious and frankly just irritating  if your playback apparatus has a compressorlimiter function use itbut of the story the unfolding the characters the buildup  all the stuff that matters yeah its got them has the lotit builds slowly then starts to scare the hell out of you with macabre events leaving you unsettled then it really starts to pour the action onit even provides some comic relief in a couple of places  nice to see something that doesnt take itself so seriously that it cant let its hair down  but this just seems to make the scares even worse because you let your guard downi liked and i like the sequel too,astonish
is a 2010 american supernatural horror film directed by james wan  saw  paranormal activity and many more  and starring patrick wilson rose byrne and barbara hershey the story centers on a couple whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an astral dimension a family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called the further a sequel chapter 2 was released on september 13 2013 with wan returning as director and whannell returning as screenwriter because of the films success it was turned into a maze for 2013s annual halloween horror nights music was composed by joseph bishara who also appears in the film as the demon performed with a quartet and a piano a bulk of the score was improvised and structured in the editing process although some recording sessions began prior to filming on describing the approach of the films soundtrack director james wan explained we wanted a lot of the scare sequences to play really silent but what i like to do with the soundtrack is set you on edge with a really loud sort of like atonal scratchy violin score mixing with some really weird piano bangs and take that away and all of a sudden youre like what just happened there,astonish
i just cant believe that no one has made mention to the fact that this could very much resemble a sequel to the entity 1982 which starred barbara hershey as the main character who also plays the grandmotherjoshs mother in this movie who was tormented by an evil entity that also followed her once she moved to a new residence for me the similarities were uncanny i felt like this couldve been the sequel if you havent seen the entity i definitely recommend it it was supposedly based on a true story  was one of my favorites that year very dark  twisted with awesome special effects for 82 i thought this one was a great scary movie in my opinion there arent too many that actually scare me anymore im getting ready to watch the sequel chapter 2 cant wait if its half as good as this one im sure ill definitely be on the edge of my seat a,astonish
a happy family suffers a situation they couldnt possibly fathom dalton falls into a coma doctors cant figure out how it happened renai rose byrne calls in a medium elsie rainer lin shaye  much to josh lamberts wilson chagrin he eventually gives in and elsie tells them their son is trapped in a realm called the furtherits always nice to see a good oldfashioned ghost story and who better at the helm than james wan james wan knows how to deliver some scares that can give you goosebumps he does a fantastic job of letting you use your imagination for scares only showing snippets of the entities here and there i thought they were very creepy for the most part except for the silly looking demon thing at the end he looked like a glorified elf this movie is very similar to the poltergeist in ways dalton is essentially in heather orourkes role while byrne  wilson are in t nelson  jobeth williams roles as the parents it is derived a bit from the poltergeist but james wan has his own vision and creativity to keep things fresh it has a good build up as well my only real carps about this movie is that it goes off the rails near the end it runs a bit too long and it gets a bit silly the huge twist with patrick wilson was ok at best i wasnt all that pleased with it i am also tired of the i dont believe storyline it has become such a clich over the years the acting is solid rose byrne is a pro and a woman i would help out any day of the week i wanted to jump in the screen and hug her patrick wilson is great as well his character is a bit cold in the first half but he pulls off his character change in the second half like a champ and i rallied behind him as well lin shaye is very good as the medium managing not to overdo it barbara hershey is wasted in her role but she does have a couple of key moments ironically enough she was the female lead in another ghost story the entity ty simpkins is fantastic for his age as dalton and i was very impressedfinal thoughts the twist at the end doesnt exactly set up a sequel but we got it anyway when money talks logic walks its just the way it is in hollywood that being said i really enjoyed this film for the most part its scary and well done im looking forward to ii even if it isnt necessary7810,astonish
ive been watching horror movies for years and not much scares me anymore so i was delighted to finally reconnect with that primal uneasiness i used to experiencegenuinely scared me im glad i watched it during the day on dvd i actually paused the movie to let my jangled nerves settle downwhat this movie did well was to build tension and then zap me it was like walking around the house in socks on a dry winter day you know the static is building up you know youre going to get shocked when you touch metal you anticipate it and when that zap happens the anticipation adds to the pain this movie did a lot of zapping in the horror genre its hard to be completely original here we have another family being haunted a child is in danger the mother is the first to believe the father is skeptical an old lady expert is called in to fix the problem theres really nothing new therethis movie wins with execution its the right pace of storytelling its the right sound editing its believable acting for the most part its the right look for the otherworldly beingsdont expect perfection though once they knew what the problem was the way they set about resolving it took me out of the mood set during the first part of the movie eyes were rolled nevertheless the overall experience left me with a lingering sense of uneaseim glad someone figured out how to put this all together ive been waiting years to feel this way again well done,astonish
if you go into this movie expecting to watch a great work of art you are going to have a bad time if you go into the movie expecting it for what it is then you will enjoy it and get a few scares along the waythe movies main issue is that it does not do enough to develop the story line as far as why this is happening goesas a parent i also find horror movies dealing with children to be a lot scarier then a typical horror movie its the kind of movie thats going to make you want to check in on the kids before you try and go to bed,astonish
good movie i feel that people who like one type of scary movie and doesnt except more interpretive kinds of ghostology wont get why this movie works on a variety of levels without being too overbearing the only negative about this movie is that it also fits well into the low budget trendy new horror movie genre as well if you dont focus too much on the acting per say which isnt all bad you can see how this movie has a good build and plot that succeeds away from the clich even though i thought the closing scenes were a bit cheesy it still is a good overall movie yet considering i havent seen chapter 2 i cant wholeheartedly fully validate this movie 7 out of 10 rent it in succession if youre bored,astonish
in facti wasnt any intention to watch this first part but i decided to give it an opportunity taking into account that the second part is on theaters right now i should have followed my instinct the only one reason why this movie hasnt disappointed me is because i didnt wait anything at all from it so i was right because theres nothing right or surprising in iti know the budget was just 800000 dollars but i think they could have saved the money instead of wasting them seriously its the worst horror movie ive ever seenwho had the idea of making a second part whats more whos going to pay for watching it although im changing my mind right now its not possible that any second part was worse than this,astonish
i dont remember much about this movie after watching it about a year ago but i can say it had a troubling impact on my ability to live normally for the two weeks afterwardit left me with a disturbing fear of going to sleep with the thought that i could go into a coma and never wake up the concepts that the movie presented had me uneasy and unwilling to stay in a room alone for too long for fear that a demon would be in there as well and it didnt help that my cat often looks at things that arent really there theres always the saying that cats can see spirits and things like that so it terrifies mewhenever i hearread about the paranormal i really have to force myself not to think about so that i dont become paranoid about the things that i saw in that moviei cant give it a rating because im not really in to horror movies so i cant say that i enjoyed it or thought any of the scare devices were effective and now that i post this i know the nightmares are going to come back again oh no,astonish
i find it very hard to be scared or shocked when i can see them coming it doesnt matter what kind of movie really the older i get the more ive seen the harder it is to see something originali was surprised at some of the attempts to shock or scare me and they were very effective but all i all i have seen this movie in to many other movies that in themselves may not have been all that original either i guess that would depend how old i was when i saw say poltergeist and how many movies ive seen before yes it very obviously stole from that movie a child being used to get the message across to the living from the ghosts and mommy this time daddy going into the other realm to get baby back i found it a bit amusing to see barbara hershey in a movie about a ghost that follows the victim from house to house as in the 1982 movie she stared in the entity supposedly based on a true storymany reviews cite many movies that have been borrowed from that i have not seen or even heard of thats just shameful there is only so much borrowing you can do without calling it a remake of some sort even if its remaking several movies at once even at that some of the scares were scary not all but some then again i was tired and getting shocked out of my sleep only helped the effect of the shock and i cant rewatch it to see if the shock is just as effective now that im wide awake and no the movie was not so boring it put me to sleep at the end of a very long day star wars would have put me to sleep then,astonish
before i saw this movie i heard that this movie was really scary and as a fan of horror i really wanted to see this so i found it and it scared me a lot i was thinking it was terrifying but then i had to stop watching because my computer was getting slow i didnt back to it till maybe a week and coming back to it i realised there were only around 15 minutes left so i was hoping it would be worth it and it was meh i could see what they were trying to do but it just wasnt as good as what was earlier in the film you see earlier on pop ups were used which were very scary but thats why ive given this such a low rating not only is the ending not as interesting as most of the movie but its the fact that they use pop ups which can only be scary the first time you watch them although that being said one of the reasons i gave this a 5 is because there is one scene that uses a pop up that is always chilling to watch not because it gives you a fright but because of the very look of it and how it was shot i think that pop ups in horror movies are a little lazy to be honest i dont think giving someone a fright is exactly scaring them i think to scare an audience well you should leave them with an idea that will stick with them certain images that will stick with them and if youve seen the movie you may think that and thats what i thought so too the lipstick demon is an example freaky at first but when you actually think about it you think at least i do lipstick come on and he does kind of look like darth maul although actually funnily darth maul is scarier looking at least to me when watch the second time or more other than the scene i have mentioned not much really scares me when a pop up comes up i dont react at all i used to think this was better and scarier than the exorcist but looking back at what i said i cannot believe i said that the exorcist not only has a more interesting story and characters it is something i will always find scary this if you havent seen it go watch it and you will probably be scared but watch it again and you might be like me and not think much of it,astonish
the worst horror film i have seen ever 1 star is a bonus really do not waste your time trying to introduce a freddie kruger like character that has no back story or apparent relevance the father following his son in to some place that can only be described as absolute rubbish why would anyone want to astral project if that was all that they got leaves little to the imagination also where did the idea that malevolent spirits exist on the astral planes come from that is not something i have ever heard of if one is producing fiction with some believability then at least make sure certain aspects of the back story are at least fairly accepted overall stay away from this film at all costs it is not worth the frustration of watching it,astonish
i was on the fence about watching this movie for a long time but after seeing many positive reviews on here i decided to give it a chanceand let me tell you what a mistake that waspeople say this movie is scaryit has to be the least scary movie since paranormal activity the acting is terrible except for patrick wilson the story line is lame and the make up effects are laughable some moments were supposed to be scary and i found myself laughingthis movie is about a family who moves into a new house but soon begins to think the house is haunted after moving again from that house they still find strange things happening and they find out its their son thats haunted not the housethis movie was just retardedlike actually one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of bad ones in my day this whole movie is just laughable dont watch this movie unless your like 8 years old then you might be scared,astonish
holy moly thats one scary movie not the best acting and especially lin shaye is difficult to take serious after all her appearances in farrelly movies but still a great horror movie its scary in the same way as the ring the concept of the further is a bit weird but perhaps they had to invent something new so it wouldnt be a complete ripoff off poltergeistconclusion watch it if you like movies like the ring but make sure all doors are locked and alarms are set perhaps some clean underwear i was scared many times throughout the movie and consider this movie one of the best horror movies in a long time,astonish
i was not prepared for thisafter a long long time im freaked out this muchjust finished watching this movie n now i cant move from my bedim literary afraid to look right i feel something is watching me and if i look right i will have eye contact with iti have to pee really badly but im waiting for sun to rise firstit didnt had any vulgar scenes any hot chick or anything that usual horror movies does but did the jobit didnt even have those loud noises that will make your head dizzy after hours instead it has a freaky environment which will haunt you at least a day or two i dont think it will be easier for me to forget about the things this movie opened in my mind,astonish
id say this was a pretty decent movie it had its moments where you were jumping around and waiting for things to happen and they never did which is really greatthe end was really goodid see it if you want to get scared a little and need to think about it a bitthis movie was the best i have ever seen in my life i have seen a lot of horror films and this one was the best one so far i would recommend this movie to scare the crap out of your children  if you just want to hang out with your buds you and your friends can go and rent this movie and you can scare your friends,astonish
a must see for horror fans i forgot how this gem of a movie did but i do recall some film critics hating on it so i didnt run out to see it now i wish i have the story has an interesting storyline that is a bit recycled but the direction details and flow of this movie give you something that has been missing for these types of movies which is the shock factor so much shock factor and it is so well done i thought the shock factor in these ghostelserealms was gone with the 80s but here we see all that goodness back and very much welcomed it is hard to pull off the shock factor in a non slasher movie but they do it here now when i saw the storyline is a bit recycled dont let that fool you im talking in a general sense because youll watch it and see that the story is original but it does barrow elements but what movie doesnt nowadays dont get me wrong it is a great horror movie and im surprised hollywood still remembers how to make themsee this now with the lights off,astonish
this is certainly not for horror fans of the slasher genre as there is no gore in this movie and for this reason a lot of horror fans have unfortunately slated this otherwise superb film as a horror fan myself for nearly 40 years i was pleasantly surprised by this genuinely creepy and sometimes spooky sinister movie yes it has a lot of ideas that have worked for some of the classics like poltergeist but i feel it moulds them together to deliver an excellent adrenalin fuelled ride for those of us who enjoy a refreshing take of a modern day horror movie sadly there aint too many these days that dont resort to buckets of tomato sauce and various body parts rejected from the butchers or fishmongers this is one of the very few movies that does not rely on the said stuff in brackets to bring a racing pulse and sweaty palmswell for me anyway i found myself creep ed out in such a way it was almost too compelling to watch in parts so if you like a creepy movie that is not a slashfest then this maybe the film for you just turn the light off light a few candles and enjoy as a side note and i noticed some others mentioned this too the overly noisy bangs in the film meant to make you jump do get annoying this is my only criticism but most films these days modern ones rely on overly noisy bangs do they not also i think the pg 13 rating is spot on younger children would be a little too freaked by this i think but because of its no gore value older children may enjoy this too all in all i feel this will appeal to real old school horror fans like myself who were brought up on hammer horrorthe only thing missing was a hammer babe the mum in this is a little too thin for that title but overall i loved this movie,astonish
i usually dont watch socalled scary movies because wellthey arent very scary to me so the scary moments in this film are the typical boo loud sound yeah i jumped several timesacting was blah especially from the husband guy its like they filmed his rehearsal pretty much emotionlesseven in scenes that demanded emotion the wife and children acted fairly well thoughthe story flows fairly well theres not much character buildingas its not really needed in this film some scenes leave you scratching your head afterward what was the point there you ask yourselfas many previous reviews mentionthe film starts off well and then kinda nosedives not a total explosive wreckbut a crummy rough landing with some minor injuriessotospeak,astonish
truly awful incoherent story line grainy unimaginative cinematoraphy thunerstorm loop for a sound track extremely poor acting  in general no redeeming reasons to torture yourself by viewing that is unless youre into guys in their underwear writhing in bed while rubbing their chests  the blooper reel however was half interesting since it showed how awful the actors really were although the movie is put out by cult films it has no hope of attaining a cult film status rent anything elsemuch worse than i thought it would be and that was pretty bad the only reason i gave it 2 stars was the boys were extra fine but the script needed much help it was a disaster mr wan you let me down on this one i am a big supporter but this one failed miserably 2 stars dont waste your time unless you like to see straight boys in their shorts bad one,astonish
i started lmao when the old lady spirtualist mentioned astral projection its a great way for people who do not have a life to live i was thinking this was a great creepy b movie before that and could accept the two ghostbusters but i started laughing so hard my sides hurt when the old lady put on the gas mask with the long nozzle my bloody valentine it was great comic relief then we had that awesome seance scene which led to the raw meat on whannell and dalton battling darth of star wars there was even the two girls from the shining tossed in and the ghost family looked like the night of the living dead was that linda blair as the old bride i finally got the joke there probably were some other references that i missed like freddys glove and jason voorhees hockey mask this movie was absolutely hilarious it was an enjoyable thrill ride of a movie because of the satire,astonish
is one of the most scary movies i have ever seen before watching this movie the grudge the ring and dead silence scared the hell out of me but this movie totally freaked me out thats why i give it such a high rating ive seen a lot of horrormovies but i dont think i want to see this one again or maybe in clear daylight lol after seeing this movie ive noticed it was directed also by james wan just like dead silence this man seems to know exactly how to keep the audience in fear the entire movie the way it was filmed the unexpected moments of terror and the very creepy images makes you jump from your seat well done,astonish
ive been hearing praise towards this movie all year long and since this october 2011 has been a rather stale halloween season for newly released horror films i decided it was time to see for myself im glad i finally did is a phenomenal new horror film that starts off as an all too familiar haunted house tale but then quickly takes the viewer on a very creative and unique journey the cinematography is brilliant full of dark narrow hallways with clocks winding staircases and shadows lurking in the corner the sound effects are spine tingling and the eerie violin shrieks and mellow gongs from the musical score perfectly set the mood the acting is also very good for a horror filma quick plot summary is about a young family who moves into a creepy old house an incident in the attic causes their eldest son to fall dormant in a comalike state strange occurrences and hauntings begin to take place forcing the family to leave and move into a new home where the hauntings continue to happen a psychic reveals to them that their son is the cause and that ghosts and demons are trying to get into his body to bring pain towards othersnow i must admit did not scare me as much as i thought it would but it certainly has some very creepy moments and is up there with some of the scarier movies ive seen in my life for one that red demonic creature is terrifying  especially the first time it appears in broad daylight behind the grandmother who is describing her dream nowhere is safe now i wasnt expecting it at all and the special effects team did a frighteningly good job on its features hoofs and all thats when i realized that this horror film was for real the rest of the film left me tensed and waiting for that thing to appear again i should mention that one of its later appearances was a very cool scene that reminded me of freddy from nightmare on elm street the demon is sharpening its claws in a chilling red sanctuaryaside from that the atmosphere of both the houses creates very uneasy environments and works well in the film the sance scene was really adrenaline inducing as well and is a great example of how well this film worked to create fear without being overly gory and violent in this scene one of the paranormal investigators is writing really disgusting things on paper that the demon is apparently saying this allows the viewers imagination to run rampant another notable part of this movie is the hellish journey the father must take at the end in order to save his son this mindbending quest allowed the filmmakers the freedom to do anything in order to make sure we the viewers would not sleep at night it also breaks the rules of reality putting the viewer even more on edge to the fact that heshe has no idea what to expect anymore this was brilliant story writing and filmmaking for all the praise i have given i took some points off primarily because some of the plot line was pretty farout there the fact that the kid has the gift to allow his spirit to travel out of this world when he sleeps was slightly vague can that kid ever sleep sound again also the ending although it was a good twist could have been a bit better i still dont really know how the father and creepy demon lady got switched around or what really was going on as they were facing each other down at the climax so a couple vague plot elements but overall they can be easily overlooked to allow for an enjoyable film experiencein conclusion is a spectacular new horror movie that stands out from many of the rest im excited to say that james wan is finally beginning to establish himself as one of the great new horror directors of film having done dead silence and of course saw,astonish
the main spook looks like darth maul from star wars episode 1 lol i half expected yoda to show up and take him to school wheres obi wan this movie was pathetic people rave about this junk but i dont see what all the fuss is about someone in a review claimed they felt like they were a child watching the exorcist how dare you compare this overdone sorry excuse for a film to the exorcist give me a breakthe idiot kid who of course has no idea what he is doing astrally projects himself into the spook world and of course because hes an idiot he cant returnso the dad goes after his son to save him and he has to battle his way through scores of demons and spooks trying to take over his the dad body even though he somehow manages to escape all of them predictably the one ghost who knew him as a child successfully beats him back to the house and takes him over oh no the terror predictable and lameand the main spook plays the organ or something loldont waste your time,astonish
i never really wanted to buy the dvd i was looking for the expendables but the video store had none so i bought a dvd of due to the disappointment i experienced i readied myself for an extremely cheesy horror film although my friend said this was very scary i dismissed that thought for a while well what do you know this movie is not scaryit is terrifying to be extremely honest i cant remember the last time i watched a movie and felt so horrified think paranormal activity and youd expect jump scares this movie thinks disturbing superdisturbing images think saw and youd expect even at least one gore scene there wasnt any this movie thinks of turning the otherwise mundane lambert familys life into a shock fest chockfull of spooky guitar strings and smiling corpses and dont think youll be limited to a single apparition this movie thinks a whole dimension of lost souls craving for life add a very disturbing demon and youre more than sold the plot is unique to me at least i dont know how many movies have this plot if there are anyand the ending was a total shock that when i thought i saw what was coming the movie twists the whole thing around and makes you rethink what the hell just happenedthis wasnt a movie this was a masterpiece in horror promise every second is a delightfully terrifying treat1010 i would have put 1110 but the system wont let me,astonish
this was a very silly movie very disappointing almost unwatchablebarbara hershey was previously in a better moviethe entitywatch that one insteadbegan promising enough then the movie just went completely off the rails im all for suspension of disbeliefbut really anyone who says this one of scariest movies in years is more disturbed than the filmmakers responsible for this messi would rather have seen saw 16 again without revealing r revealing to much  it wasnt so much the story as execution the demons were just sillynot scary at all however for everyone who loved the filmthe ending made a sequel possible,astonish
a really big waste of time really don t bother watch this movieexcept if ure 13 scenario is awful and really boring acting performance are really low i really wonder how they could have such a good actress doing such a poor performance effect are like they are coming from a 80s movie it s this kind of movies where you wait and wait and wait and u keep saying yourself it can t be that bad something will happen and i ll change my mind about but it never come and in the end u really feel that u wasted your time and it let you believe in the end that there could be a 2 in the way please producer let it go a very big deception,astonish
honestly i didnt think it was original at all because it felt like an unofficial remake of poltergeist its basically the same plotspoilers spoilers poltergeist a little girl disappears into limbo after paranormal activity at the house the parents ask a team of paranormal researchers comprising of an old eccentric lady who is a medium and two younger male assistants for help the little girl is in danger as all the ghosts in the netherworld are attracted to her so is the beast who wants to use her to cross over into our world the mom with the help of the medium crosses over to the other side and brings her daughter back all seems well but then all hell breaks loose in a spectacular ending that sees the ghosts take over the housesounds familiar a little boy disappears into limbo after paranormal activity at the house the parents ask a team of paranormal researchers comprising of an old eccentric lady who is a medium and two younger male assistants for help the little boy is in danger as all the ghosts in the netherworld are attracted to him so is a demon who wants to use him to cross over into our world the dad with the help of the medium crosses over to the other side and brings his son back all seems well but then all hell breaks loose in a spectacular ending that sees the ghosts take over the houseof course there are many differences between both films but as you can see its basically the same story i thought the first hour was great then it became ridiculous and other the top poltergeist is much better in my opinion that was the original one,astonish
malaysian born james wan is most respected by me for coming up with the whole idea for saw along with leigh whanell regardless of this achievement james wan has not been in the movie scene with prominent presence but still to be a name in this industry it takes a good number of years after all tom cruise is yet to receive an oscar so james wan has hope will this contribute to his career well firstly return on investment on the movie was over tenfold with comparison to its budget so i guess he is doing good and his directorial is amazing and is guaranteed to turn your blood cold and send those shivers through you quite a many times a very ingenious directorial and a fabulous and innovative story line almost makes me want to use the word epic however i will save it for a better movie i watch at least 8 movies in a busy week and i have more movie titles in my movie library than a normal person should have and i have not missed out on many movies especially horror since its my favorite of genres i can confidently say i have never heard of a plot as is discussed in this movie unfortunately i am unable reveal any due to the respect of the spoilersjosh patrick wilson and renai lambert rose byrne are just settling in after a move and is getting used to their new house unpacking of boxes and looking after 3 kids is not an easy task for renai since she gets quite little support from her husband as he is caught up with most of his work a house by my opinion which is much bigger than what a normal family would need they have got it so as i was saying settling in is a great challenge for especially when things seem to be moving around on its own quite inconvenient dont you think as a housewife all renai does is look after the 3 kids during the day and when she does have some free time to unwind on the family piano playing and composing some tunes of her own everything was as boring as it could be for a housewife until the baby monitor picks up a whisper baby monitors pick up a lot of static i can assure you this was no static yet there was no one at the other end of the baby monitor either what was that whats a prerequisite for a haunted house yes youre right an attic or a basement ladies and gentleman we have got an attic dalton ty simpkins stumbles up this attic whilst playing and have an accident he falls off the ladder trying to reach for the ceiling light he must be quite weak kid since the next morning he is in a coma why am i not surprised the doctors are unable to diagnose whats wrong with dalton since he seems to be perfectly normal for a person who is in a coma now are you thinking of watching the movie you will never know how good this movie is and how scary it can get until you try it out patrick wilson and rose byrne put up a great show i think rose byrne is the reason for the movie to be successful she convinced me that having an attic or a basement is a bad idea i am feeling very fortunate that real estate is ridiculously overpriced i am glad i cant afford a proper house for all your thrill seekers who love to selfinflict fear and deliberately lose sleep over a movie and to who enjoys developing complexities and who thoroughly loves to live life the way its not supposed to be lived set some time aside rent or download a decent copy blu ray copies are out on the web so be wise in your selections respect the genre watch it the way it was intended to watch and you will be pale in the endtitle directed by james wan starring patrick wilson  rose byrne rated rated pg13 for thematic material violence terror and frightening images and brief strong language rating 0710 103 minutes,astonish
alright lets start with the good things first 50 min of this movie is actually pretty good and creepy i was impressed how can they still do this scary movies nowadays and without masses of blood weird things happen you think you saw someone but did you actually see it after all who or what are they voices this movie really had potential to be one of the best films of the last decadethen it happened like my friend said to me this astrobh appeared after she came in rest of the film turned to be pure st first think what the heck then you think again then you start laughing and you continue it to end of the filmive been thinking about this is it just because in hollywood films there just has to be some kind of explanation of course some films need it but then does it really have to be this stupid astroreality or whateverwhat a stupid ideai strongly recommend to watch this film as long as astrolady appears then you can change a movie and enjoy that you dont know how it ends because i can only say that it sucks,astonish
in strange happenings and frightening occurrences lead a family to believe that their new home is haunted especially after a tragedy befalls one of their members and the ghostly presences seem to become strongeris definitely scary id challenge anyone to watch it alone at night and not be freaked out by it the first half will probably meet the approval of nearly any horror fan it takes time to build atmosphere and establish the characters while still offering more than enough scaresthe second part may be more divisive though the story goes in a fairly original direction and i wouldnt be surprised if some people were put off by the shift in tone i didnt find it that difficult to adjust to though i did think the former half was more frightening and satisfying than the latter i just thought id offer a warning that how the movie starts is fairly different from how it endsgreat finale though even if it wasnt totally unexpected overall this is a more than solid horror movie and i recommend it,astonish
spoiler free review is one of those horror movies that come once every year or so that ends up to be very creepy but not in the sense that there is blood flying everywhere but in the sense that there are unexpected images creepy music and characters you actually give a crap for your typical horror movie from the past 1015 years relies on showing blood not creepy sounds or other things that makes a film scary the movie follows a married couple josh and renai with 3 kids one being a baby the second kid being about 6 and the third kid named dalton being about 7 or 8 they live in a very expensivelooking house dalton gets into a coma after an accident in the house im not going to spoil anything but some seriously creepy crap happens around the house and theyre so scared that they move to another house to get rid of the things going onso they have moved and the creepy things continue to take place joshs mother has heard about this so she calls a physic named elise who brings 2 people who reminded me of the ghostbusters they come and see whats going on and the woman tells them that its not these 2 houses that are haunted its their son dalton whos haunted no this movie is not incredibly original this movie is almost like poltergeist except the kid is haunted not the house as unoriginal and clich as the film is i still did enjoy it a lot patrick wilson josh is very good here so is rose byrne they give very good and believable performances the rest of the cast is solid toothis movie is being said as the scariest film since the exorcist is that true no not to me its not the creepiest film of the decade or really anything like that but it is scary dont get me wrong the score is so creepy and fantastic and really sets the movies mood right awaydoesnt use much cgi i only remember 2 times where it used it a lot of horror movies use cgi for the monsters uses these these things that look almost like a mix of the joker and ozzy osbourne or just grandmas with creepy makeup and that stuff is actually pretty effective and is scaryjames wan whos the director of the first saw movie which is the film that generally agree is the best of that series directs this film he is a director that can really scare you with or without blood he does a great job managing to make this movie feel like an old classic horror movie with good scares and good writing this film has a great ending one of the best in a whilealthough this is a very good horror film the problem with it is that as it grows more insane so does the dialogue not in a good way the movies dialogue grows very weak and hokey in the last 2025 minutes of the film it really did start to bother meoverall is a very fun film yet its not flawless810 or 8510,astonish
i have seen many scary movies none of which seemed to leave me with a slightest chill however when i went to a late showing of this with a couple guy friends i found myself squeezing their hands as they did the same to me and jumping out of my seat literally screaming more than once my friends were freaked out too actually hiding behind me at some points and they arent easily scared once this movie was over it made you watch your back long into the night safe at home i watched this movie once more at a friends house and find myself still jumping and spilling popcorn all over the couch at one point i plan to watch this again with another friend and anticipate a few more jumps all and all a very amazing movie,astonish
its a very good film very different kind of horror film from all other movies nice story nice shots its new trend for horror films we will enter to spiritual world very good scary moviei missed charlie clouser music but still this movie is awesome music is really goodthe evil is well designed i really want 2 if you like james wans dead silence saw and the orphanage watch thiswatch with high volume you will definitely enjoywatch and comment about the movie ,astonish
scary stuff i dont know which was scarier the supernatural chills or the fact that you can make a movie on a very low budget gross three times that amount back and still make a film that is far better and more interesting filmmaking than a lot of the large budget cgi crapfilms should be produced more economically i hate hate huge unnecessary expenditures in films and half the movies made dont really require or justify the budgets they have and horror films in particular are often scarier without all the corny overblown cgi fxa lot of the ghostly creeps here are fairly disturbing i was surprised at how many clichs from other horror films this movie could squeeze and still use them effectively and with a much lower film budget than those films the elements from movies like poltergiest the exorcist peter jacksons the frighteners are familiar but they have effective impact and seem different and original when applied with the lower budgeti thought patrick wilson was a very good sport to support low budget filmmaking since he is obviously in more demand than this wilsons performance is hardly the caliber of the amazing hard candy its not even phantom of the opera but its good enough to be involvingthis is also one of those movies that people will predictably trash because of its low budget you know the type of viewer that thinks they are not being indulged enough unless someone attempts to sink themselves financially in order to please their pampered viewing needsthis is also one of those scary horror flicks that will probably disturb the viewer more if watched alone after dark everything is always easier to take and less scary if you watch it with a audience but im not sure anyone should do that especially if you are superstitious about demons or exorcismscary stuff i personally would like to see more fantasy movies like this that are unassuming and produced modestly it leads to more interesting results,astonish
you want to know whats scary unexpectedly seeing a really scary face and at the same time hearing a really loud musical cue im being dead serious  its jarring as heck the makers of have taken this simple premise and crafted an entire film around it not only do they understand the formula scary face  loud music cue  fright they understand how to space these jolts out over a 90 minute film so that the effect doesnt diminish they have done this and only this it is enough for a 6 out of 10 because so few movies know how to actually scare you but dont kid yourself into thinking it makes it a great or even a good film without those jolts whats left is a genuinely silly film with an overwrought score unlikeable leads and some highly sad effects ie smoke machines,astonish
from the moment i saw the trailer i was pretty much into it as it looked scary moreover james wan is the one directing which makes it a must well frankly this was a lowdown from dead silence for me wan is the person who cleverly places a brilliant twist in the end which makes the movie being rated higher its not quite the same thing here initially the moment movie starts youre gonna get a hint that this is gonna be scary as hell the music the makeups everything adds to the creepy scenario actually its scary in places and you might get jumpy however towards the later part of the movie it feels stupid scriptwise i guess they needed a better script the direction is in his own style again some humor have also been added which makes it more creepy it could have been much better thats what i feel anyways as the matter of fact its definitely gonna scare you no matter what so go for it,astonish
not good at writing reviews so i usually just vote and approvedisapprove others reviews however i felt the want to make mention on this movie the first good horror movie i have seen in at least 6 years or so all modern horror movies seem to want to throw blood and gore in every scene so much so it just disgusts youunless there is something wrong upstairs i have no clue why modern writersdirectors have to throw that crap in its just not scarythis is a good movie that takes horror a bit back to the roots stuff that actually makes you jump and keeps you on the edge of your seat having said all this i give it a 810 because the ending was horrible not going to say anything else but they could have taken it in a much better directionthe last 15 minutes or so of the movie the rest of the movie more than made up for that though and dont feel like i wasted time or money on it,astonish
i just dont understand why people are writing such bad reviews of this movie i was shaking on the edge of my seat the whole time genuinely creeped out i am not easily scared and i found paranormal activity to be quite hokey looking like it was filmed by a teenager i think it was one of the better haunted house type movies in the horror genre i think my mom almost had a heart attack a few times throughout the film and she eventually had to leave because she was beside herself if you go see this movie odds are its going to scare you if not maybe youre just not letting yourself be scared it has the feel that it has been influenced by some other horror movies from the past but it makes itself unique in many ways as well this movie will ensure no sleep for a few days go see it,astonish
i debated actually giving this movie a 5 because the first half of the film is very promising it delivers chills suspense and scares but the resolution is just too disappointing and flimsythe movie starts out as any other haunting movie things moving around noises strange occurrences the pace is set forth and you feel the tension buildingthen the plot takes a turn and the movie suddenly becomes a comedy everything from the banter between the paranormal investigators to the extremely comical costumes and makeup for all the bad guys i think the main turning point for me was seeing a ghost dancing to tiptoe through the tulips  ooooh scary then when you finally meet the demon with the fire face its a guy in red tights with a kiss makeup job and if that isnt enough he is upstairs in his lair listening to that same eversoscary tiny tim song the entire movie just turns into a bad playthrow into the mix an overdramatic psychic suppressed memories bad scenery and a number of omgpleasebeover moments and you get a movie that is very fortunate to even get a 2 out of 10,astonish
this was actually entertaining the soundtrack essentially drove the film you would probably loose interest within minutes of watching the film without the soundtrack but i think most horror films are driven by the screeching sounds there are all kinds of moments when you can assume something might happen  but the catch is that you arent really sure what that might beor when it will be the screech or metal bang suddenly comes and i most times twitchedthe people props and environment inside the further are somewhat corny however for an idea that is so far out there and unrealistic i thought they did a pretty good job making this place hellpatrick wilsons character seemed a little dry to me  rose byrne seemed to have more emotion when emotion was needed but rose experiences much more in the beginning of the film then patricks character i suppose they are reacting equally to the amount of emotion they are put through i personally loved rose byrns role in this  it was very believable she played another great role in 28 weeks later as well there was a specific difference when a great actress was paired with an okay actor but they both interacted well which is essential for a believable couplei am not a fan of most horror films but i did enjoy this one,astonish
i have been a horror movie buff my entire life this movie stands head and shoulders over any i have seen in the last 10 years i was actually scared which is no small accomplishment for someone as conditioned to horror flicks as i am there are so many little surprises throughout the film that literally had me jumping in my seat i highly recommend this movie to anyone and as soon as i can i intend to buy it this is one movie to be watched over and over great for a scary movie night with friends yes it does have a few predictable points but this does not detract from the movie at all i found the plot concept both new  incredibly interesting simply awesome,astonish
when it comes to a horror film for me 1000 pm in the basement lights out headphones on volume cranked full screen and i say to myself lets do this no not really but yeah by the time i finished this film i had some wetness in my pants and was shaking like crazy this film is insanely scary to no end they may be mostly jump scares but some psychological stuff is thrown in also and the jump scares fuel them making them 10x more scarierthe films dark atmosphere and beautiful and scary music score fuels it into each scene preparing you for the worst then hits you where you least expect it boom jump scare a psychological one here and there but yeah not much else but jumpers but thats still fine theres nothing wrong with them now a days psychologically scaring someone is almost impossible so what other choice do directors have but this one found a way to make it work quite a clever maneuversome dont like jumpers and thats fine but in this film its an exception no question because the jump scares dont just scare the ever living st out of you but they make the more psychological scares scarier than usual youll know what i mean when you see itmost modern day horror films dont fit the bill of scariness such as paranormal activity but films such as this and disturbia it works like a charm when i first heard of this i thought it would just be another stupid horror film thinking it was scary and just had pointless bull crap in it but instead i got something different i got a horror film and a director actually trying and succeedingthis film was simply nonstop scary and in terms of horror films that means its good the scarier the better and for this film it couldnt be scarier so it couldnt be better scariest film ever,astonish
if you have seen poltergeist and enjoyed it you should enjoy this one as well it seems clear to me they used poltergeist as a frame work for this movie it even has a psychicparanormal expert with two side kicks to track paranormal activity the movie is scary enough although i watched it during the day at home on dvd with the blinds down it has a jump factor and i love the addition and the fact that they show you the main demon really creepy the ending left me with some obvious questions and clearly appears to be setup for a sequel i very much hope they do make one and that its as good or better than this one if i can be critical for a moment the movie felt a little shallow and quick to me and somewhat of a rip off of poltergeist however all that being said its very enjoyable and worth watching if you are a horror fan or want to get your blood going,astonish
james wan and leigh whannell have come a long way since they singlehandedly set the so called torture pornmovement in motion with saw  a brilliant thriller that only got its bad reputation from its countless lukewarm sequels already their second attempt at horror dead silence was a complete uturn relying more on shocks than on grossout violence the story involving evil dolls and a creepy old lady that kills you if you scream was a masterful combination of known but modernized horror stereotypes much like dead silence also treads on wellknown territory its a classic haunted house flick with many references to the haunted the entity and poltergeist actually its little more than a mashup of those three movies and that is part of many problemsbut first things first the movie is builtup very well its a relief to see wan and whannell move even further away from explicit shock value towards mood and atmosphere this development may not have been their decision entirely people generally seem to be fed up with gore and the success of paranormal activity has reopened the shrieking door for subtle horror that relies on objects moving by themselves more than anything else that is exactly the kind of scares that displays in its first half the creepiness is underlined throughout by great sound editing and clever camera movements that keep things interestingthe problems arise when follows through on its promise in the second half the movie isnt as ballsy as the haunting was by relying solely on suggestion when we actually get to see the otherworldly figures that terrorize the family they are not scary at all up until the typical wanwhannell ending plays almost like a grim fairy tale for children in some scenes the tension falls apart completely for instance when patrick wilson suddenly has a fist fight with a guy in white makeup or when we learn that the main villain looks like a mixture of darth maul the darkness from legend and freddy krueger the story itself is not too logical and as mentioned above very very derivative of other better movies from the general hauntingfeel and plot devices lifted directly from poltergeist scary trees in front of the window something creeping up from under the bed a team of scientists with a female medium entering the scene people crossing over into another realm up to the minor twist that this isnt actually a haunted house movie but a haunted person movie which is taken directly from 1982s the entity which incidentally also starred barbara hershey has almost no original ideasin the end wan and whannell have made a movie that will scare the living crap out of children and people who are not watching many horror movies hardboiled audiences however have seen this before and will get bored soon still its not a bad flick at all it definitely shows signs that wan and whannell are moving forward as filmmakers and are at the forefront of worthy modern horror directors and writers,astonish
let me start off by saying there are too too many poor horror movies made the one word titled monster movies filled with gore were too much thank god for this movie had little blood you know a horror movie is good when it can scare you without splattering blood and entrails everywhere i will explain now why i think is the best horror movie i think of all timefirst off i do not scare easily i just cant when this movie was over the smallest crack or whistle made waves of goosebumps run down my arms second i jumped more than a ditsy schoolgirl with a jumprope third the camera angles and quick jolts of subliminal faces and shadowy figures were a blast by the end of it my heart was pounding my arms were trembling and i was begging for the movie to continue characters protagonist and even antagonistic were sublime and the tension the movie built made this movie absolute fun i give this movie a 9 out of 10 for an unresolved absence of a character during the second half of the movie it never answered that but my friend had to bring that up i was too in love with the beginning middle and end of this movie and i have never been this scared in my life im sleeping with the lights on for a while other than that see this movie if you enjoy jumping and freaking out but having fun at the same time this movie is for you,astonish
off topic im going to be quick here when i was a kid 7 years oldand accidentally watched alone at night the movie shining i was so scared that i went to bed really in shock and as near to the walls as i could but even though i couldnt stopped watching it im saying it just for you to know how much i love horror and i watched more then 500 and that my favorite of all time is shiningif you watched shining im pretty sure you will like this one im no movie specialist but i guaranty you that your heart will go like 200bps specially on the third part of the movie that i wasnt expecting it so if you like ghost movies getting scared just by watching people staring smiling with a creepy face at youthis is the one i wasnt expecting a movie this good on these days but finally someone likes old school ghost movies as much i do and wasnt afraid to take a shot in the dark for me it was bullseye,astonish
usually all pg13 movies that are supposed to be scary turn out to be pretty lame and i am a person who isnt really scared that easily but this movie was great it made me jump several times i was even scared to go to the bathroom this was better than a lot of those r rated movies and parents dont hesitate to let your teens watch they use very minor profanity in this movie i am looking forward to 2 i really hope they have one  this is now one of my favorite movies i adored the plot this is one of those movies that you probably dont want to watch alone unless youre looking for a scare but its very interesting your eyes will be glued to the screen the entire time get your popcorn ready and put this bad boy into the dvd player,astonish
i bet youre the kind of person who goes to a magic show and sits there going there see how he did that you have no imagination much less any ability to suspend belief which is required by most horror movies these days  and i said horror not the typical slash and gore crap that you probably call horrorwith notable exceptions this is a well made suspense movie thats sure to keep you creeped out i started watching it at night then resorted to a daytime viewing it was just weirding me out too much to watch alone at nightthe scariest parts happened in the house not the fatherson episode near the end and the ending is completely out of left field freaked me out,astonish
id advise any prospective watchers to stop reading reviews dim the lights and buy this movie with no further questions you may not want to watch it alone howeverwas an excellent movie and from many angles  at first it was actually heartwarming which builds your emotional investment in the family theyre a small family and they have their issues but theyre looking up and things are getting better quickly however things start going wrong and the scares are more disturbing than anything  gore is never used and blood only in minor ways this movie uses suspense mostly as a scare tactic one thing that stood out to me was the nature of the ghosts themselves  i dont want to ruin anything but the ghosts seem unusually tangible for a horror film theyre absolutely solid as in theyre not translucent or vague in any way and one of the most stressful for lack of a better word aspects for me was how they had a tendency to remain oncamera occasionally rather than popping in and out for shock value to wrap this up was also a funny movie at times but without trivializing the dark and dramatic nature of the story and it was certainly scaryas for that the scariness thats definitely why i added watch with a friend to the title im not exactly easily scared by horror movies even though i sometimes wish i were but this ones truly different i know that sounds corny but really its true this is one of those movies that will have you checking corners like a swat team come night actually when the movie wrapped up i thought i was fine it wasnt until i diverted my eyes from the screen and realized that i was in the middle of a big dark room with numerous open closet doors and hallways and corners all alone that i started to panic so seriously it may be a good idea not to watch this alone unless you like that trickling panic that sets in and makes you damn near hallucinate just a warning take it or leave it,astonish
this is not your ordinary runofthemill supernatural thriller no this movie is more of a supernatural spine tingleer i didnt jump i didnt scream nor did i grip the edge of my seat i simply tingled at every scare tactic and gnawed my fingernails down to the quick if you are planning to see this movie prepare yourself for something a little different perhaps even lower your expectations some moments will seem cheesy but they are perfectly cheesy perfectly as far as performances go they werent the best ive ever seen but what this movie lacked in performance was more than made up for by execution it seemed as though someone took the same dusty old formula for a ghost story and added more depth to it making for a great movie experience turn the lights off and crank your speakers to 10 because not only are the visual aspects bone chilling at times the sound alone could rattle your senses dull,astonish
i was expecting to be absolutely terrified by this film after reading many of the reviews on here i am a huge horror fan and love to be scared love eerie films such as the original grudge the ring the others drag me to hell and love being made to jump so from that point of view i was very disappointed by this filmi actually found the film pretty enjoyable good fun and very amusing but not sure that was entirely the intention of the film makers the acting was fairly ropey especially from patrick wilson who ive not seen in anything else so not sure if hes a sound actor usually i love rose byrne and she certainly did her best with the material but why do characters in horror films always act in such an unrealistic and nonsensical way would you be able to nod off to sleep quite happily on your own the night after witnessing very obvious signs of a haunting in your house i sure wouldntmy husband and i are normally both very jumpy but neither of us jumped very much at all during this film i did feel that the tension was built up quite well and loved the music but felt that the scares never really came to anything maybe if id watched it at home on my own at night it wouldve seemed scary but in the cinema surrounded by other people i wasnt remotely scared i thought the story line was fairly good and it did maintain my interest but it just wasnt the scare fest i thought it would be,astonish
the plot was ok but really when it hits dvd it will be a total snore couldve been better pretty weak and the jump scenes were a joke i laughed more than anything because the characters are horrible supernatural has much better demons and boogie men the movie looked old like it was filmed in the 80s and while all the kiddies in the movie jumped and screamed nobody left there truly scaredor excited about seeing a quality movie for hardcore horror movie fans this movie is a definite no rite was much better and its jump scenes actually did make me jump reallllllly disappointed kinda angry that i paid for 4 people to go see this movie not worth the money or time rethink it unless ya just dont care about your time or money,astonish
is the newest film from duo james wan director and leigh whannell writeractor who were made infamous by their first film saw except this time instead of starting a subgenre theyre paying homage to another the haunted house genre which includes films such as the amityville horror and house on haunted hill now as much as i like campy little tribute pictures like brutal massacre or grindhouse i usually dont consider them great movies the reason as fun as it is to revisit a genre that is otherwise dead and gone these movies dont really bring anything new to the table that being said was a delightful surpriseit keeps its heart close to home with the classics but is totally original in both its execution and plot now you may think youve seen this movie before  quick shots of people walking by doorways turns out a brutal multiplehomicide took place there years before blah blah blah  but i assure you youre wrong the film does have some aspects of familiarity to them theres no denying that but it also has a refreshing edge that most recent horror films dont have one of these things is that earns its scares yes it does have the quick shots of things appearing and disappearing loud noises and all that jazz but it also has a shocking number of scenes that rely on buildup and legitimately creepy circumstances instead of the popout scares that were all so familiar withunfortunately though isnt consistent for every brilliant scene that is beautifully done there are at least 34 that either dont make a whole lot of sense or are the cheap popout style scares also the big reveal into whats going on in this movie was good but it also missed the mark slightly other scenes were carried out a bit too long and got a bit too ridiculous one can see where they were trying to go with it but it just didnt come out that greatit is unfortunate that this movie wasnt better received they came so close to being a notable force in the horror genre which is so desperately needed right now in main stream cinema and personally i think james and leigh would fit the bill wonderfully because they have something that very few people dont heart and theyve got a ton of it,astonish
maybe the title of my review is an exaggeration but its really how i felt after watching this filmit starts very climatic and the story is simple yet solid solid is a good word to describe the first half of the film it may resemble many other horrors from the past but it did well in telling its own story at its own pace maybe it wasnt an icon to the most scary is what you dont see philosophy but it did well unfortunately something broke down along the waysuch a great potential to make a good horror in the era of torture porn trash thrown away by the creators that gave up to the urge to show more not only they shown too much they cant even show it properly,astonish
hollywood horror films draw from a grab bag of assorted halloween party favors but amidst all the cheap plastic spider rings director james wan inserts a tarantula or two for good measure his latest takes a seewhatsticks approach that can sometimes be as frustrating as it is refreshing but in a cinematic climate where scary movies are becoming an increasingly onrails experience every goose bump is worth its weight in gold and i imagine it adds uphas plenty of genuinely chilling moments and makes better than average use of the oft maligned jump scare the technique doesnt always deliver the desired impact but that such instances are uneven in effectiveness is in a way an incredible asset emotionally were on our toes wan puts convention in a blender and the audience is often left reeling from the topsyturvy inertia that familiar horror guardrail is gone and were left groping in the darktaking a page from sam raimi not to mention title work more than a little reminiscent of his 2009 flick drag me to hell wan keeps us offbalance with unpredictable emotionality not every bizzaro changeup he pitches lands squarely in the strike zonea bumbling pair of paranormal investigators falls flat on the comedy frontbut by constantly upsetting our expectations picks a cerebral scab and burrows under our skin a particularly inspired and disorienting soundtrack choice is the use of tiny tims tiptoe through the tulips proving perhaps definitively that nothing is more terrifying than a ukulelelittle unconventional details help too and with credit to saw screen writing veteran leigh whannell makes some subtly interesting choices for once our parental protagonists josh and renai lambert patrick wilson and rose byrne are not the progenitors of an only child creepy kids are a genre staple but by diffusing that clich with siblings whannell opens himself to some lesstraveled roads unfortunately one of his most glaring oversights is underplaying that idea in the inferior second half of the film the other offspring essentially disappearor take for instance the critics aceinthehole why dont they just leave the house like in paranormal activity whannell explicitly explains that the demonic presence is attached to his characters rather than their homestead but they hightail it out of there all the same i cant immediately recall another example of haunted protagonists rationally raising stakes in the middle of the second actit may seem insignificant but it makes a big difference in a genre as delicate as horror where the element of surprise is everything if were comprised entirely of offbeat innovations it would be a perfect film but just as often whannell lets convention get the better of him or he piles on too many subgenreswhat starts off in poltergeist country winds up closer to a nightmare on elm street if you can imagine that the disparate elements clash and complement each other in equal measurespearheaded by wan and whannell the saw franchise pushed horror in a new direction nudges it back inspired by classic seventies spookouts the filmmakers crafted what feels like hollywoods most synonymous effort in years imperfect though it may be there are no hidden camera gimmicks and absent is the also oft maligned torture porn the pair popularized eight years prior instead expect to be treated to the unexpected true the beats and boos are familiar as can be but when jumps the rails its one hell of a ride,astonish
i only give 3 stars because the beginning of the movie showed promise this film was absolutely ridiculous it was like the people from paranormal activity did the first 12  which was pretty good actually had quite beautiful lighting and was kind of scary  and the people from saw did the second 12 which was plain horrible after the initial scary parts in the beginning the only thing that was scary about this film was the loud music and noises the ghosts were so sillylooking and the demon was the stupidest thing ive ever seen he had some shiny facepaint on it was sooooo silly and they used tiny tims tulip song as a creepy song really i mean tiny tim is creepy but that song isnt and when the father enters the demons lair or whatever the hell its supposed to be it looks like the crew went to pier 1 and bought all of the cheesy ugly mediterranean decor they could find and put it in there and then the demon is djing tiny tim and sharpening his nails with the kid chained up in front of the fireplace come on if this was supposed to be funny i wouldnt have cared so much but this was communicated in a serious way i couldnt believe it i knew the movie wasnt going to be great but i didnt think it was going to be that bad but at least i know how to laugh at bad movies and enjoy myselfor else i would have walked out,astonish
i have to say the first half of the film was really good and deserved 1010 the plot cinematography directing sounds and acting were all superb however the movie took a wrong turn in the last half of the film when the whole real story unfolded it became nothing but a cheap lowbudget dvdtype horror film i realized they made this film with about 1 millions also but that wasnt the reason why the film failed in my opinion the script for the last half of the film was just so horrible that it ruined the whole movie the demon looked like nightcrawler from the xmen and other ghosts looked just like those youd find at disneyland haunted mansion ride the makeup was really bad the acting of the ghosts except the demon was worse the scenes in the house where the father was searching for his son were totally videogame like it just made you feel as if the whole thing was shot in a cheap backyard haunted house somewhere it was very disappointing the worst scene in my opinion was when all the ghosts were coming out into the real world it was bad horrible and most of all stupid they walked like zombies everything looked seriously fake and pathetic ghosts trying to come out of a closet anyone the ending was stupid as well any horror fan could have seen that coming miles away it was so predictable and unoriginal i felt cheatedoverall the film is a disappointment my advice is to save your money and go watch an episode of the twilight zone instead,astonish
confuses me not because of the plot which is endlessly spelled out by expositionspewing secondary characters and is all shamelessly lifted from better movies anyway im confused as to how so many people like it a 74 on the imdb a fresh rating on rotten tomatoes and people proclaiming its the scariest thing theyve ever seen has everyone been taking drugs have they forgotten all other horror movies exist i know im not alone in this everyone in the theater with me disliked the film four girls walked out partway through people were laughing at the scary bits and cracking jokes and when the credits started rolling i loudly proclaimed well that sucked the crowd laughed in agreement so what happened was my theater somehow screening a different cut of the movie is everyone else living in an alternate dimension where this is a good movie i have no ideanow onto the plot a family has just moved into a big creepy old house one of the kids falls into a supernatural coma because his spirit is trapped in the realm of the dead and the mother starts seeing visions of ghosts the dad is skeptical at first but eventually cannot deny the truth they move but its the person whos haunted  actually stalked by a demon trying to possess him  and not the house they call in an old lady and her goofy team of supernatural tech experts to bring the kids soul back into the real world whats that you say it sounds exactly like a sloppy cross between poltergeist and paranormal activity well yes thats because it isnothing happens in this movie that isnt incredibly predictable that might be okay if it were done better than most other movies but it isnt  the apparitions are often more goofy than scary theres too much comedic relief dialogue is simplistic and far too expository and the acting never rises above mediocre and is usually somewhat short of that marknear the beginning of the film its shown that family life is tense the parents have three kids and the father a schoolteacher has been staying at work late every night with flimsy excuses that plot point is mentioned once or twice then completely abandoned the two kids who still have souls in their bodies a baby girl and young boy almost completely disappear from the movie at the halfway point and never amount to anything we learn that our female lead is a songwriter near the beginning which is really the only characterization we get and also goes nowhere other than the standard mysteriously moved object scene with some of her sheet music in fact the entire film is almost completely devoid of character developmentthere are some plot points that carry over but this is actually another problem the movie thinks its much more clever than it actually is and also assumes the audience is full of idiots it uses the triedandtrue device of kids drawing out their nightmares and almost every single time we see what inspired the drawing the movie cuts back to that picture in case we forgot about it alreadytheres also a subplot involving a previous possession attempt on another character by a different spirit which is clumsily introduced with more overexpository dialogue and of course leads into the telegraphed twist ending this subplot also makes heavy use of the spirit photography element and feels a lot like shutter or parts of the omentheres even a trek into the otherworld in which a character is sidetracked from his goal when he discovers the origin of two smiling murdered female ghosts who have no real relevance to the plot other than to serve as a sloppy and unnecessary allusion to the shining its implied they may have been killed in the house that the family moved into at the beginning of the film but this is not at all important to any occurrence in the movies storythese girl ghosts are joined by two other standard ghost types who are highlighted amongst all the inhabitants of the netherworld for no apparent reason the creepy guy with a disgustingly malformed tongue and mouth who is required to attempt kissing a character at some point and the playful annoying goofy and unscary little kid spirit whos obligated to play hide and seek with a victimoccasionally something scary will happen  a few scenes build reasonable suspense and there are several cheap jumps but these dont override the failings of the film as a wholemaybe people liked it simply because it reminded them of some of their favorite older horror movies im of the mind that references dont work unless the movie theyre in is good on its own and i didnt find this to be a good movie it wasnt even bad enough to be fun  just 103 minutes of generic disappointing and uninspired horror tropes i suppose im happy for all the people who like it i certainly wish id enjoyed it as much as they did but i cant say i see the value in this movie i didnt think it was offensively bad so perhaps you should take a chance on it since so many others think its great just dont be surprised if you walk away feeling like you wasted your time,astonish
the summary pretty much sums up my thoughts on this remake of so many of the similar genre that have come before thispoltergiest was both funnier and scarier its lead actors had a much better presence than these two and where is the movie making theyre here line even the remake a dud was worth seeing when compared with this entryrosemarys baby had a more believable premise than astral projectioneven some of the bad and there are more in this category than good stephen king film adaptations have better acting scripts and plot twistsi am of the firm belief that the entire genre horror movies needs a disclaimer danger junk science within for sheer schlock entertainment and a way to kill an hour and a half you could do worse but as a way to win your dates heart and more you might do well to listen to her advice and go to that romantic comedy she suggested,astonish
initially i set out to watch this movie because id heard from many many people how scary it was and frankly my goal was to justify my position that they were all wussieswell the joke was on mei was right everyone i know is a chicken this movie is not scary but its also not even remotely entertainingi had hopes id at least enjoy it as ive quite enjoyed some of the previous offerings by wan and whannell now im just angry at wan and whannell for dropping the ball so very very badly i suspect they owe someone money and this is what they did to get itfind below an enumerated list of my major complaints 1 i know nothing is really new anymore but this is basically nothing but poltergeist with astral projection boring2 astral projection seriously come on and the dad being able to do it too how convenient not quite a deux ex machina but close enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth3 while im on astral projection i realize that its difficult to film that concept but seriously walking around in a house thats the least convincing depiction of astral projection anyone has ever come up with seriously horrible did anyone think that was good 4 fist fighting while astrally projecting come on5 contrary to popular belief not all north american audiences are drooling morons and we dont need to see things like the red door and then him flashing back to the drawing of the red door we didnt forget seeing the drawings guys we made the connection also again with the horse i dont like my movies spoon fed to me thanks6 the demon looks like darth maul the only thing scary about darth maul is how many people went to see that other snooze fest of a movie on the big screen including me twice if theyd been able to reanimate tiny tim as the demon to go along with his music it would have been a lot more frightening than the demon they hadso there were only two things i enjoyed in the entirety of the movie two thats it1 the creepy smiling people in the house they look fun and id invite them to dinner2 im glad the father came back possessed though i was hoping itd happen to the kid too but hey gotta punk out for the north american audiences right cant do that to a kid blahthe end is the only thing that saves this from a total zero5,astonish
i cant really believe all the praising reviews for this movie i mean sure it was decent for its genre but i felt like i had seen it 4 times already story wise and the plot was like swiss cheese if i read all of this it makes me feel like i should have seen something amazing and different like pans labyrinth this doesnt even come close its the same old story all over again haunted house kid sees creepy stuff nobody believes it at first later they do believe they get some paranormal lady who can do something about it things go good then bad some epic battle you think yes but of course in the end dun dun dun its not the happy ending you where hoping fori was left with a lot of questions after this movie and not even with a scared feeling the only thing i really liked was the fact they didnt use cgi and kept it clean like that but no this was just a 5 for me if not less,astonish
usually we have to wait sometime longer for films to hit uk shores and what with the need to be scared in public eye as much fun and exciting as can be this just offered the same predictable jumps and silly ghostly appearances in all the wrong places largely because the second half of the movies laughable spirit travelling find your sons inner being in a terrorised ghost realm that for me and the audiences response to the ending a wasted story to such a positive and butt clenching start and what was with the tales of the crypt fly towards the camera opening title that was just hilariousfrom the beginning offered your run of the mill strange happenings with little signs here and there that something odd was happening but it was done right at least everything felt on edge and the tension was well built throughout the opening a stereotypical american family of teacher and housewife and some little terrors running about worked nicely and everything felt in place you knew as soon as josh the man of the house went to work things would kick off and just like paranormal activity started slowly and pretty frightening moving on to when things get a bit naughty and not selling away the plot one of the most body tingling face changing heart pounding moments comes in the babies room behind the cot something made me scream inside michael myers is here but it worked perfectly well a lot better than darth mauls predictable appearances youll see what im talking aboutwhen things get really bad they call in some experts who access the situation for what it is and start the magic off where the film sadly takes a nose dive down and down with no sign of ejecting to safety and as i said before the film i feel goes to waste when the psychic ghost whisperer so and so expert sends are hero dad into this spirit travelling rescue mission that the funny and not the scary begins with plastic looking smirking like you just dont care ghosts that oozed humour not fear was that intentional i have no idea but its not what i call scary so without ruining a ruined end ill leave that bit for you to see how disappointing just a great starting movie turned into drag me the hell stupid scares and predicable goings on mehhhh,astonish
as a dedicated horror fan and a fan of the original paranormal activity this film just didnt have the lasting appeal i thought it would in fact i walked away from it wondering what was the best way to relieve my bored moodsee the thing is im all for scare tactics despite the fact they never work on me and there isnt a horror movie i havent watched and despite not finding scary enjoyed none the less take the grudge for example let us not speak of the third one while i didnt find the the grudge scary i did at least find it entertaining on the other hand was not i didnt consider it to be scary nor did i consider it to be entertaining there were a few when things go bump in the night scenes which were okay at best but the whole scare factor is lost because you already know what the cause of it is and quite frankly knowing what is causing the haunting as well as the fact they mean no harm just makes things a little less scary or interestingthe scare factor of paranormal activity is in the fact that something is stalking our main characters we know not what but it means harm and is willing to kill anyone that intervenes this just makes it seem all the more fearworthyim also a person of subtle fear tactics while i dont mind the loud sudden boo effects i believe that subtle things like the lights going on and off down the hallway in the grudge 2 the footprints on the floor and lights down the hallway switching on and off in paranormal activity the dark ghosts prowling on the ceiling and walking up behind a certain girl in the messengers etc were all scary and superb in their own rights and if a movie can keep that up right to the end its all the more enjoyable the cherry on top being a superb resolution to the issueunfortunately had none of these with its most entertaining scene coming from certain ghost hunter revealing not really what we already knew because its all over the front cover to which i thought oh really fancy that ey that sounds like a problem no one has ever solved how are you going to solve it to which they didneed i say more,astonish
the horror film when i looked at the imdb rating of 73 on here i became very sceptical thinking due to three previous film experiences that it was highly overrated the films i refer to two not being horrors but still overrated were the fighter and the hideously bad thor the third film which was a horror and had a rating of 74 was the descent which for me without a doubt is one of the worst horror films in years as i wouldnt even classify as that because it was so bad so i settled down to with cautious optimism im afraid to say again like the descent for me has been quite overrated but it is not as out of proportion and this was much more entertaining than the descentthe story itself has some promise with demons and spirits which is nothing new but there are some creepy moments throughout the film when these spirits appear with unending ease which stayed in my mind for a while during the film the atmosphere created by director james wan is done well to an extent with some impressive make up and special effects and his effective use of sound though mainly this in the first forty minutes the acting too though not amazing was reasonable for a horror but really the film lost heart after about forty five minutes as it became more and more silly where i just laughed at certain scenes and im glad from looking at the audience reviews on here i wasnt the only one as it didnt look at all that real when they camera does an extreme close up of like the demon it looked like some ridiculous attempt from a child at making a halloween costume the thing is does market itself as a serious horror and me laughing at it is what disreputes it to being better than it could be for me it is completely bonkers with a stupid ending but strangely in a way it being silly made it more enjoyable in a goofy sort of waybut by the end the film had lost its chilling atmosphere and was half horror and comedy and though it was entertaining it didnt remotely scare me and was uninvolving and forgettable its nothing special but is enjoyable enough to watch and it passes the time and is more entertaining than the descent,astonish
i thought after reading several reviews about this film i would go and watch it and i must say i was disappointed yes the film is a budget film and maybe it could be argued that the story is fresh but that would be wrong this film is a cheap imitation of poltergeistand in all honestly it would struggle to scare a 13 year old because there is nothing in the film that is remotely scaryon the odd occasion the film does try to scare you it falls flat the tension builds you sit wondering when the scary jump moment will come but it never does you really do come out the cinema feeling like you had just sat through someones school project go rent poltergeist close the curtains crank up the sound open a bag of popcorn and enjoy i guarantee it would be money better spent,astonish
i think its ok to watch this film if you know what youre getting yourself into its not a great film it has some scares especially at the beginning but soon even the audience begins to laugh at the not very scary ghosts this film takes itself too seriously it is not as good as poltergeist or paranormal activity which you can see its trying to replicatethe demon and ghost are only scary when they appear unexpectedly however when you get a good look at them which unfortunately is too often you see that its just regular people in costumes and cheap makeup they even forgot to put some scary teeth on the demon it all looks very hallooweenishwhen you go see this film expect a tv production of poltergeist and paranormal activity and you wont be disappointed i for one couldnt stop laughing,astonish
oh wait we have seen this movie before about 50 times same predictable scary elements and twodimensional plot that i nearly fell asleep oooooo theres a scary bumping sound in the house go investigate it alone in the dark ooooooo the creepy old psychic lady says your son is haunted gosh that old lady sure has lost weight since poltergeist oh wait thats a different old lady shes just playing the exact same role i get it why does every family in every movie that involves a haunting insist on keeping as many lights turned off as possible is the midst of a haunting problem really the best time to go green did the ghost trip a circuit breaker hey your house may be haunted your kid may be in danger but dont bother turning on a light somewhere naww just blunder around in the dark hey maybe the ghost is afraid of the dark right weak overdone predictable go rent poltergeist and enjoy yourself,astonish
2010 out of 4 a father and mother patrick wilson rose byrne are heartbroken when their son falls asleep and never wakes up its not a coma but the doctors arent sure whats going on with him but soon the family start to witness various ghostly figures in their house when i heard the plot for i pretty much wrote it off as yet another haunted house flick but im really grateful that i decided to go watch it ill be honest and admit that i love ghost stories whether theyre in a movie or on something like unsolved mysteries i love them because they really do have a genuine way to be terrifying but quite often they just fall flat on their faces by trying to do way too much thats not the case here because there are several moments that are so chilling and flatout scary that youll be having a wonderful time feeling your body heat lower to pure chills there were several times in this film where i was rather hot sitting in the theater but something would happen and i ended up pretty much curled up in cold chills i was really surprised when i saw director wans name appear because hes certainly a king of excess which he showed with saw but i was happy to see him take the less is more approach here im certainly not going to ruin any of the twists in the story or give away whats wrong with the kid but lets just say there are several ghosts who appear and at times the intensity level is almost too much again i wont ruin the scene but theres one that involves a baby crib that really felt as if someone came up from behind you and stuck a knife in your back im sure if you took a comb over the events in the movie and the explanation were given then you could rip the film apart i think its fair to say that the movie starts off rather slow and the character development at the start really doesnt do much i would probably also say that the ended isnt as strong as the stuff leading up to it im sure you could attack a few of the camera shots that are a little too stylish for their own good you could do all of that stuff but youd be missing the point because people go into a film like to be scared and the movie succeeds on that level again there are several scenes that will turn your blood ice cold the ghostly images are quite frightening and if you believe in such things theyre going to be even more effective the importance of a film like this is to build up dread and atmosphere and director wan does both of these things very good you have an old creepy house you have lights that dont work as they should you have floors that crackle and pop with each step you have a dark attic all of these elements are in the ghost story 101 handbook but its what you do with them thats important and director wan puts them all together and delivers a very effective movie the performances by wilson and byrne are exceptionally strong to where you believe they are actually dealing with these events and we get strong supporting work by barbara hershey and lin shaye,astonish
although director james wan hasnt made multiple horror movies his productions usually end being the next box office grab not only did he ignite the saw 2004 franchise but he also began his second franchise here with this film its not a surprise that this happened because of how much of an innate talent wan has for making horror films at first his focus was on insane people then ghosts and now demons the trend just keeps getting more supernatural the story depicted is about a husband and wife that end up seeing their son go into a coma as time goes on however they begin to also notice strange events going on as well that for some reason deal with their sleeping sonas a narrative the story is very solid leigh whannells writing not only makes its audience invest themselves in the characters but also in the new universe the further that is given as well unfortunately there is one drawback and that is of which this new dimension the further is explained who discovered this dimension how does one acquire the ability to enter and leave this particular area these kinds of questions are rather significant when this specific plot point is the backbone of the story besides this the writing is captivating enough that viewers may not have these questions on the tip of their tongues patrick wilson and rose byrne both portray their characters nicely and develop off of each other from time to time ty simpkins plays the child that is in the coma although simpkins does not take part in much of dialog his part is still a scary position to be in and when he does speak he shows he can act the rest of the supporting cast is noteworthy too of which writer leigh whannell is apart of along with him are angus sampson barbara hershey and lin shaye who all try to help the couple get their son to good health the visual aspects to the film also worked in its favor john r leonettis cinematography helped with the atmosphere of the situation and definitely made good use of his visual style when entering the further realm leonetti also had david m brewer work with him my guess is since brewer does not have many theatrical releases under his belt leonetti was giving him some professional advice and experience the specialpractical effects and horror elements to the film blend nicely too james wan also seems to be backpedaling when it comes to gore ever since saw 2004 his other directorial films contain less and less blood for gorehounds they will be disappointed but gore isnt always needed to make these kinds of movies scary the scariest thing about this movie is two parts the first part are the ghosts smiles they are downright unnerving the second is the demon played by musical composer joseph bishara the makeup on him is terrifyingly well done the only problem however is the way bishara plays the demon originally his minor appearances are extremely noteworthy however later on hes portrayed in somewhat of a campy fashion not sure if it was intentional or not but it lowers the terrifying quality of this character when initially his presence was so menacing as for music bisharas composition is a totally different ball of wax right off the bat like many other tracks composed by bishara audiences will be introduced to the shrieking strings despite that being his way of creating many of his tracks bishara actually composes a lot of other emotionally related themes that revolve around the family in the story this shows that bishara knows how to compose motifs that are easy on the ears no matter how simplistic and juvenile his other tracks may soundit has decent scares believable acting wellrounded music and a new story to tell that goes beyond the normal ghost stories told before on the other hand there are some key parts of information left out that are quite important to the backstory plus some of the terrifying tension may be lost if one cant get past a particularly campy scene,astonish
how many of these films were there in 2013 i saw so many i can not remember the numberi mean they are more or less entertaining but i think too many of these were created in 2013this one is excellent first of all house looks fabulous inside and outside furniture is beautiful and the whole set is something to be commendedthe red corridor hm it reminds me on those red corridors in the red light district of amsterdam where instead of supernatural you find prostitutes  acting is excellent although the husband character is something i leave for you to make judgment on and the guys who are helping they look like guys from your local supermarket delivering goodiesif you like supernatural films year 2013 was a year for you for many titles to choose from you can choose this one as well,astonish
i am a lover of horror and great ghost stories really was a good movie i was scared to death from start to finish i experienced several different types of emotions while viewing this film but in the end it was fear that took me over this film takes you to a really dark and scary place and from the music to the strange world you will be curled up in your seat for the whole entire ride i highly recommend this film it is haunting and terrifying and you will be sleeping with the lights on i cannot wait to see the sequel because i did not want this one to end the way that it ended nor did i expect it to end that way when i ask people if they have seen this film they always say no and i always tell them you have no idea what you are missing see this one before you see the second one,astonish
first of all thoughtplot of movie is really nice that helps to catch your nerve it scares too 2 or 3 times with few really good scenes but that all it builds the horror environment to its peek but than it just goes fuzzylast act has always been important in horror movies this is where the movie really disappoints though the last mystery unfolding may surprise fewanyways it is still watchable it really develops the thrill of horror most importantly without stupid blood shredding scenesstory  good theres never much scope for it but did good direction  intelligent acting  nothing new or remarkablerecommended  yes should watch it if you are not frightened of ghosts,astonish
hello great horror fansi went this movie when i saw the poster in cinema and i wait another simple horror movie which will have some jumping scenes and atmospherebut after finished movie all i can say this movie and director is a legend and director for me make history in horror below you can find why1 great acting partick wilson and lin shaye rock the movie also side characters rose byrne leigh whannell angus sampson make the film going in energy fear and suspense acting 109 2 wonderful atmosphere and ambiance this movie has its own unique atmosphere that can scare all kind of people no body can leave this movie without 2 eyes open i can guarantee for me this movie like the pc game amnesia dark decent you have only gun which is your light you walking in enemys who wants your body thats really annoying place to find your son atmosphere and ambiance 109 3great story movie has its own aspect depend on astral ride in theatre where i watched movie after the child go to coma most people in cinema say oh another ghost story bla bla when lin shaye start to give the idea why the child in coma we all shocked and start to close our eyes slowyd so this story for me 1010 in all aspects4monstersthe only blow for me in movie is the red monster which is not scary enough for me but the lady is not the type you wanna mess withd this is the one of the scariest faces in horror movies i didnt see other then the fly or alien which are science fictions moreover when patrick wilson go to astral ride the mosnters in there pretty scary also sum up these the lady and other mosnters save the day mosters 107finally if you are a horror fan or not it doesnt matter this movie is a masterpiece by james wan and it mustnt be watched alonethanks,astonish
a great horror flick that will send chills down your spine especially in the 2nd half of the film james wan brilliantly managed to create a superb horror flick without one drop of blood while the violence in some horror films can add to the creepy atmosphere this is not needed in although the film relies heavily on jump scares most do work and satisfy your need of jumping out of your seat watch this film if you are just getting into light horror films because this flick does the trickrating 910ps definitely see the conjuring which is now in theaters it is triple the scary and possibly one of the best horror films of the decade,astonish
homage or ripoff you decide but it owes a great deal to poltergeist from its suburban setting to the strained domestic situation between the two leads rose bryne always believable and patrick wilson dependable as well the big difference is the location of the haunting which was pretty clever as this was a lowbudget film the writer and director couldnt cover up story holes with more cg the scares as sharp and surprising making nice use of silence the shadows and the supporting actors who do a good job of conveying reality to some pretty unrealistic situations fairly eerie makeup tooonly two failings and one was budgetary when the spirits put in a final appearance at the end they looked far too solid  again no money for fancy cgi but the other was a real failure of writing that is the twist ending most of us watching horror films know there is going to be a twist and were expecting it part of the beauty of a twist ending is that you are surprised but since its now considered a requirement then is no surprise no matter how allegedly clever the twist,astonish
i dont get all this hate or love impressions i see people getting from this as a horror movie it did its job scaring me but dont be scared by the people who tell you this is the scariest movie theyve ever seen although those are individual opinions i bought this one after seeing sinister and paranormal activity and used those two as standards so i was all set for a good old mental breakdown and the first half hour was scary but after that its a very strange way to do a horror movie the standard is often to build tension before unleashing hell at the end doesnt its intense from the start on already showing off a creepy old ghostlady eerie music and a semi jumpscare before the five minute mark but beware that the first hour might leave you shaky enough to break down during the rest of the film that sadly just goes bananas with ghosts demons loud noises and unsettling visual details know this the rating is wrong do not turn this on for your 13 year old people norwegian censorship gave it a pg18 but i would say the correct one would be around 15 if you are very easily frightened stay away from if you like me enjoy horror movies you will be able to handle this one,astonish
this film really surprised me back in 2010 even the opening title of the movie with its sheer violin sound effect gave me the impression that i was in for a good horror film the only problem i have with this film is its catchphrase of its not the house thats haunted its your son is so much more than what that phrase offersi attended the film with a date and we both left the theater with chills and a slight uneasy feeling from what we saw and whats best about it is that theres no gore no foolish teenagers running away from the bad guy and very little fake scares when a chilling moment in the film happens it happens in full force i refuse to give spoilers but just trust the fact that this film was made with 15 million dollars and made 100 million in the box office its a genuine horror film with an unfortunate catchphrase thats what is,astonish
i like a good horror movie even a lowbudget one if its effective this one is not its the first time i ever violently swore at the screen when the credits startedlots of closeups a little alarming on a big screen especially if it is not of the scary peoplethe little brother and sister were just extraneous characters easily dismissed for the final act frankly i found the creepiest thing about this movie to be the darkhaired little brother but oh they will probably be using him in the sequel i really dislike it when a movie sets up its own franchise that was perhaps unique back in 1980 with nightmare on elm street but its old hat nowall the dad had to say was hey he looks like darth maul you know he got killed right i liked this better when it was made as poltergeist,astonish
i will first admit that i heard wonderful things about this film and i had high hopes when i sat down to watch it the disappointment that i experienced while watching this film may have been as intense due to my high expectations that being said it didnt bother me that the story has been done over and over again i wasnt even all that disappointed that it wasnt as scary as i had hoped they usually never are anyway it did have one or two moments during which i was startled enough to jump a bit what upset me was how unbelievably stupid it was i actually laughed out loud when they referred to the other realm as the further i get that it was in part an homage to poltergeist one of my all time favorite movies but really the further i think some level of respect for the audience would have been nice i felt like a child being coddled through a scary story the entire movie the ending was one of the more disappointing aspects of the movie i wont give it away but i definitely sat there for a moment as the credits rolled up the screen feeling truly let down what we have here is a film that begins strong but after about 15 minutes dwindles to nothing more than a complicated story that never fully makes sense a few less than terrifying monsters and a truly disappointing ending i know im in a bit of the minority the people i saw this film with actually loved it and they love horror as much as i do you dont know me but i love me some horror movies so to each his own i guess but i certainly wont be adding it to my collection any time soon,astonish
this is one of the worst horror movies ive ever seen i dont know why anyone would give this more than one star really dont waste your time there are plenty of much better movies out there this one here has a bad cinematography the story is really poor the acting is formal the guy who wrote the script doesnt know what an astral projection means he doesnt know if haunting or possessing has anything to do with it it looks to me he had a nice conversation with an old bored lady at the tobacco store and he made a script out of it the director was surely missing from the set or he was not paying attention or he was really stoned or any of this combined i really dont recommend this,astonish
when i read this was pg13 i thought it may be great to watch with my almost 14 year old daughter we curled up in bed in the dark and put on the movie what ensued was 90 minutes of us hiding behind cushions screaming and generally jumping 3ft off the bed this is a horror like old school horrors there is no blood and good just a good old scare fest that happily trundles along keeping you entertained as it goeswe really did enjoy it the only downside was having to sleep with hyper wriggling teenager daughter who was still so wound up she couldnt sleep in her own bed,astonish
i will keep it short this movie is absolutely creepy and scary it is not a blood and guts slasher and it is not anything like damien  omen box art was misleadingits the kind of wtf  jump  freak  imagery  sound scape that sets the tonei honestly had to close eyes and do the ole peak through the fingers technique at a few pointssee it now in a pitch black dark house with a beautiful tv and beautiful surround sound turned up loud do not watch this on some bogart compressed torrent on a crap screen do it some justiceloved it loved it loved itamazing edits absolutely genuinely scary im a huge horror fan favorites being haute tension and of course the exorcistrent this now from redbox if you dont like it i will refund your 110just hit me up at barrackobamadeficitfailurewhitehousegovrent this nowoutstanding,astonish
after seeing the trailer for the movie i really wanted to see it in hopes that it would be a truly scary movie unlike many movies that have come out in the past few years that are not at all scary after watching this movie all i can say is this i have never been more scared in my life the movie does a wonderful job in getting the audience genuinely terrified while many films put a few scary moments throughout the film and leave the rest of the movie to be used for build up to an ultimately unhorrifying moment is pretty much back to back terror while the ending of the movie can petty much be seen coming and there are a few moments where the acting in the movie lags a bit the overall feel of is one of true terror the film is by far one of the best if not the best pg13 horror movie to date dont watch if you are not ready to scream,astonish
the initial thought i got was of the highly common typical american family moving to a haunted house story but isidious proved to be one of the best horror movies i have watchedwith a strong storyline and impressive acting this movie managed to scare the guts out without a single frame of blood or gore which i think is pretty impressive where horror movies are concerned the turn of events are lined up very well to keep you guessing while keeping a good balance between the two extremes of keeping you utterly confused or having an easily predictable endingi highly recommend this movie to horror fans who are tired of seeing bloody predictable and repetitive horror flickscheers,astonish
i watched this movie with my niece and sister and we were excited to watch it we are long time horror fans and love scary movies unfortunately it took so long for the movie to start to unfold that we got bored it didnt take 90 minutes to tell this story and then 10 minutes of semi excitement it was also very easy to see what was going to happen we practically predicted every scene before it happened it was very predictable every once in a while a loud sound would occur and i guess this was the scary parts it almost seemed like one of those spoof movies because it took a part of many other recent films and put it all together then in the end for the last 10 minutes we laughed and said how will they set this up for a sequel i will not see this movie again it was downright boring at times and the story took forever to tell you wanted something to happen and it just never did until the end and even that wasnt exactly life changing in todays movie world where horrorscary movies are as rare as it gets is just in the long line of flops the standards are so low i cant believe any grown person being scared with this movie there are reasons this never wowed anyone at the box office,astonish
i gave this one 2 stars and i feel that was generous with the technology available and after the saw movies i felt that they would go one up not hit below the belt i would love to get my money back and would gladly send the dvd i bought back to them to see a dream demon sharpening his claws to tiny tims tiptoe through the tulips was sad they had a good thought but the process was lost i was not scared and have slept like a baby since come on people the technology is out there scare the pants off me you are able to awe me with monsters from older movies brought to life and avatars life with the navi on pandora come on,astonish
exceptional shocker i was pleasantly surprised at how meticulously each shock was carried out nearly every single one of them worked as someone who has lived long enough to experience the horrorscifi craze of the 50s and 60s where william castle laid down the groundwork for the shock sequence this movie would make bill proud ignore the 1 and 2 star reviews that are permeating this entry on imdb those apparently are from viewers who revel in torturegushing bloodand the thrill of intestines on the highway etc etc which frankly are beginning to bore me none of the above appear in this film they arent in any way necessary to make it effective it stands completely on its own merits turn down the lights  and hang on is a winner  all the way,astonish
a family moving into a new house are disturbed by strange things happening when their son falls into a coma they need to look for help from paranormal investigation teamthat short synopsis makes this film sound like poltergeist and its hard to avoid the comparison but poltergeist was big flashy special effects extravaganza and this film is much more subtle the scares come the from mysterious noises and the sudden appearance of things such as a face at a window and bloody handprints on sheets my biggest jump scare came from the appearance of a redfaced demon just behind patrick wilsons headi thought the film was very good at building up the tension through the first twothirds of the film rose byrne and patrick wilson really were very convincing as the desperate parents trying to get help for their son lin shaye was lot less bizarre as the medium brought into to help than the unearthly zelda rubenstein in poltergeist at least she was until she put a strange gas mask to talk to spirits perhaps the rush of events just left no room for the quiet tension that was so effective earlier and the last third of the film was a bit of letdown despite that is still a very good film and i think it is better than poltergeist especially as horror filmrating 710,astonish
i think the first half was very promising and scarier than the second half since first 40  50 minutes of the movie is built upon horror movie tradition and working great in the sense of horror genre haunted house possessed little boy etc  unfortunately director destroys the first half in the second half simply taking an unorthodox approach to the genre basically what he did was he turned horror icons upside down for example he tried to scare audience with shots taking place in almost sunny daytime or he used a group of characters even in the most scary moments rather than one helpless character the problem here is when you see daylight or a bunch of people screaming around you don t get scared because you fell safe when you fell safe while watching a horror movie you don t attach yourself to the characters and fell any empathy for them also the technological stuff that the characters used to bridge between our physical world and nonphysical world wasnt exactly working as it was supposed to  in fact i believe many people find it funny maybe the director actually used it to ridicule the genre he played with anyway id say the movie is ok it sometimes scared me sometimes i found it very funny evil makeup was ridiculous i think the director deliberately mixed horror icons with unusual elements to surprise the audience more but i dont know why he wanted some funny stuff in his movie id recommend this movie to horror fans who look for something different but i cant say i myself enjoyed much,astonish
ive said it before i will say it again 80 or more of horror movies are terrible so i look at it like this if it freaks you out a few times even if the movie is bad and the ending is terrible its still worth itthat being said man o man is this movie above all else its not blood gore or cgi it just works on so many levels the music and sound add so much to this well filmed and acted horror movie what a treat it was to watch this filmthe whole team that worked on this picture should be given an oscar when it comes to making horror movies its subtle things can do so muchim sick of movies that call themselves horrorfreddy from nightmare on elm street never kept me from falling asleep i was afraid to go swimming anywhere after jaws and the exorcist thats just scary as well hellbelongs with these films and many other classic horror movies i hope you enjoy it as much as i did and if you didnt then maybe your definition of horror is sleep away camp or bride of chucky,astonish
scary children are well scary theres something about a haunted youngster that just gets under my skin is no exception harking back to the notsosubtle horror movies of the seventies this chiller about a young boy with demons leaves no clich unturned doors swing open unexpectedly cast members venture where no sane person would and things mysteriously get moved throughout the night thankfully though the aussie team of james wan director and leigh whannell screenwriter who brought us the original saw movie provide a plethora of genuinely frightening moments that had me jumping out of my seat i loved the opening title sequence too 3 out of 5,astonish
is a magpie of a horror movie that steals ideas from other classics and weaves them together to make a fun movie  even if it will seem familiar to any horror movie fanthe opening is jhorrorish with the grudgeey type spooks inhabiting the house of a young family coping with the fact that one of their children has gone into an inexplicable coma we then move to poltergeist territory as the family brings in kooky help to help rid them of the presence in their home and finally the film evokes nightmare on elm street in the last and weakest part of the film as those things which lurked in the shadows are finally exposed and are frankly kind of disappointingbut even with all these influences the film it reminded me of most is sam raimis drag me to hell another movie that threw shock after scare at the viewers contrasting eerie quiet with loud in an effort to lift the audience of its seat in unison and just like dmth the impact is spoiled a little by a twist you will have predicted easily unless you have never seen a movie before everits this overfamiliarity that stops this movie from being more than a scary ride it is a fun ride while it lasts but once its over it will soon be forgotten,astonish
i dont see as many horror movies as i used to still when i see one get good reviews i try and check them out with notices saying its everything from better than expected to the scariest movie since the exorcist i kinda looked forward to it added to that is that was coproduced by oren peli whos paranormal activity was effective in a minimalist way the pg13 rating likely toned down saw director james wan as much as pelis involvement but the combo works well enough and for the first 23 of its an okay if more than mildly silly haunted house cum possession horror film sure every terror clich is milked for all their worth the shock cuts are turned up to 11 and the music and sound effects are turned up to 12 but the film was serviceable enough it even has a perfectly decent climactic scene plus a twisty epiloguebut thenwan and saw writer leigh wannell tack on a ludicrous sequence that makes the prior silliness look downright grounded by comparison full of foolishness that provides more laughs and many more clichs than shrieks not satisfied with torpedoing what was already a compromised ending wan and wannell add yet another epilogue that levels the film completely inisidious has simply become insipid,astonish
the thriller is not what it seemed like it would be at all not scary soso storyline and horrible graphics filling the parts that ran out of plot as scary parts came along the giggles became plentiful as graphics music setting and acting were all horribly entertaining and not set up the way they should have been after moving into a new house a young familys son unexpectedly falls into a coma and tests are done with results that are all but helpful just after the tragic accident the family learns that their new abode is haunted or so they think in the end of several happenings that throw the husband and wife into a crazy state they finally decide to move to a new not haunted home while unpacking the wife undergoes yet again another happening with a ghost that throws her into turmoil and confusion pushing the family to greater heights and forcing them into the ghostbuster yellow pagesafter the experts check out the home they decide that they immediately need to put a plan into action in order to save the sons live whom is not haunted by the house but by his dreams usually a film has a least one great trait this one does not the filming is way off for what it should be the acting is not in character and the plot makes no sense and sparks no attention what so ever for a credit the makers went in the right direction for an actual thriller that makes you jump but ruined it with all else included in the movie obviously i found this movie as one of the worst i have ever seen scary movies are not supposed to make you laugh throughout them this ends with a harsh score of 4 out of 10,astonish
i can not understand why so many people give this movie high ratings in the end it is bland and utterly predicable so much so that i was able to call end around the middle of the movie tries nothing new or special nearly every plotpoint seems to be recycled from another horrormovie the only tension in this movie derives from jumpscares even the design of the ghosts are slightly creepy at best the main antagonist however looks like guy in a very elaborate halloween costume although no movie is required to reinvent the wheel doesnt juggle its generic plot production design special effects and direction good enough to make for a enjoyable movie was filmed on a budget of 15 million dollar and ironically i guess that  in this case  throwing more money at the production would have benefited the movie a lot especially the sets and visuals in the final act seemed to be toned down to the bare minimum they had to be to make the conclusion of the movie work because of that the end feels rather anticlimactic instead like a payoff for a long and slow buildup this movie will fade away in your mind rather quickly becoming one with the memorymush of all the other mediocre movies you know you have seen but struggle to remember them,astonish
i must admit i had high expectations for this film but it turned out to be wasted energy evil spirit dressed like a mafia bully and fighting like one as well old woman with toys r us wig and a demon with red face paint and cheap contact lenses doesnt do it for me sorryquote imdbwriter leigh whannell stated at the toronto film festival that when he wrote the film he had a list of horror movie clichs posted above him so he could avoid using them well the movie is packed with clichs records changing tunes children laughing old woman laughing old medium chick child drawings of nightmares shadow of spirit mafia bully in the window fog machines etc etc etc yawn,astonish
first off not up to the hype its not as scary as people make it no matter what you read i was terrified by it before i actually saw it then i was like really ok cool im sleepin good tonightbut then the pros and cons must be distinguished pros  incredible introtheme very subtle the perfect introcredits ever for a horror  good use of the music with the momentum of the scenes  good ideas for the scare scenes  a killer plot that had tremendous potential  excellent vision for the further the perfect nightmarecons  borrowed or simply copypasted a lot from many movies before it  acting direction at times script and just feel overall too hollywood too unreal too polished  actors are playing mere prewritten characters as opposed to real human beings who react to a horrible reality  could have been much scarier given the pieces they had to their puzzle  some aspects in bad taste long haired fiend  a bit too unrealistic towards the endall in all just like inception this film touches on subjects of astronomical potential and importance  the realms of dream realitymeetsfiction eternity and infinity  and fails like the latter to deliver a complete whole picture of its monumental failed ambitionbecause of the great and the good in this movie and because of the efforts on the artistic side to make this more than just a polished soulless hollywood creation ill be generous and give it a 810 though a 7 could be in the discussion but theres no way this movie earns less and it just doesnt have what it takes to get to 9 or 10fully developed and less hollywood less commercial  this has the potential to have been the best horror movie of all timetoo bad,astonish
what a refreshingly delicious spin on the horror genre and it only cost them a cool 2 milish okay so maybe weve all seen the haunted house and the body possession dealsbut ooohh not like this you havent it has the cinematic operalike visuals of a dario argento film susperia with the delirious madness of a suspenseful written poltergeiston a side note its nice to see darthmaul still alive and kicking the crap out of your nerves in your nightmares the last time i was this affected by a horror movie was when i saw the blair witch in theatres about a decade ago turn off the lights and get ready to be scared shtless sweet dreamsmuhahahajust dont wet the bed ,astonish
and scared isnt the right word because i define scared as feeling uncomfortable and exhausted and just wanting to pause the movie to watch something less scary like when i watched paranormal activity that was a great movie but i jumped two times when an unsuspecting jumpcut happened thats it the rest of the movie is for those who have never seen a horror movie then it probably is pretty scary the scenery isnt too bad but the story the characters the shock moments you know absolutely every scene and whats going to happen nextso like i said those who love clichd horror movies or who never saw a classic horror title may have a pretty good time,astonish
i thought it was kind of dumb and took the idea of people having outof body experiences way out of proportion i admit that at some parts i found my face inside my shirt but i guess it wouldnt really be the plot that would scare you it would be the images and the dark maul looking thing i was really expecting to see a movie like paranormal activity and i thought to myself how the heck am i supposed to sleep at night but i slept peacefully and didnt even give it a second thought it didnt really scare me but what did scare me is the preview to dont be afraid of the dark i kind of would recommend it but at the same time i wouldnt,astonish
a family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child ty simpkins in a realm called the furtherthis film is marketed as being from the creators of paranormal activity which makes sense given the subject matter  but this is really the brainchild of the saw boys  being directed by james wan and written by leigh whannell who also appears as a character for an added bonus horror veteran lin shaye is here in one of her best rolesthis film is legitimately creepy i am not big on jump or bus scares and even less of a fan of computer animation but this film just impressed me there were so many shots that made it worthwhile with quick flashes of a shadowy figure  just enough to get the imagination to conjure up something more the best balance for horror is the use of the seen and the unseen in a certain mixture  not sure precisely how much but the makers of this film clearly do i think was overlooked by many and that is just a shamethe advertising consistently used quotes from reviews to insist this film is the best thing since either poltergeist or exorcist i assume anyone who reads that thinks its an exaggeration but do not think it exaggerates too much  these are not just cherrypicked quotes while putting in the same league as either of those two films is hard to do it is not far behind in fact i would not even mind saying it gives poltergeist a run for its moneywhile i hope does not turn into a franchise we are all a little burned out on saw paranormal activity and the collector as it stands this film is a winner it takes the haunting subgenre of horror and completely turns it on its head for the better,astonish
hats off to james wan i loved and most of the merit goes to him the story happens like many other poltergeistparanormal activityish films but even with this simple argument boy we have a haunted house and its a pain in the ass we are tested in every scene our capacity to scare is tested with original tricks i didnt notice but there was not a single drop of blood in the whole film even with some borrowed tricks it scared the hell out of me the acting was so good not a flaw not a single overacting but an adjusted performance of everyone involved it also has a strange sense of humor in some parts of the movie which i liked similar to the wes cravens autoparodies some of the scary parts are to collect and retain in our memories i must repeat without spoilers that it scared the hell out of me thats what classics do there are some cinematographic deliverances that made me enjoy extatically the mastership of wan when it comes to film but he didnt relie on his talents he used his talents like kubricks the shining to deliver a classic horror film im not comparing wan with kubrick but some of the camera works some of the angles are truly brilliant rarely seen in a horror film this is a movie you can analyze in many levels i watched it again and again i almost never watch a horror film more than once since is very rare to find a gem like this in the genre and normally i pass the movies with the strange feeling of oh my god this is the same movie i saw last week and i grew tired of horror films recently but with i didnt want it to finish for me having seen poltergeist i think that spielberg apart is a masterpiece of horror in a similar level than poltergeist or even the shining cinematographically speaking the next horror films might be a little boring if there were the oscars for horror genre james wan would get all of them this year he has stablished a mark with this film and will be hard to be surpassedabsolutely recommended 910,astonish
i started watching this movie with little hope as i am skeptic about movies as of late i especially dont expect much from thrillerhorror movies anymore however as it progressed i found myself continuously expecting more and more every chance to win me over was quickly dashed with awful executions of what were good if not great ideas if i was to rate the concept of this movie i would give it an 810 but as a whole 410 is more appropriate i was especially disappointed in the effects the scene where all the spirits are coming for his body reminded me of why i dislike most old zombie movies apparently everything spirits do is in slow motion except when one teleports from the other side into his bodythe few redeeming qualities were the old style demon and the concept i just really wish it was produced as well as it could have been,astonish
apart from rose byrne who is delicious and talented the film started out like so many clichd horror films everything was unimaginative ive seen a billion of these same types of starts with so many better storylines to carry them thru it just goes thru the motions for the first half everything is typical some of it is really stupid like the fathers character development ive seen so many better and original storylines that take you into the second half at this halfway point after the basic story is revealedin short the first half was very boring uneventful not suspenseful and meandering in clichs so then the second half of the film just descends into utter atrociousness as it tries to reveal the horror of the story the ness tries to build subject matter to resolve its like they ran out of ideas or perhaps more specifically ran with so many stupid ideas the crescendo scenes towards the end were laughable appallingthe very climax was stupid too given that it did not gel with a specific moment being abstract to avoid a spoiler it was just a shallow device as tho there had to be some omg twist andor way to introduce a sequel andor because they had to tack something onto the end because they couldnt find a way to end the movie as that whole crescendo sequence was not horror not thrilling and dragging out a happy ending feelgood destination,astonish
we went to the cheap seats cost us 4 bucks for 2 adults and i still feel like i was ripped off this movie is not scary its not anything more than dumb as hll we have renamed it is now called its hideous this movie is a wanna be horror movie it isnt anything more than a waste of time i saw the trailer and could not wait to see this movie i talked to a few friends who told me it was a great movie that really played with your mind and the ending would leave me breathless it left me breathless alright because i was laughing so hard  it ripped off poltergeist left and right that movie can never be remade speaking as an late 70searly 80s kid i know what horror movies used to be and this aint it,astonish
ok first of all this movie brings nothing new poltergeist the exorcist all the goodies you name it they used it acting yes you see them act that they have to be scared the story is weak and the end is made for the sequel or prequel so if you have nothing to do and the weather is lousy its the film to watch nothing more nothing less i can not believe that some people compare this with the exorcist come on not even near one off the scariest movies ever hahahahaha youve got to be kidding me my son is 2 years old and his possession is more scarier than this movie like i said if you have nothing better to do and some lifetime to waste then this is the movie for you,astonish
the first half of the movie was quite good it was actually much better than i was expecting and much scarier and usually i dont find movies scary it was almost perfect there are only two thingsthings that i didnt enjoy firstly was the comedic approach of the investigators they just seemed out of place in this movie it was not the writing or the acting just that in the context of the movie up to that point it didnt work for me nextthe last 30 minutesroughly was just not very good if any movie could benefit from special effects this was it im trying not to give too much away here its hard to blah too lateastrological bodythe furtherthis was a great conceptcould have been a great title too a little clich perhaps yeah but then again the movie became so clich when it entered the furtherback to the pointit would have been so much better to have the scenes in the further less idkearthly if the people didnt look like people if it was not set in an earthly environmenta house and the costumes especially the fire face omg looked like darth maul to me lmao the whole movie just fell apart for me in the last half hour very disappointing because it started off so well all in all worth watching i did enjoy it it had potential to be a classic a great but ended up being just good just descent,astonish
i was more impressed with the first half of the film then the latter thought it was very refreshing and intriguing until we find out that the reason for the chaos is because dad had this gift when he was young somehow forgot and now has passed it onto his son talk about a massive wtf moment since when is anything remotely spiritual genetic next well find that only fathers can pass on this gift to their sons i was totally for the movie until the writers obviously ran out of juice and had to recycle that old clich 10 stars really some of these folks are smoking granted it had some genuinely spooky moments but the epiphany moment was a total bust unfortunately i see a part 2 in the future very disappointed in leigh he could have written a better story,astonish
this movie does what it sets out to do it makes you jumpthe plot is good and the concept works the lead actors will also draw you in and make you part of this moviehowever other then being a movie that makes you jump i struggle to find any features that make it a good movie the first half for me is a winner but as we progress the film starts to feel rushed the story line becomes odd and the horrors begin to look cheap it falls fowl of the issues most movies that want to scare us doyou see the evil and laugh the demons and ghouls look like drama students let loose with makeup the limited use of cgi which i prefer looks cheapdid it scare me well yes it did up to a point however i wouldnt class it as the scariest film in years its simply a good basic horror flick which lets it self down in the later stages,astonish
i am a horror movie fan and i try to catch horror movies that get a good wordofmouth this movie is one such movie with some critics giving it an a rating very rare in the horror genreinvolves a child and that is usually a positive thing among horror classics like the exorcist the omen and poltergeist to the sixth sense and the others little dalton lambert suddenly falls into an unexplained coma one day with no plausible medical explanation from then on their house began to manifest various ghostly goingson that scares the living hell out of his parents josh patrick wilson and renai rose byrne pushed to the wall they consult paranormal experts to solve their supernatural problems can dalton still be savedthe device used to explain what happened to dalton and what can be done to deal with the situation was quite ingeniously conceived by the writer leigh whannell however the execution though by the director james wan is a tad disappointing in several parts this movie pulls out all of the traditional horror tricks to make this movie scary the shadowy darkness the loud startling music all to bring about a creepy atmosphere and jolting surprises and screams from the audience the images of the ghostly tormentors while disturbing and unsettling are more weird than really scary i believe that i may have been affected by expecting too much from this film i was expecting an arated horror movie but ended up rating it as merely an average one for the genre,astonish
i might get some flack about this but i have to say i was really disappointed with the second half of the movie i couldnt wait to see this movie the trailer always showing the best a mix between paranormal activity and drag me to hell the beginning of the movie  great i loved it real suspense albeit the musical cues warned me what was about to happenbut the second half flopped it was almost like they got another writer thats how different it wasgas mask it started to decline quickly after that i started to laugh  she look so funny in it the further  more like those haunted houses you see around halloween with paid actors the zombies reaching out to claim their victim silly hey how about those paper mache chains here son let me just rip them apart without any effort fog machine smoke  cmon theres more to rant about but ill stopthe ending  very cool it was the old lady who was communicating to the medium what was written on the tablet by specs was exactly what josh old lady said at the end of the movie in the end as i see it josh becomes possessed,astonish
i have read many of the reviews and am amazed at what people today think is a great horror movie is not the first half of the movie is really goodvery scary it is scary in the sense of startling youakin to someone in a haunted house jumping out and shouting boo it doesnt have the slow build up scares of truly classic movies the directors did a much better job of that in saw but i must admit that the first part was scary then the second part of the movie hit and it was crash and burn first they bring in the psychic lady and her two bumbling oafs it was a blatant rip off of poltergeistwhich was much better then we find out that the boy in the coma is really off in a world of spirits who want his body however the main one is a red faced devil who looks more like a character from star wars arent these supposed to be dead people walking around where did the demon come from it made no sense also they were all around the boys bodywhy didnt they just take it they had no problem taking the mans body at the end but the scenes from the further were just ridiculous who was the little boy who gave him directions who were the people in the house why did the one shoot the other three but when the demon was there sharpening his freddy krueger blades on a grinding wheel with tiptoe through the tulips playingi was laughing the wheels totally came off many things didnt quite make sense in the plot the demon was laughableall in alli didnt like the movie the first part was very good second part was terribleending was goodif you want to see a low budget horror flick that scares you but doesnt take much thoughtgo see it if you are looking to see a classic good horror flickstay away,astonish
i always have to laugh out loud when people say that either this film scared them or they enjoyed in the least im sorry but its a natural reaction this film was recommended to me by someone who saw it in the theater so i went with a filmmaker friend of mine figuring i was going to have the crap scared out of me and i found myself not only laughing in the theater but he and i were exchanging looks like reallythis is what we paid 11 bucks for although maybe some thought the premise was original when they reveal what is happening to the kid i had to chuckle we both were so disappointed in this that when i see what the film cost to make and what it made in theaters it makes me sad since there are so many other better films out there that are indie horror films more deserving financial success you want to see a great indie horror film check out the french film inside much better and very scary i dont post many reviews only when i feel strongly about a film and this film is horrible laughable and id caution you on wasting your time on it,astonish
this move is by no means bad but after reading the reviews i thought i was going to get a classic ie exorcist omen  poltergeist  i didnt get anywhere near it was described as terrifying i watched it late at night with no one in the house and still forgot about it 2 minutes after all the scares are telegraphed  the story is a mix between poltergeist the hole and the others and while it was entertaining slightly i was expecting far far more so all in all the rating pg 13 was correct and i wouldnt expect anywhere near the movie that has been reviewedand while this is a lot lot better than the drivel coming out in the last 10 years im afraid the days of classic scary supernatural horror are over with a few exceptions like the ring dead silence and gravedancers i give a solid 5 out of 10,astonish
i have given this 5 out of 10 as the start of the movie i thought was quite well done i kept having to pause it and come back to it when i had calmed down something i have to do for really scary partsby the half way mark for me it morphed into a really cheap 90s movie i thought the music was a little too much at times the acting was ok but i have seen better from these actors some things during the movie i personally found no explanation for it just didnt seem to fit maybe i expected too much out of it maybe i am too fussy just wasnt what i had hoped so a bit of a let down for me  i would say its worth a watch if you have nothing better to do with your time sorry but this movie just wasnt for me,astonish
the story seems classic at the beginning then it goes wild towards the end the plot simply loses attraction 4 or 5 new characters are just thrown into the movie and as others have said it you really dont connect with anyone in the movie this being said they still could have pulled it off except that the acting is poor and the cut is just awful it just goes from one scene to another with no fluidity plus the action scenes at the end are cut even worse plus a school teacher who gets home at 1040 pm every night it seems this movie was thrown together without a script i would say scary movie 4 has a better chance at becoming a horror classic i dont see how critics could rave about this movie it gets 74 on imdb 6th sense gets 82  give me a break guys this is a 45 movie at most,astonish
i only decided to watch this movie because i like scary movies and imdb had good reviews on this what a mistake this movie started off ok  decent until the cheap rip off of ghost hunters entered the picture then the movie lost all credibility eg a distressed family is sharing their horror experience with the ghost hunters in their first interview as one of them is eating what looks like a burrito or wrap attempting to add some humor or comedy into the picture the rip off of tangina from poltergeist was also seen anyone who has seen the movie poltergeist will totally see right through this sad attempt the movie from this point just went on being ridiculous and not scary at alli should have known better paranormal activity and saw should tell you enough save your money rent it,astonish
the ageold formula sets the tone a quintessential american family settles into a quintessential american house within days the wife renai rose byrne starts hearing strange noises and sees what shes sure are apparitions but what her husband josh patrick wilson calls her imaginationit takes the sudden unexplained comatose of one of their sons for josh to take renai seriously though he remains sceptical he agrees to change house all is okay in the new home until the same sorts of things occur more freakish noises and strange sightingsnow renai is hysterical so josh enlists a pair of ghostbusters it was correct to make them comedic and not take them seriously wan uses clich like its back in fashion i counted at least five a heater turns on by itself doors opens by themselves the clock has a pendulum mysterious kids run in and out of view and doctors cant diagnose the boys condition theyve never before seen anything like it why not find out who hasturns out the boy has been possessed by a particularly nasty demon which has got to him in a realm called the further hell to get him back josh must ignore his fears and enter this godforsaken placetheres no buildup clichs are like contractions they come out of nowhere and then disappear never to return why are demons so coy wans demons  get this  crave life but like to toy with their victims before revealing themselves jesusa horror film isnt scary when you can predict to the second when a fright is coming i have an almost otherworldly talent for this from someone who is known to still have nightmares over a certain horror film from 1973 this film isnt scary at allwwwscottishreviewnet,astonish
i am gonna start out by saying i am not a huge fan of the haunted house style of movie i will say that this movie did impress me though it isnt really scary at all creepy is more of the term i would use not once did i just feel like my heart was gonna explode and anyone who says that it was terrifying was probably 1 a twilight fan or 2 a 15 year old girl sorry but this isnt scary dead silence was better in my opinion for the whole scare factor and it was only a shock and awww film is the type of movie that inspires a dark eerie mood it was a little to similar to poltergeist though in my opinion i put this up because i was sick of people saying this is terrifying when in fact it isnt even close i do recommend that you should watch it though especially if you like poltergeist type movies,astonish
for they took a really good movie and half way through lost the plot and stuck a different movie on the end the first half and the second just didnt match they would have made two different films but together theyll didnt blend well and it fell into the american trap of showing too much and completely nullifying the scare factor lets talk about the good the film starts using classic horror scoring even the font for the title is old styled its like watching the horror films of the 1930s imagine the font and music of nosferatu this older scoring makes for a classic eerie atmosphere its an unnatural music with sharp sounds great for creating an unfamiliar and unsettled environment it really works in the films favour as it does make this house feel haunted and creepy you dont trust it and you already feel like something bad is in the house now the first half sets up the haunting and some of the things you need for a horror film we have an imposing house that already feels ominous the camera angles also make the house seem unfriendly giving us unusual views of the staircase and shoots of locked doors add to the mix the young family new home 3 young children one still an infant in the crib a new job the pressure of motherhood and working from home an unfamiliar area and the isolation you get as an adult when you move to a new area and only have each other this all leads to added anxiety for the characters and us as the audience who begin to emphasize with their growing concern and apprehension about their new life so everything is set up nicely for a good horror film as the characters are already under a lot of pressure which makes for a nice tense atmosphere to add a haunting and this they do well with a subtle buildup of books moving but no one sees how or when a strange voice on the baby monitor and some really good jumps i was well on my way to feeling truly unsettle and had given myself a heart attack at the jumps i soon started hiding behind my hand and decided that this film was a bad idea because i was freaked out this is a great example of a haunted house film coupled with the growing anxiety of these parents before long one of the sons is lured into the attic another source of fear and has a fall next day he is in a coma we dont know the reasons and soon its 3 months later mother is getting more and more freaked out in her home and father is spending more time away from home unable to help his wife things begin to come to a head as it becomes apparent that something in the house wants our comatose youth and its getting closer so our mother finally convinces her husband to move house as soon as we get into the new house the wife starts seeing ghosts which are a little too real looking for me this is where the great atmosphere of the first half is ruined and the film takes things too far heres where the film goes bad and wrong they call in the ghostfacers if youve seen the show supernatural youll know what i mean they act like the comedy double act of the ghost hunting world and while its works for a little while you are lulled into a false sense of security by the comedy and then something jumps out at you it goes too far and then they call in the exorcist now it all goes wrong ok the exorcist seeing that its a demon haunting the son trying to steal his body thats fine but it just didnt work we get all the back story and a stupid plot about astroprojection and our little boy lost in a place called the farther his soul is lost and now ghosts are trying to take his body and worse than that this demon it turns out that good old dad was an astroprojector and when he was young a creepy old women stalked him getting closer as revealed in a selection of secret photos his mum kept somehow creepy woman didnt run off with his body dad has forgotten this and now its up to him to remember his power and project into this nightmare world to save his son and escape the demon it just gets plan silly now old woman exorcist puts on a gas mask with a weird trunk and does some odd sance that looks ridicules and then darth maul appears im not even joking you see his face once in the normal world and i jumped like crazy but then we meet him in crazy ghost world hes fully revealed and just not scary if youve seen the recent star wars movies the astro farther scene just plays out too much we explore all these ghosts that we know nothing about theyre not needed it just bulks out a storyline that is running away with itself then we enter an area that looks like the vip area of a night club mixed with the phantom of the operas lair just to make things weird we see that darth maul is a bit of a carnival fan loves an old record spinning on a classic turn table does darth maul by now weve seen the big bad in all its glory the film is pretty much over for me as its way to obvious and just not scary watching this cgi demon chase our characters around the place trying to get back to their bodies the film does try to have a quirky twist one that they flash back to about 5mins after we saw it but its just not enough to save a failed second half,astonish
whilst i quite like movies like this the supernatural chiller as opposed to the all out gore and yuckfest that is the saw movies et al im surprised this movie ever got the green light to go ahead and get made a blatant rip off of poltergeist and not a very good one at that the only difference and the only reason i can think of that it got made at all was that it didnt have anything to do with native american burial groundsalthough i wouldnt be surprised if they made an appearance in the obligatory sequel the movie sustained some kind of tension but that tension is rather to do with my annoyance at the alarmingly similar set pieces that recreate poltergeists i dont want to give anything away to anyone who hasnt watched this more to warm them that what they are about to watch is by no means original and by no means a 1010 film do yourself a favour and watch the best movie of this kind and rentdownloadborrow or steal poltergeist i give this film a 5 star rating based on the amount of actual jumpy bits but you see them coming a mile off so dont worry,astonish
the first half of the film was really scary full of tension creepy images and jump out of your seat moments second half totally lacked the subtlety that created these terrifying moments in the first half it got goofy which leads me back to my original point of view for most horror films when you leave more to the audiences imagination they tend to create much scarier things than a makeup team canin order for a horror film to scare me its almost like they have to create a form of inception let me explain by leaving clues of frightening images and sounds your letting the audiences imagination run wild and you are ultimately planting an idea of something bigger and scarier that has stay power to haunt them right before they go to bed to me the power of suggestion is much more affective in horror than an aggressive cgi created face telling you to be scared it doesnt work and didnt work not for this moviei can only imagine the last half of the movie being scary to a child because as a grown up people with scary makeup on just look like people with scary makeup on not monstersall in all great actors great idea for a film some scary points some laughs its worth a redbox rent i give it 6510,astonish
not voting because i wont see it i dont understand how anyone can say pg13 horror are horror if no gore then its a immediately a thriller not horror horror in definition has gore so this is not an officially a horror moviestop with the horror pg13 lies i watch so many of these false claimed horror flicks that i only see horror if its r or unrated now sorry these knock offs are about as good as poltergeist which is now not really scary anymore so people out claiming this is scary is weird just because the music gets louder and a big loud noise does not make it scaryi been so disappointed with the media lately with pg13 horror that they not worth the 1 and half to 2 hours of watching a few that i thought for an example as terrible is others the fog remake the skeleton key signs the village sixth sense and a lot more are badif your looking for a diet version of horror movie this is one for you for me i do not need a diet or light version of horror movie to see they are just no way scary at allthe people that are saying this review is not good are probably girl screaming boys or teenager girls that go to pg13 horror movies to scream at every single loud noise in theaters to annoy anyone that is sitting around them a normal adult would call this movie dumb i actually took the chance to watch this and find out i was right this whole time it sucks like all pg13 horror claiming trash heck this might be worse than poltergeist but i can not even watch that anymore not very many horror so called horror even rated r or unrated are even scary but at least the gore gives something more interesting to see than this crap if i attempt to watch another pg13 so called cheated horror flick i will shoot or some how kill myself firstdo not i repeat do not see this trash i can not believe james wan made this after dead silence if he does not redeem himself with a r horror then he went down with all the directors that went to pg13 too i will never end the complaining with these trashy movies,astonish
as of writing is the most profitable film so far of 2011 and basks in the praise of genre fans rarely have i been so dissatisfied by a film so feted and im a pretty easy guy to please not to mention i dig haunted house films anyway and have a lot of time for the era of schlock that taps into that would be the blessed 80s but somehow from start to finish fell flat for me at almost every stage a family find themselves the target of mysterious and menacing spooks after one son winds up in a coma after a ladder accident from here the film moves into overdrive serving up boo scares with loud and obvious scoring by the numbing repetitive barrel full with a saddening minimum of actual creeps baby monitor put to good use the restless dead seem to have a lot of fun popping up or out or in and props to them if they are indeed having fun as it must be pretty lame not passing on but the constant activity combined with lack of serious threat or greater purpose i didnt exactly expect a probing gaze into the traumatised mentality of parents post tragedy but the film is remarkably thin stuff makes for a hollow experience lacking menace plus pretty much only one is designed with any flair and it gets underused the living of the film are slightly more effective though still flawed patrick wilson and rose byrne offer sturdy performances as the leads they never summon much in the way of drama but are never less than watchable barbara hershey is fine value as a helpful mother though and lin shaye makes for an endearing psychic things eventually build to a modestly entertaining climax in which the film finally achieves some sense of the unusual and a bit of style though the direction is pretty dodgy and a rather cool capper that deserved a better build up altogether though the film came across to me as nothing more than a haunted house fairground attraction with less verve or humour an effect aided considerably by the occasional shrieks of my fellow cinema goers shrieks i rather hope were intended humorously at around an hour and a half or so an overstretched and tedious experience i seem to be one of the few dissenters on this one so perhaps my thoughts ought to be taken with a grain of salt but in no way do i recommend this one unless you have a stack of viewing aids and some buddies on hand to make a laugh of the watching 410 from me,astonish
i loved the idea of this since ive experienced astroprojection myself numerous times i can relate to this and find it quite chilling great film,astonish
this is literally one of the scariest movies i have ever seen really the only gripe that i have with this movie is the fact that the one time where the family was smart enough to move out of the house it wasnt the house that was haunted but even thats not enough to knock my score,astonish
its a poltergeist ripoff but not a bad one i found the ending to be a bit lame obviously just a setup for the reportedly lame sequels which i dont plan to watch,astonish
all this film is about a bag full of cpending was good though,astonish
full credit to all involved they did a good job lots of homages great screen play good actinga confused overlong end sequence didnt destroy the film and i loved the ending,astonish
possibly the worst horror film ive ever wasted nearly 2 hours on i dont know what planet all the high reviews are on but i think they need to get out more,astonish

the film is aboutuhm well aboutwhat was it again oh this was so forgettable from the preposterous plot and the forced dialogue to the scares because of sudden loud music and nothing else to all the obvious plot flaws this is one i wont be remembering clich upon clich upon clichthe first half of the film is subtle and the scares are effective the second half of the film becomes rather absurd and totally unconvincing reminding me of the foundfootage genre just less believableyawn,astonish
very few new ideas in this movie if any and the steals from other films are very obvious to the point of being distracting since you start to mentally compare scenes between movies while watching the means read budget were there so it looks professional but take out the money and this could be the school project of a not very inspired art student a bit sad,astonish
ok i know its not the house that its haunted but the boy whatever even with this small difference in relation to our average poltergeistthe amytiville horror copy this movie is still horrible there are all those elements that youre used to see in such films the new home the careless children the overbusied wife the distant and clueless husband the easy scare jumps the obvious external help the ghosts the sequelfriendly endingwhen you have watched a polstergeist movie youve seen them all the actors also dont make things easier for the watcher as someone mentioned elsewhere they all look like theyd rather be doing something else real good horror movies are a rare thing to find this one is not one of them,astonish
this movie is just hilarious just look at that red faced guy he looks like a donkey they just stuffed 100 ghosts in one story if lorraine knew that the astral traits had been passed on to dalton by his father  couldnt she have told his mother and father that he is not sleeping was she busy eating dorritos and watching spongebob all the time and what was that leather coat guy doing  licking daltons mothers face  they are ghosts not zombies that you can kill with a headshot this movie just made me fall to the ground my opinion is that dont watch this movie literally youll fall to the ground ,astonish
what a waste of time dark gloomy predictable it gave me eyestrain just trying to see what was going on obviously most of this was filmed in the darkso many great scary movies around why do people settle for tripe like this have they seen so few movies they dont know the difference between a good movie and a bad one lin shayes performance was the only redeeming thing this crock had to offer shes one great actresswas so slow moving in the beginning it was difficult to become interested but i stuck with it hoping something would happen you should stick with it too so you can become as disgusted with this timewaster as i was,astonish
this is a great film it is one of the better horror movies of the modern age and though technically its not the houses that are haunted this film has all the makings of a good haunted house flick before the coma tragedy and the hauntings that follow the family goes through the normal concerns of adjusting to a new home isnt this how many haunted house films begin certainly has the haunted house props the first house has a tall staircase and a spooky attic the second has a long hallway with a grandfather clock at the hallways end that sort of stands in an eerie spotlight there are plenty of places for ghostly beings to hide creating such hiding places in suburban homes seems to be one of director james wans specialties for a more thorough review check out my wordpress blog the link is on my profile page,astonish
i used to love horror movies  but over time the horror genre has gone way down in shock value  the new chainsaw massacre movies were ok  the saw movies became repetitive but kept my attention  but this movie surpasses those by far  scarier than the exorcist  a young boy draws pictures of things he is seeing in his familys new home  something happens and he goes into a coma  but his mother thinks its something more  morediabolical  she consults a woman with a team of two men to see if her son is really in a coma or has he gone into the farther  though the movie starts off slow  it definitely delivers the scares when it gets going  this is not a make you jump and scream horror movie  its more like a visually disturbing film  which to me is worse this movie made me pray so hard before i went to bed  for fear of seeing the images of the parasites wanna be disturbed  watch this movie,astonish
saw franchise veterans james wan and leigh whannell team with paranormal activity writerdirector oren peli to give the familiar haunted house story an exciting new twist with this tale of a family that moves into an old house and begins to suspect they are under siege from otherworldly forces when their young son inexplicably falls into a deep coma as devoted parents josh patrick wilson and renai rose byrne struggle in vain to uncover the root cause of their sons condition the stress of the situation gradually begins to take its toll on their oncestrong relationship later when darkness falls and specters appear to reach out for them from the shadows the frightened parents realize theyre dealing with powers beyond human comprehension,astonish
james wan a acclaimed director in most respects decided in 2010 to create yet another horror film partnered with his longtime partner since 2004s saw he and leigh whannell set out to create a creepy and effective horror film that didnt rely solely on jumpscares entirely on a budget of 15 million that budget is nearly unheard of in these modern times and especially with a horror movie so did the film work lets find outfollows a seemingly normal family as they move houses and start experiencing paranormal activity when their oldest son goes into a coma for several months and the paranormal activity gets worse and seems to follow them their only hope to save their son and stop the ghosts are to call a team of paranormal experts who may hold a key to one of the family memberss pasti didnt know what to expect from when i watched it a lot of people had said it was a good horror movie but some had said that the film fell apart around the third act i myself had been interested the film because i had seen a few clips on youtube and wanted to know the story that people said was really intriguing so when i saw it was going to be on amc at 2am of course i recorded it and watched it yesterday what did i think wellthe acting was really good from everybody involved usually in horror movies the worst thing about it is the acting but you could tell that everybody was really giving it their all patrick wilson is great as our main character josh lambert who is the father of dalton the kid who goes into a coma played by ty simpkins wilson really portrays what most people would probably feel in a situation like this one rose byrne is great as joshs wife renai and does great during some of the spookiest scenes of the film lin shaye however stole the show as the leader of the paranormal expert team elise rainier she did an amazing job and she was almost too good for this movie some of her acting during the finale really sold the situation for methe visual effects even though not many were used were really well done all of them looked convincing nothing looked as if it couldnt have happened in real life which is more than i can say for some horror movies now a days im looking at you ouija the scary bits were amazing as were the demons and such that were in the film there was one that did kind of look like darth maul but he was easily one of the if not the scariest there was also a old woman who wasnt a woman apparently and i think i remember reading that this woman is important in chapter 2 ill have to check that out soon thenthe script was really tight all of the dialogue flowed and it sounded as if these could be real conversations that people could be having in their homes when they are casually being haunted by ghosts and paranormal spirits the exposition that lin shayes character delivers towards the end of the film sounds really believable and it sounds as if it truly could be a real place that exists the direction and cinematography all worked in the films favor giving it a creepy edge that i think the film definitely neededmy only issue with the film is that during the third act the film started to become a bit more clichd without spoiling it the demons end up chasing after some of the characters and after a few minutes of this it became rather clichd and boring luckily the film picked back up for a satisfying and mysterious conclusion but that still bugged me a bitoverall however is one of the best horror films released in the last 1015 years the acting effects scares script direction and cinematography all were amazing and truly helped give this film a great atmosphere while the third act did fall into clich territory for a time the film as a whole is a very fun thrill ride and i recommend you check it out warning give your grandma her heart medication first before she watches it910 grade a,astonish
try watching alone at night prepare to shiver like you never have before as is the most terrifying nail biting suspenseful intelligent dark atmospheric and jumpy horror lipstick face demons lifeless dolls long haired fiends and creepy entities stalk the lambert family home and wander the shadows of the further rose byrne is exceptional in her role the fear in her face alone is enough to creep you out all round great performances from the whole cast and just executed perfectly from assured direction by james wan has the best ending a horror movie could ever have leaving you right on the edge with a seriously awesome and frightening cliffhanger you will find yourself gasping for air and fearing for the characters dramatically shot and edited so fast delivers all the shocks nonstop accompanied by a loud and frantic piano note the use of the song tip toe through the tulips is scary and it suits this horror movie really well down right scary from start to finish with a incredible ending that will shock and stay with you for a long time this is one of the scariest movies ever,astonish
a worthy start to an influential franchise the supreme mix of wan and whannell proves to blend enough ghouls and grime to result in a fun film byrne fits the contemporary stonefaced worrier of a mother horror archetype that seems so popular nowadays and she does rather well as the tiredeyed parent of a young boy in a coma who seems to be attracting the tormented and often disfigured demons who inhabit a distant realm patrick wilson balances her out well with the warmth of the fatherfigure and also gives a good performance as a genuinely concerned and worried parent the use of colour borrows heavily from the work of argento and thats a good thing smearing our worst nightmares in candycoloured paint contrasting to the bleakness of the real world the main demon antagonist is a little kooky though and depending on its audience will definitely inspire a few unintentional laughs,astonish
over the past few years weve had some terrible horror movies drag me to hell forget me not human centipede and the devils chair were all absolutely terrible i dont know why drag me to hell got such rave reviews horror isnt what it used to be it is a dying if not already dead genre which relies on gore more than scares james wans movies however are different they rely on genuine scares along with the conjuring is actually the scariest film i have ever seen in years from the brilliant soundtrack which is actually the best horror movie soundtrack ive ever heard to the actual suspense itself this is what makes so scary the special effects are kept to a minimum and the terror builds and builds making the movie more and more scary the acting is brilliant as well i have taken a liking to james wans movies and am definitely looking forward to the next one,astonish
i have watched a lot of horror films it is my favorite movie genre when a horror film is done right you feel like you need to leave the lights on this movie was well acted the film shots were almost like a marilyn manson video in the good days of mtv and had great music especially when tiny tim came on a perfect choice of creepy upbeat song it combines elements of a lot of ghosthaunting movies but with the added flair of another dimension and being able to see what its like i love the actors in this movie especially rose byrne shes very likable and sympathetic as a mother there were so many heart thumping moments where i didnt want to see what was about to show its face that demon was creepy overall this is my favorite horror film of the 2000s,astonish
summary in spite of its messy final act is clever well acted and suspenseful 73100 bis a lowbudget horror film directed by james wan the first act of the movie looks like paranormal activity 2 without the foundfootage but after the first 25 minutes it becomes more original and some scary stuff start to happen wan directs very well the movie boasts a nicely handled suspense especially in its first act in addition it has terrific sound effects the acting is superb rose byrne and patrick wilson were great in their roles the two main characters performed by byrne and wilson were believable and very well developed is a spooky wellacted flick and probably wans first good filmas i said above the plot is refreshing and the scares are effective the characters are well developed and some of them are funny in a good way a great example are the two male paranormal experts both play a hilarious role without being annoying the film scares you with some creepy noises and unexpected images its final act keeps the tension although its a bit weak in comparison to the last two acts during its final act there is a scene where this demon is revealed it was very surprising for me the demon itself looks very scary and that whole scene was so terrifyingon the upside has some thrilling scenes good performances and unexpected scares also its second half is strangely original james wan is a director with experience in the genre and creates here a truly scary atmosphere that is reinforced with strong performances by rose byrne patrick wilson and lin shaye i also liked the camera work this movie has lots of creepy shots and a good illumination too see this film if youre a fan of the genre or if youre interested on seeing a strange weird ass horror film also if you like jumpscares is a jumpscare fest a very good oneon the downside its final act is strange sometimes confusing and it almost ruined the whole film for me during its first half the movie kept the suspense and delivered lots of scares however in its final minutes the suspense was totally gone and the movie was not as terrifying as it was before i liked it anyway the whole production design is awesome and the special effects are well done in spite of being a lowbudget flick in conclusion is a great scary flick that boasts a creepy demon and originality my only issue is the final act its such a mess b,astonish
falling victim to a slew of strange experiences a couples attempts to find the cause of their woes center on their comatose sons journey into a world inhabited by demons and forces them to travel there to bring him back alivethis was quite an exciting and enjoyable effort that has a lot going for it one of its better features is the fact that theres a lot more going on in the story than just the usual haunted house tropes that are found in such efforts as here we not only get those fun and enjoyable supernatural tones throughout the first half when theyre constantly under attack in the old home that results in some great scenes as the attack in the bedroom and the blaring alarm constantly going off this is then based quite nicely off the second half where it turns into a demonic attack effort with all the paranormal investigations throughout the house before finally unveiling the final half which is the cleverest aspect of all these different efforts each one tends to lead into the others quite well as the early stuff is based on the threat of something there but not quite seen to determine how to go about dealing with the claims which are used to great effect in actually getting them out of the house where they knowingly experienced something creepy and dangerous going on the paranormal investigations are likewise a lot of fun by getting all the usual jumpscares out and really using the large sprawling house to great effect in generating some fine scares throughout here even more to the point this concerns the films highlight sequence in the sance into the different dimension that contains some truly freaky ideas before fully unleashing the action into hyperdrive with a stellar exciting and actionpacked sequence that really sells this quite well the atmosphere in the final half does have some great uses here especially the different demons interacting throughout here as well as the sequences with the mannequins which are unnerving and truly chilling works that altogether give this a highly impressive series of events it really only falters in a few areas namely the finale which is obvious the second the trick is mentioned twenty minutes earlier about the freedhosts body and never really has a chance to surprise because of the obvious nature of what happened likewise the fact that this one is so dependent on reusing storyline ideas from other films and even filming whole sequences wholesale from those efforts does cause this a little bit of distress as theres just enough here to make this feel as though weve seen it all before yet is still original enough to matter here these do hold it down slightly but not enough to still make this a highly entertaining and chilling effortrated pg13 violence language and childreninjeopardy,astonish
the first time i watched it i couldnt sleep at night sure this movie is unoriginal which is unfair because of similarities of other movies with similar plots but this movie is unique of its own the cast were great and the atmosphere was just creepy for me the lipstick demon was scary in the dark but later on it wasnt so much the movie was a fun paranormal thriller i love how they attempted to satirized the haunted house theme with a psychic and spooky children theres definitely a few jump scares either by just the music which worked on me or the ghosts themselves that play a haunting image in your head when youre about to sleep,astonish
well people im a hardcore horror movie fan and i have to say this movie is one of my favorites it may be quite clumsy at times but bloody hell is it smartspoiler alert i still get nightmares from that old lady that follows josh around creepiest thing ever more than little girls anyways yes i love this movies please watch it give it a chance open your mind turn off the lights close the curtainsonly if your watching at dayhighly unrecommended get the snacks and the drinks get a friend if you want wait for the movie to start get hyped do not eat the food yet check all dark areas in your house and get ready for a crazy ride oh and enjoy the movie,astonish
it has been very well documented over the past 1015 years that there has been a distinct lack of genuinely frightening films with the horror industry relying more and more heavily on sequels and remakes and although that there has been some standout films from places such as europe and asia with titles such as ring and the orphanage america has seen a noticeable drop in the quality of horror films although once again with some exceptions such as the saw films orphan and cabin fever however with the help of brilliant and very underrated director james wan horror seems to be making a slight comeback has almost everything that i believe makes a film scary a good amount of jump scares good tension buildup throughout and a very well made soundtrack and although there is little violence within this film it is neither needed to make the film scary or necessary to the story the direction of this film is very good with some interesting shot choices and good use of panning and zoom the actors also managed to do their job very well with some excellent performances from patrick wilson and rose byrne who play the parents in the film josh and renai lambert there are very few criticisms i can make about his films the biggest being that the main antagonist in this film is built up to be very scary and simply isnt also towards the end of the film there are some slight plot holes however neither of these things manage to ruin the overall atmosphere and brilliance of this film this is a must watch for any horror fan but definitely not for the faint hearted,astonish
my god where do i start this movie has everything it is unbelievable i first remember seeing this movie when i was about 15 and i went with two of my friends one of my friends was a huge horror fan and has seen probably every horror film going whereas one was a little more anxious about horror i was quite newish to horror movies and i hadnt really seen many in the cinemas before but i was pretty much okay with horror so i decided to see this let me just say one thing im so glad i wasnt on my own in the cinemas it was absolutely terrifying the first 5 minutes set the typical horror movie scene a husband and wife and their kids moving into a new home it was pretty much basic for the first 5 minutes or so and even then it didnt completely pick up until about 20 minutes in i didnt feel anxious at all and to be honest i was feeling a little bored but then the true horror of the movie really kicked in from about 2530 minutes of the movie all the way to the end i was absolutely terrified out of my wits i jumped at almost everything i was shaking i even screamed at one point and made half of the cinema scream with me i was so terrified that i just wanted to leave the cinemas and never come back and i couldnt bear another second of it my friend who has seen more horror movies than either of us can count had her hands over her ears my friend who is anxious of horror was covering her eyes and i had both my eyes and ears covered i didnt remove them until about 20 minutes from the end looking up occasionally to see what was happening when the movie ended i was thrilled although i could hardly walk as my legs felt like jelly and i was shaking like a leaf that night i was hidden behind a cushion for 3 hours staring into space eventually i got the movie on dvd and learned to not be as scared of it in fact i really liked the movie since refusing to ever watching it again when i saw it at the cinema even now though i am 17 years old almost 18 and i have watched more horror movies than i can even begin to contemplate and every genre there has ever possibly been no horror movie ever seems to bother me anymore however will always be an exception if it is dark i still cannot watch it or if im in the house on my own and the longer i go without watching it again in a period of time i forget about what happens and end up jumping at everything again if you want a good quality horror movie and want a twist on the typical ghost elements then this is the movie for you it has everything a horror movie should have slamming doors ghosts around every corner creepy kids a sinister demon things that go bump in the night you name it but what most horror movies missed out on was the element of surprise and the tension that is constantly built up to create a superscary atmosphere its one of those movies where you expect something jumpy to happen and it doesnt but then something else happens and you almost jump out of your seat if you get the chance it is a 100 must see 1010 for the scares and acting,astonish
the lambert family has moved into a house with a dark spirit lurking within josh patrick wilson and renai rose byrne have 3 kids their boy dalton has an accident falling through a ladder in the attic he hits his head and falls into a mysterious coma overnight three months later and he is back home but still in a coma there are strange voices over the baby monitor the younger boy foster is scared of dalton walking around late at night strange things keep happening they move but the haunting follows them to the new house grandma lorraine lambert barbara hershey brings in specs and tucker and elise to find the causethis is a nice solid little horror using all the classic haunted house effects and possessionghost story elements it is a lot of old school filmmaking from horror specialist director james wan the performance are all solid anchored by rose byrne who plays a compelling young mother the characters are certainly real enough that i didnt ask why they dont just move these people actually moved this is good old fashion horror,astonish
is not an original movie nor is it groundbreaking so why in the world did i find this movie so riveting and terrifying the directing in this movie is fantastically chilling james wan masterfully builds tension and earns his scares from the main title of this movie i was tense and felt something wicked on its way this film made me feel like there was an evil presence staring me in the face which no other movie has made me feel every environment i found the characters in had a life of its own each one more evil than the last i felt as if i were walking on thin ice and every scare was a heavier and heavier step i call this movie arrogant because it does not respect its audience it takes everything you have ever felt when watching a horror movie and uses it against you to catch you off guard an incredibly disturbing journey manipulates your anxiety at will and definitely sticks its audience,astonish
we have a nice quiet family living in a nice house all of a sudden the oldest son gets possessed by a demon he starts seeing horrific visions and soon they start showing up in the house this results in a lot of jump scares some are scary but some are really cheap like the house alarm anyway the parents seek help from a group of exorcists to help free the boy from possession this movie has a lot of effective imagery the demons look really strange especially when theyre out in the real world the move does go a little over the top with scare chords and hammy acting but this is probably deliberate the exorcism scene is the best scene in the whole movie it is very intense and dark literally and memorablemy problem with the movie is the last act which gets very slow and almost turns into a completely different movie the atmosphere changes completely and it pretty much becomes a haunted house ride that drags on for a long time also random things happen at times for no reason other than to scare you these things brought the movie down a bitoverall a good movie if your looking for a few good scares but dont get dragged down by the bad ending,astonish
is a movie that has to do with a boy who the evil spirits trap him and left him comatose all that starts when the boy started to travel in his dreams in a place that called the further but this time was losti liked this movie because of the plot and the story i also liked because of the interpretations of patrick wilson who plays as the father josh lambert of the boy and he is outstanding and rose byrne who plays as the mother renai lambert of the boyis a movie that has suspense and if you like horror movies then you have to watch it and i am sure that you will like it,astonish
after a series of initial paranormal occurrences in the home of a seemingly regular family a child goes to sleep but forgets to wake up and after the unraveling of a dark family secret his father must enter a purgatorylike dream world called the further to remind his son to wake up all while battling entities that are trying to make it back into their bodies before they do exceptional acting by all including the childrenone of the best and perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is that it did not go the obvious route of gory spectacle blood spilling suggestive innuendo profanity laced obnoxious characters screaming their way through the majority of the film only to get killed at or towards the end and whatever other nonsense is typical of socalled scary or horror movies made nowadays instead the writer and director employ simple things like familiarity and psychological terror that would unnerve even the most tough to ruffle among us if it could happen to them if you happen to you right their lives seems so routine and so safe how could such horror possibly happen to such a lovely family,astonish
i though this was just another crappy movie about some possessed kid with horrible actingbad plot etc like so many other horror movies from this century i was badly mistaken it kicked of right from the start with a really good plotgood acting and really good scares it just kept getting better and betterand when they introduced us to the further in such a believable way i got really amazedand even more interested this movie is very well donejames wan really shows us that he is a master of horrorit has so many good scareslike the ghost behind the babythat old creepy lady and the demon many movies fails when it comes to the endingwith like a bad twist or something but not this onethe ending is superior leaving us craving for more and i was gladly surprised to see that a sequel was in the works james wan and leigh whannel really got something going with this onei just hope it doesnt turn into the new saw franchise with 30 sequels amazing is the right word to describe this movie watch itsit back and enjoy the ride into the further,astonish
have you noticed how many horror films start with an ordinary family moving into a new house we get to know the parents and the kids usually at least one teenager and their problems and dynamics and we see how they have trouble adjusting to their new home they hear weird noises and see weird things like objects changing place or doors closing the tension increases and we prepare ourselves for something scary and then the films original story takes it from thereis no different in fact the beginning of the film is so conventional that i was sure there has to be something more something surprising well there is once gets into gear it does offer some twists but not exactly like youd expectheres the big spoiler this film is not scary the first half is somewhat scary and it seems like the ending might be hellishly frightening but its not its funny the film starts realistic but turns into fantasy horror pretty much like the show supernatural there are comic sidekicks and slapstick action sequences and the plot becomes very fantasticalthe humor is pretty subtle and understated so the film doesnt really jump the shark its just a pretty startling change in atmospherethe acting is alright and there are some cool dark visuals,astonish
leigh whannell and james wan have the knack for the lowbudget suspenseful storytelling they proved it with sawthe original and dead silence which may be more cheesy then i had liked but now comes their third theatrical film together their take on the worn out haunted house ghost stories the film stars rose byrne as renai and patrick wilson as josh they are a married couple who have three kids dalton11 foster6 and calliebaby and they are trying to get settled in their new house weird occurrences begin to happen around the house sending renai into a panic so they decided to move their son dalton has fallen into a coma and they are able to take care of him from home more weird occurrences take place that involve renai seeing demonic creatures so they decide to call in ghost hunters one played by leigh whannell and they begin to explain astro projection which basically is an out of body experience while you sleep and their son has gone to far into the world they call the further how will they get him out i might have given you more information then you would have liked but it is so hard to describe this movie because its very slow it builds tension and when it goes for a scare it gets you it only fails within the showing of the further but i blame that on their budget this film soars above so many recent horror films that have been released within the passed few years i cant wait to see it again i give a 8 out of 10,astonish
i saw the second a couple weeks ago and i thought i would re watch this one i am still scared every time i know whats coming but it still gets me each time i watch it oh by the way i reviewed the second one so you should go check that out this film is absolutely terrifying and i think it deserved an oscar i dont know if it did but ill probably check later the movie was completely awesome the whole way through it was scary and realistic it was funny at times and was filled with awesome special effects takashi shimizu an asian director believes that the more special effects you have the less real the movie looks i think the same philosophy is applied here and there is only one moment where they used special effects that only added to the realness i thought the acting was awesome and just like the second believable even little foster lambert who is played by a boy named i dont know but he was good rose byrne was good as well but nothing really outstanding patrick wilson as always did such a good job its a shame he hasnt been in more horror films hes been in his fair share but this is where he really stands out in this movie he plays a lovable dad with humor compassion lin shaye does a memorable job as elise rainier and one that cannot be replaced by another actress barbara hershey did ab as always wonderful job as lorraine lambert you can probably replace her but it wont be easy even joseph bishara who didnt have one line as the lipstickfaced demon because he was so agile and strong and scary looking leigh whannell and angus sampson were the writers and producers but also made an exceptional duo as specs and tucker they were the only people who kept the movie light when it wasnt scary which was a good idea this is one of the only movies that i can watch and be genuinely scared of unlike paranormal activity or boogeyman that movie was just terrible i thought that james wans directing style is unique and weird but in a completely good way he uses the instant scene change technique and also the dread technique meaning he does more jump scares than a lot of people and also can kill you in suspense more than anyone else i know about i was shocked that people 10 years older than me cant sleep after watching this it is very scary but i had no problem going to sleep as i said before james wan is a very skillful director and i want to see more of his movies he directed saw i and iii but i dont plan on seeing those any time soon the story was pretty generic and original at the same time the generic side is that there are a bunch of ghosts hanging around and on the original side the son falls into a coma and a big elaborate process tries to save him that wasnt a spoiler was it anyway the music was extremely different but in a completely good way it has sense of terror every time it plays and when it plays you know something is going to happen they really are disgusting brief recap actingawesome effects awesome storypretty cool musicextremely scary that was my review of i think you should go see it if you like really scary movies and see ya,astonish
the haunted house movie is a welcome break from all of the gore present in most horror moviesyou need a house that is big and old and has a lot of places for spooks to hide and can make a lot of creepy noisesmoving into the creepy house are the lamberts josh patrick wilson renai rose byrne and young dalton ty simpkins who bangs his head in an attic adventurea psychic and two ghostbusters provide some comic relief as we try to figure out who is haunting the house and whycreepy,astonish
watched this movie without too much of expectations and let me tell you guys 10 minutes into the film and fear started creeping all around me and towards the end i was scared to death i even paused the film for some time at a point where i couldnt it anymore even the conjuring from the same director gets dwarfed here the mood that is set by the film from the word go is the best part of it you get the feeling that something is not around you and slowly you tend to feel that you are also a part of it no gore fest no blood spills still enough to scare the hell out you if you are looking for some genuine horror never miss this one you may need some sedatives for a good nights sleep,astonish
hello people of imdb this is my first review after reading that this movie barely got a 610 lets go i am not a horror type i tend to avoid horror movies unless they can teach me something the story has to be solid and the characters has to be credible i loved the ring i adore it even if its born as a bookand recently i enjoyed the woman in black and the awakening i consider myself an openminded guy if something may be like that i agree with you if something seems impossible i think its possible if you say why i answer why notive been suggested to watch and so i did its not a horror movie is a spiritual movie a lesson movie tells you theres this and this you may take it as pure fiction and keep eating your popcorn until the credits or you can actually believe you can actually understand that the world we live in is not ours only we live in an energy world a world full of spirit we possess the spirit but we are not the only one we are not the only living beings here or anyway not on this level and if you venture further and further into the other levels you may lose yourself and what you will find you may not like it so in all honesty if youre going to watch just as a horror movie youll have your share of jumps but thats it if youre going to watch as a lesson youll learn a lot trust me,astonish
at first glance seems like it might just be a retread of the classic films that influenced it such as poltergeist obviously and the entity it even has actress barbara hershey whod starred in the latter film but fortunately screenwriter  costar leigh whannell and director james wan do some interesting things with the premise and prevent it from becoming a cheese fest they create some bona fide atmosphere and chills here is definitely for the horror fan bemoaning the focus on gore and cheap thrills in more recent genre fare its got a number of jump moments but they actually work most of the time because theyre not expected and its all acted with the utmost sincerity by a good castpatrick wilson and rose byrne star as josh and renai lambert a young couple settling into their new house with two boys and an infant girl in tow after the son dalton ty simpkins takes a spill in the attic he soon slips into what seems to be a coma but is something different altogether after supernatural experiences begin to be too much for renai to bear joshs mother lorraine hershey calls in a medium friend of hers named elise horror veteran lin shaye but things only get worse after that josh learns that its up to him to resolve matterswhannell who plays the part of specs and wan deserve some credit for creating a film that genuinely manages to creep a viewer out wan takes his time doling out the imagery carefully bit by bit until the big finale where an alternate dimension dubbed by elise as the further must be entered and even when the story requires its primary demon played by joseph bishara the films composer to be shown a little more the character doesnt lose that much effectiveness certainly one successful element is the convincing enough creation of disturbing surrealism in many scenes and the song tiptoe through the tulips is made even more creepy than it already was wilson and byrne are easy to sympathize with as the parents and its always a delight to see shaye and hershey in anything child actor simpkins does alright in his roleclearly the film is designed to end the way that it does in order to set up the sequel but it does leave one wanting moreseven out of 10,astonish
as my title says any follower of horror pictures in the las 30 years will find his way in this movie the first act is a perfect clone of amityville with blows and whistles and second act is a perfect clone of poltergeist then we go to the third act now we have to look past that as we are aficionados of the horror genre so we look past that and what do we see itz obviously a movie addressed to the geeks  ie us in that nobody but us could catch the allusions to former classics in each act in act 1 it was clearly the amityville horror in act 2 it was just as clearly poltergeist 1 in act 3 however thats where it began to strike its own i like movies where it slashes and clashes but dont want to talk about it anyway this movie is at the crux point between amityville horror poltergeist and supernatural its really worth a view and then some,astonish
most horror movies ease you into the various degrees of the fear factor skips the series of subtle scary foreshadowing and dives deep into horrifying scene sequences there are too many lame films in this genre that can make a viewer become immune to scenes that have others screaming like children this movie will pierce through that immunity and have you freaked out and jumping out of your seat what makes the final third of the film bad its the transition from a feeling of paranormal possessionlevel fear to a fun housetype creepiness which fails to deliver unfortunately the conclusion of the movie can leave the viewer feeling disappointed is it worth watching absolutely the beginning is so superb that it makes up for the ending and wont be a waste of time,astonish
is a confident attempt at reviving the haunted house genre in more of a creepy and disturbed fashion from the nostalgic bloodred opening credits to the chilling twist at the end james wans well crafted gem will get under your skin and into your minda married couple josh and renaipatrick wilson and rose byrne have recently moved into their new home and it isnt long before theyre eldest son dalton ty simpkins slips rather easily into a coma which doctors find no cause this coma marks the start of the spirit realm on the loose or as the movie refers to it as the further the first half of the film is some of the best horror filmography ive seen in a while its main asset is its ability to leave the horror in the viewers imagination ironically this ideal is totally bashed in the latter half and if youve seen the movie youll be wellaware of what im talking about in spite of this the movie definitely serves some wellcooked scares throughout and most importantly will leave the lasting impression horror fanatics have been looking forwan is beginning to monopolize the horror genre his recent chillfest the conjuring has simply outplayed all other competition alike and genuinely raises the bar for haunted house horrors may not be the standout poltergeist film that ardent horror fans know and love but is a sincerely spinechilling attempt at horror done well 910  definitely one to see,astonish
while i found the plot interesting the scarefactor was a big disappointment without the sound effects the movie wouldnt have been at all scary maybe a little thrilling but not scary the demon looked like a wellmade halloween costume the dollfaced ghosts werent even a little bit realistic and dont look like they could have been people once upon a time and the ending was nothing but predictablei did enjoy the plot though and also the actors everyone but the boy there were no terrible special effects which is a big plus in my book i found the plot development refreshing this time the characters actually moved out when they got scared contrary to most other characters in most other movies who very frustratingly stick around until they get themselves killedbut long before the end i already knew what was about to happen and to whom sadly i find most horrormovie endings disappointing and this one was no exception it would have been so much more refreshing if things had gone well if there had been a happy ending,astonish
its too bad when wan goes along beautifully and then loses his grip thats the only real problem here and kindly ignore reviews trashing the acting etc its uniformly solid with believable leads and wilson nicely avoids what could be a pretty boy trap the scares begin and build creatively and the direction keeps you in pace with the victims yes the whole idea is poltergeist but absolutely everythings been done before anyway and what matters is the novelty of approach this film brings it sadly the rescue of the boy in the further is just too too protracted and relies too much on stock horror nightmare props id have preferred plain murky for why would these lost souls be so fetishistic over scary dolls and creepy music this is a dimension after all and not a realm within a persons mind which might explain those elements andi wanted a happy ending sorry but i did all that said however its highly watchable and light years better than all the slashersadism porn calling itself horror,astonish
this is a fun horror film to watch mostly because its not the same crap that gets pawned off as horror these days when weve had more than a halfdozen saw movies and i am aware that the same people made this movie and other such flops its nice to have a horror movie that doesnt rely on blood and goreeven though it was very clear to the audience that the house itself wasnt haunted i liked that fresh approach the entities were all creepy but they also werent required to have all that much on screen time to do their work the visit to the further region was cool weird but also spookythe acting was subpar at some points but it wasnt too bad the special effects were pretty goodmy only complaint is that the movie was sometimes too dark that it was hard to see what was going on this could have been the provider fearnethadnt optimized the film for presentation but there were points where i figured it was supposed to be scary but i had no clue what was going onanyway i enjoyed this film hopefully it and others like it such as the conjuring are a sign of things to come from the movie industry for the horror genre there are predictions that the era of the blockbuster is coming to an end maybe that will mean hollywood will focus on making good movies instead of expensive movies,astonish
this weekend my girl and i are going to see 2 so we decided last night wed rewatch the first movie havent seen it since theaters so we get the popcorn ready and everything and put the movie on only to be scared out of our minds within the first 30 minthis movie has everything you want in a scary movie the music is suspenseful and not overly tacky like most crappy horror movies the acting is alright however the plot really messed with me i really enjoyed that the demon thing attacks no matter what time it is or what house the whole only when its dark or only in the basement idea about horror movies really bothers me i also enjoyed that the demon really didnt give a crap who or what was trying to mess with it it wants the kid it gets the kid the movie kind of reminded me about of the new evil dead movie where when hit starts hitting the fan it just goes and goes until the movie endslastly i loved that there is a sequel and that it didnt end happy just makes me want to watch the new one that much more i cannot wait till sunday ill be posting back afterwards if i make it alive ahhhhhdb,astonish
this film was incredibly entertaining from beginning till the end no time is wasted setting an ominous tone creepy title scene with screechy violins in the background invokes many emotions and lets the audience know they are in for a treat jump off your seats moments are plentiful and well timed there are fun and campy scenes that lull you into a false sense of security but the viewer should not let their guard down definitely had some of the best sense of tempo and dynamics i have seen in a horror film everyone in the audience walked away a bit shaken and worn out from the viewing but laughing about how much fun it was i am very excited for chapter 2,astonish
subtle and spooky go together like spiders and cobwebs in malaysian director james wans psychic chiller this imaginative yarn deals with haunted houses astral demons and the outofbody abduction of an adolescent wan and his screen writing partner leigh whannell who collaborated as director and writer on saw and dead silence have retreated from the obvious literal world of saw and plunged into the nightmarish oblivion of the further paranormal activity producers jason blum steven schneider and oriel peli have fashioned another one of those horror movies that doesnt seem scary nobody gets butchered by a maniac and wallows in a pool of blood created by severed limbs and legs nevertheless is all the more terrifying for its refusal to indulge in gore astral projection lies at the heart of this creepy 102minute pg13 opus astral projection is an outofbody experience such as when people die but survive and return to talk about their brief journey into the void the worst thing that you can expect from is the appearance of otherworldly individuals who slip up behind our young married couple and generally create chaos in their house things take a turn for the worst when renai rose byrne of bridemaids and josh lambert patrick wilson of watchmen move into another house renai convinced josh to move them from an older house to a new house after a series of eerie events occurred that made her skin crawl one of their two sons dalton lambert ty simpkins ventured into the attic of the older house climbed a ladder and then fell from it the following day when josh tried to awaken dalton in the morning to get him ready for school he got no response the baffled doctors believe that dalton has sunk into a coma but joshs mother lorraine lambert barbara hershey of beaches suspects something more sinister lorriane brings one of her oldest friends elise rainier lin shaye of 2001 maniacs over to visit with them initially a pair of paranormal technicians specs leigh whannell of saw and tucker angus sampson appear with an arsenal of exotic equipment to make sure that josh and renai arent nut jobs after tucker spots a couple of ladies clad in white in a hall way he assures specs that it is time to summon elise to assist her eventually we learn that josh is an astral traveler and elise dispatches him to find his son in what she calls the further wan relies on sympathetic performances upsetting music and surprises to keep interesting the unsavory but interesting conclusion comes as a jarring shock nevertheless qualifies as a neat but effective whiteknuckled exercise in suspense,astonish
i never post reviews on imdb for movies if i did i feel i would spend most of my life doing so but looking at the current movie review when you first jump on the page i completely disagree and i feel another perspective may help people who are considering watching for the first timei have seen just about every horror film you can think of from mainstream to independent asian and european etc not a lot scares me other than maybe the strangers but is a film with a truly intriguing storyline excellent acting and genuine scaresits not the type of film that relies heavily on death counts or blood and gore but goes right back to how a horror film should be  scary and eerie and should have an unsettling feeling in your stomach days after watching itis a ghost story with a twist and defiantly something not yet done in previous horror films yes it does borrow from the likes of films like poltergeist but does not copy it just borrows certain elements and makes it its owni am not going to give you a run down of scene for scene or any spoilers as i think you would get the gist from the synopsis and i dont want to ruin anything but i will tell you has a classic horror feeling right from the introduction the music is so creepy that it makes you feel uncomfortable the scares are disturbingly eerie and the acting is top notch this movie is a 1010 for me nd no matter how many times i watch i i still feel uncomfortable thats what a true horror film should do always stay with you each and everytime you watch itchapter 2 comes out this weekend in the usa i have to wait a bit long as im in perth australia but once you watch and see how the movie finishes youll be running to the cinema to see what happens nextwill remain a classic horror film and will not be forgotten in years to come,astonish
if you like me are a fan of the old ways you should not be disappointed by this movie usually when theres a new horror movie the conditions for being scared are nullified from the getgo because of all the irritating traits like young people who speak in the latest cool way of speaking and special effectsmonsters that could be deemed wild and crazy or if theyre going for a more subtle feel it usually ends up like a goth rock music video or a new age medium tv show the somewhat young couple in this movie thankfully act a bit older than they are at least by todays standards and help the movie maintain a bit of if you could use such a word today solemnity its amazing that it can be combined with the movie actually being really overthe top in some departments its just done with that 70s80s italian style in some way where you could freak out with themes and still maintain respectability mixed with the asian style of the 90s and early 00s ringu etc where horror is so much magnified due to the downtoearth tone and lack of hollywood modernness,astonish
first of all there is nothing like horror in the movie except one or two scenes movie was interesting in second half only and that two when those two men came and start exploring the souls else its a time waste in terms of acting the actress did a fine job i dont know how it managed to take a place under the imdbs top ten horror movies list which includes scariest movies like the grudgethe ending could be better but it seems that making second part of any movie has become a trend and thats why in this movie also john become the monster i means its completely ridiculousanyway i am giving it 4 out of 10 3 for movie and 1 additional point giving respect to the top 10 horror list of imdb,astonish
i decided to finally get around to seeing this film after seeing that it was time for the second one to come out and i found the conjuring to be a pretty good modern horror movie for the first hour of the movie i found the suspense and scares to be well done its not often that i can compliment a modern horror movie for that for the last 40 minutes of the movie however i didnt enjoy nearly as much while it still had that creepy mood i didnt really have the same feeling as the first half of the film this movie did a good job of establishing its own mythology in the confines of its world and i found it to be overall pretty well done however the being that was shown only in shadows was better done by just sticking to the shadows later in the movie they show it up close and it lost a little bit of the edge it had while keeping to the edges of sight the home of this thing was also quite well done for the design and definitely had a sense of dark humor about it with the workshop tiny tim music was greatthe ending which a lot of people seem to have issues with makes sense to me personally just due to all the threads laid out all throughout the runtime however it left some unanswered questions that im hoping the sequel will elaborate on and allow for a 2part end to this storyline instead of pulling a paranormal activity which still leaves some unknown things in the air for yearsoverall i actually do recommend this movie it has a well done suspense feel for the most part and was definitely an enjoyable film for myself since i usually wind up just rewatching horror movies in the 80s and further back i gave this movie a 710 due to some of the issues with the tone change at the hour mark the for lack of a better term sequel bait ending that didnt fully cover the ramifications and some points that i just wound up losing interest due to some parts having some slow pacingregardless of these things just watch the movie and decide for yourself its certainly not a bad movie by any stretch and will allow for some enjoyment of the modern movie market at least for a horror fan,astonish
the movie is as good as any horror movie one can get i definitely wanna see this movie in the top 250 and ones rarely gonna see anything better than this from the beginning till the endeverything is perfectly done be it the acting or the plot itselfits a delight for all the horror movie fans out there i strongly recommend this movie to everyone many reviews out there compare it with the poltergeist and term it as a poor remake but i just dont agree with any of those reviews although everyone is free to express themselves wherever and whenever they feel like this movie is among my all time favorite horror movieshowever the only problem with this movie is its depiction of the demon the special effectsgraphics could have been better but they still could convey what they wanted to showalso one should keep this in mind that this is actually a low budget movie moreover the fearscare in the movie doesnt come from looking at the demon but by the plot and the story of the moviejust dont get confused by reading any of the negative reviews out there and give this movie a fair chance im certain that this movie is gonna entertain like any horror movie fan out there and will definitely give one a good scare with quite a few frightening moments some goosebumps and a feeling of uneasiness throughoutdespite being not a perfect movie i still rate it 1010 may be i could have rated it 910 but i want the movie to move up a bit in overall imdb ratings,astonish
james wans 2010 suffered from the same fate that unfortunately a lot of modern day original horror films suffer from asking the audience to suspend their disbelief just a little too muchthe opening thirty minutes were promising with the film seemingly setting up a solid group of questions that were worthy of answers whose kid is that whats that creepy music is the mother imagining this whys the dad never been caught in a photographunfortunately leigh whannells script never took us to what i felt would be appropriate answers to any of them with the saw 2004 writer instead taking the film on a run through alternate universes and demon mythology wrapped in to one daddy reestablishes himself as the centre of the home piece which seemed entirely formulated and lacking in originality at its base 2010 was always going to be a horror film that intended to make you jump from your seat and it did a pretty good job of presenting those moments however in asking its audience to believe that the child was lost in an alternate reality and that the only way to save him was for his father who could do the same thing to go in after him and return him home just seemed way too much of an almost instant widening of the audiences perception of reality and thus alienated the more logical viewer like myself from that point on i became disinterested and therefore not very afraid perhaps that was my lack of imagination or my vast disappointment that such a potentially great 21st century horror descended in to something i wasnt much of a fan of either way it failed to thrill me for 23s of its runtime despite acceptable presentation and such an intense and promising opening,astonish
wellthis movie had me for the majority of its running time the acting is good cinematography atmosphere and plot were strong as well then theres the dream like state and endingill keep it at that to be spoiler freeso weak the demon creature has a tailnuff said its just too typical for me if this movie scared anyone they are probably 9 years old this isnt horror paranormal activity spawned all these ghastly ghostly movies so therefor i blame that franchise for this type of flick where are the scares where is the terror where is the horror oh yeah it doesnt exist stop killing my genre of movies thank you,astonish
by far this is my favorite horror movie ever i havent watched anything like it its not the typical horror movie they are mostly with blood and guts spilled all over the place while this one focuses more on ones psyche which is really rare ive watched this movie only twice but both times it was creeping me out combination of good sound effects and creepy pictures make you unable to sleep afterwords the ending was so unpredictable and brutal that i was shocked by it although i havent seen the actors before in any movie i can say they did a really good job portraying the characters in the very best way they could i recommend this movie to everyone,astonish
is a horror film that doesnt rely on gore to scare its audience it instead relies on an eerie atmosphere to frighten us the paranormal and surreal aspects of the film are reminiscent of horror classics the exorcist and the shining be warned has plenty of jump scares these jump scares however unlike most today are anything but cheap the films script as well as james wans direction is fantastic giving the viewer a relentless sense of paranoia throughout the films entirety the plot surprisingly delves deep into a supernatural story that is hauntingly fascinating the less you know before watching this movie the better insidous will keep you up until 300am and give you a sense of urgency to make sure there is no one standing behind your bedroom window,astonish
i watched this film for the first time recently after hearing good things i had previously viewed sinister and was told that was a similar type of scary although the film has some great scream and goose bump inducing moments i felt that the second half and specifically the climax were lacking the film started off presenting the viewer with some genuinely scary imagery and moments but into the later parts of the film it began to become in my opinion silly minor spoilers follow in the climax of the film i thought the netherworld sequence was not very scary and actually took some of the fear away from the movie the fire faced entity was more laughable than scary the final scene of the movie offered a good twist but could not make up for what was a disappointing climax to the film i hope the upcoming sequel can improve upon this ones mistakes ps if you are looking for a very scary film that is also very good then i would recommend sinister enjoy,astonish
its very hard to find a good horror movie these days but is definitely one of the better ones i loved for not doing a lot of cheap jump scares or using lots of gore is a lot more subtle than that it might be something in the background but its a lot creepier when you notice the scare after a few seconds it had a bit of originality in it but it was a little too close to other paranormal movies to be extremely memorable that being said as i sat there in the dark at 2 in the morning watching this it did terrify me it may not be as original as saw or paranormal activity when they first came out but it is certainly a good horror movie and with 2 coming out it could be the start of a new franchise,astonish
the premise is pretty good although it put me in mind of poltergeist with the whole having to go to another world to save someone or the classic part of amityville 8 with the final attic scene this was a very promising storyline however it tries so hard to be realistic from the off then trails off into fantasy land sigh i really felt for the characters originally struggling with their young son who suddenly one day after a fall is in a coma cue distraught mother and absent working late aggro father refusing to believe that the house is haunted after weird things suddenly start to happen before finding irrefutable evidence  who does not look at their kids wall and see drawings when trying to find out what has happened to them they spend a good deal of time in his bedroom but never spot a massive clue some scenes genuinely had me freaked the shoes and the little boy dalton walking around while in a coma was very eerie the creepy guy stood by him pointing the house in the further with the very odd family but the main demon well not so much didnt even look scary a pierced darth maul esque face with blue eyesthe classic cloven hooves under furry legs and razor sharp teeth showing hints of a forked tonguehmmm sure it was at the point where he is filing his claws on a sander surrounded by puppets in some phantom of the opera worthy setting that i felt the movie had lost its way slightly also the wholecreepy psychic woman who knows more than she lets on mothers propheticflashback dream and of course the token over exuberant paranormal investigators made me think tired clichs but they did manage to make some scenes more realistic in this attempt at leastso a few too many clichs and cookie cutter horror scenarios later the hey im a psychic somethings up with your house you know that cause i pause mid sentence and give that look but dismiss it solets look round hereohyep a ghostlets break it to the family person x not i refuse to get help you are full of it oh no wait my badthe house is falling apart   ok maybe we should do this lets call a spirit astral bodyooh geez that escalated quickly its gone wrong and spirits are attacking us lets go to the other world to save someone and follow someones voice back pauses for air the one saving grace drum roll twist at the end hurray and yes ever the hard to please vieweri humbly admit i didnt see this coming or fully grasp it pretty open to interpretation and now i see whysequel good callso now i am actually looking forward to seeing things unravel further in 2 lets hope it can redeem some of its flaws,astonish
this has actually been the second time ive watched this film i remembered it was excellent and terrifying i just didnt remember how much now ive seen it again so i could review and rate it and even though i remembered the twists and the ending it still scared the living daylight out of mei usually start off with the buildup and the story but in this case ill save the best for last the acting has been absolutely excellent by the entire cast ive especially enjoyed the slight and subtle comic relief by leigh whannell and angus sampson as specs and tucker they give a few seconds of comic atmosphere enough to give us a breather from being absolutely terrified and not enough to spoil the overall sensation of utter fear speaking of utter fear  the cinematography and sound effects have also been excellent right on the spot for a ghost story horror subgenre so far the scariest ghosts ive seen have been in the ring and the grudge so im a big fan of the japanese way of portraying a ghost in this case  the macabre style spirits have really frightened me especially the framecut shots where moment second they are expressionless and then suddenly they smile a neurotic deranged smilenow for the best part  the story the build up is a little slow and slightly empty of event to the point of boredom but becomes packed with fear and thrill at just the right time proving that patience pays off as for the story  in one word wow during the past years at least from my experience as a devout horror freak in general and a huge fan of ghost stories in particular in such films the main focus is on the hauntings physical manifestations moving furniture shattered light bulbs doors openingclosing suddenly etc andor on the ghost itself very few screenplays have a truly genius original and horrifying story with the exception of the haunting in connecticut where the story is original as it is brilliant in however the screen writing has been in my opinion flawless almost perfect an original and simply excellent idea using astral projection as the connection to the world of spirits its been long since ive been so impressed id like to shake the hands of writer leigh whannell and director james wan for creating one of the best horror films in historynow for some criticism or what this time i call why im not giving a perfect 10 without giving any spoilers  i just want to say i was very disappointed with the demon thats mentioned towards the middle the way its visually portrayed is so banal so obvious and unoriginal and thats very obvious in such a film where the main idea is as original and superb as it is why use such a cheap and terrible overdone design simply a shame however thats the one and only thing i didnt like edit ive just now looked at the overall rating here and im furious so im going to do what i feel is right be subjective and rate it 10 for justices sake shame on the imdb raters for this filmall in all  i think just might be the best non asian ghost story ive ever seen i cant recommend it enough im a grown man and an experienced horror fan and i dont scare easily and yet will give me nightmares dont you dare miss out on this one,astonish

this was a movie that seriously scared me i got very uncomfortable in the theater had the scariest most unsettling vibe ever when i first saw it there was one part that i literally got an empty feeling where it scared me so bad even at the first of the movie i was scared just the feeling it gave me the music was even ridiculous it took a very open mind to make this movie is a movie that will creep you out and make you think more than actually scare you yeah it made you jump a lot throughout the movie but there were many scenes that were just too creepy i loved this movie and was very satisfying because i was hoping it would be scary and it definitely was,astonish
contains spoilers ok so i am assuming the readers of this rant have some interest in horror flicks or why else would you be researching this movie well let me say that this one was on the verge of greatness let me explain you know how most of the so called scary movies out there are either to corny like zombie strippers or so slow and drawn out that you want to eat your own arm off before any action occurs like paranormal activity you wont have that problem in this film the reason i say was on the verge of greatness has nothing to do with the acting or script itself but with the makeup malfunction you see right in the middle of the movie when this film is scaring most people senseless imagine my surprise when darth maul phantom menace appears as the demon i mean there are some subtle differences but come on its darth maul this was such a great movie and i encourage any horror fan to watch it i just think that they could have made a better demon anyway thats my two cents i hope you enjoy the movie,astonish
do not expect gore gimmicks and other things their previous films had this is new this is what horror is all abouti am a scare lover and i suppose over this course i have become desensitized nothing scares me hardly but this did for most people i talked to this movie stuck with us the unsettling feeling even going to see it multiple times knowing what was going to happen it was terrifying see true horror is an art it relies on subconscious cues and perfect timing most scary movies basically announce scares with cues that we all have come to pick up on music silence camera angles we hold our breath in preparation and are not scared never lets you be ready for anything the combination of an amazingly disturbing soundtrack and never really having safe scenes sits you on your utmost edge of discomfort and stress creating true terror the timing is so that your brain after years of scary movie training subconsciously guesses wrong when and what will happen this makes all the differencei will say you must go into the movie wanting a journey an experience and a desire to be scared to enjoy it dont be a critic just enjoy it watch this if you want a new experience a different take on terror not blood it is a work of art and a lot of fun,astonish
this would have to be one of the most unoriginal unimaginative and predictable horror films i have seen in a long timeseriously if anyone over the age of 15 finds this movie scary they seriously need to get a life and develop an imaginationeverything about this film is totally unoriginal and has been done at least a dozen times beforeright from the start we have the usual clich of a loving unsuspecting family who move into a large house with their adorable kids its so innocent boring and lame that you just know evil lurks around the next scene and ofcourse it all starts with the kidwho would have guessedthen we have our usual period of scary things going on doors opening shadowy figures appearing objects being flown around the place etc etc etc all this is followed by the standard team of ghost busters starting off with the local priest and moving on to the clairvoyant and her special powers then off we go on a scary journey to the dark side and to fight the forces of evil and rescue the young and innocent child whooooooo no need to bore you with the rest of the predictable details as im sure anyone with half a brain can work out the resti found some of the so called ghosts particularly amusing one looked as if he escaped from a goth party i also found the clairvoyants gas maskghost communicator also amusingneedless to say this film put me to sleep on more than one occasion and robbed 102 minutes of my lifego watch scary movie instead its more entertaining and probably less predicable,astonish
let me start by saying im a huge fan of leigh whannell and james wan teaming up both saw and dead silence were tremendously entertaining films with great atmosphere and stories i knew i had to check out but i was skeptical because i feared they might have delved too far into the supernatural side of things in fact they have for my liking but thats ok because theyve put an original spin on it as theyre talented at doing and that pulls it throughthe acting was solid enough rose byrne and patrick wilson carry the story through without ever making you think wow lin shaye couldve been better cast in my opinion her delivery in some of the explanation scenes wasnt eerie enough for my liking and the characters of specs played by whannell and tucker were too lighthearted for my liking and took away from the creepy atmosphere the film was working so hard to createfor me was a cross between the exorcist and the cabin in the woods it reminded me of the cabin in the woods because it created a story which seemed to allow for any creature of any type and appearance to pretty much jump out of anywhere at anytime lots of fun to make a film with that being the case id imagine and the similarities between this and the exorcist need no explanationone flaw for me was that i never really felt the characters were in enough danger the rules if youd call them that laid out allow too much comfort for the characters things were constantly jumping out but it never felt like once theyd jumped out they were actually going to do anything overly menacinga good film for those who like to get the heart racing a bit if you liked saw and dead silence expect things a little bit different but still up to the same quality and standard i read in the trivia section leigh whannell made a conscious effort to avoid clichs and he did this well everything here is pretty original and you certainly wont find yourself groaning at any never saw that coming moments also as these filmmakers have treated us to in the past youll get a nice little surprise at the end enjoy,astonish
i have just finished forcing myself to watch this film for the second timeand i say forced because i still havent gotten over seeing it in the theatre last year this film stays with you long after you get home then as you timidly start to turn off the lights to go to bedyou realise how much it has affected you let me start this review by saying that is a horror film that has taken on board all the scare tactics that every brilliant thriller horror has accomplishedthen meticulously uses these tactic to take you on rollercoaster of emotions from slight paranoia to downright i cant breath im so scared fearimmediately as the opening credits begin stirring your inner paranoid thoughtsis blasted on the screen with threatening strings playing in the background with an old school thrillerpsycho motif and you already have hairs on your arms prickling with anticipation you soon find your ears tingling at the slightest sound and your eyes searching for creatures in the shadows and the film continues in this fashion for the next 103 mins leaving you sinking back in your chair dreading the next scene because your every sense is terrifiedi dont want to ruin the story for you with specifics but like any horror you must let the film take you on the ride the bad guy is scary as hell and while there are sawesque elements to the film this film stands alone as its own entity i commend these guys for bringing out another psychologically played movie where your mind leads you into deeper fear and the film makers take full advantage of thisplease if you are a scare seeker you must see this film these guys know what they are doingand maybe wear a nappy cause you are at risk of wetting your pants the story could have sunk had it not been the brilliant directing and actors involved the beautiful rose byrne leads a fantastic cast that you care for and sometimes have a laugh at they actually respond in a realistic way which makes the film more believablethe only thing that i took 1 point off for was how the bad guy was depicted in the end 10 mins where we really see it for what it is this is where the sawesque elements are really seen and it takes away from the horrifying way we are introduced to it its almost like there is no real big show downhowever the film has scares coming at you until the bitter end enjoybut leave some lights on in the housetrust me,astonish
instead of reviewing this movie i decided to put an actual conversation with my brother which i had on the messenger after watching the movie both of us are usually afraid of watching a horror moviemr y says what are u doingmr x says just watched a moviemr y says ok which onemr x says mr y says oh that horror moviemr x says yeah scary onemr y says that is why i havent watched itmr x says its scarymr y says i think so i want to watch it too but im scaredmr x says dont watch it i didnt watch the screen when something scary was going to happen he he i just looked away from the screen and watched it back when intense and scary scenes relieved but gradually i got into it at later half and dared to watch itmr y says did you watch it alone or were there others watching with youmr x says no i watched it alone the ghosts are not that scary but the thrills are unexpected and it is a scary story too there are some scenes which are really frighteningmr y says ill watch it during daytimemr x says ok but dont be too scared itll scare you moremr y says hmmmr x says for a relief the ghosts are not so scary but when they appear they thrill you good but once you know the ghosts youll be less scaredmr y says okmr x says but watch it during daytimemr y says yeahmr x says try to look the ghosts in funny way theyll make you laugh may be dont put so much scare in your head while watching this moviemr y says okmr x says some ghosts are funny looking too you might laugh later after movie just dont build up the scare too much i had too much hype coz i read some reviews which claimed it was really scarymr y says no but even the trailer is scarymr x says he he you might be really frightened for the first half hour or more but as i said if you are scared itll scare you more its a good horror movie after all,astonish
i wont go into an in depth revue because the movie doesnt warrant it most people who didnt like the film have noted that at seems that it was two movies stuck together with the first half having some nice chills and a certain level of tension but the second half being a typical mish mash of reused horror clichs i concurother reviewers also have noted that american horror movies show too much this is also a valid criticism in almost all horror movies once you know the nature of the evil and once the protagonist moves beyond fear all horror is gone and then it usually just becomes an actionadventure movie with fights chases and loud noises this is exactly what happens in this movie finally it uses too many stock horror movie clichsthe shadowy figure that moves across the room initially out of the line of sight of the charactersthe husband who doesnt take the supernatural situation seriously even though he has seen all the objects in the kids room move at their own volitionand finally worst of all the possession in the final scene ensuring a sequel if you want real chills rent some of the truly frightening movies coming out of asia,astonish
the only thing scary about this movie is that i will never get my 103 minutes back the story line is great could have been great a lot more could have been done with this story line and it is really a shame the effects were terrible almost laughable not at all what i was expecting from the same people that created saw almost nothing happens during the first half yes half of the movie and i considered just turning it off them should have because it was extremely boring i have a very active imagination and am usually very afraid of most horrors movies and this just did not deliver i cannot believe the amount of wonderful reviews this movie has i thought for sure i would be having a sleepless night but quite the opposite if this is what horror movies are coming to then i am done watching them,astonish
1010 for sure if you want a good fright this is perfect very scary and intense i watched it with a group of friends and we all screamed so much its very jumpy straight from the start and the music although slightly clich adds greatly to the intensity throughouti have seen many frightening films similar to this such as paranormal activity night of the demons and many others that were made for a similar affect but this was by far the scariest ive seen i really think this should have been rated higher than pg13 though im 15 which is the english rating for this film and i found it extremely disturbing i strongly advise against young children seeing this although theres not any strong gore or violence i think the disturbing and very jumpy scenes are enough to terrify people of any age still it was a brilliant brilliant film,astonish
i watched that the ratings of the movie is 68 and i think it is still underrated the making of the movie so awesome that its frightens people it is only comparable to the movie the exorcist the most important thing about the movie is the scary part of the movie is properly placed that makes me frightened some part of the movie may seem like monotonous but i think it was for maintaining sequence of the movie the acting was also good i think hollywood made a real horror film after a long time after the exorcistone last thing about the movie is if someone watch this before sleep he or she cant sleep without a cold feeling of fear,astonish
of any genre this ridiculous turd makes battlefield earth look like casablanca there are parts of airplane that are scarier than the scariest parts of this movie the ending and i only watched the whole flick because it got to the point where i had to see if it could get any more idiotic is laughable and the most frightening part of the entire timewasting experience is the way that the formerly hot barbara hershey has aged on the other hand it was fun to see farrelly bothers favorite lin shaye in a role like this and patrick wilson did give us lynch in the a team so they get a pass but james wan should be waterboardedhave i made myself clear,astonish
is the new horror movie from james wan and leigh whannell who brought us the original saw movie and the 2007 movie dead silence which was also reviewed on this blog is the best scary movie of 2011 so far it is not gory and bloody like saw but returns to the basics how to really scare you in a deep and authentic way with out resorting to cheap violenceis a story that that crosses two popular horror sub genres the haunted house and demonic possession with this film director james wan has created some of the creepiest and nightmare inducing images to be seen in a long time along with the musical score by joseph bishara who also acts as the main villain they have created a truly frightening filmthe lambert family has just moved into you typical dark and foreboding new house the doors creak the attic is cold and dark and things just dont feel right as the family of five starts settling in when dalton the younger of the two boys has a mishap while exploring the attic he seems fine but doesnt wake up the next morning after a trip to the emergency room he checks out to be perfectly healthy but in a sort of coma over the next few days the mother played by rose byrne is freaked out by the strange things going on inside the house think poltergeist when she is attacked by a ghost she begs her husband josh patrick wilson to move they do to smaller and happier looking place but the ghosts and spirits seem to have followed them they have a paranormal team investigate and find out that the house is not haunted its your son this plot twist and how the rest of the movie unfolds has alienated some viewers but if youve come this far you might as well strap in and enjoy the ridedalton is stuck in and other worldly dimension called the further a sort of purgatory for demons and lost souls lin shaye plays elise a paranormal medium who seeks to bring back dalton to his earthly body before it is taken over the premise is no doubt out there but the filmmakers know this and really go for it there are not cheap scares in this movie no cats jumping out of the dark no flocks of birds hiding in the shadows theyve created a roster of truly frightening baddies in the old woman the lipstickface demon and the doll face girls whats more amazing is that this film was made for only one and a half million dollars and grossed over 58 million in theatersthe movie was also produced by the paranormal activity people but actually delivers on the scares is now available on dvd blu ray on demand red box and probably more so see it today,astonish
the movie starts with average duringthetitle scene and later becomes more boring and just at the point when you start losing interest in the movie then and there you see scenes that surely bring your interest back but then you start thinking that this is just an average hauntedhouse drama and again you put your thoughts away because you start being served with scenes and sounds that blow off your mind and force you keep your eyes and ears closed for the next 60 mins but if you take my advice dont close your eyes or even ears because this movie is a treat to watch and if you can watch this movie with your eyes open all the time then i bet you can watch almost 90 of other horror movies because they are no way close to if horror movies start getting the oscars i think would grab a few of them because it really deserves it,astonish
i gave this movie a 2 and that was really pushing it poorly cgd no shock or horror value at all completely lacking in suspense being a horror fan for over 20 years from the artistic styles of the korean horrors to the suspense filled japanese tales all those decent titles america can occasionally produce that is not a ripoff of the success foreign versions im more than happy to say this movie was a complete let down and although arty in places this alone was not enough to save this messavoid if you can but if you do get forced into watching it and are bored stiff by the 30 minute mark you thisit doesnt get better in fact it gets worse,astonish
sorry to say it but this entire movie was an experiment in how to jump the shark or nuke the fridge or whatever you want to call it i am so glad i did not pay to see this in a theater i would have asked for my money back after walking out half an hour in with elements from other better movies youd hope this would have been more interesting  but no amount of ripping off from poltergeist can save it every single character was wooden and uninteresting and i had no desire to see any of them live through the movie not one not even the kids the so called suspense wasnt suspenseful the plot was so thin and predictable i am surprised m night whats his name didnt write it at one point i looked at my husband and said for crying out louddid they really just go there a total face palm moment i really really love a good haunted househaunted kidsomething evil under the bed type movie this wasnt it,astonish
the man behind the original saw and the full feature james wan directed this supernatural horror dont think that you will have something in the saw style or some gory shots it isnt going to be it do has a feeling like paranormal activity but add an extra to it it even has something to do with poltergeist so you can guess what you will seeit was never scary or whatsoever i think it failed a bit due the entities walking around they werent believable at all the acting was okay but it fails storywise the entities walking around in real life makes it a bit ridiculous when renai lambert rose byrne encounters them it wasnt convincing for me it was in fact a mixture between asian ghost stories and european ghost stories it wasnt all that bad but i was just sitting there and at the end i thought this isnt that creepy after allgore 05 nudity 05 effects 25 story 25 comedy 05,astonish
this movie was of poor quality and poor plot line the story was not believable i read in peoples magazine that a child actually died in the making of this movie apparently there was a horrible accident in one of the scenes where the child fell off a ladder and broke his collarbone he later succumbed to his injuries in the hospital rip exploitation at its finest at the finale of the movie where the demon possessed father chokes out the ghosts whisperer to her death is puke inducing and horrible acted i swear i saw her smile at one pointoverall tasteless and there was way too much sexuality just another run of the mill horror movie,astonish
im not scared easily but this one had me sitting on the edge of my seat quite uncomfortably for the most part of the film this is definitely one of the best thrillers ive seen in a long time im more inclined to classify it as thriller because there arent too many standard horror scenes of blood and gore its a spiritual thriller i think one of the main reasons i found this so appealing was that it didnt stick to the traditions style of suspense most suspense films have a very large build up to a quick startling moment while sticks this this method quite a bid its individual because it cuts between seriousfrightening and turns around to be almost disturbinghumorous and then back so fast it would just catch you unaware leaving you wondering how you feel about what you just saw in any case its great cinema,astonish
i sat down to watch this movie with mixed feelings i love horror films nut recently hollywood has been churning out thrash in this genre with few notable exceptions like the descent even the much over hyped paranormal activity seemed to me to be a boring experiment in cinematographythen a film like comes along to breath a fresh air into the genre and revitalized a story telling style of haunted homes that is reminiscent of the old horror moviesits greatest strength perhaps is that it does not rely on gore surprising considering that the director is james wan who made his directorial mark in the hyper bloody and extremely gory saw script writer leigh whannel creates a story about a family that moves into a cute old fashioned house to begin a new life soon odd things spectacles noises begin to occur which makes renai lambert the matriarch start to suspect that the house is haunted suspicion becomes conviction after her son falls inexplicably into coma faced with baffled doctors and a semiskeptical husband she is forced to force the truth of the horror that her family is about to face anyone with even a passive interest in horror will see the clichs in the afflicted child the haunted house the distraught mother not the father the hair rising music we have seen them all in such movies like the exorcist the unborn haunted etc but in the clichs are refreshingly told with a simplicity and a style that makes you hooked right from the spooky credits again reminiscent of old movies style to the heart stopping conclusion and unlike in other horror movies halfway through the movie the couple decides to do the most sensible thing a family will do in real life if confronted with an inexplicable evil in their own house instead of waiting till all the family members are killedboth the director and the writer deserve a lot of credit for this outstanding horror piece rose byrne was good as the distraught mother who would believe anything to save the sons life so was patrick wilson who at first is hesitant in accepting a supernatural explanation for what was happening to their son their acting was not really outstanding but still good enough to support a low budget horror movie it had a reportedly budget of 15m and grossed over 50 great scary movie,astonish
this movie has all the elements to be a classic horror movie if you read a review with the reviewer saying the movie was cheesy or not entertaining  then they are not telling the truth going into this movie i listened to those people who said the movie was trash and i had low expectations this movie exceeded my expectations i was scared excited and full of suspense the acting was great and the designs of the creatures were great the only thing that stopped the movie from being a 1010 was the amount of originality the movie is similar to a lot of other movies from the film idea all the way to some scenes in the movie i often felt like this was a combination of most horror movies that were classics this movie is a great addition to the great horror movie franchise collection,astonish
a family of five  including two boys and a baby girl  have just moved into their new home they attempt to settle in and go about their lives until one morning the father discovers the eldest boy dalton has slipped into a coma doctors are baffled by his condition whilst he is tended to in his home the family begin to experience strange goingson in the housethis is the premise for a modern horror that makes a solid attempt to deliver a haunted house film reminiscent of poltergeist and the likes it opens with a suitably creepy scene in which the camera pans from room to room in a house whilst all sleep following a foreboding silhouette in a window until fixing upon the figure of an old woman this really sets the tone for what is to come and draws the viewer right in what follows in the next hourandahalf is pretty much what this films audience will be expecting but the results are still well executed the shocks put in place throughout the course of the film are generally well timed and many of them genuinely make the skin crawl regardless of whether or not its something youre likely to have seen before in a filmwhilst the climax may be a bit generic and will therefore likely disappoint some its a decent enough payoff if all you want is to be entertained i personally thought it worked and felt natural in context with all the events leading up to it if i had to give another criticism it would be the characters who are just bland but who goes into a film like this for its performances if youre one of those who complains about all the gratuitous violence and gore in horror these days youll find quite welcome it isnt massively original and probably isnt a film worth watching again but it is still well worth seeing and i would recommend it as an excellent rental choice,astonish
okay so people told me that this movie is so scary that you have to turn it off half way through thats not true and being only 12 even i didnt find it that scary the scariest part of it was probably all the devil things and the fact that it may happen to you and it makes you jump like 2 or 3 timesthe thing i like about it is that its one of them movies where you have to think about and figure out whats going on the ending just freaked me out i have to say you think everything is going to be okay its all sorted everyones happy when bam something happensi didnt really get the meaning at first and i had to look it up on google and read a couple of reviews spoilers  well this is what the movie is basically about and what it means please dont read if you havent seen it yetwell a little boy called dalton falls down a ladder and goes into a coma the next day but the doctors dont detect any damage done to the brain the parents take dalton home and the mum keep seeing things such as demons and ghosts but the dad cant see any of it they end up moving house because the mum gets too freaked out but weird things keep happening in the new house as well such as a little boy running around and a room getting completely trashedlater on some ghostbuster people and a lady come in to help them and it turns out that dalton is an able astral projector and he went too far away from his body into a place full of them devilsduring the movie we also find out that the dad never likes his pictures taken and that he keeps seeing a devil woman in his dreams who also appears in pictures of him  closer and closer each timethe only way to get dalton back is for the dad to go and astral project him self he goes to get dalton who does back into his bodywhat we see at the end is the dad coming back to his body just when the devils are about to reach it and wakes up everything seems to be fine but all of a sudden the old woman snaps a picture of the dad who goes crazy and chokes her to death later on the mum comes into the room and looks at the picture and instead of the dad being there there is the devil woman that kept appearing in all of the other pictures was there all on her ownwhat i think it means is that the devil woman was trying to take control of the dads physical body and in the end she got into it which means it was still his physical body but the spirit was the devil womanthe old woman could probably sense the spirit in him and took a picture to make sure well thats about it  710 for the movie overall,astonish
leads with a reasonable title sequence that leads to an overly dramatic actual reveal of the title for a while the film follows suitthe early stages of are straight up haunted house fare josh patrick wilson renae rose byrne and their three munchkins move into a new home and are immediately beset on all sides by the usual reasons for selfeviction random door openings moving books brief glimpses at the window and distant but ohsoclose footsteps there was even one scene i have cried out for ever since we bought a baby monitor in 2006  pity its been used about three times in the last few years and is now hardly original still the scene sorta worked herethen one of their boys inexplicably becomes comatose overnightthe following days and weeks find the family becoming increasingly terrorized and not knowing why particularly at wits end stay at home musician renaewhat were once brief visions and glimpses rapidly seem to grow ever bolder and suddenly the house is infested with actual ghosts big loud brash onesso  as everyone in the audience is already saying  the family movesin the new house it doesnt take long to realize that these ghosts consider themselves part of the family so they tag along too barbara hershey shows up as joshs mum to lend a hand and a crew of nerdish ghostbusters complete with an angular faced ghost whisperer type get called inthings are moving exceedingly fast already at this point the finale kicks things up another 5 or 6 notches in sillinesswhere paranormal activity reveled in leaving the audience perched on edge wants so badly to push you over into outright fear and panic its just that the 137th boo hey and oogyboogy comes across the same as the first one so they simply put more of them in and make them louder and sillier culminating in a never ending series of mini money shots that leave you exhausted and jaded instead of breathless and exhilaratedrose byrne and patrick wilson try desperately to lend credibility to this menagerie of the ever more pushy undead but without success in fact after the very early baby monitor scene i wasnt moved at all aside from by momentary loud noisesteens and young couples on dates will probably love this film there is no gore no sex and minimal profanity add to that the fact that it is not at all scary and it is the ideal risk free teen movie event i actually thought it veered incredibly close to selfparody but for those of us who like some horror in our horror films i advise you to stay far away from this insillynessfinal rating  5  10 the game started with a slow build but early in proceedings the filmmakers gave up on development and started trying to hit everything for a home run the longer it went the more they struck out and the more generous my 5 score becomes in retrospect,astonish
a lot of people get horror dvds expecting to see blood and gore and internal organs all around the placeisnt like that it basically just uses more traditional methods like good directing good editing and good acting to scare the life out of youthere are elements of it that are reminiscent of the 80s film poltergeist but unlike that piece it wont try to dazzle you with special effects eitheri guess they realise that fear of the unknown is a much more effective motif than anything they can visualise with cgi,astonish
this is a weird movie that jumps quickly between boring mildly interesting and ridiculously stupid its good for a couple of good scares in the beginning but the movie quickly deteriorates from there the big slogan was its not the house thats haunted and it was compared to the exorcist both couldnt be further from the truth without going into details the story is just stupid the special effects are laughable and the acting is soso the kid newcomer ty simpkins was mildly entertaining and did do a nice job the parents werent too bad either but the rest of the cast were just terrible a perfect fit for a movie that is pure crap if it wasnt for a couple of scares and the fact that i was laughing at how stupid some of the parts were this movie would have gotten zero its a complete and utter waste of time,astonish
i cant give this less than 6 but i cant maintain dignity and give it higher than 6 the movie has a great start really great actually it was hauntingly chilling during the first third or so of the movie but sadly it began getting unconvincing and unbelievable as the movie progressed the story just got so preposterous half way through that i had a hard time sitting through it i found myself rolling my eyes sighing saying to myself really cmoni love movies horror movies especially and if this would have maintained the quality and believability of the first third of the movie it would have been a solid 8 maybe even 85 for the most part theacting was decent as usual rose byrne acted her role very convincingly in fact i only watched this movie because i hold her acting abilities in high regard after watching 4 seasons of damages as well as the movie just buried which i watched 3 timesi think when everything is said and done i almost wished i hadnt watched it but rose byrne was great it was chilling for a good 40 minutes or so i wont say how the ending turned out because that would spoil things but im a fan of nontypical endings so i was ok with the endingi feel bad giving it a 610 because rose byrne performed so well but the story just didnt hold up to my expectations as were established at the beginning part of the movie id give rose a 910 easily though as an actress her husband however i couldnt get over how fake his snores sounded call me picky but they just sounded silly and frankly its silly of me even to be bothered by that yet oddly i amworth a watch if you like rose byrne but elsewise i cant necessarily recommend it as it felt unbelievable preposterous and drawn out storywise,astonish
a lot of people seem to like it and ive seen it on many top 10 lists for horror movies of 2011 to be brief i found the first 30 minutes or so very well done but then the rest of the movie happenedfor those of you who crave true horror this may not be for you a lot of the movie is very tongue in cheek while there are some memorable scare moments this movie handles its reveals like a true pg13 film that is this movie should only be truly scare to those in the 13 and below bracketoverall i found the films plot sloppy the entrance of two pseudocomic relief characters mid point who werent even very well written didnt helpas an aside the use of tiny tims tip toe as if it were some obscure ancient song of a forgotten bygone era is kind of ridiculous though i can see it being creepy for those who are less culturally aware again 13 and below for the most partto close i can see where the appeal is but my personal tastes had my eyes rolling as this movie came to its conclusion just not my taste or my style pg13 horror is best left to master directors spielbergs poltergeist comes to mind otherwise it kind of falls flat just my two cents 410,astonish
was one of those movies i heard everyone talking about saying so scary or scariest movie i have ever seen even someone who claimed they were a horror film fanatic had this movie over the exorcist i can tell you that this movie is not scary at least to me but it is jumpyi think audiences now a days do not know the difference between horror and terror according to devendra varma in the gothic flame 1966 the difference between terror and horror is the difference between awful apprehension and sickening realization between the smell of death and stumbling against a corpseis full of horror but it uses a lot of jump scares this movie is very jumpy and uses cheap scares about every second the only problem is that you can tell when a jump scare is going to happen except for about two scenes i will admit there are some good concepts in this movie and the good ideas start to fold at the end of the movie but the beginning of the movie just isnt so good the movie uses the loud violin screeches way too much really the violin is so loud in this movie that you cant hear anything elsethe plot follows a family in what is seemingly a haunted house after their son goes into a coma after falling from a ladder creepy noises bloody hand prints and other strange stuff occur they leave the house and move but even stranger stuff occurs it ends up that the kid is actually trying to be possessed by many demonsspirits and the same time there isnt a real main bad monster or bad guy but there is one that appears frequently and looks like darth maul meets freddy krugeri will admit that the red faced demon is pretty sweet looking and hearing tip toe through the tulips was great i actually sang to it really loud while watching the movie since i know the song well i guess for some people the song made the movie scarier but for me it made it lighterthe movie has some lol moments where the dialog is just dreadful but that is mainly during the first half of the movie the second half has much better acting and dialog scary scenes were ruined by some bad dialogoverall the movie tried something interesting but kind of failed in having genuine terror,astonish
given how many people crapped their pants from this movie im anticipating negative feedbackfor a thriller it does a decent job at least some of the time i found myself feeling pretty scared during the first third of the movie but then it suddenly transitions from frightening to weird with the introduction of some comic relief characters the movie begins its downward slope in my opinion i was initially refreshed to have the scary mood lifted but it never returnedi recommend watching this movie but dont expect it to be the scariest thing in the world again dont know why so many people were crying about this movieone other thing i dont understand why many reviewers said the scare tactics were unique they were not at all novel it was filled with very obvious popout scenes and used the same slow suspense that paranormal banked on,astonish
hahhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahahahahahahahahaha the main evil thing in the movie is a topless guy wearing red face paint hahahahahahahahaahahabut the movie started off ok i detest the main actress she plays the same bint in every other film shes ever been in totally one dimensionalso we have a poltergeist type premise ok not bad nothing new but could of been interesting the couples son goes into a coma but really his soul has wondered off astral travelled to a dark spirit world and his dad needs to go and get him backit could have been great but when you see the spirits they look pathetic and the man with fire on his face or whatever turns out to be a topless bloke with face paint lol this movie suckedand why on earth when the father got back to the house with his son did he tell him to go on ahead and stay behind uuuuuuuughhh duuuh bloody stupidstarte off well but turned into a pile of poo give this one a miss,astonish
notewarning contains spoilersi watched this movie thinking that it would be good scary creepy it was none of those except for maybe creepy the problem with this movie is that nothing ever happens dont get me wrong the plot is wonderful and the acting is decent but the trailers are misleading the only scary part in this whole movie for me would have to be tiny tims or as i like to call him tommy face appearing behind that other guys head whose name eludes me right this second the only good acting came from the kid who played dalton and the old women really went overboard the movie was quite boring and really couldve been better i didnt find it all that scary though the ghosts creeped me out my suggestion is to either skip this one completely or rent it i dont suggest the ladder suggestion,astonish
i suggest that if you choose to watch that you also check out the horror 101 that is a special feature on the dvd it is about 10 minutes long containing interview footage of the films creators discussing the films background you will see they are woefully in need of their own horror 101 to sit throughok basic plot outline a married couple with 3 kids two boys about 9 years old and a baby girl move into a creepy new old house there are plenty of floor creaks and the other usual trappings to make you think the house is haunted one boy has an accident in the house goes into an unexplainable coma and while in the coma weird things happen in that house as well as the new house the wife forces the husband to move them to so we at last are told it is not a haunted house or even two haunted houses but rather a case of astral projection gone wrong if you are not familiar with the concept projection involves a sleeper whose soul can leave the body at will and normally controlled by the mind and wanders through the astral plane or wherever the boy wanders too far and too long and eventually becomes lost thereby leaving his physical form as an inviting new home for other lost souls or even demons a seance is held and so onoddly enough as i was killing this movie mentally by noting all the other films this movie borrowed from i found myself unnerved by the nonsupernatural aspects of the movie hearing a voice in the baby monitor real or imagined would be scary but its not a new idea and having the home alarm go off and front door open plus the knocking at the door would be something thatd scare me but it doesnt have to have a supernatural force behind it imdb lists about a dozen films that already deal with astral projection so for the film makers to say they didnt think this topic had been covered before is well pretty typical for todays moronic young horror directorthe film house from the 80s stood out in my mind the most as i watched this if you havent seen that a father loses his son in an old house and goes between worlds meeting ghosts and demons in order to find and free him to bring him home where they are followed into the physical world by someonesomething who knew the father earlier in life sound familiar yes it does do yourself a solid and watch house instead house had an intense impact on me as a kid influencing much of my artwork at the time its not necessarily scary but far more enjoyable than even the repeated moving camera outside the house at night was right out of housethis is exactly the sort of film id expect from the creators for saw and paranormal activity except for an fbomb this could have been a tvmovie or a decent addition to goosebumps i felt like i was watching a professionally made real film version of paranormal activity another film i could do withoutthe film stock looked cheap almost madeforcable and reminiscent of those haunting shows as if i wasnt watching a film but a recreation by actors who couldnt get a job doing anything real repeating the lines of a story that supposedly happened to someone elseand just like with paranormal activity i didnt care about the family because they didnt act like real people im sorry but you dont get your butt whipped by some devils in a seance then just go downstairs and chat about it i normally dont boycott horror film directors or writers but in this case they have forced my hand i will never watch anything by this director again,astonish
the acting of this movie is the worst ive seen in years the plot was even more horrendous when it was revealed that the father was an astral walker i almost vomited this thing was draped in clich from head too toe and i cant forget about the costume design of the main demon it was one of the worst costumes ive ever seen when i saw the demon send the main character flying back without even touching him id think he would be able to prevent them form escaping and oh my god the man is actually the ghost bride please obviously since it didnt show him reenter his body something fishy was going on dont waste your time and money on this peace of crap,astonish
i watched this because i was told it would be terrifying i was told wrong but i did laugh for a significant portion of this movie because 1 the big bad was darth maul 2 darth maul is apparently a tiny tim fan 3 there are mormon ghostbusters go figurethe scene where darth maul was supposed to be really scary in the further was just really darned funny also why did the little kid ghost like tiny tim tooor was it just darth maul in disguisethe ending was just ludicrous and involved a plot twist that had a notsofrightening character the old woman that appeared only in the very last quarter of the movie it was also extremely predictable  i knew for a long time that a some demonghostthing would get into a body in the real world and b that omg the dads hatred of being photographed would be important i just think that if they wanted the old lady to be superscary that they could have introduced her sooner and made it more ambiguousother than that is a great comedy im just not sure thats what they intended,astonish
i rate this movie a 410  this movie i believe had no plot and i was confused most of the time  i didnt really know what was going on through the movie  the goods of the movie was that it does make you jump a lot and you really dont expect it coming  it was terrible because the make up on the demon did not look real he has red paint on his face symbolizing fire and it was a low budget movie  the camera is always shaking the mother in my opinion is a terrible actor and puts no emotions into her acting  the movie did contain very good horror music  this is not a movie i recommend someone watch and i definitely do not recommend it to the true horror fans that watch every horror movie and i think that every one that saw this movie would agree that this movie was terrible and i think the movie truly disappointment at the end,astonish
is 70 minutes of good oldfashioned horror movie creepiness the story is familiar to any fan of classic horror movies a happy family moves into a new house and weird stuff starts to happenbooks appear where they dont belong odd noises emanate from the attic apparitions appear and disappear and then one of the sons lapses into a mysterious coma the wifemother played by an appropriately distraught rose byrnes implores her husband patrick wilson to moveshe insists that the house is haunted he acquiesces and they move to a new home only to find that the haunting continues for a brief time after the move to the new home looks as if its destined to become a contemporary horror classic reminiscent of poltergeist but then theres a fateful scene involving a gas mask and the movie rapidly goes downhill the remaining 30 minutes or so of the film focuses on astral projection and other dimensions and seriously loses its way the ending telegraphs an almost inevitable sequel which im sure will be a disappointment too badi had high hopes for this one,astonish
the haunted house genre of horror seems to be making a comeback in recent years i wouldnt call a breath of fresh air but it is certainly a fun addition to the genre the film teams up director james wan and writer leigh whannell once again for a horrifically electrifying film it tells the story of a family who has just moved to a new house in the country shortly after moving there their son dalton has an accident that puts him into a comatose like state it isnt specifically a coma but the doctors cant discern what exactly the state the boy is in is the family quickly learns that it has a lot to do with the supernatural as strange noises erupt throughout the house and daltons mother starts seeing ghosts eventually they learn that dalton is the one who is being haunted not the house and so begins a harrowing effort to cast out the evil spirits which have befallen dalton before its too latehas all the chills and frights you would expect from a great ghost story and it presents these spine tinglers in unique fashions that legitimately frighten and disturb youll find some intensely frightening images within this film that are sure to haunt the dreams of the weak minded there are some disturbing things in here which are hard to shake and make this film a sadistically fun ride i really do have to give all the props i can to how scary this film is i wouldnt call it the most terrifying film ive ever seen but knows how to be scary and how to frighten us the most it isnt the kind of scary that messes with your mind and disturbs you for a long period of time but it is the kind of scary that makes the film nerve racking to watch but in the most fun way possibleas far as the real substance the real story of it is fairly tailor made to be a basic haunted house film it throws in the twist of the boy being haunted rather than the house but all the same principles apply the family moves to a new house strange things start to happen things get so terrifying that a specialist is called in to perform some sort of exorcism on whatever is being haunted is even complete with the two comic relief goofball exorcist assistants who come to the house to perform tests and make sure there actually is a supernatural presenceit is these kinds of flaws that i attribute to lazy screen writing from writer leigh whannell this gentleman is also what kept saw from being a phenomenal film his dialogue is very poor and he isnt the best at properly structuring a story and creating believable characters his writing has certainly improved since 2004 but not enough to make an outstanding film he takes the easy way out of writing a haunted house flick simply going through the motions and not presenting anything substantially original none of the characters are particularly memorable except for maybe the exorcist played by lin shane the story is littered with irrational decisions that only serve the purpose of moving the story along as well as hollywood conveniences that dont make a lot of realistic sense but make for some exciting visualsbut if you put some logic aside and take some of the craziness for granted is a very fun film it is legitimately scary and disturbingly exciting for a story that doesnt deviate much from the original it still works in making an engaging watch from beginning to end the films far from perfect but its not a total disaster either,astonish
i just rented this film on dvd its one of the worst films i ever seen it started out quite good but then it turned really predictable bad acting and terrible effects i missed it in the cinema so i had to rent it i must say it has all been seen before just way better i cant understand why they made so cheep looking special effects there where too many of the same scares so in the end i wasnt scared any more if you like really good scary movies dont see this its not worth spending your hard earned money on if i should say anything positive about this movie it must be the score i liked the song they played on the lp record,astonish
is probably the best horror movie ive seen in a long time getting tired of the they live inside a cabin in the woods without coverage on your mobile look this is really something new that makes you not know exactly when something will happen which makes you scared the story is well written and very good actor in my opinion it comes with the act and is something i appreciate very much of a horror movie i fought it would be just like that when i saw that the guys from saw directed it ques they are weary talented and together with the paranomal activity gang they have created together a masterpiece of horror category so get ready with the popcorn bowl call all youre friends and pull the home theater to max cause its gonna be a bumpy ride ,astonish
okay  creepy children scare the hell out of me i normally avoid watching these types of films  but hey its halloween so why not true enough the opening 45 minutes was very tense with some great scares and strong direction from the safe hands of james wan whilst not avoiding every horror clich wan does well to keep the camera moving and not telegraphing the jumps however in my humble opinion its the second act where it takes steep nosedive and ruins most of its early hard work the plot becomes pretty ludicrous and negates any fear by being basically dumb out of body flying children and demon faced wierdos arent nearly as scary as a good old fashioned ghost boy the father having experienced this all as a boy and being the only one who could save his son along with the obligatory twist ending were all signposted a mile away and by the time it was finished i wasnt even nearly scared just a bit bored,astonish
i read several comments posted here of grown up men with wife and kids who went on and on about how scary this movie was and how it almost made them pi i mean wet their pants or scream like little girls so long story short i was eager to watch this one especially because a movie with this budget that succeeds where so many milliondollarblockbusters fail would have been epic and praiseworthy as a feat in itselfthe movie is not so bad for the first half or so during which it behaves like an average psychologicalhorror that is to say a movie that works solely on atmosphere coupled with a good photography music and sound effects to create a sense of tension andor fear and it does that relatively well despite being rather slow paced uneventful and based on a weak plot so to wrap it up no gore no special effects and id say no plot twistsso far it would have been a decent movie like 610 with some scares very few but also pretty boring overall fact is that the second part of the movie is actually quite lame starting from the unnecessary comic relief of the nerdy paranormal investigators and continuing with the ridiculous monstersspirits the related paranormal mumbojumbo this time involuntarily comic i guess and the laughable quest to save the possessed childthe general acting level left me very unimpressed and i think that plot pace visual effects and ending also leave much to be desiredhowever i keep seeing a lot of 110 or 91010 flying around these days on here which i believe to be extremely unbalanced and almost always undeserved my rating for this movie is 510 surely more than watchable if you like this kind of soft horror that is but surely not worthy of all the hype surrounding it and thus deceiving or better ly crappy,astonish
i had wanted to see this for a while based on the trailer which looked pretty scary and i wasnt disappointed having bought it on bluray dvd it certainly lives up to its name the idea of an threat is one that grows as the growing sense of unease with which this film plays out highlights even the opening credits are very unsettlingpatrick wilsons character and his lovely very hard working wife and 2 young children move into a new home and almost from the word go strange things start happening house alarms go off one of their children meets with a nasty accident and ends up in hospital and intruders seemingly come into the house neither patrick nor his wife rose want to admit whats going on its only until they call in a psychic with much persuasion on roses part that it becomes apparent that theres something badly wrong with both their son and the house the use of astral projection as an explanation is a brilliant one and adds a real flavour and purpose to the film but its the sense of real genuine menace that sets this scary movie from almost all others theres a touch of the excorcist going poltergeist the others quite a big nod to that and paranormal activity no gore but then it doesnt need it  a brilliant movie which does what it says on the tin,astonish
 watch poltergeist instead its basically the same movie but done much better haunted child check old woman psychic check paranormal investigators check going to the other side to bring the child back check terrible movie terrible story telling terrible execution if they wouldve called this a poltergeist remake i wouldnt have wasted my time in watching this it also seems that they spent a good portion of the budget in hiring some recognizable actors but in doing so they completely dropped the ball in every other aspect although it was good to see darth maul get some work sorry thats my opinion xzx,astonish
i was expecting great things of this after reading good reviews and seeing typically enticing trailers however i was enthralled then badly let down it reminded me of jeepers creepers because of the great first half and dreadful second the first held of the film creates the idea nicely and we work out the different characters and their issues the boys fall is handled well and his false coma explained then the scares come and they are well done and it reaches the inevitable angst of the parents a little unneeded humour is added with the paranormal investigators but that is where the film starts getting sillier and your interest wains firstly the gas masks  why then the inevitable tagline  it is not your house but your son and it is explained where he is etc and i thought lets forget the silliness and get back to the dread and fear but the music and feel of the other zone is ruined by the people on the sofa and then the dreadful old style rendition of tiptoe through the tulips why as it just totally destroyed all tension and the ending was lazy and totally unsatisfactory great idea good first half but poor second and totally unsatisfactory ending dont make a sequel just make a better ghost story,astonish
the first time i watched this the phone rang and i had to turn it off i watched it again 2 months later and was frightfully disappointed by the way the movie falls apart after the character of elise rainier is engineering the journey into the further i was so in love with this movie until it decided to play halloween costume party with all its demonic extras seriously this was a great premise for a movie a little boy haunted by supernatural forces fine actors a great supporting cast very homey set design and smart cinematography why did they have to ruin it with a boo ending at least in stanley kubricks the shining 1980 it was evident at the end that jack torrance got swallowed up into the overlook hotels ghost population you dont even understand what happens in the ending of this film unless you want to go to wikipedia and rely on someone elses cribb note observationssadly this is what most people do when they sit through a movie and end up asking what the heck happened too bad we cant hire a professional editing team to recut the movie so it makes a little more sense,astonish
i was pretty desperate to see this film the trailers made it look like something that would probably stop you from sleeping ever again and a good horror film with a child as the main focus is always worth the admission fee its a fact that ghost children are far scarier than other ghoststhe first two thirds of the film had me gripped some very scary parts that had me jumping in my cinema seat ill never listen to tiptoe through the tulips in quite the same way then the final third lost me completely it went from a pretty great horror to a sort of fantasydream story i was genuinely disappointedits worth watching just for the few good shocks but dont believe the hype,astonish
i was extremely excited about viewing this film partly because of the massive publicity it got and also the trailer for the film was pretty intriguing unfortuantly i didnt get a chance to see the film in the cinema so my only other option which i was happy to do so was to buy the dvd when i came outafter my excitingly anticipated walk to the shops to buy the film i then watched it that night with my popcorn ready and my big bottle of share size coke beside me i was finally ready to watch the best horror of the year however my excitement for the film ended within the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film and justifiably the main reason why i rated this so low the acting in this film is and this is me putting it lightly absolutely atrocious considering this was such a highly rated film its save to say after not even viewing the first half hour that this film was not all it cracked up to be the story line for the film was generally good and was quite intriguing and not something i had seen before i havent seen many paranormal films other that paranormal activity even though i felt that the film was not as good as it was made out to be i am still glad i have view mearly for the fact that it would have bugged the hell out of me if i hadnt on the bases of the hype if had got i feel that with a lot better acting this film could have been a whole lot betteroverall majorly disappointed,astonish
insidius is a second rate poltergeist knockoff the lead characters just like in poltergeist are trying to bring their kid back from a type of spirit realm except this ones not stuck in a tv i was hoping to see a movie with substance and an edge of the seat grip i was sadly disappointed the movie opens slow and stays slow for the first 35 minutes over dramatic elmer bernstein style scary music is used to try to make up for the lack of actual scariness the story line twists and turns in downward spiral of hilarious scary characters including the heavy grease painted red faced character and some others that waddle like leprechauns i couldnt stomach anymore beyond where they brought in the old lady and turned it off if you watch this movie youll be wasting time that you can never get back,astonish
i just recently watched this film with my mum lol and thought it was pretty damn scary wasnt really expecting it really just thought it was a typical average american horror and my mum who is usually a massive horror fan even pooped herself and couldnt turn the light off for a while before bed lol the whole atmosphere of the film is creepy throughout and all the actors did brilliantly i will say when the sort of ghost busters got called i thought what the hell as a couple of geeky guys turned up but they turned out to be alright really as it said it was from the same people who did saw and paranormal activity i thought it would have lots of blood and guts but was nothing like saw and had more of a paranormal activity feel to it where u dont really expect whats going to happen i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good horror and likes jumping out of your skin at very freaky unexpected moments to summarise it up its well worth a watch if your a horror fan but if your a comedy lover i would give this a miss lol and a good decent horror for the year,astonish
after watching this film the first time i have to admit it was quite jumpy and creepy at times the start to the middle of this film is brilliant good acting good story line and an excellent idea the positives of this film mainly the idea of going out of your body when your sleeping which i have read about people believing they can do this even i must admit that ive had dreams where i had overlooked myself sleeping so allowing people to relate to the movie is great the creepiness that you experience in this film is the kind that makes you not be able to sleep at night with the small child laughing and running around but not being able to see his deformed face properly makes it worse apparantly now for the problems there are a few that ruined the film firstly there was the man with fire on his face this was just funny it ruins all of the scary shadows that you might of saw throughout the film of this devil kind of thing it basically just looks like an ugly man with paint on his face there are too many hidden meanings in this film after watching it more than once and also watching the making they talk about how the child was a deformed man which in the film you know nothing of this and the devil man was meant to of rubbed lipstick all over his face i just thought it was a bad make up artist lastly the further idea and the possessed child also ruined the film making it boring and just plain funny overall worth a watch but not the greatest film,astonish
yet another contrived hollywood demon oriented horror film with little edge or fun for that matter the writers are too busy trying to dodge the clichs of the exorcist and their previous paranormal activity that they do not realize how out of wack their story is the story is so far fetched in the second half that the horror does not even work horror is about believability taking something audiences can relate to and expanding on the concept to scare them director james won pulls across little believability and little stylistics to make up for it and the result is lacking i cannot pan it due to its desire to be original but i cannot like it either for the absurdity of the plot elements film buffs should move on,astonish
anyone who calls this a horror film is sadly deluding themselves theres just so much wrong with it i barely know where to starthow about the intensely annoying screeching violin  dog being dropped on a piano soundtrack the wooden passionless acting the terrible demon effects the 2 geeky ghostbusters who appear in the middle of the film the story blatantly and badly rippingoff poltergeist the total lack of character developmentall the scare scenes are just sooooo predictable and sad do you really want to be blasted with 100 decibels of clangingscreeching noise every time a ghost appears in a totally formulaic mannerthis rubbish might make a 12 year old jump a few times but thats about all its good forso to steal a theme from family guy demons try to possess kid ghostbusters come dad saves kid there i just saved you 2 long boring boobless hours,astonish
there are a few moments when you will jump out of your seat equally some of it will make you laugh not sure whether this is the intention i think it best that horror films do not take themselves too seriously and this one appears not to the steady build up of tension in the opening half hour is handled pretty well the film is determined to make you look the ghouls in the eye most films of this type tend to leave more to the imaginationi think i prefer the my imagination to fill in the gaps but credit to the film for taking a different approachif your test of a good horror flick is that you cant sleep after watching it im afraid this one didnt do the trickmildly entertaining,astonish
a psychological thriller from director james wan according to merriamwebstertreacherous having a collective effect josh lambertpatrick wilsonmoves his family into a brand new home and immediately josh and his wife renairose byrnehear strange noises in the middle of the night the next day their son daltonty simpkins informs his mother that he doesnt like his new room actually afraid of whats in his room even daltons brother is afraid of the footsteps he hears in the night dalton becomes sick and falls into a mysterious coma the doctors cant explain the coma or the other hospital tests the boy is taken home where his body begins to attract a malevolent force when the lamberts begin to realize there is a real threat they move to another home hoping to leave the convincing evil spirit behind well thats when their problems really get serious cinematography is super wish i could say the same for the last third of the movie the lamberts must give in to the supernatural to awaken their son from his coma i just cant get into wilson or his character byrne is no better others in the cast angus sampson john henry binder ruben pla and barbara hershey,astonish
i think its safe to say this is one of the scairest movies that i have ever seen i was expecting it to be scary but not as scary as what it is there are some scenes that will make you jump some scenes that will haunt you forever the scares start right from the opening credits and it doesnt get easier to watch the pace of the movie is really good as well it never has a dull moment plus the plot is a inventive one that you wont have seen much of insidous shows us that horror movies can still be scary not just full of gore insidous is one of my top ranking horror movies if you want a really really scary movie this is a must see but dont watch ot without the lights one ill warn you now is one hell of a scary movie insidous is a cleaver horror movie one that will scare you to the extent pf not sleeping watch it now,astonish
im always impressed when a studio manages to create an entertaining horrorthriller film with a pg13 rating the lower rating means the film wont be relying on gore effects to rattle the audience instead relying on atmosphere creepy music and hauntings rather than eviscerations its odd to think this movie comes from james wan the director responsible for the original saw the film that jumpstarted the worlds love for torture porn the film focuses on the lambert family josh patrick wilson and his wife renai rose byrne move into a new home with their three children and mysterious occurrences begin almost immediately exploring the attic their son dalton falls from a ladder and while he appears fine at first he soon falls into an inexplicable coma as her son lies comatose renai begins to experience instances of garbled voices over the baby monitor and visions of people in the house despite her husbands skepticism renai is sure something supernatural is involved she finds help in elise ranier lin shaye a medium assisted by two sociallyinept paranormal investigators who delivers some grave news to josh and renai its not the house thats haunted its their soni love a good haunting film especially the adaptation of stephen kings 1408 ghosts and poltergeists are much creepier than masked psychos in my opinion doesnt bring anything new to the genre and borrows a lot of the same clichs but at least the filmmakers try to do it with their own style there is the usual sance scene but to up the creepfactor elise wears an old gas mask and shares the experience by muttering into the headphones of her associate specs who transcribes the conversation and passes it on to the confused family ive read a lot of posts and seen a lot of web reviews of people who seem pretty terrified of this movie im sure their exaggerating a bit as theres nothing really to scream about but the movie does a great job of keeping the chills consistent in what was personally the eeriest sequence in the film renai is cleaning her new home listening to some music on an old record player she steps out take out the trash and the record player crackles switching to the warbling sound of tiptoe through the tulips then through a window we see a young boy dressed straight out of the 20s dancing a little jig by the time renai rushes back inside everythings back to normal little weird bits like that keep you on edge throughout the film you know unless youve been desensitized to normal spooksi loved how the film touched on astral projection rather than running the same route as poltergeist and other ghost films it touches on a supernatural element we never really see in movies the ghosts populating the other world the further as elise calls it were great the cast does an awesome job here everyone filling out the usual roles we find in these sorts of movies the tormented wife the skeptical husband the strange medium etc i thought the paranormal investigators played by angus sampson and screenwriter leigh whannell were fun as the comic relief in the later parts of the film where things are starting to get serious overall its a really welldone ghost story with very little detracting from it i did think it took a bit long to get into the story its a pretty slow buildup as the family is introduced before we get into the meat of it all i was also sort of put off by the ending though ill avoid details here it wouldve been fine if it had tied up all the loose ends but leaving it open for a sequel means theres a chance for more films to milk a potential franchise when id much rather have a real good oneoff thriller,astonish
if you accept theres another dimension another world somewhere in the ether then this movie is right up your streetin many ways it is better than poltergiest which i believe to be the best film ever of its genrepeople who didnt get anything from this movie in my opinion have no imaginationthere were plenty of shocks and the acting was averagebut what im looking at here is a movie based around the subject matteri guess it depends on what you believe about the world you live in ,astonish
i loved this movie i enjoy a wide variety of horrorthrillerscary films i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this one the overall feel direction and acting of this film were perfect but there were a few particular points that made this film for methe music ive noticed a few reviews where people are saying the music is overbearing or too loud but i loved it every scary film ive seen recently sticks with quiet creeping scores which have their place but this film had loud inyourface music which perfectly sets and works within the tone and feel of the filmthe color of the film was interesting the lack of saturation in the film was definitely an interesting choice but again it worked it set up the feel of the film in an unexpected way it added an oppressive feel to the atmospherethe acting was pretty good not amazing but very good believable characters and fairly strong dialogue i was not disappointedfinally the finale is fantastic i wont give any details away but i will say i was more than satisfied with itoverall i would go see this film again in theaters i will definitely be buying it for my personal collection i highly recommend it for everyone and especially those found of scary films,astonish
ok first off dont buy the movie dont even rent it from redbox the movie is not worth it yes everyone says its the scariest film since poltergeist lies poltergiest for an older film was a lot better and more a scary than this modern version of poltergeist the plot starts off fine than after an hour iam thinking wait havent i seen this plot before oh yeah poltergeist i laughed through the entire film i thought it was a horror movie not a comedy and the end was awful i thought the writer of saw and the director of paranormal activity would be able to make a good descent horror film that actually would make me jump and be scared boy i was wroung so take my advise and do not see this dreadful film,astonish
there are two kinds of haunted house movies the one that builds dread and never shows a ghost and the one that takes you on a rollercoaster ride james wans latest horror outing is a combination of bothjosh and renai have moved into a new house with their sons foster and dalton and their baby girl cali renai is still getting over the nervousness of moving in but overall things are going quite well until dalton falls into a sudden coma thats when things go downhill strange voices vibrate off of calis baby monitor loud noises erupt randomly and renai begins to see things almost certain that their house is haunted renai and her husband move into another house but not even that can stop the terror and when they invite a group of mediumsghost hunters they make the horrifying discovery that its not the house thats hauntednext to the important fact that its from the creators of saw and oren peli director of the ingenious frightfest paranormal activity produced it people will mostly recall the advertising campaign for a black screen constantly saying is one who has never seen the film can only ask that question what is i can proudly answer that it is easily one of the best and creepiest haunted house movies since the others or maybe even poltergeist but the film does feel like this generations poltergeist that was james wan and leigh whannells intention to make a ghost story that is lowbudget atmospheric and reminiscent of the classic 80s haunted house filmsdespite maybe one happy moment between josh and renai and some comedy from the ghost huntersplayed by screenwriter leigh whannell and angus simpson there is nothing funny about this movie right from the opening credits an immense feeling of eeriness and mood drips off of the film like common horror movie blood things start out creepy and build to a terrific edgeofseat fright that never flies off of the wheelswhile the demented torturous ghostsor demons are extremely scary especially to look at its the more subtle quiet things in the film that get to me most there will be moments when something scary is happening and you barely even notice it other times a chair will rock or a door will slightly open and a chill is brought down the spineis filled to the brim with fantastic acting talent patrick wilsonwatchmen and hard candy and rose byrneadam and bridesmaids are perfect as josh and renai especially ms byrne she may have been noticed in the horror sequel 28 weeks later but as fun as that movie is ive always longed to see her make a seriously scary movie shes done it here and has proved herself worthy of more jobs in hollywood in many different genres other times leigh whannell angus simpson and horror mistress lin shayeknown best because her father robert shaye created new line cinema and helped wes craven give birth to a nightmare on elm street nearly steal the showand then theres the work of director james wan his two previous movies dead silencea fun horror romp and death sentence went by without much attention but everybody knows wan for saw as creative and frightening as that film is i was a little afraid that wan would stay labeled as the creator of torture porn luckily he has broken that mold and shown people that he can easily scare people with atmosphere more than a dude with a weapon he also pays homage to directors like tobe hooper and david lynch as well as his first inspiration herk harveys 1962 film carnival of souls thanks to this film things have just gotten better for wan and his partner mr whannellwhile there are so many more remakes and harsh criticism even for the more original films or sequels you might realize that the horror genre is getting better with movies like the strangers paranormal activity the last exorcism the descent and black swanyes i call it a horror film the future is bright for fright flicks and has just been added to the list youll scream youll gasp youll quiver with fear this is a haunted house movie that nobody is going to forgetps if you get freaked out by faces at your window dont watch this movie,astonish
it could have been a very good movie however the acting was average at best and i didnt think it wasnt scary i could describe this in one word sucks so since the minimum length is ten lines here it goes this movie was pathetic it was one of the worse movies ive seen i did not recommend it to relatives and friends however i did to four friends and a brother just for the fun of it all five said pretty much the same thing ive said one told me that pay backs are a b going on to number eight line this movie is terrible and i give it a one star rating out of ten im close to making it ten linesthis is line ten only thing scary about this movie was the movie itself it sucked,astonish
dont waste your money on this its startling not scary it even gets borderline stupid there were 6 year olds laughing in the theater it starts out good sfxs are good even above average good plot im thinking this may be a good new scary movie boy was i wrong halfway thru the movie it gets just straight up ridiculous effects wise while the plot  story line remain good the special effects are awful literally a guy in a mask it was almost like they didnt have enough money left to invest in the back half of the movie so they just improvised save your time save your money the only reason i give it 5 of 10 is for story line  actors they did a good job with what they had to work with,astonish
my wife hates vampires werewolves attacking aliens and zombies except for the resident evil movies she liked the strong female lead but she likes ghosts demons and stuff about alternate realities this movie hit the spot for her unlike so many others out there it scared the stuffing out of her so much that she couldnt go to sleep for hours the only thing she didnt like was the long tiptoe through the tulips view of the redfaced guy it could have been shorter without losing anything this movie dealt with astral projection and dead people and she couldnt get enough of it excellent rental for a buck,astonish
notice how the people that gave this a 1 out of 10 think some clown doll from poltergeist and some little girl are scarier than a big ass legit ghost also of course its gonna be similar to dead silence if youre gonna talk trash do your research its the same director ive seen almost every scary movie out there and i thought this was the first movie to scare me in years and not scare me as in i couldnt sleep but scare me for the moment of the movie it was good suspense and good for making you jump in your seat a little and the kid getting lost from his body is nothing like poltergeist she got pulled into some tv and nothing scared me there,astonish
i am not a proponent of giving out any details of a movies plot in a review due to it setting an expectation to another person the movie has a great plot and theme the degree of suspense is set high and for a lot of the movie kept me on my toes and had me wanting to take shelter under my blanket if i was still a child the fatal flaw is that towards the end and note i am not stating specifically the ending the movie seems rushed and as if the producers were running low on the budget if rating the movie from beginning until before the last 1520 minutes this film would be an 859 all in all i would say this movie is well worth the 2 hours you will have to sacrifice from your busy life to enjoy and is a welcome title to a genre that has in the past decade been polluted with mostly clich garbage,astonish
a malevolent and demon causes a couple havoc when their son falls into a coma and can only be help by a medium and her teamjames wan notable writer director of saw brings the drama of his directing effort death sentence 2007 and the macabre visuals of dead silence2007 into one creepfest of a filmbuilding on the aforementioned and borrowing from heavily from poltergeist 1982 wan and writer leigh whannell throw in every supernatural clich from ghostly photos boys with caps dead brides old hags evil drawings mediums and paranormal investigators to name a few however talented wan manges to infuses life into a well trodden subject leaving other haunted movies behind as he crafts his own modern version that pays tribute instead of trying to reinvent it the set design and locations are what youd expect with the first third of the film set in an old house complete with a dusty attic and creaky stairs but then the setting moves to a suburban house placing the viewer in a safer environment and false state of security reminiscent of poltergeist and paranomal activity 2007patrick wilson is adequate as the trouble father and rose byrne is excellent as wife renai the film looses its edge in the second half as wilson takes the helm byrne is the stronger of the two but is left with little to do or say and the weight of the film suffers as a result the small cast works well and credit should go to both lin shaye as the medium elise rainier and barbara hershey in their supporting rolesjoseph bisharas music score is exceptionally creepy and the lighting makeup of the ghostly faces is enough to give some nightmares what works well is that while there are cgi shots they are well designed and hardly a distractingtheres few story surprises but lots of well built up jumps and from start to finish should send shivers down your spine making the hairs on your neck stand its no shining 1980 but its one of the best popcorn haunting cocktails in a longtime,astonish
this movie did not have the blood and guts horror it was more realistic of ghosts it gave chill bumps which i have not had in a long time since watching a scary movie since a child the music sounds and things you would see with ghosts it is what had me intuned with this movie the astral projection was new to me i researched and it is real enough that people have written about this for thousands of years you have to follow the movie or it will never make sense from beginning to end lots of twists and turns in it i recommend this movie for most people that dont have nightmares great couples and teens movie i am sure some people will never get frighten but if you ever had a ghostly experience if will be very realistic to you,astonish
i saw the trailer and thought this film would get me pretty rattled i dont really like horror films because i dont particularly like knowingly being scared but being a man i didnt admit that and casually went into the cinema with my friends and watched this film what a spectacular misconception i had about the first 10 or so minutes were okay theres a part where the woman and baby are alone in their new house where there is some unsettling whispering coming through on the baby monitor unfortunately that was the scariest part of the film it went dramatically downhill from there trying way too hard to be scary and failing miserably as said the main demon in is shown way too much removing the mystery from the thing completely if it wasnt for the fact that i descended into laughter about halfway through and continued intermittently for the rest of it i would have been pretty bored whilst watching this even my friend next to me was laughing at it its just ridiculous unfortunately she was the only one to do so as it seemed my other two friends thought that the story was amazing and that it was scary it really wasntto top it off the music throughout is terrible and cheesy  its more than likely supposed to be that way but this is one of the reasons why this movie sucks they try to add elements of humour and classic horror into this which just kills the apparent dominant genre horrorwhat did i like about this film not much to be honest the cinematography was good although borrowed heavily from concepts like paranormal activity the ending was okay although it was made pretty obvious before it happened bottom line if you dont mind a cheesy film or a film with horror scenes that are so bad that theyre funny then yeah maybe watch this film  otherwise i would suggest you stay well clear its not scary and to be honest overall its not good either it could have been so much better,astonish
i had an opportunity of watching this last night with my wife and man i have never been this freaked out since the exorcist and it i couldnt believe this day and age they can pull out one like this it was all fun and a ride till the end i was jumping all the way my eyes popped out through my glasses to such an extent i could hardly sleep at night was even scared of all dark passage and mirrorsone of the reasons i knew i was going to enjoy it was it was edited by the director himself and right there and there i knew it was going to be worth watching as we were going to get exactly what the director directedthis is the kind of a movie that will leave you thinking the whole time the cast was great and convincing most of the horror movies especially with kids dont pull it off like this cast did and i enjoyed it as much as i did dead silence and the skeleton key,astonish
seen poltergeist and paranormal activity if so then youll be in very familiar territory with james wans which borrows heavily from both of these supernatural blockbusters but thankfully does so with just enough verve to still make it a satisfying experienceas in poltergeist wans film centres around a suburban familyjosh and renai lambert patrick wilson and rose byrne and their three kidswho experience supernatural activity shortly after moving into their new home at first the occurrences are fairly innocuousstrange noises and moving objectsbut after eldest son dalton ty simpkins mysteriously lapses into a comalike state the incidents begin to escalate in severity and scarinessjust like paranormal activity even moving house doesnt prevent the creepiness from continuing leaving josh and renai no option but to turn to a team of experts led by the always delightful lin shaye who discover that it is dalton himself who is being hauntedby a hideous demon intent on occupying the boys bodyalthough certainly wont win any awards for originality it successfully does what it sets out do do frighten the audience silly for an hour and a half with plenty of well executed jump scares and lots of fun freakiness watch it and just try and tell me you werent weirded out by the sight of that little kid gyrating to tiny tims tiptoe through the tulipsmind you the song on its own is enough to make my skin crawl,astonish
i watched a couple nights ago with a friend of mine we watched it in a dark room at night to make the experience more intense ill just cut to the chase  it wasnt scary i found myself laughing a lot of the time instead of curling up closer to my friend and screaming the atmosphere of the movie was just okay  it wasnt scary it wasnt ridiculous the majority monsters had a good design but most of the scares in the movie were just cheap things jumping out the music of the movie was more annoying than scary the ending was surprising but not scary it left me more curious than afraid this movie scared my friend but left me extremely disappointed,astonish
this review is coming from a horror movie lover i live to watch these things so upon hearing from some friends and reading some reviews i decided to watch from the trailer one will obviously laugh this film off elsewhere but once sat in front of the movie itself it will pull you in and make your heart pound to the very end this is no friday the 13th nightmare on elm street paranormal activity saw etc this is pure terror and it will scare the hell out of you in every movie ive seen i am eager and excited to see what is waiting on the other side of the door this is the only movie where i was begging the character not to open the door being pg13 i was sure this would be another rotten egg but this movie will push you until you fall over the edge it takes you when you least expect it you cant stop it its ,astonish
now i dont have a lot of experience with horror movie because i dont see how grotesque dismemberment is entertaining or actually scary so i loved the ghost story style horror of the paranormal series because they were at least trying you can imagine i was excited to hear about a new paranormalesque movie after watching however i was sorely disappointed the first half of the movie had some of the best unnerving scares ive ever seen and for that i recommend it i dont want to spoil anything and its not a big revelation but i did say only the first half was good as soon as you hear the phrase astroprojections turn it off after a certain point in the movie it just gets awful and hard to watch it pretty much turned into a lowbudget rip off of legendary,astonish
patrick wilson and rose byrne are the unfortunate couple of a soon to be possessed son in the years most chilling movie surprised me i saw it opening weekend not expecting a lot and this movie really got to me i was actually scared to go to sleep that nightwilson and byrne are a married couple with three kids when they move into a new house their son daltonty simpkins falls into a mysterious coma 3 months later the bizarre starts to happen alarms start going off theres an evil voice on the baby monitor strange break ins and other thingsand she cant take it anymore he never sees it but he moves for her anyways but not even the new house is good after she sees a weird dancing midget listening to tiny tims horrible song tip toe thru the tulips she decides to get help and thats when the movie really picks upthe couple learn from an expertlin shaye whos work here is brilliant tells them that the houses arent haunted but there son is he isnt in a coma his spirit has floated into the further and a redfaced demonthe really creepy part is trying to possess himthe film blazes with originality it starts off sort of like poltergeist but in the end its a chilling and at times terrifying film with a surprising twist i think that this is the best horror films in years it makes other look like trash if youre looking to get really scared see b,astonish
theres a scene in star 80 where a hooker tells john paul schneider eric roberts why despite his coarseness and unattractiveness hes got to be her best lover honey you just plaintry harder she laughs one could say the same about james wans films though sometimes falling a bit flat in their morass of fantastical elements or dissolving a bit too quickly in their frenetic camerawork you cant deny the heart and energy he injects into his movies it theyre failures theyre not from a lack of tryingwhile is most definitely not a failure  its actually the creepiest haunted house movie ive seen in maybe thirty years  it suffers from the more is too much curse of much modern horror at least in the demonic possession realmwhat keeps it going and ultimately wins us over is the acting and the brilliant casting choices patrick wilson and rose byrne are usually good in whatever they do but theyre spot on here as a clueless couple whose son falls victim to a mysterious coma or so they think in trying to find some solution to not only their sons sinister illness and to the havoc that plagues not one but two houses they attempt to start a life in they bring in ghost hunter lin shaye and her two assistants one played by wan partner and once again screenwriter leigh whanell shay is exceptional and barbara hershey continues her run of good believable supporting work since black swanwans pacing and shot setups are craftily constructed devilishly executed and the use of the discordant piano chords black christmas anyone is surprisingly effective the problems come when the demons get a bit too visible and therefore lose a lot of their shock value theres a bit toward the end however where several waxlooking figures pop up that makes you rethink that rationaletheres something in this sequence thats creepy in the extreme but it doesnt last longthe demonic possession aspect of the film was an unfortunate combo of chestnuts ive heard before and an overly complex explanationit didnt do much for me and explained too much about too little id have been more curious about the apparent homicides that seem to have taken place in one of the houses though this is never expounded uponwhatever the details prove out or dont the overall effect of the movie is unsettling and while id have preferred a bit more atmospherics what we get is still far and away better than the usual pappy crappy pablum of films like the haunting in connecticut,astonish
after all the hype i was pretty keen to see it seemed right up my alley supernatural movies are my favorite subgenre of horror and i actively seek them out from the mainstream right through the lowbudget indies but ultimately was a disappointmentmost people who didnt enjoy the movie cite that the third act borders on absurd while thats partially true there were actually points where i felt like the protagonist was being attacked by the crow and darth maul and the explanation is a bit of a stretch thats not the reason the movie didnt work for methe reason it didnt work for me is that everything about it was overcooked even the opening credits which could have been understated and dreadinducing were diminished by cgi effects it pulled out all the good old tropes that us ghost movie fans look for  the kids drawings the creepy tune on the gramophone the gentle buildup of sinister events etc  but in each case it was just handled too heavily too evidently too gaudily to sustain the foreboding atmosphere that drives the best of these types of moviesthe only two genuinely creepy scenes were already revealed in the trailer and everything else unfortunately served to detract from those moments by being so heavy handed it begins by masquerading as a ghost movie for adults but dont buy into it by the third act youll probably agree that this was clearly targeted at a younger dare i say it sure i dare  add  generationi see what james wan was trying to do with i really do  it was a brave attempt to update poltergeist for a new generation  but now i realize it takes someone with a finer touch than him to pull off a feat that big,astonish
the reason homeowners prefer that the bump in the night be a desperate drug addict opposed to a ghost is because junkies have organs that can be sold to pay mortgagesand while the family in this horror movie isnt trading on the black market theyd give anything for a tangible homeinvaderplagued by spirits since moving into their new home renai rose byrne and josh patrick wilson live in fearone day their son ty simpkins falls into a coma on the advice of joshs mother barbara hershey they call in an expert lin shaye who tells them their sons astral body is being held captive by a demon wishing to possess his physical bodydrenched in eldritch ambiance and imbued with nightmarish imagery this macabre tale is a triumph of terror fortunately if things do go awry there is a cure for demonically possessed children  its called ritalin green light,astonish
first off i must say i have not seen this moviebut after reading the otherwise boring excuse of a synopsis i must say it lacks true horror movie luster i honestly couldnt get past the first paragraph as it sounds too near like the orphan blended with paranormal activity and seems that if reading about it doesnt captivate me then viewing certainly isnt tip for horror movie directors stop making pg13 horror with ghosts and simulated realism horror was its most terrifying in the 70s and 80s when killing took on a whole new meaning the only way to appeal to the younger generation of wouldbe horror fans is to give them what they wanttrue realism let them leave the theater wishing they could drown some of the images in their head from the film they just saw true terror starts in the mind after seeing something that doesnt quite register with the psych,astonish
i was highly surprised when i recently watched this movie i was under the impression that it was a suspensethriller but i was happily surprised to find out that it was indeed a horror film i have almost given up in past years trying to find a movie that was actually scary but this movie did it absolutely excellent plot very true to life and believable the actors were great everything about this movie was perfect and unlike many other recent movies that end horribly this one had a good ending also i try to see all the scary movies as they come out and i can definitely say that this one has something that puts it far above the rest let me just say that this movie not only kept me up late at night but woke me up and had me sitting on the edge of my seat highly recommended,astonish
now im not a famous critic but this film is just a mix of really awesome scenes from films of the past mixing into a giant blender but still has an original story such a strange combination what a great world we live in this film seems to imitate classic films like the exorcist amityville horror poltergeist wes cravens a new nightmare yes even darth maull from star warsthis film actually does have an original story that is pretty cool but too bad the director filming this production was thinking on how to make these scenes way over pronounced but its still a fun ride i understand that the dp of this film loves all the films i mentioned above or at least likes them but he really didnt have to make them so superimposed basically we have a great story built on the shoulders of giants now we all know that this is how great films are made by borrowing really cool ideas but really lets be sensible you dont have to overdue the filmmakers you love in your own production this makes your film transparent the idea of the further region was really cool but ruined when they turned it into a circus act and theatrical production they should have made it more gritty with a lot less colour it was like watching a technicolor disney film from the 50s they should of done the opposite with the colour scheme and put the colour in the real world and the drab colour in the further region because when we dream and if there is colour in your dream its never usually very vibrant and thats what they didnt remember when making this filmnow on a positive notei did like the scare scenes in this even after all the down talk im no film maker but this review comes from just a fan of thrillers and horror films but ill be a man and tell you that i did get scared of the fright scenes they were very effective this film is actually one of the scarier thrillers ive seen in a while actually a long while being it was from the creators of paranormal activity and saw thats just a selling point and nothing more the real talent behind the scares are the writers and dps if it wasnt for great people like this we wouldnt ever have great scary films but im just pointing out some of the things i liked and didnt like i may sound a bit harsh but thats what these reviews by normal everyday people are all about thanks for reading regards jeffrey j turner trnjamesbondaolcom my website wwwgovernmentbullcom,astonish
i was in the mood for a really scary movie and i heard this movie was really scary so i decided to check it out this really is a scary movie although silly at times but when it comes to the scare factor it can get really scary and has tension to it as well i wish the main demon had a different design to it cause some audiences tend to make fun of it a lot instead of get intimidated by it it basically looks like a darth maul demon and when it actually shows the ghost it loses its edge the violin scores is what builds the scare in this movie cause just the violin scores is frightening there is almost no blood and gore in this movie which proves that you dont need those elements to make a movie that is actually scary anyone looking for a good scare should see this flick7610,astonish
i asked it who are you and it said it was a visitor i said what do you want it said dalton thinking that a fall from a ladder as landed their son dalton in a coma josh  renai lambert wilson  byrne are shocked to learn that their son may be possessed instead when told of a way to bring him back the family will risk everything to get their son back let me start by saying i am not scared very easy at all in movies i can count on one hand the movies that have actually scared me saying that the ones that have scared me include poltergeist paranormal activity 1 and  the exorcism of emily rose i say that to tell you that this movie is a lot like those three put together which is why this is one of the scariest movies i have ever seen take that statement as you will but this movie had me sitting up with the lights on for almost the entire time im actually a little surprised that this movie is only pg13 but that just shows how desensitized we are getting to horror one of the best things this movie has going for it is that it is scary without being gory this movie creeped the hell out of me and i loved every minute of it overall i would call this paranormal activity meets poltergeist mixed with what dreams may come with a dash of whatever will make you scream watch this but not alone i give it an awould i watch again  maybe but not soonalso try  paranormal activity 1  2  poltergeist,astonish
with a high average rating here on imdb thought to catch sooner rather than later and i must say i enjoyed the show it does a lot with an obvious thin budget it succeeds i believe on a couple of strengths  not getting too gory having an interesting and a bit scifi ish concept and very good makeup and great use of music while the movie couldve done better with set designs and i grew a bit tired of the inside of houses i thought all the actors were satisfactory and lin shaye as the paranormal lead was very good spoilers i guess i wouldve liked to see the story hashed out a little better  the last third was when it finally started moving nicely  maybe a longer runtime couldve helped and more use and description of astraltravel nonetheless recommended for horror fans and its high average is merited rightly at 710,astonish
this movie was without a doubt one of the best horror films i have seen this year when i read that the makers of saw and paranormal activity were releasing this film i wasnt really expecting much as both these movies seemed to lack the main horror elements for me personal opinion of course i was not scared by neither saw or paranormal activity but created something completely different for me and for most of the other viewers as i have heard was a very thrilling film with many scenes that made me jump just a little as a big horror movie fan i am quick to criticise movies by the way they portray or ghost or a demon as such in if you have seen the movie dont worry i am not giving much away we come in to contact with numerous ghosts and demons from another world which are all different this brought something new to the table as we are not always seeing the clich ghost or the clich demon the plot in this movie was quite a good one and differentiated from normal haunting stories the acting was a lot better than i expected it to be also towards the end of the film the movie got a little out of hand you could say but i wont give too much away the ending was also quite enjoyable and was a rememberable twist not one to forget straight away,astonish
is a movie where a light goes on but the room still feels dark where you are too afraid to look but you are forced to anyways and where things go bump as they always do but you dont see it coming such are the makings of a successful horror film which this is the photography alone would impress hitchcock and even though the material is familiar to the genre director james wan makes it feel juicy and fresh wan enjoys the stuff that nightmares are make of as he has demonstrated here for the third time following saw and the arguably underrated dead silence as accomplished and frightening as is its not perfecttwo problems come to mind first of all patrick wilsons lack of range for a lead role is unacceptable especially next to rose byrne secondly wans ambitious starts to take him into curious territory for the climax insidous goes from being sixth sense to being in the mouth of madness wan flirts a little too closely to the surrealist category and while the film maintains perfect coherency and is certainly no less scary it gets a little hard to take seriously as comes to a closeeven so the film does what it sets out to do its memorable and stands out earning its place as the horror film of the year i hope james wan can keep up the good stuff,astonish
its not easy to make genuinely scary horror movie any more most great ideas have been done and hollywood has a lazy habit remaking the best asian and european horrors and failing miserably is an above average horror that really tries its best to scare the audience but ultimately is let down by a ridiculous storyline and the introduction of two comical charactersthis film is a little bit like freeky 1980s horror film poltergeist the kid gets lost in some kind of ghost world so the family call in a specialist to get him back the problem with this film is that the specialist brings with her a comical pair of ghostbusters and it totally kills the atmospherethis film does have its fair share of scary moments and for that it has to be applauded but in the end it just falls short of being a really good horror flick,astonish
james wans finest a very welldirected and written movie no doubt as i was watching i had visions from poltergeist and the entity wan payed a great homage to these paranormal movies of the 80s and wont let you down this is a very good movie worth watching in a movie theater and it scares in these days its hard to come by the key wan uses here is to keep it simple and clean no gore or violence but following a solid story makes this film much stronger than just a horror and gory movie wan is not used to this thats why we see a more serious side of him that i loved this one did take me back to those days and trust me it scares lets not also forget the presence of barbara hershey the one who scared a generation in the entity go see this if you love paranormal this is the right formula for a good movie,astonish
just saw the film tonight and it was one the best scares i have ever seen in fact it is the best movie i have seen in a very long time it had all the effects you would expect from a ghost story and then adds some boy did that movie make me jump the astral projection thing worked fine and what i liked most was the way the story unfolded which is why i call it the best movie i have seen in a very long time there is no hurry  things evolve naturally from good to weird to worse all the while you are comfortably knowing that youre in for a real treat the cast and the acting was spot on rose byrne is very convincing and sweet as the mother renai lambert who is the first to experience all those strange events to wans credit i also liked the fact that she didnt freak out or that she and her husband josh played by patrick wilson didnt break up because she was hysterical and he just wouldnt understand i really felt that they were a reallife couple not just brought together by a script and a caster but in it together all the waylet it speak for itself  if you like scary movies this is the one you shouldnt miss out onill give 11 stars  the last one is for the goose bumps that just wont go away,astonish
james wan saw and oren peli paranormal activity the two people behind two of the most popular horror franchises in recent years deliver a surprising and terrifying movie in an almost dead genrea family movie into their new house and begins to think its haunted when their son is put into a coma parents josh and renai struggle to uncover the root of these strange happenings and the stress of the situation begins to take a toll on them as they realize that they are dealing with powers beyond human comprehensionthe plot is your run of the mill haunted house story but its a different take on it as they soon find out that its not actually the house thats hauntedrose byrne plays the caring mother who will do whatever it takes to get her son back and find the root of evil and patrick wilson is the father who doesnt really believe what his wife is saying about the house and just wants things back to to the way they werethe acting is solid especially byrne and wilson who are always good and i really liked the different take on the haunted house story but the best part of the movie is just how terrifying it is i was on the edge of my seat all the way through well apart from a few times where i jumped out of my seat scared to death the movie left me with nightmares i highly recommend this to people looking for a good scare that will leave you thinking about it for a couple of days or if your easily scared like me a couple of weeks,astonish
first of all movie was fantastic its been a really long time that i saw a movie this scary totally worth your money and your timejames wan and leigh whannel simply knows how to create the atmosphere we saw that ability in the first installment of saw leigh is a very good writer and james wan simply knows to make that script come alivenowadays horror movies are all about bad scripts bad acting and lots of special effects and of course there are movies like paranormal activity done with low budget and wants to scare us with their so called realism this movie is also like the old horror movies especially the music sounds like very old like the exorcist and stuff but i really liked it sound effects were really god for example the bam effect not comes with the scary visual james wan wants to take your time to see it for yourself than he hits the sound effects and take the scene to a whole new level first hour of the film is really slow but its also good to create the atmosphere and get to know our characters second hour is the best its like an unstoppable mindblowing scary movie i think that james wan and leigh whannel keeps this genre alive they respect the works of wes crawen john carpenter and all the other masters also they are very aware of what theyre doing and theyre aware of the power they have so theyre coming to scare and surprise us once again its not a thriller like saw but its not a empty teen horror movie either its a good horror flick that worth seeing,astonish
watching this horror movie was very enjoyableunlike most movies of this genre that have innumerable clichs managed to stay away from most of them acting from patrick william and rose were on the spot direction was also great this movie is indeed a must watch for any horror fans the scare tactics used in this movie is also excellent and is well placedanother plus point for is its soundtrack and its usage in the movie the movie doesnt have dull moments and once the plot sets in you are certainly in for a ridei feel that is one step ahead of paranormal activity and fans of pa wont be disappointed with the best horror movie of 2011 so far,astonish
just saw the movie as not being a horror fan i liked it good cinematography good sound and music acting was great it is a well made film in my point of view i was especially surprised to see astral projection being plotted in the movie something you cant see much in horror films thumbs up for that is it scary depends is it worth it i would recommend itwell whats my problem then well i bet everyone my generation knows about the marlboro man he is cool he is the raw model male homo sapiens he has lead many people to smoke to be as cool he also died of cancer as many have died following his path this is the marlboro man of the scary astral projection realm dont go there you will get your body snatched everywhere is dark and you need a light to see until you bump into an alienemotionalized ghostly face the way i see it its a alien fax machines invade the planet movie but i know my fax machine many dont know astral travel i hoped at least they could have included some reality or info on the subject at least people have now heard the subject and will show enthusiasm to astral projection if they havent already shitted them selves ,astonish
this is easily one of the best horror movies ive seen in awhile i had family over and what the heck popped in the bluray and i did see many of the scenes coming but everything from the horror sound effects to everything else the movie is amazing i have never been this scared after watching a movie im 19 now and i like to think ive grown up from getting scared but this movie really did it i was told about this movie awhile ago but i didnt want to watch it on dvd my mission was to wait for the bluray as such hype for a movie can only do justice on bluray im definitely going to give it another watch in a few days ive already recommended the movie to a few on my friends as one of the best horror flicks in awhile,astonish
its 2am i just finished sitting through i watched it with my roommate who promptly stood up at the credits and said and i quote good luck sleeping dude i then turned on half the lights in my apartment got a cold drink and i am now sitting in a fully lit bedroom typing my review i love scary movies i love watching them and then being disappointed at their utterly predictable failure when i saw the poster advert for this movie i wasnt even interested the old possessed kid or demon child bit has been done to death especially recently i didnt even give the trailer a chance but for whatever reason i just decided to check it out and from the first 30 seconds of the film to this exact moment right now i have an eerie creepy wrenching feeling stuck in my gut i feel like something is over my shoulder and i am stressed out i dont want to turn off my lights or look out my window blinds i am now afraid to open my bedroom door after having closed it and locked it my review the film is done perfectly it had a little bit of everything even a few light moments of humor but not enough to draw you away from the sinking feeling it gives you the musical score sounds more like alarms in your brain telling you to run you dont just hear it you are bothered by it the physical settings were a perfect backdrop with an oldness that in a way became a character in itself the acting each character and their roles and the way they where affected byby the main antagonist as i will put say uh shivering i just need to forget that face and that sound those movements for the rest of my life my mind is totally playing tricks on me now but on another note watch this movie preferably with backup and follow it up with a care bears and rainbow bright marathon its the only thing that will get you emotionally back into shape and able to physically and mentally function afterward hooray to the writers director and actors who finally for once assembled such a great horror film it should be rereleased golf clap note there is more film after the credits,astonish
so this film promises screamsand he does ityou never gonna sleep or take you pictures again after watching this film nice filmed and nice acted i cant imagine how wonderful is this film i love this filmsimply love it have an excellent plot amazing performances amazing script amazing characters wow this must be the most original horror film since evil dead i am 15 years old and i have watched more than 500 american horror films then like 200 foreigner horror films i think i have the correct mind to review this film and say that is one of the greatest horror films and gonna marks history the producers of sawyeah they do this film james wan have an interesting view of horror filmsi like that view,astonish
first of all i am 38 so maybe age is a factor i had nothing to do this evening so i decided to go watch i liked the reviews i saw on here that spoke highly of it and all in all i was not disappointed the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat however i did not find it thaaat scary what i found real scary was the lady behind me who screamed at the top of her lungs every time a door was slammed open or slammed shut i would rather say you will be startled a lot during the movie startled rather than scared in the first half of the movie what you may find scary is the fear you see and hear everywhere on the actors faces and perhaps behind you if that woman finds a seat behind you too it was during the first half that i was bored with all the slamming doors and gasps leading nowhere it reminded of the movie scream part 1 when drew barrymore was being chased outside in the garden and i was thinking yada yada they will never kill drew then she was slain and gone in the first 5 minutes that made the movie but here on this one after a 100 slammed doors and screeching windows i was more exhausted than scared then in the second half what they are afraid of starts to show the story is a patchwork of so many pieces you have seen from here and there a minute from the exorcist a minute from the grudge a minute from gothica and indeed a minute from saw towards the end when the dad faces his own demons you will see what i mean the story is nothing amazing and that heck of one single expression on every single actors face that doesnt change how the story is told however is a different matter this is not the others or sixth sense but it is a good movie on the whole would i watch it again or buy the dvd no,astonish
at the time i saw this it was number one in the american box office chart and it was billed as one of the scariest movies ever and being from the makers of saw and paranormal activity i was keen to try it from director james wan saw basically the lambert family josh patrick wilson and renai rose byrne and their three children are settling into their new home theyve moved into their son dalton ty simpkins one night hears noises in the attic and goes eight year old to investigate and he climbs a ladder which has one step step and cause him to fall and the next morning he has fallen into a mysterious coma three months pass and he is still in a coma that the doctor says wasnt caused by the fall and over the next few days paranormal events occur in the house renai seeing and hearing scary things including a bloody hand print in daltons bed and dark figures josh agrees that if she is so worried the house is haunted they can move house however the new house makes no difference as the dark forces have followed them to their location therefore renai has a talk with joshs mother lorraine black swans barbara hershey who refers her to paranormal activity expert elise rainier lin shaye who agrees to see them about the fearful goings on along with her team specs saws leigh whannell also writing and tucker angus sampson and she does confirm that they are being tormented by evil forces but it is not the house that is haunted it is dalton because he has the ability to have his soul walk around out of his body and the coma status has forced him into another dimension guarded by the evil and there are nasty entities trying to take over his body but the nearest is a black figure with a red face of fire with renai and joshs agreement they begin a form of exorcism to get rid of the spirits and try to make way for dalton to come back to the real world there is a little bit of progress made elise tells josh that he also has the same ability to transport his soul out of his body like dalton explained from photo evidence with him as a child and a dark figure getting closer to him she says the only way to get him back is to enter the demons world the further without being noticed by the other spirits eventually after the near doom josh does manage to get dalton out of the spirit world and they both return to their bodies renai is relieved to have them both back in the end we see them slowly going back to normal and we see josh really lose it with elise when she takes a photo of him he kills her after she sees an evil figure and the horrible ending is not happy with renai discovering evil is still present and we dont know what happens next also starring andrew astor as foster lambert heather tocquigny as nurse kelly and ruben pla as dr sercarz i can see the comparison to paranormal activity and poltergeist and there are elements of a few other haunted house films even though its not technically the house but i genuinely found it scary i jumped at least five times even some bits i knew i would i did i admit some shock value does not work the second time watching but it is still a really worthwhile scary supernatural horror thriller good,astonish
possible spoilerslets be real here people this movie does make you jumpthat being said followed a similar formula of a perfect getaway that being a brilliant idea meets an overworked plot the movie started out creepy jumpy and very ominous but as it progressed i failed to buy into the overcomplicated plot was the idea cool you bet but was it really necessary not reallymy problem with horror movies like this is that theatre is classified as art art is meant for interpretation and movies like these end off with very little interpretation dont get me wrong there is a moment where one can wonder at the end whats going to happen but that still takes away from the overall point to have end off on an open closure point and analmost untold finish would have really put more than just the jumpy fear back into my boots it makes it mischievous to come home after this movie and think what happened whats going to happen to me if i fall asleep and never wake up interpretation takes its course the acting was subpar at best i have no idea where the other two kids went throughout the movie and the characterization that was developed early was uselessfor those who like the closure points and modern day generic style of horror movies then is for you for those who like to come up with your own ideas it is still possible to enjoy the movie as is but seeing as its average at best like a vas majority of recent horrorsuspense movies trust me when i say it is not for every horrorsuspense fan,astonish
2011 12 patrick wilson rose byrne ty simpkins lin shaye barbara hershey leigh whannell angus sampson paranormal activity meets poltergeist is the best way to describe this derivative particularly of the latter flick about a family plagued by ghostly beings despite the attempt to move only to find the specters following themand deign to possess their comatose young son one genuine shock spoiled by the trailer thank you trailer in seeing the nasty black  red demon  a bastard of darth maulfreddy kruger and the bogeyman  is the only thing keeping this underwhelming scare fest alive with its bmovie tropes ie creaking doors shock jumps  the telegraphic score director james the original saw teams up again with scripting bud whannell who has a small role as a comic relief ghostbuster but there is little magic or horror in the making,astonish
is an interesting movie the script is well written is it a haunted house story a haunted individual the movies story keeps you guessing i found answers to these questions stupid i thought you have to be kidding however the movies ending was strong the story is complemented with great acting and directing the movie had no slow spots or over acting i would give an eight out of ten the movie is worth seeing in the theatre i would definitely v o d the movie i did not recognize any of the actors in the movie the story is fresh but hard to swallow astro projecting in ones sleep to another dimension unbelievable,astonish
im going to go ahead and say that is one of the best pg13 horror movie of the past twenty years or at least of the 2000s only to be beaten out by drag me to hell is really scary let me just state that now it is scary because it takes successful horror movies what was scary about them and applies them i noticed some parts borrowed from poltergeist drag me to hell and of course paranormal activity all of which were scary on their own by using their own method notice how i said borrowed and not stolen this is only because was not a flop but rather a hit in the horror industry its true the first half of the movie is way more scary than the second once the actual story starts to unfold it feels more like a video game yes i know it is weird to compare a horror movie to a video game but i felt as though i was in silent hill towards the ending not that thats a bad thing but it is honestly how i felt all in all is really good but in the near future i feel it will be forgotten it doesnt go the extra mile and isnt an achievement in the horror industry if you are a horror fan i suggest seeing it and play a game where you point out what parts are borrowed if youre not a horror fan take your girlfriend boyfriend to see it because it is that scary,astonish

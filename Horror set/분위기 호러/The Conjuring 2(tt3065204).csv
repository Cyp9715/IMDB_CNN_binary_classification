2 doesnt waste time in bringing the scares in by that i mean youre pretty much in the thick of it within three minutes or so being given some background via another very notorious haunting incident for what is to followthe warrens are sent on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which is whipping up a media storm in enfield england and as per the first movie they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation as per the first movie a family is being haunted and they fear for their sanity and lives there are a few new twists this time round so all does not play out as before  but its not a complete departure from the format which might have made it a bit more gripping in places james wans trademark visual style is repeated in this movie  his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm when its intended to scare it really does the scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension even if youve seen the original so well done to wan for thatwhats really enjoyable about this movie is its nostalgic recreation of 70s england wan has really done a great job of this which is surprising given that hes not from there also the central support role of janet hodgson is pretty crucial to empathising with the enfield family and madison wolfe gives a solid performanceits arguable this one is as strong as the first i really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed part one or indeed likes movies of a haunting or possession theme stick around for the credits  the music is seriously unsettling,astonish
was a shocking horror film it combined every creepy trope you can think of ghosts dolls music boxes mirrors you name it and it actually worked thanks to a genresavvy director behind the curtains james wan has proved himself a capable producer on projects such as saw and insidious and with he cemented himself as a master of the genre it had the perfect amalgam of horror tropes crafted in such a way that felt as fresh and spinetingling as classic haunted house movies did in the 80s 2 is another based on true events tale that has us follow expert paranormal investigators the warrens this time solving the mystery of the enfield haunting similar to the amityville haunting the enfield haunting sees an english family plagued with a poltergeist that doesnt seem to enjoy the presence of anyone in the house what 2 succeeds at is giving us both character development and another great story which is exactly what a good sequel should do the acting is uniformly great but the true star of the film is james wan his shots are designed in a way to imbue dread and stir it around our heads for a while before hitting us with the scare thats what true horror lacks these days patience the longer the anticipation is built and the more atmosphere is created the more unsettling the situation becomes until its like a ticking time bomb that you anxiously wait to go off it uses familiar tropes such as selfstarting childrens toys slamming doors and smashing furniture but theyre used as tools to mask the truly frightening fact that this family is up against something utterly beyond their control  theyre hopeless and we can feel itmind you 2 isnt without its faults the runtime is a blatant offender pushing the 2hour mark is never a good idea for a horror film and some fat definitely could have been trimmed there are a handful of cheap scares audio scares to be precise  when the music gets extremely loud all of a sudden and you find yourself more annoyed than scared quickly reaching for the remote to turn the volume down at the risk of enduring another ear drum shattering noise it also doesnt feel as unique as its predecessor understandably due to the very nature of sequels but there are moments that drag on long enough to remind you that the first didnt have these plodding plot points for example it takes about an hour for the warrens to even get to england also while in the haunted house theyre able to sleep through some horrifying sounds that would snap a bear right out of hibernation but these dull spots and plot inconsistencies are few and far between2 is how a horror sequel should be done its slick stylish fun and at times quite terrifying when a horror movie makes me want to turn on the lights as i go roaming around the house at night i consider that a job well done 2 well done,astonish
wow wow wow ive never been much of a fan of sequels but 2 was incredible im never one to jump at everything scary i see in movies as usually youve seen it all before  lets be honest nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore however had me jumping all over the place at one point i even yelped much to my embarrassment but thats why we go to horror movies to be scared  didnt disappoint all actors gave amazing performances  the story had you never in a state of boredom walking out of the cinema i couldnt wait to see what 3 would bring assuming were lucky enough for another definitely a movie to see in the cinema i give it 1010 great movie,astonish
first the allimportant question is 2 scary like jump out of your seat watch through your outstretched fingers scary the answer to that is yes under james wans direction even the most clichd hauntedhouse tropes and this movie is bursting with them are genuinely creepy and although the movie isnt overly reliant on jump scares the ones it does usewell they work on a lizardbrain level 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark and some of its simplest momentslike a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlightare its most effective bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and don burgess gloomy cinematographyspeaking of tropes thats where the based on a true story bit comes in the main plot of the film revolves around a reallife incident known as the enfield poltergeist an extremely welldocumented case of a supposed ghost who terrorized the hodgson family of north london from 1977 to 1979 and was apparently a fan of the classics knocking on walls shaking beds throwing furniture and even the occasional haunted kids toy and as malevolent spirits often do it picked on one of the children in particular 11yearold janet hodgson madison wolfe call it a collective delusion or a desperate cry for attention from a disturbed child or call it what the movie very explicitly calls it the devilwith this installment movies may have overtaken the exorcist as the most christian of horror franchises taking place in a universe where the catholic church is the spiritual shield and demon hunters ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga its holy roller superagents the film opens with the warrens investigating the famous amityville case during the course of which lorraine first encounters the hellish presence that will haunt her for the next few years fearing for his life she begs her husband to suspend any future paranormal investigations to which he reluctantly agrees until that is a priest arrives to give them their next mission travel to london and confirm the veracity of reports of a demonically tinged hauntingboth farmiga and wilson are given their chance to shine in spooky set piecesfarmiga early on in the film wilson later but while theyre both convincing in spiritual warrior mode wans decision to play up the romance between the two doesnt quite work we knew that the warrens were a happily married couple in the first movie but having them each individually tell the story of their paranormal love and ed make suggestive comments about the sleeping arrangements seems odd maybe because theyre flirting in front of a possessed preteen whose soul is currently in the process of being swallowed by the pit on the other hand this is just another day at the office for the warrens the nonhorror elements of the film are uneven in general the score so effective in the fright scenes suddenly evokes eye rolls when things start to get sentimental and theres one scene of unintentional comedy where the films retro 70s settinganother element downplayed in the first film but foregrounded herecollides with its demonic imagery in an honestly pretty silly way 2 shares its predecessors eye for period details some of which seem outandout ridiculous until theyre juxtaposed with photos of their reallife counterparts in the end credits the onthenose pop music gets no such redemption that being said there are also some truly funny moments like a shot of the hodgson family running from their haunted house after a particularly intense bout of psychokinetic activity that riffs on smartasses favorite retort why dont they just move and for the record they dont move because its public housing and the local council which is naturally quite skeptical of the whole ghost thing has to approve the relocation its also worth noting that 2 is more than two hours long allowing for lots of escalation and while each individual haunting scene can be whiteknuckle intense by the dozenth or so such shock the film starts to lose momentum so the final confrontation when it does come is a relief in more ways than one the long running time also allows wan to overthink his demonology the main villain an infernal nun is appropriately nightmarish if reminiscent of the veiled bride in black from wans own insidious whats less compelling is the insertion of the crooked man a storybook scarecrow monster that starts spreading babadookesque chaos about halfway through and is explained as the demon assuming a form thats familiar to the hodgsons which would be fine if it werent for the two familiar forms that the spirit has taken alreadywhen 2 focuses its efforts on scaring the audience it succeeds wildly and why wouldnt it wans got his horror technique locked down at this point its the parts where it wanders away from the basics of creating and releasing tension that prevent it from outdoing its predecessor,astonish
2 is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be it is a perfectly executed haunting movie from james wan that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision belief and faith the family drama is still right at the center and is quite effective and vera farmiga and patrick wilson are excellent to their roles the film doesnt give anything new at the horror movie genre but its set pieces are often impressive even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares the truth is that 2 has enough suspense and story to have appeal for all kinds of horror fans and is a film clever enough to scare us nikisreviewscom,astonish
i was really surprised about what an amazing job james wan did with this sequel from the very start it captures you and keeps you attached to the screen there is no way you can get bored i loved the suspense that goes increasing pretty quickly through the whole film i could feel my heart in my ears beating faster as the atmosphere grew creeper and creeper i enjoyed all the small details threw around such as the name of the demon that was showed in the warrens house more than once in the background leaving me with the question why that word keeps being repeated nobody in that house has that name only at the end i figured out what it meant i absolutely adored the whole plot and the plot twist within make up and special effects were crazy they made you get chills running down your spine the soundtrack was impeccable it played a big part in creating the right atmosphere few jump scares very well situated some of them very unpredictable didnt see a couple of them coming at all i found that vera farmiga was absolutely stunning with her performance in this movie i loved the way lorraine had her moment when stepping in to save her husband condemning the demonic entity back to hell she was incredibly intense personally i think patrick wilson did a better job in this movie compared to the first i felt like ed and his relationship with lorraine was a lot more highlighted i highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of the paranormal you cant miss it,astonish
2 is directed by james wan and stars vera farmiga and patrick wilson 2 is an excellent horror movie and just a flat out great movie in general from the camerawork to the performances this movie delivers on all fronts the plot follows a family in poverty in einfieldengland that start experiencing strange happenings in their home after things become much worse over a period of time the warrens are contacted to come and help this is a very scary movie thanks to james wans direction from lingering and tracking shots he is truly a master behind the camera the scares come quite often as scenes will linger and bring a huge sense of tension and get you when your not expecting it bringing some very frightening scenes vera farmiga and patrick wilsons performances are excellent as you buy into their relationship and learn some lessons on marriage the children actors have the be given credit too as they are great in this film these kids are terrified of the haunting and you will feel their dread i am so satisfied with this film generally people worry about horror sequels usually because they can turn out unsuccessful but i am happy to report as a big fan of the first movie this is just as great,astonish
i was really counting on this movie to raise my scare level to the top and if you havent seen this movie you have no idea what i am talking about oh my gosh this film was freaking terrifying for three years i was plagued with nightmares of the first movie and i didnt think any movie could be more scary definitely proved me wrong not only were there jump scares but real horror not just being startled by a loud noise but james wan shows us what real horror is there were many rising suspense scenes and you have no idea what will happen that is what scary is demons are what true scariness are what lurks in the darkness is something to be terrified about and this movie shows us this perfectly like i said it does have jump scares and i appreciated that why because none if them are false they were not a cat jumping out or a character popping out every single one was real and lived up to the rising suspense that was built up not only is it scary but it is an awesome story as a matter of fact a trur story it was very well told and unlike most horror movies today it actually had a plot the twist in the end is brilliant unpredictable and pieced together the plot elements well also greatly shot greatly acted and great character development unlike most horror movies this has likable characters unlike most horror movies its not a gore fest or has countless swear words its rated r just because of how scary it is i love james wan he is terrific at what he does every horror director now days needs to see the insidious trilogy and of course the 2 movies this has restored my faith in horror movies i definitely recommend it see it with your spouse friends girlfriend or boyfriend definitely do not bring your kids and you will have the thrill of a lifetime by the way you might want to look under your bed tonight ,astonish
the thing about series is that it screams classic right at the first few scenes and just works its way up from there while is definitely being remembered as one of the most excellent horror movies in decades its sequel does even a better job by providing some extra welldone scenes that are not normally seen within the gerne but how about the scare part is it scary definitely yes dont bother comparing it to the first one just enjoy the movie and you will find yourself holding your breath until the very last moment vera farmiga was superb her presence was so strong and powerful that she managed to pull the viewer through all kind of emotions patrick wilson was also wonderful indeed there are some subtle little hints about a sequel here and there in the movie if those two continues to star and also with james wan there is no doubt that it would be another masterpiece,astonish
dont take me wrong i did not hate 2 it is an enjoyable film in many terms but i need to stress out that this is one of the many films that have come lately which is absolutely all about selling the product the hype the anticipation the goal of the producers lies 1 second after the ticket is sold and not quite 1 second after the film is over 2 takes its context out of a very documented paranormal case which took place in england in 1977 it narrates the story of a family of 5 single mom and 4 children which are tormented by a spirit and who eventually get to be assisted by expertsinthesetopics ed and loraine warrenthe premise might not be original at all but it still works the problem comes when such a premise is used at an attempt to pull off an over 2 hours long feature film about 30 minutes in you will start to notice that this film is desperate it is desperate to make you scared and live up to its own trailers and expectations it might succeed on some mostly children under 14 who sneaked inside the theater or whose irresponsible parents lied about their age at the ticket booth but seasoned horror film enthusiasts will be able to anticipate almost every single jumpscare or even take a leap of faith and predict the outcome of a whole scene why because everything that happens in 2 you have already seen or experienced in other films this is the type of film you can watch with a notebook and start checking those clichs as they appear the effort through which the writers struggled to come out with anything barely original or never seen before is noticeable and every time they fail now considering this film is 110min long you will get tired quickly of hearing a loud noise the a scream and the some generic paranormal door slam or furniture dash because it happens a lot and it get old a lot fasterdont get me wrong it is not a trash film production values alone are worth the ticket the film is beautifully filmed in dark and ominous colors and the house looks stunning even in almost 95 darkness the music is interesting and tense and the acting is top notch and the vile nun got myself quite convinced it was marilyn manson but if youre there for the technical specs of it you could have gone to other place to watch citizen kaneit saddens me a little to be witness of the decadence of the horror genre where most of the production money goes towards jumpscare rollercoaster rides like this one the recipe for box office success was found and they just keep making the same cake with different glazing you will probably notice that before the film even starts when you see that 4 trailers and then you cannot make the difference between the 4 generic horror movies youve been shown probably you wont even be able to recall the names of the films because it doesnt matter 3 stars enjoyable overall but terribly generic,astonish
james wan is the genuine sir alfred hitchcock of the 21st centurythree years ago the world went crazy with the 5th invention of the malay director james wan  my king master and role model  triumphs in critics and box office bringing a breakthrough and resurgence to horror movies in the last decade it was compared with classics like the exorcist and the omen and is considered as the master jewel of malayan and the cinematographic of horror wan has continuously been providing us great achievements in commercial films since his major debut as a director with saw in 2004 to his first action film 7 furious last year his shiny and original style to portray suspense and horror through each frame has made to the director reaches to the top of podium of the films not only in the horror genre also the action genre and we hope more hell try to experiment 2 opens the same iconic way that its predecessor now is the famous case of amityville 112 ocean avenue which reveals to ed and lorraine warren the renowned paranormal investigators duo amityville was the event that gave them renown and recognition to investigators but not by their horrible experiences but by unbelief and ignorance of the people which didnt believe it possible that those things happen later within the film we continue to validating in a 90s tv show lack of confidence and credibility of the people towards the warrens ironically that skepticism would be powered once more with the enfield poltergeist the case more documented to paranormal level the famous massacre defeo family has been adapted millions and millions of times a big screen however wan manages to save that gloomy essence of the night of the murder and projects it of a delirious and disturbing way in lorraines head from the first minutes horror genre shinesthe enfield case is adapted with purity and splendor of a script credited to carey hayes and chad hayes  james wan and david leslie johnson wan dodges references of the two small programs have focused on the event bbcs ghostwatch and timothy spalls miniseries to develop to ed and lorraine in the story in real life warrens had not the least significance in the case they only evidenced it one night the film takes its time  somebody says that enough i for one the more see jamess delights more i go crazy  to introduces the destabilized life of peggy hodgson frances oconnor the events happened in a interval between 1977 and 1979 to capture each sublime moment of the epoch it was vital the intervention of the department of costume led by kristin burke the department of light and art led by fiona gavin a todd holland and andrew rothschild which not exaggerated in capturing the atmosphere of the 70s and 80s wan is amazing to recreate complex and refined milieus and sets every shadow square furniture door toy and even each color play a fundamental role in the creation of the style of the director a director who is delicately precise with his details even though was a humble house without many luxuries or support tools the visual tension is concurrenton a night as any hodgson family is sleeping peacefully after a tiring day two of the four children janet madison wolfe and margaret lauren esposito are awakened abruptly from their nap by an unknown entity immediately they go to tell what happened them to her mother who refuses to believe and finds an ouija board manually made by her daughters next day harassment persist more sharply up to the point that the mother experiences with her own eyes paranormal events  jamess interesting proposal to not to fall into the clich that nobody believes them meanwhile a suggestive subplot takes place in warren family lorraine tends to keep fragments of each case and in their latest investigations she sees to the demon nun bonnie aarons a superb and shocking demonic nun who torments them with a sinister intent that purpose will intertwine of a sumptuous way with hodgsons ending which never happenedwan knows how to distort every trick in his favor rung by rung construction makes that final climax has really earned wan is distinguished by the ability to frighten or intimidate the audience with shots both day as at night he knows play and combine the tools that possesses knows to keep constant tone of his film he doesnt allow his audience to sleep and even though this time he uses to more jumpscares than its predecessor are equally enjoyable and are not shamelessly used all of the above is essential in the foundations however the actors take all the credit ed lorraine peggy and her four children especially janet are fabulous measured and charismatic2 is credited with the title horror film of the year and is used for viewing the constant advancement of its director within the genre its hard to watch and hear the film is not suitable for hearts or minds weak 2 an instant classic,astonish
for the most part i came out with a positive vibe with the film productionwise i thought it was exceptionally well done and coming off the original one i can definitely say this held its own very well sequels have this innate ability to overdo what the previous installment did and one might say this did it in some sense but for the most part it played with a dialedback approach i mean look what am i supposed to say about a film that is supposedly based on a true story sure they will take their liberties here and there regarding what to make happen and how but if they say it happened what am i to do in telling them theyre doing what happened wrong or overly much it was the right amount of more donein my opinion alone which will not be consistent with everybody here the first hour was terrifying depends on what one considers scary the crowd interacted with the film appropriately and the actors on screen did their due diligence to make you fearful for their wellbeing pacingwise the second hour took a strange turn i was fine with what they did by creating more of a slowburn effect to build up to a large climax but considering there wasnt much to be considered scary in the second hour it kind of felt like we got slowburn for nothing the end punch was fine just not nearly as frightening as anything in the first hour is all i cant really explain it thats okay i guess but im sure this film ran over two hours long and i think the most appropriate cut would have been about right at two hours i was only slightly fatigued by the end of it alljames wan has a terrific eye for the horror genre and likes to display an array of emotions in his films especially comedy where needed nothing slapstick at all just the perfect blend of realism like this is how a person acts in real life something that christopher nolan has never been able to do himself the characters arent just pieces to tell a larger story they are the story patrick wilson is silently one of my favorite actors often taking the nonblockbuster role but still holding his own in a natural way i have only seen vera farmiga in a few films now the departed orphan up in the air source code safe house and and with every scene she is in she just encapsulates me i would love to sit down and have a dinner conversation with her if you know what i meancompared to the first film id say this resorted with a few more jump scares but im going to credit wan for not cheapening them and doing them where they fit no kids scaring each other etc this film did not play with the less is more mantra as much as the first film though but like i said ill go with that in a sequel the first one also had much more even pacing and left with the right amount of questions unanswered not to be unfair with this but i also believe the story of the first film more than this one only regarding what was seen on the screen however in 2 i cared more about this family and i think the tension was equally as good in this film save the night scenes being just a little too welllit for my taste id say i might like the first one just a little bit more at least in that i own the first one on bluray and i dont know if i need this one immediately oh and just be aware that the official trailer reveals way too much im not even talking about jump scare material which it does overdo but i mean story material avoid please watch the teaser trailer instead that one is perfect and reveals nothing substantial also make sure you stay for the first billing credits sequence at the end of the movie just because of how well it is crafted as was the film itself if only they cut out 10 minutes and maybe even 10 million in the budget i think it would have served its purpose a little more appropriately unlike sinister 2 though this film didnt disappoint in the slightest,astonish
this is going to be less of a review and more of a rant so let me get the good parts of the movie out of the way its competently acted and there isnt a bad child actor in the bunch its also pretty well shot with james wan using long shots where the camera floats around and through windows and walls giving it a feeling of omnipotence now for the badthe intro is god awful im not exaggerating when i say it made my entire theater erupt in laughter as lorraine warren pulled out in invisible shotgun to murder a family in a sort of dreamsequence this accompanied by the fact that her hands are sped up every time she pulls the lever back to reload turn an intentionally intense introduction into a selfparody next this movies cgi is also god awful they were so lazy with so many parts that its almost unbelievable how this movie has been made out to be a masterpiece by so many people instead of using a prop cigarette that produces smoke they said fk it and just made crappy cg smoke instead of using machines to produce fake snow or create realistic rain effects the crew must have decided that was gonna take too much effort so they instead just cgd the rain and snow effects and they arent even good cg like in the fast and furious movies that wan does its like he decided his vfx and fx crews should be made up of entirely by monkeys with downsyndrome the 2spooky4me memelord skelingtons in this movie dont look any better the possessed girl yeah ill get to the clichs of the story later is completely cg including her fake face veins and shty catmonster eyes and the evil nun demon monster that makes no sense has a cg mouth tentacle thing that looks straight out of the resident evil movies that shouldnt be getting made anymore but the icing on this ss flavored cake is the amazing idea to put the skeleton from the nightmare before christmas in this movie complete with the wonky frame rate that comes with claymation that makes things look like they arent really moving right it doesnt make sense on an artistic level cause it isnt fcking scary and even less sense in a real life level the dog literally transforms into the monster in front of a little boys very eyes like if it has this power why did it decide to use it only right there and never again thats probably more useful than just about every other monsters power in this movie yet it just decides to do it once and only for the spooks cause lol this movie is so scary right guys gosh james wan u master of horror u also cgi tree spikes killing major characters in hallucinations is definitely 100 super intense not fake looking at all gr8 job m8 88ok for my favorite part the story it doesnt make fking sense like ive seen so many message boards trying to understand certain motivations and all i can think is guys no one writing this movie gave a sht there is no explanation so first off the main antagonist is valak or whatever and he can only be defeated by finding out then saying his name yadda yadda yadda clich clich clich sure whatever now this nun monster valak enters the movie in physical form to terrorize lorraine warren once in her little spirit world and once inside her house btw the house scene this movies socalled scariest scene of the decade is absolutely retarded the demon literally grabs a picture uses it as a face and runs at lorraine while both its hands are still holding the picture it looks like those kids that try to do naruto ninja running because their parents dont love them now you might be saying why does she do that well wouldnt you know it the house the warrens investigate just so happens to be terrorized by valak so valak must have been fcking with lorraine to try and draw her and her husband to the house right except as soon as they get to the house the demon tries to make it look like the family is faking everything and therefore tries and almost succeeds in making the paranormal investigators leave what was the point in haunting lorraine then if it wasnt to draw her to the house the only explanation can be just to scare the audience in fact drawing them to the house only leads to the demon being defeated there is absolutely no reason lorraine should be seeing this ghost unless it is through some kind of ghost world logic that the movie never explains if that is true then its pretty fcking stupid to not explain a major loreplot element like that to the audience once god this movie makes me want to jump off the roof of my house more than everyday life already does so i rate it 310 dont see it unless you want cancer i hope somebody actually reads this big wall oftext review,astonish
maybe spoiler in review2 is one of the best movie sequels ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of sequels i loved the first one and when i found out about the 2nd one i thought yeah i dont know most likely going to be really bad then i saw the trailer and thought hmmm this doesnt look half bad then i finally got to see it tonight and i couldnt believe how amazed i was at it it was scary suspenseful and jumpy one thing i loved about it is that they get straight into the action they dont wait 20 minutes to scare the living hell out of you they like to throw in a jumpscare 23 minutes into the film they dont add some crappy boring 20minute introduction scene know one cares to see its boom into it,astonish
the first was scary tense and original it scared you when you least expected it and it scared you even when you expected it the sequel however is the first time a horror movie ever gave me goose bumps never has a movie ever given me goosebumpsdoes that tell you something  the direction is top rate and the acting is solid the pacing is superb as the director lets the story unfold at its own pace like the first movie 2 borrows from the real life case files of ed and lorraine warren two real life ghost hunters that had a knack for getting the truth out the film opens up in the famous amityville horror house and goes from that investigation which lorraine said the evil in that house is as close to hell as she ever wanted to get then the story moves to england and the house of a normal family named hodgson and the stark horror that awaited them the enfield haunting as it came to be known has the distinction of being one of the most documented cases in the area of the paranormal things occurred there that no one can explain from cops to paranormal scientists no one could explain how it was done from scratching inside the walls to the young girl named janet being tortured and speaking in voices of course there is the people that tried hard to disprove it and only muddled the waters further when the attacks intensify and the catholic church is brought into it the church sends in ed and lorraine to investigate not to get involved just observe lorraine is plagued by fear that if they do get involved itll mean eds death but from the moment they get there things escalate to the point that the warrens realize they cant just sit back and observe there is danger here and janet is targeted for death by the vengeful spiritand so begins a struggle to find out just what it is theyre dealing with a ghost demon or hoax that struggle is going to lead the warrens to the edge of despair and it might cost them dearly in the endthe story is based on true events but like 2 is based on the fact that the warrens investigated the haunting they never solved it they never had epic battles like the films suggested but thats reality and we are looking for entertainment and as entertainment this is entertainment of the finest kind best money youll ever spend at the movies this year and best money youll send renting or buying the dvd in other words go see it,astonish
i was a fan of the first movie and a big fan of all of james wans horror movies i love his unique skill of creating tension and keeping you on your toes but i feel like he has taken big steps to becoming one of the best directors there isthe movie itself has pretty similar structure than the first one that is not a bad thing though it has some good scares and nice tension like a horror movie should but the cinematography and the quality of directing in the movie kind of surprised me the movie looked really beautiful and and its something that i personally appreciate a lot the characters in the movie were very likable for a horror movie its very important to be able to care for the characters i think that is something that separates good horror from bad their relationships were well written and the actors did a really good job i especially liked patrick wilson i have always liked him but after seeing this i like him even more in the middle of all the horror and frustration of the nasty situation the family had there was a really beautiful scene that actually made me emotional its pretty rare when watching a horror moviei think the movie was just really well made horror movies used to be low budget and low effort films in the past nowadays some are made with great talent and effort its not just good horror movie it has heart and style and great acting the very ending of the film made me give it 910 instead of 1010 but can recommend this to anyone who likes horror or just appreciates movies,astonish
james wan is creatively bankrupt and grossly over rated i went to see 2 today with a friend and i was completely fed up by the endthe movie starts off with a blatant marketing pitch for what im guessing is going to be 3 why else introduce the amityville horror at the beginning which has absolutely nothing to do with the enfield poltergeist its just so james wan can keep milking his franchise like he did with 1 with annabelle and the god awful insidious series etc either that or they will make a spin off featuring marilyn manson in a nuns outfitso then the film shifts to london with a cringeworthy attempt of signifying that we are now in london by playing london calling by the clash cue stock footage of very british things and blah blah blah we are in a school playground where we meet janet and then its over to her house to meet her caricature mother the mother who has the most fake sounding cockney accent you will ever hear in england we refer to it as mockney its so over done and put on you wonder why wan didnt just hire an actress from eastenders the acting may have been worse but at least youd have more of a real sounding london accent that scene where she goes into the basement of the house with a mate to mess about with the washing machine i felt like i was watching a live london stage show where the actors over do the acting and accentthankfully i wasnt the only one in the cinema who laughed out loud at the actor playing maurice grosse another awful awful representation of a real person his moustache and hair looked glued on and again was nothing more than a hilarious caricature most of the extras in this movie people playing the police etc had no fluidity at all just a stale rigid performance devoid of anything you could relate to real peopleevery scary scene is a loud bass thump accompanied by a jump scare this is the extent of james wans creative vision mind you i will give him credit for the chair scene where janet is blurred out in the background and old bill comes for a chat with patrick wilson you can see bills face form slowly as he talks thats as good as the film gotthere was no tension no atmosphere nothing the inside of the house was huge for a london council flat flats like that are tiny in realityand the demons great plan for mr warrens demise was to make him fall from the top window and impale him on a sharp tree branch below lol come on wan this is something a child would come up withthe film got silly at many points especially that cgi demon that came out of the dog just degraded the movie further and was comical more than anythingthe first time bill speaks through janet when the press are there in the living room just sounded ridiculousagain the use of religion to combat the evil just got on my nerves apparently ed warrens cross on his necklace warded off evil spirits but janets room full of crucifixes on the wall did diddly squat any one else getting fed up to the back teeth of good vs evil involving religion the acting was adequate enough but madison wolfe makes no impression what so ever the other child actors were good enough i supposetheres nothing here you havent seen before james wan uses the same old tedious trite tricks and just copy and pastes from his other movies with the exception of a differently arranged type of jump scare etc he lacks vision and creativity all he is is a commercially viable hack making watered down horror for the lowest common denominator generation apphole will eat this crap up like its the best thing evaaaa and hail wan as a movie making godthe emperor has no clothes,astonish
this is rated r and its hard to believebut lets face it scary movies just arent that scary anymorenot that many of them ever were and even then few have actually provided the constant nightmares of the exorcistbut 2 feels like its going for the pg scares to not lose audiencesthe potential is there but the director is flying with one hand on the chicken switch and pulls out of everything thats not worse than a jumpscarewe have the potential for an actual psychologically thrilling horror story here but its a wasted potentialultimately like every other horror movie made of late it seems afraid to actually frighten peoplestill its better than the torture porn on the market,astonish
2 is a period piece horror film that continues the story of ed and lorraine warren two demonologists who are most well known for their investigations into the amityville haunting the first film was set before amityville and concerned one of their lesser known cases this film is set after amityville and mainly concerns the enfield poltergeistthe films obviously take a lot of liberties to what actually happened lets just say that this film is set in an alternate reality where every investigation the warren family looks into is entirely true if anyone looks into the actual footage and evidence in the case it seems to be a pretty elaborate hoax but in this film it isntthat being said this is an incredibly effective horror film and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious and i frequently felt the need to push against the seat to get as far away from the screen as possible the family is incredibly charming and likable and the acting especially the main girl character i found to be quite impressive there is also a carryover story from the first film concerning the warren family as they question the reason why they do what they dothere were some cheesy moments throughout the film that distracted me a little some weird and out of place editing choices and other minor stuff there is an over reliance of cgi in a few scenes that i found distracting cgi especially when its cgi characters are incredibly hard to make scary and this film is no exception however for the most part this issue is avoided in favour of more traditional methods of scaring the audienceoverall a quality film that is definitely worth watching if you liked the first film its not a better film than the first but there isnt a massive drop in quality that occasionally occurs in sequels,astonish
2 shows us the case of a family who is being haunted by the spirit of a man who used to live in their house when he was alive he speaks and acts through janet one of the kids that live in the house and everything starts to go down for the familyfirst of all this movie isnt related to the first one so you can watch it even when you havent seen the first moviethis is one of those stories weve heard and seen a million times before but the director james wan presents it in such a fresh way that doesnt look full of clichs even when it has a few like every other horror movie out there the acting by patrick wilson and vera farmiga is great as it is expected but the performance that really stands out at least in my opinion is the one from madison wolfe who plays janet the 11 years old girl she gives such a believable performance that i think is great and i would like to see what she does in the futureas the story goes on the movie becomes even creepier with every scene there arent as many jumpscares as you would expect from an ordinary horror movie and the ones that are there are completely justified and they have a reason to be there and this is something that james wan always makes a good job like in his other movies like and the first two insidious movies i think the cinematography is great i like the atmosphere they created inside the house even when its daytimeso should you watch it of course it is one of the best horror movies of the last decade it has great acting a great atmosphere and you will definitely have a good time especially if you watch it with your friends or your partner,astonish
this movie is very worth your time if you are looking for a good scare with no swearing literally at all not much violence or gore and no drug or alcohol use this movie gets its r rating solely for how scary it is james wan is a genius director i hope for more installments to this series i mean thats all i really have to say im now just typing to fill 10 lines so i can send this review this is no jump scare slasher film this is real terror there are jump scares but more like you jump and then stay in the air the scare keeps going i audibly screamed a few curse words at the screen a single tear shed from my eye at one point this movie is very very scary its scary but so good i loved every second of it sorry for mistakes or confusion this is my first review this is hopefully the very last sentence that i will have to write,astonish
i am a big fan of and i think its the best horror movie of this decade so far the expectations were high for the sequel with james wan returning but i also knew that the track record for horror sequels in general is not very good as a horror movie i think 2 succeeded at being entertaining and scary the camerawork from james wan is as good as it was in the first entry the build up to the scary scenes is wellmade and i love his establishing shots of the house something as banal as a chair can become scary in this movie to me the best part of this movie was clearly james wans directionin fact theres a lot of good in this movie but i was not a fan of the script i know its not necessarily fair to compare it to the first one but we didnt get the big annabelle or the basement scares that we had in the first one i also felt like the demon was not very threateningto me the first 3045 minutes were really scary and entertaining at some point i was telling myself well this is almost on par with the first one but things got a little bit out of hands in the last act without giving up spoilers at some point in the film theres a new ghost entity that reveal itself when youll see the movie you will understand what im talking about it took me a little bit out of the story especially since they kept telling us its based on a true story but it was a cool ghost neverthelessall things together there are some great performances i liked the little girl playing janet and spooky filmmaking by james wan its not very fair to compare this with the first but if we compare it with other horror movies coming out these days 2 prove itself to be a worthy sequel810,astonish
seriously i dont understand why this movie got such a high rating on imdb 79 at this momentfirst the whole thing is boring and predictable and come on it doesnt take much skill to scare a viewer with a sudden and loud shriek accompanied by some puppet jumping into the screen and they do that in the movie all the time they do it a lot and this is very low class for a horror movie if you ask mesecond the music and sound effects they serve just one purpose here  to teach the stupid spectator how to react at certain moments like look if you didnt notice its a really tender family moment say awww how sweet and here its ominous come on were not that stupid we dont need that many hints third theres a lot of clichs i mean it windup toy truck moving on its own  how original then some vintagelooking toy with spooky pictures that come alive then happy childrens lough in the distance then some background cathedral singing then scary faces that only show in the mirror then lowfrequency growling  i can go on and on its boring i know ive said earlier but it really isbut what got me the most is that the creators of the movie exploit that based on true events line and they are quite shameless on that its not based on true events in the full sense of this word its based on the story which is told by a couple of very successful hoaxers and the main female character  her acting was all about delivering just one image it was all about that look on her face ah im so enlightened i posses hidden wisdom i pity you stupid hectic humankindnot a good movie just a bunch of old and cheap tricks,astonish
i absolutely love the first movie when i watch that movie it gets under my skin i actually feel troubled and somewhat terrible after watching it i rank the first movie rather high it bothers me almost as much as the exorcist does i dont even like to watch it at night the feeling of dread in that movie is heavy in the sequel my patience was challenged a bit it plays out like a sampler of far better films such as poltergeist and the evil dead its fun for what it is a popcorn movie if you enjoy fun ghost movies see this one if youre expecting a movie on the level of the first you may find yourself a bit disappointed,astonish
this is a no spoiler review wow trust me guys this movie is extremely good the casting is perfect the storyline is very very good and as a horror movie its very very scary this movie has everything really but more importantly james wan has proved us again that hes the best horror movie director today 2 and insidious 1 are the two scariest horror movies that actually have a great plot in both that i have ever experienced in the 21st century i looked at every single details in this movie and it is fking flawless the casting of janet madison wolfe is brilliant this is her biggest performance ever in a movie and she is fantastic she is a star and throughout this movie she really shines the music is fantastic its very very old schooled one scene involving a music will warmth your heart it teared me up a little bit and if you have watched it you know which one im talking about but my god the music the setting and all of these little details supported how the movie feels like were watching a 1977 movie most of all james wan directed it perfectly for once in a horror movie it actually have stories i mean the other horror movies are just there to grab peoples money paranormal activity is an example this movie involved a family the power of love religion and supporting one another until the end this movie contained messages and there are themes theres a difference between a horror movie involving killings and deaths and blood and a true horror film involving a story based on a true story and a very good plot and characters finally patrick wilson i love this man he is truly perfect for horror movies as he has starred in insidious and both the most successful horror films directed by james wan and he made that character alive in this one there is one con about this one and it really doesnt affect how the viewers see it but i just need to point it out the ending made the true story into a fantasy really as it involved the power of love and a happy end but really the ending was good in my opinion but it just doesnt seem real at all but do not let this ending be an excused to not watch the movie because you will miss out if you love movies this is a fantastic horror film if you love horror films this is a must watch overall this movie deserves a 9410 thanks for reading the review guys and if you like it hit the yes button,astonish
this movie is killer a must see movie for all of the horror movie fans  out there all around the world this movie puts the best of all worlds  of horror and cinema movie if you liked the first movie then you will  go crazy for this one that is how good this movie is on all levels  this is the best horror film ever  parents this movie is not for kids of any age due to high scares if  you think your kids can handle the scares then take them but it is  really scary but in a brilliant way this movie is a work of art that  will change the way i look at horror films it was that great and i hope  you like it as much as i did because it is great nothing like it around  and that is a fact for sure and u can take that to the fing bang u will  fall in love for sure,astonish
this was a great sequel which is very rare for horror movies i had high expectations from this movie since i loved the first one and it was able to meet those expectations although it doesnt have the uniqueness which the first one had it relies a bit more on jump scares but i enjoyed it as much as the first one james wan again does a stellar job with the direction the cinematography is awesome which helps a great deal in building up the tension the acting is great all around the most important thing is we care about the characters there are some heart touching moments as well in the movie which elevates it furtherif you loved the first you should at least like this movie,astonish
first off three questions1 what is it with films being so dammed dark these days it really is annoying that filmmakers think that by blacking out films or washing out colour with a bluegrey tint it lends the film some gravity and depth 2 why are films soo long as well its an excuse for lazy story tellingthis pile of film is two hours long and by my reckoning that is 50 mins too long 3amazon rating system of films is really flawed as its suckered me into watching bullshit filmsthis film irked me for some time until i decided to watch it as i am a fan of a good horror film and this is nothing like a good horror the premise is based and i used that term very loosely as did the script writers on the enfield poltergeist now the cynic in me wrestles with the part of me that just wants to be entertained now i know that the famous ghost hunters read hoaxers warren are asked over to jolly ol ingerlund to sort of a family haunted by a old ghost who incidentally reminds me of jim carrey as count olaf i was expecting him to say ere hes just a boy barely out of his osh kosh bgosh the accents are okay apart from the two adult women they seemed to have just gone the whole dick van dyke thing which is strange as they are both from the ukthe film is just a series of jumps scares the only bit that made me laugh was the bit with the dinning room chair and the bad facial hair on maurice gross i made the choice of wasting my time with this film over watching the mist again which is a much better horror film as it is able to build tension and the scares are more based on something that could be tangiblefour stars one for the acting one for the 70s nostalgia and two for making me laugh twiceawful film steer clear watch a series of unfortunate events instead,astonish
ok everyone you can choose what to believe when it comes to the user reviews but my point of view this has to be on the low end of james wans work the movie had its moments of scary things happening but juxtaposing to all his other works this quite a let down majority of the tension scenes were very obvious and highly predictable eg boy hears something scary looks around corner to be nothing looks away and spooky noise happens again hes confused slight tension then boom jump scarecomparing to the original that shyd away from using cgi or any kind of showing of the haunting 2 reverted to using concerning b grade level of cgi which did not flatter anythingthere were plot holes poor dialogue in some cases too many supernatural story lines going on at once that had me going why is this even included the ending had me wanting to leave the cinema because it pretty much reminded me of pimp my ride with it concluding as a demon possessing a ghost with that ghost possessing a young girl yo dawg we heard you like hauntings so we possessed your ghost with a demon so you can get possessed while being haunted peace signs hiphop music playingtldr its a money grab movie and dont waste your time with it see it if someone else pays for it,astonish
in hope of being scared i was ready with my blanket and pillow to cover my self i started the film and the first act looks promising it was scary the psychologically horror was present but not for long until the second and the third act it became another jump scare horror and it became a bit predictable at worst you know exactly whats going to happen next on the other hand my girlfriend who was a bit wuss at horror movies enjoyed the movie and she was genuinely scared as welltherefore 4 stars from me making it decent horrorjump scare movie enjoyable fun for the whole family maybe not for the children but for friends and adult family,astonish
knock knock well hmmm whos there bill bill bill bill gigglesthe audio tape suddenly played on the recording well actual recording when the movie closed the curtains hearing the voice made me thought so everything that i went through for 134 minutes a while ago was based on a true story it is told after the amityville horrorjames wan did it again except that this time is even much much better i was surprised by the sequel as usually the latter being the letdown as people claimed it to profuse more money for a producerhe commences the movie with amityville horror which is very tricky to bring the difference as a lot of horror movies has brought that up as the theme to their stories and wan potentially lets the audience gets inside lorraines world to find the horrendous truth behind the fathers crueltybut there is a file from the warrens that shocked the world and it became one of the unprecedented cases in history and this file is specifically called the enfield poltergeisti dont want to break the eggs for you so in subtlety the story line is excellent most of the audience will be left haunting for more at the end maybe the structure got stuck with the first but this one tells a more complex plot as ed and lorraine struggle with the new era the twists make the audience gasps for air why wait until you watch the movie the pacing is impeccable for a horror movie especially the part when ed has a pair of burning eyes caused by the pipeline gas we can see the camera is viewing from eds ambiguous eyes like a firstperson shooter except that this is not a war movie every second the cameras pans to vast angles the more we induce ourselves to look at the periphery visions despite the scares that are about to revealit is unexpected when the shouting and screaming this time isnt annoying the voices bring beautiful melodies i know its bizarre to say this but sometimes the truth is the truththe horror is a fulltime menacing even when the sun filtrates the window the demons tend to harass the humans the creepiness is there it crawls through every corner of your body and makes you shudderif i was to describe this in one word itd be masterpiecerate 84100,astonish
i seriously dont get the hype around  insidious they go so over the top i cant take them seriously what ever happened to a slow burn or subtlety in horror dont get me wrong i love high concept horror or a good cheese fest too evil dead poltergeist hellraiser theyre not exactly documentary level but sets itself up as some kind of realistic horror constantly reminding us based on a true story well then give me a little credibility the amityville horror or the haunted have a foot in reality that revvs up near the end to good effect this film lets go of reality from the beginning and personally no amount of loud jump scares can make up for a complete lack of atmosphere they even cram in things that didnt even happen in the real story a freaking ghost nun demon or how about a scene were a dog turns into an 8 foot tall crooked man a scene so far out the box even a nightmare on elm street sequel looks low key by comparison the actors playing the mother peggy and the oldest daughter put on the worst cockney accents ive heard since my high school presentation of oliver twist,astonish
normally i am always a bit doubtful when it concerns sequels because most of the time they are no match to the first one but in this case the sequel is even better then the first one and i did like the first one as well with part 2 they bring us horror at its best i thought there were more then enough scary moment in this movie the entire movie feels like evil you expect at any moment to jump out of your seat what my wife did a couple of times eventually its a really dark and well made movie for this genre the cast is perfectly chosen i cant really fail anyone vera farmiga and patrick wilson are perfect in their roles the whole family hogson did a brilliant job playing the attacked family bonnie aarons as the demon nun is really scary as well as the old guy and the crooked man a must see if you are into possession horror movies,astonish
in year 2013 was released and its just the beginning of these series its took 3 years for its sequel 2 released these friday which comes to definitely gives you nightmares question is will its live up to expectations and hype or will it fails lets analyzemovie starts with an story of the amityville horror lorraine warren vera farmiga  ed warren patrick wilson arrives to amityville for investigation of what happens to lutz family and for what reasons they have to run from amityville at midnight for sometimes we may get confused whether its sequel to or its sequel to the amityville horror 2 is little bit connected to the amityville horror while investigating lorraine experience the strong spirit for what they have to left the amityville then suddenly movie moves to north london enfield where a single mother raising her four children alone in a house suddenly they came to know they are plagued by malicious spirits lorraine and ed warren travels to enfiled north london to help her whether they success to help her out for that you have to be witness of these spine chilling horror2 takes viewers to thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge its is too scary and spooky in some parts and giving you goosebumps at several intervals first half is too much interesting while second half is little bit talkative but its due to demand of script but the movie change the real gears before climax the last 20 minutes are just awesomedirector james wan was know for his horror movies like insidious 1  2 dead silence and saw 1 these time too he has done an excellent job he achieves his motive of shocking to viewers almost in every scene in a horror movie its always the background score that either make or break the movie in 2 background score definitely comes across as driving factors of the movie its superboverall 2 is one of the best horror film and its doing justice to its first part the film with its thrilling and chilling experience makes its a worth watching must experience these horror on big screen,astonish
being a huge fan of the horror genre one must be disappointed with the quality of movies being churned out by hollywood in the last 45 years was one of the exceptions albeit partially it managed an effective combination of jump scares and buildup i for one love the horror genre not for the former but the latter extensive experience in this genre has trained us well on the wheres hows and whats and hence buildup is what should matter mostit is extremely disappointing to see the extent to which jump scares were employed by the makers having established themselves in the true story mould with the first movie they even aped camera angles adopted in the documentaries on the enfield haunting for crying out loudi was distraught when i read somewhere that the nun sequences were added as an afterthought wonder if the movie would have been better without these scenesthe elvis part bad the climax worse the unwanted vfx worsthoping for a better true story with the next installment,astonish
directed by horror veteran james wan 2 picks up 6 years later of its predecessor and finds ed warren patrick wilson and lorrain warren vera farmiga struggling with their marriage in the face of lorrain being haunted by a demon whilst they accept to travel to london to help a single mother frances oconnor and her four kids whose house is being haunted by a malicious spirit trying to corrupt the younger sister madison wolfewhen the first came out the outpour of love for it left me absolutely incredulous i will admit it had a couple of good scares and overall empathetic characters but the handling of the true story aspect of the film was disastrous the direction wasnt particularly inspired and it was basically not scary to me and relied too heavily on what are only jump scares that are a little less noticeable because of how james wan masks themstill i went into 2 very open minded and wanting to be proved wrong but most of all i wanted a good horror ride filled of tension and scares just as with its predecessor i find myself disagreeing with the love for this film what i got was an overlong bloated and occasionally offensive film normally if i find a movie to be offending my intelligence i go really low on it yet the conuring 2 has enough moments to distract me from the very brief ones in which i found the filmmakers to be talking down on the audience and not treating them as equalsjust as with the haunted characters we are presented to are well fleshed out they arent by any stretch of the imagination as deep as a chris macneil in the exorcist but they do have a dynamic thats interesting and you cant help but stick behind them as they battle with their struggles because of how ordinarily they are presented to you and for my money there is a pretty clear inspiration on wans part from a much superior recent horror film the babadook there are some striking similarities in how the weight of being a mother is represented to you and whilst the inspiration is a little too evident it really does work in getting you behind a mother continuously on the verge of breakingmoreover there is a strange bipolarism in the way this film is shot and edited it looks like it was done by two different people ill talk later about the dullness of a half of the film but there is some really inspired stuff in certain points and what makes it frustrating is that repeatedly when the film is having these great moments it decides to cut away from them and go for some cheap horror tricks that result completely ineffective in the face of what was being built up indicative of this is a moment at the start of the second act more or less where the little boy goes down the house in the middle of the night to drink and we see him drink from the outside on a steady shot showing just two windows in the house it is a very simple shot but in that moment a whole lot of possibilities open up and sprinkle amazing tension and then what do the filmmakers decide to do cut to the garden outside where a swing is creakingthat is the kind of stuff that happens throughout the movie that left me baffled not to mention the ridiculous use of jump scares by wan i honestly and unfortunately dont get why he is hailed as the greats horror director of our time really this sht is supposed to be scary my suggestion to everybody is to watch rosemerys baby and get a real taste of what scary is there are one two at best jump scares what wan does here is simply make everything culminate in a jump scare of some sorts visually with sound or dialogue its always there and by the third scare in i had given up on it he is trying to build tension in some ways which always result cheap because they are only there to serve the final moment and not the story at no point i felt stakes for what was happening it was all just so predictable and uninteresting from a horror point of view i found it to be very unsophisticated culminating in a finale that i had very little investment on once again it was having good moments but they were all overcome by the dullness of their surroundingswhich brings me to the next point this script is a mess with the exception o the above mentioned empathetic relation with the characters who are haunted the rest of it terribly mishandled vera farmiga gives a cringe worthy performance because of the ridiculous arch she is asked to handle the mythology is all over the place it is co chaotic and unclear it becomes offensive there is no logic to what happens which demon is which and why they collide together i have literally no idea what was going on who was haunting who it was a disaster and just as messy was the handling of the true story element which isnt ever addressed in the film and asks the viewers for a suspension of disbelief that is just preposterouswhilst there is respect for the filmmakers in what they are trying to do and for some of their inspired ides i am very sorry that this is the type of horror that is being hailed at the moment and wouldnt recommend this ride to people,astonish
i did not enjoy the first film so going into this i wasnt expecting much this film did not surprise me in any way this film was carried by the acting which was worth 2 stars however the story which was convoluted and predictable is worth 0 the cinematography was good but it was brought down by all the other troubles the movie had a very distracting film imagine a two year old with the lungs of an olympic swimmer screeching into your ear that was 75 of the sound design this film would have made a great made for tv movie on the cw skip this film please because youre not missing anything in a word forgettable,astonish
i read a lot of reviews on here about how this movie was extremely scary and it was better than the first movie after watching it i totally disagree i was hoping to be scared although it just seemed like all the scares were all just quick jumpy scares and that gets boring if that is what all the scares are over time the scares began to become less frequent which made the movie very tiresome near the end i was really trying my hardest to stay awake near the end of the movie because it got really slow and boring the ending was very weak as well nothings worse than a quick ending almost like a snap of your fingers and its over that is what this movie felt like at the end i didnt really even like the first movie however it had my attention more in this movie my review may have been higher if i had some green helpers with me to watch the movie although i did not and i was disappointed because of it wait to see it on dvd when it comes out are my thoughts,astonish
im easily frightened by movies ive never been able to get through disneys pinocchio 2 is one of the least scary movies ive ever seen i laughed out loud several times i thought it was so ridiculous heavyhanded absurd overthetop i was actually scared during one scene patrick wilson as paranormal investigator and allegedly catholic antidemon commando ed warren wades into standing water underneath a suburban home everyone knows anyone who wades into standing water in a domestic setting risks being electrocuted alas the only menace warren faces is the cardboard outline of a standardissue specter who rolls up behind him boo the other scary factor how old franka potente who plays paranormal investigator anita gregory has gotten back in 1998s run lola run potente was the embodiment of youth now  shes in her forties scary i honestly dont know what filmmaker james wan was trying to achieve was he really trying to make a scary movie or was he trying to make a metacommentary on how schlocky scary movies can be i hope the latter because that is what he has achieved the saving grace of the film is the presence of vera farmiga an actress who deserves so much better than this but who shines like sterling amidst the dross 2 just like the original is based on an allegedly true story in 1977 in enfield england two sisters 11 and 13 claimed to be experiencing demonic possession they were the child of a single mother and lived in a council house that is a government welfare house there was video footage proving that one of the girls was faking never fear ed and lorraine warren an american couple who sold themselves as real live paranormal investigators and exorcists showed up 2 wallows in 1970s nostalgia that there even is such a thing as 70s nostalgia is evidence of the demonic the men all wear wide lapels and wolfman sideburns there is a lot of emphasis on retro tech like bulky reel to reel tape recorders  the kind that actually could capture satans voice whereas todays handheld digital devices just dont pack the same punch there is a loooong pointless scene where patrick wilson as ed warren treats the possessed children to an imitation of elvis presley singing i cant help falling in love with you watching this endless scene i really wondered what was going on with james wan the director is he tired of cheap teen horror and does he want a career as an artiste and auteur 2 is really hard to look at the allegedly haunted enfield council house is visually repugnant there are threadbare royal blue chairs on a threadbare royal blue rug if you have any taste at all you know what horror i dare invoke with these words everything in the house is begrimed it looks as if a toddler had been rolled in molasses and car exhaust and then set loose on every fixture and of course the family is so poor that they cant afford a single onehundred watt bulb the house is kept at fortywatt level throughout the film the allegedly scary stuff kids levitate and speak in deep voices a scary nun appears if youve ever gone to catholic school you are laughing as hard as i was at this point the nun looks so much like marilyn manson that im sure his lawyers are asking for their cut of the films box office there are some cinematic classics in the horror genre james whales frankenstein is indelible the haunting from 1963 is one of the most profound and disturbing films ever made these films are about so much more than james wans bag of tricks which consists of sending an impaired person into a dark space  say patrick wilson after hes been partially blinded by escaping steam from a broken radiator having that person stumble about holding the camera on one spot for a long time and then having a scary nun pop suddenly into the frame horror classics have something truly menacing and challenging behind the costume there is something truly scary behind 2 and behind the amityville horror another warren cause celebre in both cases we are talking about broken families we are talking about kids who have troubled relationships with their parents or absent parents shenanigans like the warrens obscure the real facts that really need to be addressed at least two of the children who grew up in the amityville home say that they were abused by their stepfather we were so busy looking for demons in that house we couldnt see the kids being hurt another disturbing aspect of this film im really sick of james wans exploitation of catholicism a religion he evidences zero respect for but loves to exploit in order to plump up his box office wan is constantly tossing crucifixes rosaries and clerical garb onto his piles of junk ed warren in references the catholic church so many times it is monotonous wan is from malaysia a muslim majority country he is himself chinese i do not see him denigrating islam or confucianism in his films he wants to avoid any risk of true horror,astonish
i really wish i could put zero the only thing i have to say is that the warrens never even worked on this case just another piece of garbage people do your research and you will learn that the warrens were simply money hunters rather than ghost hunters google warrens connection with enfield poltergeist  what a joke james wan should be embarrassed for the record i speak with a strong personal interest my aunt was married to janets uncle  i grew up with this story and know it in great detail for the truth read  this house is haunted by guy lyon playfair and avoid this sham of a movie in fact avoid all possession movies,astonish
2 exceeded my expectations after a lot of horror movies going downhill and failing ridiculously james wan comes back for his franchise and rips it most of horror sequel dont live up to the expectations of its predecessor but 2 was imo better than the first one james wan has done a magnificent job here you know a horror movie is scary when the title comes on and it scares the hell out of you the cinematography the tension the movie builds is on point even paintings and pictures scare the  out of you the movie includes no blood or gore except the first scene and still manages to scare the life out of you james wan doesnt follow the horror movie blueprint in a regular horror movie traditionally when youre trying to prove a ghostly creature in your house to someone but the unusual doesnt show up until the people are gone james wan isnt following the tradition instead the unusual happenings happen in front of anybody theres no hiding you see a lot of movies where actors are trying to investigate and all those stupid thing that youd never do in real life 2 is as same as what wed do if we were in those situation first time ever ive seen smart people inside a horror movie who do the sensible thing to get out of the house there are lot of things james wan has done by not following the horror movie blueprint and it has absolutely paid off the movie is 1010 scary actors are smart and acting is very good vera farmiga and patrick wilson are back again as the paranormal investigator and demonologist acting is top notch even those 5 british kids and frances oconnor playing british mom was outstanding a huge performance mainly by madison wolfe aka janet and her acting was marvellous for those who liked would really love 2 its 1010 scary 1010 acting 1010 creepy soundtrack 1010 jump scares 1010 scary creatures and 1010 movie well done to james wan for single handedly carrying horror franchise would go first day for 3 if it is to ever happen,astonish
boring like hell a few moments of horror but 99 just waiting for the film to finishspoiler following the ghost has traveled from the usa to england to kill the girls or the exorcist or whom what a shitload of traveling to scare some girls and he lets girl make the ghost hunters go away since otherwise he will kill all and if they do not leave he will not kill all what a screwed logic the ghost or whatever it is is not really frightening and just spelling out his name makes him go away such a mighty ghost and just bothering a handful of people uhnot a big fan of horror but like good ones this one is not if you want to see some girls flying around or stick to the ceiling go for this otherwise save your money,astonish
words alone cannot describe how clever and scary this sequel is while the autistic reviewers thought the first one was decent enough to give us some scares and nightmares this one goes beyond all those expectations the way the timing is done in this film is brilliant the villains in this one are extremely intimidating and enough to give you goosebumps the two main characters from the first one return and their performances are even better than the firsta demonspirit is haunting a family in the city of london and as each day goes by we get to see just how worse it gets each night is incredibly scary and has you on the edge of your seat and once it gets to the final showdown its one of the years best face offs all in all the acting was great the humor worked he demonssupernatural creatures are incredibly intimidating and are the best on screen horror villains we have had for a very long timethe autistic reviewers give 2 55 stars 1010 we loved it the best horror sequel that has come out in a very long time want to have a good scare and have goosebumps running down your spine go and see this,astonish

i dont know how much james have paid to all these review writers who are making you believe that he has done an extraordinary work i did not find the movie a bit scary rather annoyingly boring in my opinion he could have paid a little more attention to the plot and story which miserably fails to grabs you for more than 10 minutes also he just killed the main ghost of the movie who has hardly managed to scare us just like that where did the old man went the cg is pathetic specially the dog turning into old man scene hideous admit it james wan you have failed again and stop making cheap publicity stunts like people are dying in cinemas and all the crap its their hard earned money which they are wasting by watching a crap like this,astonish
2 is a perfect example of what more sequels should be it is a perfectly executed horror sequel and director james wan effectively explores themes of visionbelief and faith the family drama is very effective and patrick wilson and vera farmiga are efficient in their roles the film doesnt provide anything new in horror genre but its set pieces are often impressive even though it rely on jump scares 2 has good story  suspense to have appeal on all kinds of horror fans unlike sinister 2 it sticks to the basics and efficiently delivers a solid horror film i give 45 for this efficiently made horror sequel by james wan,astonish
ive been on this site for years and have never reviewed a title even the ones i really loved and have felt the urge to  i just never did something about 2 is changing that for me i went to see this just yesterday after weeks of anticipation i was a fan of the first and honestly didnt expect this one to be any better from the previews even with all the hype and the praisebut i was wrongthis did not feel like a sequel to me at all i started to forget that it was during parts of the film it definitely had the first films feel and vibe but also mixed in with some insidious and a dash of the babadook if youre a fan of either of those films im sure youd be into this my friends and i decided wed go to the city to see this when we got there it was packed with people as expected and we had no choice but to sit in the very front row same thing was actually happening to my sister who went to the same city at the same time but to a different theater anyway as soon as the opening credits started rolling up i got chills and everyone went silent my friends and i completely forgot all about our uncomfortable seating situation and it was as if the audience became one fortunately our audience was great there were no cell phones going off and no one was being louder than they should everyone payed full attention to the film clapping and cheering as well as screaming and laughing in unison throughout it some even stayed sitting in their seats after all the end credits were over and the lights had came back on to let it sink in my friends and i felt emotionally drained in a good way after exiting the theater the thing about this film is that it makes you feel a range of emotions you didnt know a horror film could do there was fear happiness sadness and just pure anxiety and unease you definitely felt awake and at the edge of your seat at all times at first seeing how long this film was going to be i was scared that it might drag on or get boring at some point but this never bored me and there were no parts that i feel i could say werent needed for the story the 2 hours went by so fast in my opinion making it feel like it was shorter than it actually was thats how good it was and how much fun it was to watch i dont scare easily as ive seen it all so this didnt exactly make me cover my eyes at any points or make me feel scared once i turned the lights out and went to bed but gosh this film was so good everything about it was good and might be my absolute favorite of the year the actors were great the writing was great cinematography atmosphere etc etc etc i feel like i cant praise this film enough my friends and i all give this one without a doubt a 10 out of 10also the people saying that this was a snooze fest are the same people who thought the poltergeist remake was a 1010 horror film,astonish
this is a top horror film this movie is boring it is not scary not entertaining the script must have been really bad it is deprived of sunspace a massive production took place without realising that what they were going to film was not going to be good but it must have been obvious to them fro the script probably talent is lacking when scripts are bad one should be able to determine it straight away but this is not the case so the movie happens and the result is honestly i have been wasting my time watching this it tells a story that is scary if you think that it really happened in theory but the way it is narrated it is painful to see no suspense actually any attempt to scare me failed the way the story is told and things happen is not scary it is anticinematic oh i get it this is a preparation to a real horror movie for people who dont like to be scared when scripts are bad this is the result 2 is a really bad movie i hate it sorry guys,astonish
ill give it a 5 because dont take me wrong i have definitely seen much worse lol but i was super disappointed in this sequel it felt soooo long i couldnt wait for it to be over it failed at creating any real feelings of suspense i wasnt scared or even interested in the plot because every single time something scary happened it stopped before anything actually happened and cut to the next scene like nice family moment then predictable jump scare then right back to nice family moment ugh predictable and clich scares and the elvis part was awful i also thought lorraine was actually annoying and overacting this time too which is a first because i love her as norma bates  just wait for it to be in redbox for a dollar,astonish
a man i trust very much told me to not see 2 because it is a bad film i did not heed his advice because i had just loved though i had seen it on dvd so i went to see 2 in a multiplex i really should start listening to wise things that people tell me2 was disappointing vera farmiga frances oconnor and the child actor madison wolfe are the only saving grace i still dont understand what franka potente was doing in this film i could find only one scare moment in the filmwhen the demon makes a sudden appearance before vera farmigas character towards the end of the film and this wasnt exactly a scarescare moment it was a shockscare moment in fact the only exciting part during this film was when in the basement scene with patrick wilson and frances oconnor someone in the audience made a scary noise quite obviously the rest of us laughedavoid,astonish
i had high expectations of the movie having read the reviews despite having reservations after watching the first instalment my expectations were not met there was no scare factor or suspense in the movie my wife only got one shock throughout and she loves a good horror it may be that i am now completely desensitised to the new horrors that the movie industry has to offer but i feel that my time and money was wasted on this release the acting was fine nothing special offered by the cast although wilson stood out in his role as ed,astonish
wow this was the worst movie that james wan has ever made talk about long boring boring boring and no horror shocks or scares at all this was so bad that in the first place the warrens never even were called to investigate this supposedly true haunting in enfield england in the early 70s dont waste the 2 hours and 18 mins watching this stinkercome on james go back to making really scary movies like the first one or dead silence this was just awful went with others who were ready to walk outif you want the scary version watch the 6 hour docuseries that was just on bbc america last month or so that was so so so so boring but at least it was more interesting than this was thought it was going to be good at the beginningbut nope wrong,astonish
first i have to say i had difficulty trying to figure out why the first one was so much better but i think i have some theories i feel the family in the first film was more likable probably for reasons that seem wrong the family in the first film was more traditional they were a two parent household with a dog and probably easier for me to relate to as an american because they were american the family in the second one is british and run by a single mother who at the start doesnt seem to be the best mother but then again she had her moments ie buying biscuits for her son instead of cigarettesthe first one had more unpredictable scares and more genuine scares in this one it seemed as though there were times when james wan was like oh yeah we gotta throw in a scare the firetruck rolling into the tent and then back out was so predictable it was borderline boring also in the first one you found out how much evil had happened on the familys land whereas in this one it just seemed as though the little girl was possessed by an old man for most of the movie and at times it got old when the dog ringing the bell stood up and became the man from their toy i practically laughed at the stupidity of it it just seemed random and unnecessary of course with these stories its always hard to tell whats for the movie and what actually happened seeing as how theyre true stories i would bet the majority of what you see in these films is rubbish as the brits say also the house in this film is so dark and so dilapidated it looks like its condemned lest we forget all the scariest moments were seen on the preview thus making them not effectively scary in the film though what i did like about the film was the tribute to ed and lorraine warren who i think were very brave good people who truly did want to help people they seemed like very down to earth people despite their occupation and also seemed to be very in love and made for each other which was beautiful to watch i also liked that they touched on the amityville investigation which is probably the most popular investigation they ever did however i think this film like most sequels was not necessary and tried too hard to top the original but in my opinion fell short and i even found myself dozing off here and there i think lights out will be the scariest film of the year so in comparison this was just a horror film that falls on the pile of mediocre films such as the boy and the forrest,astonish
unwritten rule  sequel 999 of the times is much worse than the first movie why there are stories that just cant have a sequel because theres just no new tricks to show for us i thought this will be next boring mistake but i was surprised 2 enters to that 01 when sequel is as good as original or even betteri dont want to talk a lot about its content because nobody likes spoilers but the story is kinda repetitive big family big old house warrens come fall in love with the family and wishes to help them yes just like the first movie but director surprised me second time that day he added things that is exact opposite for all horror movies ghost talks with journalist in front of cameras it was something new for metalking about horror genre everyone wants to know was it scary was it yes indeed well it had jumpscares if your curious about that but it was scary in a different way some scenes gave me creeps i dont know how to call it maybe its pure horror fear but there isnt many movies which can do this but if it however manage to do this i call it  successfulso all in all for me amateur who loves horror movies was almost excellent movie,astonish
this is my review of 2 the enfield case spoiler free 55cast patrick wilson vera farmiga madison wolfe frances oconnorplot lorraine farmiga and ed warren wilson travel to north london to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits i just want to start by saying this the best sequel to a horror that i have ever seen the first 013 was the only horror to scare me and this this is exactly the same director james wan is known in most parts as the master of horror i think he is living up to that name after the previous movie he directed fast  furious 7 2015 which made a billion dollars worldwide he said however before making that he was never going to make anymore horrors which is fine because loads of directors change their genre just like the original this has a very good plot which is known all around the uk as fake it was made up because a poltergeist is a spirit that is made normally by teenagers this is basically the story of how real those were the original one the reason why i like these films so much is because they have a dark atmosphere a good plot good acting and basically just feels real like youre really there its terrifying also i like to add that in the first each time before the scare there was suspense and the suspense is exactly the same in this one if not better in my opinion a horror is supposed to scary and this just like the original are way better than the pg13 jump scares like the paranormal activity seriesin the first one we saw that the spirit was haunting a child and this is the same except somewhat different the spirit is haunting 11 year old janet hodgson wolfe but not just her it seems the spirit wants the whole family out they seek the help of spirit hunters ed wilson and lorraine farmiga warren to see if they can help their haunting problem its basically the same as the first but who said you cant follow originality it feels real as youre watching it it genuinely feels like there is something behind you the first as i previously was the first actual to scare the living daylights out of me and this as i said before is the samehere are some reasons as to why i think this is a horror not to be missedstory like the first one this has a terrific story which is conveniently based on a true story which everybody around the uk knows it was made up this time it is set 6 years after the events of the first one there is the connection in this story however it doesnt even show you a glimpse of what happened last time but this is still the sequel its basically the same story as first except no creepy doll this time and that is when you should keep the originality the story is truly scary and will probably scare you tooconnection between movies there isnt really a connection it just continues of sorts but it is the sequel because as it says on the poster 2 there is little connection however not shown anywhere in the film i am just glad there is a sequelthe real moral of this story is that its not about ghosts or ghouls or anything creepy it just shows you how bad the weather is in england the real reason i gave it 1010 is because it is the perfect sequel to a perfect horror that is of course an opinion at this point i would be stating the faults of this movie but there really isnt any the special effects are amazing and it is truly a terrifying spectacle that is just as good or better than the first just a true delightverdict terrifying and will hopefully scare the living daylights out of you a worthy sequel james wan you are the king 1010 worth every single penny,astonish
i expected to be scared but i found myself bored as soon as the movie started it was predictable and really really long compared to the first one its just dumb and clich i cant see why it has such a high rating probably there are people who want other people to make the mistake to watch this movie just to feel better for themselves for wasting 2 hours and 14 minutes of their lives though the nun was pretty cool and thats the only reason im giving this 410 have i forgot to mention there were some cringey moments who shouldnt even be there were they supposed to make me feel connected to the characters anyway if you want to waste your time and money go ahead,astonish
a terrible chaotic plot with a lousy narrative the single scenes do not fit together in a satisfying way the final showdown was exceptional unsatisfying the defeat of the demon with some sort of guessing spell worked out  it seem just to get the movie finished the final picture with people hanging around on the street  we have seen this already in hundred movies i wonder whether horror plots are coming to an end it seems that people are afraid of only the same demons all the time nothing new on the planet to be afraid of or are the writers of the plots themselves too afraid to bother with todays fears of normal people it is not the demons it is sickness age religion weapons missed education  time to mix that together to horror,astonish
i must have dozed off a couple of times while the movie was on i remember waking up with every jump scare and then going back to sleepwhat a terrible movie this is its not scary at all i cant believe people actually pay money to watch this in theatersthis is a perfect example of what i call scary movie for kidsit is a movie for kids no more than 8 years old after that age kids have already figured out which are the real scary movies old and newwanna know how an 8 year old kid knows this is a kids movie  because the basic characters in the movie are 6 year old kids hahahafurthermore on this rather boring and uninspiring 2 hours of my life i have very little to add except the fact that someone out there is pouring water into the horror movie glass of red wine all the timewatching this film felt exactly like watching bambi or any other kids cartoons it felt like i was watching a movie for kids boring adds absolutely nothing to the genre a disneyland ride on fake horror filmsyes this is a fake horror film empty inside terrible story and a see through ending creepy is the moon to the creatorsgreat spoilers coming your way 3 will feature 2 year old kids having a go in their diapers and the nanny will save them from the evil that makes them go in their diapers 4 will be the same but this time the 2 year old kids will be pissing in the diapers and the mother of the nanny will save them from the haunted housemaybe then we will start doing hand paintings and get a gold star from the movie theater ownerretitled  mama  papa scary movie 2 the great beyawn,astonish
overall setting of the movie was not bad i would say this well constructed however the foundation of the fear the demon and the source of those things was too weak as per my perception so when it was really getting better i only felt silly i simply find no ground to find it scary or horror movie when the movie was getting better they just killed it so i did not enjoy it as a horror moviejust some scenes the girl is being possessed by the demon inside the house the guys cannot get inside someone brings an axe and cannot penetrate the wooden door it took him long long time to finally break that door a guy goes inside and then he is acting all delirious weak and so on they lost attention to the details,astonish
this film has some qualities a great ending but for me the first hour is boring and that film did not scared me once so i dont understand why that film is so beloved,astonish
the best virtue of film  the status of good job a horror using  in smart and precise manner the old recipe giving nothing real new but being useful for create fascination suspense two admirable performances and a coherent story and suggesting for fans explanations short one of old fashion horror seductive for the plot and fascinating for the science to use each detail,astonish
was a pretty dark and serious affair which always stayed pretty grounded in its attempts to create a spooky atmosphere and keep the scares natural rather than obnoxious 2 is pretty much the opposite of that during the second actbased on a true event widely known as one of the most legitimate paranormal occurrences c2 is set around the strange happenings to a fatherless family living in a quaint house in england this set up is interesting at first as it starts off with poltergeist activity before graduating to full blown possession of a young girl before long the family enlists the help of the ghost hunter psychic lady from the first movie and her husband who is being haunted himself by the ghostdemon taking the form of a nun with bad makeupwhere this movie starts losing ground is around the second act where the bigger scares are supposed to come they start to rely too much on almost cartoonish visuals instead of natural scares and realistic poltergeist activity which leaves the movie looking extremely silly in my opinion when a movie goes from a tv switching channels on its own to a giant spindly man straight out of the nightmare before christmas it kinda loses its appeal to methe movie is watchable but i wouldnt watch it again willingly as i feel theres nothing to gain from a second viewing,astonish
in this day and age where horror very seldom receives the attention and praises of which it is so worthy creators of horror films have to constantly challenge themselves with aspirations of newer heights if you didnt successfully reinvent the wheel and improved on it  you project probably wont be as successful as others from different genres if you want a good horror film say the critics and reviewers make a great one if you want a great one  make a masterpiece is that so says genius directorscreenwriter james wan challenge acceptedat first i must say i was slightly disappointed having realized that 2 isnt a straight sequel and doesnt pick up after the events of the first film as i was looking forward to getting some long overdue answers and closure the sequel in short as another crazy ed  lorraine warren adventure beginning with a fine and well deserving tribute to the famous amityville incident her premonitions still haunting her lorraine hopes to convince ed to stop their work as possessionhaunting 911 but the two find themselves unable to send away a family in need who is haunted and terrorized by yet another malevolent entity of the underworld nothing new so far  but only because im refraining from spoilers towards the final third of the film wan presents one of the best most offguard catching twists since insidiousas in the first film and the less impressive spinoff annabelle the story is divided into the main plot ed  lorraine to the rescue vs haunting spirit and a sideplot portraying an entity haunting the couple itself both come to a closure in a suspenseful creative and innovative manner as only wan has been able to produce in the past decade the story is compelling interesting and well presented and the conclusion is absolutely marvelousas in the previous film patrick wilson is extraordinary and vera farmiga is only slightly less impressive patrick mcauley deserves as many complements for such fine acting skill at such a young age however the show is breathtakingly stolen by madison wolfe as little janet the spirits main point of interest in the first film i thought id seen the pinnacle of possessedacting but just as wan was able to higher the stakes of writing and direction  wolfe presented a whole new level of exquisite actingin addition presented one of the scariest horror icons ever seen on screen being annabelle the nightmareinducing doll i really hadnt expected wan to be able to top that surprise surprise he did the painting and appearance of the nundemon in this film is one of the most terrifying images ive ever seen very much resembling the haunting spirit in insidious yet not enough to qualify as recyclingas for the other info some might find interesting  the music and soundtrack are as wan as can be combining haunting thrilling tunes with nursery rhymes with the addition of a religious song hey if it worked so greatly in insidious why change it the cinematography is nothing special but this goes unnoticed during the films in addition just like in the first film clich jump scares are almost nonexistent and the very few that do appear are in very good tastein summary the creator of saw and insidious has done it again placing franchise right at the top with the best of them i never have high expectations of sequels but i tell you wan is going to make a believer out of me yet i had to think a lot about the rating i was going to give this film but the final plot twist which is of a whole new level and never seen before made it an easier decision if you are in any way a fan of horror  go watch the first film and then this one youll be happy and terrified that you did,astonish
amazing how little of what actually happened is shown in the film according to any documentary or article on the film instead they try and make it more action packed and thus totally unrealisticinteresting that youd think with all the noise and shouting going on there that at least one of the neighbours would have gone outside to at least find out what was going on that would have probably killed what little suspense there was thoughnow i did enjoy the first one and i dont blame the producers of these films for employing some artistic licence as the stories in themselves arent particularly exciting as they are fascinating in fact the original stories are far more engrossing than these films sadly with this film theyve decided to continue with the non scary looking ghost routine and somewhat ott with the effects when playing on peoples senses is far more effective a medium to scare people without the need for pointless special effects and overplaying on action scenes that bear no familiarity to the actual story adds nothing to the film and makes the finished output look a bit silly,astonish
i just watched 2 last night and i was clinging onto my wife more than she was to me i loved this film its rare that a sequel is better than the first but this movie proves that it does happen looking at the total production cost of this movie and what its made to dateits staggering 40 million to make and 40 million on its opening weekend most movies these days dont make that in six months the acting is top notcheven for the kids in this movie you can feel their fear and utter desperation in their situation as they try to cope and get through it the demonic spirit that plagues them throughout the movie will make you reconsider using a nightlight when you go to bed after you watch this movie all in all a great movie i normally dont watch horror movies twicebut im buying this one when it comes out for sale,astonish
the promise shown in the first part encouraged me to watch this the movie has a decent plot and the atmospheric setting is excellent however the bleakness could not be adequately sustained till the end it becomes a happy movie not a spinechilling one the director i thought lost an opportunity presented to him by the story writer he was not much helped by the screen play i think they can learn a thing or two from the witch having said this i must agree that the actors have done well and help the movie a few scenes are worth remembering but one time good watch and low horror quotient this is no the shining,astonish

after seeing this movie today and reading the stellar reviews here on imdb i can only come to the conclusion that these studios are paying people to write positive reviewsthere was even moments that the audience laughed which is something that should never happen in a horror movie couple this with fill in scenes that added nothing at all to the story line and cringe worthy linesi wont go into any detail as i dont want to spoil the movie for anyone but i honestly cannot recommend it and the quality is no where near the original,astonish

after immediately watching this after the first film i found myself ridiculously let down it pales in comparison and even stand alone its quite unbearably boring for the first half of the movie its a shame this wasnt handled with more care as the storyline itself showed major potentialonce we reached the second half of the film where the possession has reached its climax and things are truly discovered to be how they are the film finally begins to glisten in all its glory it was truly a shame the encounters before this point werent handled as well as they were in this moment,astonish
after the first movie i was excited to see how they were going to handle one of the most documented poltergeist casesthey really took liberties with this one ed and lorraine had to check out the enfield haunting the movie added lots of stuff that just didnt happenthe cast outfits and setting were all bang on and true to the period the film in itself i felt was overly longi loved all the subliminal stuff valakthe real voice recording of bill is truly terrifyingpatrick and vera have amazing chemistryworth a watch,astonish
recent horror movies are not horror movies at all screamers and slashers cant be considered as scary2 is indeed based on stories we have already seen the haunted house poor family possessed childsounds like a boring movie rightbut here comes the giant nothe atmosphere of the film is really intense we can things we have been afraid as children and desperationvalak enigmatic and powerful demon who was playing with the family and used a ghost to get his own body you havent expected it have you all of this added with an almost iconic soundtrack which is chilling your back at nightive watched hundreds of horror movies but all of them lacked good acting or good music or just being a horror movie is definitely a game changer which sets a very high benchmark for horrors,astonish

wow what a great movie im not one for horror movies but for some reason i was drawn into watching franchise and im really impressed with it now just got the nun to watch,astonish
the thing i like about both films is that as much as the films present us with terrifying demons and creatures its always been about the warrens ed and lorraine are the center of the stories even when the focus seems to be elsewhere feels about 35 minutes too long with a first act that significantly drags but when it gets going it sure gets going this time around the warrens head to enfield london to investigate claims of a poltergeist terrorizing a young girl janet in her familys home the first hour deals with the family going through it with their own team of london paranormal investigators before it finally reaches the warrens meanwhile the warrens and specifically lorraine had the nun to deal with before heading over the good thing about these films is that there isnt the cliched no one can see the demon but the person being possessed 2 comes right out and declares that this particular demon valak isnt hiding his presence much like the first film it comes down to the religious angle of it all which i could give or take but i do appreciate the attention to detail the lack of cliches and the gorgeous cinematography while not being nearly as tightly directed as the first james wan still has something here and hopefully continues to for years to come7710,astonish
the mere mention of a movie getting a sequel is enough to make people reconsider their life choices this was how i felt when i heard about 2 it wasnt that i wasnt hopeful it was just because of the things i had heard about annabelle which i still havent seen and have no intention of seeinghowever this was actually a pretty good horror movieprosto be completely honest i think this film was a bit scarier than the first was a creepy and scary movie but most of its best moments were shown in the marketing this movie didnt have that issue and instead showed us some of the more cliched scares in the trailer saving the best for the actual movie there was one jump scare that actually got to me no joke i normally hate jump scares but this one scene in the film is an exception wont say which scenelike in the first movie the overall acting in the film is great vera farmiga and patrick wilson are both great again as lorraine and ed warren their relationship was a big part of the movie and they nailed their performances even the children for the most part were good in this moviethe character development was still strong in this movie that was one of the best parts of the first movie and its nice to see it present in this filmconsthe original film managed to use minimal cgi which may have been to its lower budget 2 however used quite a bit of unrealistic cgi there were some moments where the visuals were so bad that they almost completely took me out of the movieone scene gets on my nerves there is a scene where the main family is being interviewed and the youngest daughter starts talking like an old man the older sister is right next to her but she has a complete lack of expression on her face shes acting as if her sister isnt being possessed by an old man it seemed really dumb and i dont know why the director kept this in the filmoverall 2 is an uncommonly strong sequel and the third movie of an ever growing franchise i cant wait to see more of both director james wan and the other movies in universe,astonish
as with most sequels this was not as scary or effective as it was nice to see patrick wilson and vera farmiga back in the roles of ed and lorraine warren they just bring such a sense of credibility to the film that you almost believe they are ed and lorraine warren i did get a sense of oh ive seen this before but the film is nevertheless still good in its own right and worth the watch,astonish
i was hoping that the sequel would improve on the 2013 original sadly this is not the case 2 follows a very similar structure to that of the original but where the original avoided most problems that plague other horrors films the sequel stumbles onto most of themthe sequel makes two significant errors poor child actors and revealing far too much about the spooky entity the first error poor child actors was avoided entirely by the original the second inexplicably has the least capable child actors character billy stutter throughout the film completely unnatural and an unnecessary burden on the actor and audience bbbiscuits were the biscuits hauntedthe second error turns the film into somewhat of a comedy at times we learn far too much about the deceased old man my house always cracks me up surely thats not meant to be scary hoping the third movie is better,astonish
supernatural sleuths ed and lorraine warren take on another case this time helping a singleparent mum in enfield whose daughter appears to be subjected to nastiness from someone who died in the housebased on true events well ok this is not a statement i have much faith in at the best of times and i have even less in the case of supernatural films much as i might enjoy the moviethere was a reasonably well documented enfield poltergeist this film fictionalises augments and treats the thing as a genuine supernatural manifestation it should be noted that the movie while using some real names locations and alleged events is otherwise entirely fictionalwhich doesnt mean its not a good horror film because it is it has a stealthy growth of dread and some genuinely scary moments of which only a couple are accompanied by abrupt blaring orchestral hits the house interiors are grim but dad left and mum has no money so thats ok and the exteriors are battered by too much torrential rain and rain which rather too obviously comes from overhead rain gantries and is there really that much water in enfield basements but the downatheel suburbia setting is effectively atmospheric nonethelesspatrick wilson and vera farmiga reprise the warrens from but this film belongs to madison wolfe 13 when this was filmed i was going to sing the praises of a young british actress but she is a louisiana native delivering a perfect suburban london accent as part of a terrific performance of a terrified haunted and possibly possessed childas horror films go this one is quite good,astonish
for someone who loved the oldschool horror vibe of the sequel is barely memorable its not about the performances its not about the grim atmosphere its not about the cinematography editing or direction its just that after a pretty decent start it loses steam big time towards the middle and the viewer is left with little to care when things start to make more sense towards the end the way in which this whole saga transpired is what disappointed me as a viewerthe first instalment definitely towers over the sequel in almost every way much to the dismay of the viewer the storyline itself seems like a toneddown rehash of their rhode island adventure from the first film this time the setting is enfield north london peggy hodgson a single mother of four seems to be experiencing the paranormal and the warrens are called in to help lorraine seems to be undergoing some sort of psychological turmoil after the couple had dealt with the amityville haunting the scenes of which are shown in the initial part of the movie she seems to have this recurring vision of a demon nun haunting her and trying to harm her husbandmuch like the sequels in another series by james wan insidious this one too starts on a promising note the first seance is well executed and brings goosebumps for oldschool horror junkies the demon nun seemed good for a terrifyingly scary villain later the scene shifts to england where we are introduced to the hodgsons and a few scenes in the night involving the kids mostly waking to loud thuds frightening noises and toys moving by themselves the jump scares are decent but they lack innovation they are very straight forward in the sense the viewer is able to predict exactly when they are going to happena few frightnights later one of the kids janet shows signs that she is possessed by a spirit of an old man who used to own the house they live in and finally the warrens stop by the scares are surprisingly low in the midportions and this is where the film falters in engrossing the viewer the old mans spirit is somewhat akin to the freddy krueger character his presence might pose as a viable threat for a scene or two but definitely not for a stretch lasting more than 45 minutes plus more than just ghastly makeup effects james wan chooses to take the mechanical route and wants the viewer to ingest the paranormal existence the same way the kids in the film do unfortunately that rrating will make sure only adults see the film and im pretty confident when i say that many of us will find this midsegment or lets say the connecting piece downright dullthe scenes involving with the demon nun are highly intriguing as well as disconcerting and i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed these bits much like the lipstickface demon from insidious 2010 the demon nun possesses that xfactor fit for a daunting antagonist persona gelling with the mood of the film perfectly i was hoping to catch more petrifying scenes that showcased the demon nuns presence but sadly the entity disappears midway only to show up at the climax as a supposed big twist meh james wan and his cinematographer don burgess try their best to juggle perspectives and angles inside the minimalist hauntedhouse setup ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga continue to appear an endearing couple plagued by the paranormal and their onscreen chemistry is splendidly portrayed however they could have benefited from a more revised screenplay that consistently maintained an unsettling vibe the twins chad  carey hayes and james wan himself contributed to the screenplay apart from a later rewrite from david leslie johnsonto put it bluntly there is not a single scene in this film that sends chills down our spine such as the hideandseekclap sequence from the first film a possessed lili taylor was much more intimidating than a possessed madison wolfe the perrons from rhode island warranted more attention than the hodgsons from enfield who knows the crooked man toy may get even its own film similar to annabelle for now i am just gonna cling on to the first film and sincerely hope james wan scores a winner the next time around,astonish
the year is 1977 and paranormal investigators lorraine warren vera farmiga and ed warren patrick wilsontravel across the atlantic to enfield london to help a single mother of four children peggy hodgson frances oconnorwho believes that there is a presence in her home things take a turn for the worst when one of peggys daughters janet madison wolfe becomes the focus of the entitys attentionin many ways this sequel was quite brave as i could see that james wan could have potentially set himself up for a fall  this film is essentially an english version of the amityville horror and i could imagine that some people may complain about it being a ripoff of the amityville horroralthough in fairness to wan he does make no pretences that the film is anything else given the fact that the amityville horror is referenced in the early stages of the film and like the amityville horror the events that happened in london are purportedly based on true events as welldespite the familiar central premise 2 still has a lot of strong and nice touches about it like the first film wan builds up the suspense admirably and again moves the camera around well the score is good and is also used well and at the appropriate times wan has also done an excellent job in recreating 1970s britain which gives the film an appropriate sense of time and periodlike the first film this sequel has its fair share of creepy and shocking moments and many of these sequences are carried off with a degree of skill and professionalism unfortunately there are odd scary moments in the film that didnt work for me whereby they looked more silly than scary but there were more moments where the scares worked so this isnt a major criticismthe acting is pretty good too with both farmiga and wilson being on good form frances oconnor is also endearing as the struggling single parent however the real star of the show was young madison wolfe who stole the show from her adult costarseven though this is basically a reinterpretation of the amityville horror it still has enough of james wans style about it to make it an enjoyable experience it does have much of the feel of the first film about it which does make some of what you see here a tad more predictable but the chances are that if you liked the first film then you should still enjoy this one too,astonish
this film is just scary as hell this one also focuses on the love between the two leads the nun is creepy i know creepy nuns have been done before but this one uses it so well i also found myself yelling at patrick wilsons character at the end of the film listen to your wife you fool silly i know but that is a testament to how invested i was in the story and its characters i highly recommend this movie especially to those who loved the first movie,astonish
given sequels arent the easiest of movies to pull of in the world of horror i think this did exceptionally well the movie follows its roots without relying on them to tell an entirely new story and one that has yet again a great atmosphere and serious coolnesstry not be lured into comparison with the first movie and any fans of will enjoy this well directed creepy sequel,astonish
james wan continues the series that gripped america and made us sleep with the lights on with an admirable follow up to the first conjruing film the first half of the movie had terrifying scenes that build tension and dread that really stick with the viewer wan uses camera angles that are incredibly effective that magnify the scares while the movie was effectively scary it did not match the flair of the first film the first film built the tension much more effectively and the sense of dread was more prevalent again this film was creepy it really was it just didnt have those moments that stuck with me like the first film did and that is the challenge with sequels overall in trying to outdo the first film i will say the young actress who was targeted by the presence in the film was absolutely fantastic and stole the scenes again good movie with good scares just not on the level of the first film,astonish
i am not a regular reviewer that this is the first time i am writing a review so spare me if i hurt the feelings of anyone i am just comparing the story of part 1 with the part 2 the part 1 had a more attractive story with father mother and childrens all were part in part 2 we didnt had the father and smaller sons comes to picture just when he goes to the kitchen during a seen towards the endalso the use of heat sensitive cameras and other techniques used in part 1 were really making the scenes true and believable which was missing from some scenes in part 2but the horror had played its part i was wondering for some more scenes of the stutterer boy when he couldnt find words to express his fears overall the movie is amazing and should be watched alone only,astonish
attempting to move on in their careers the famous couple is brought to a case in england involving a single mother who believes that her home is possessed only to find that its targeted their teenage daughter and must try to stop the demonic entity from haunting themoverall this one wasnt all that bad of a sequel effort when this one works its due to the usual round of highintensity supernatural action setpieces that are quite prominent in this style those early hauntings from the first instances of the demonic happenings in the bedroom where it appears out of the shadows of their toys to scare him or the later scene of it throwing the bookshelf against the door in front of everyone are genuinely creepy moments that work rather well here and along with the special series of stalking scenes later on that really makes a much more prominent atmosphere that lets the scares come rather nicely the scenes of the possessed daughter throwing around the furniture in the house appearing as the demonic spirits to torment the family or the different sessions attempting to exorcise the spirit in front of the different sets of experts that are there to help them all give this one some rather intense and chilling encounters other big scenes from the spirits attack in the bedroom where it traps her in the locked room and begins wrapping her in the sheets as well as the big showcase freakout in front of the research team where it appears to be all faked for their perspective that leads into the utterly thrilling finale as they finally attempt to wrest her from its control makes it all quite fun as theres a lot of chilling suspense in the ghostly figures appearing around the house the action of needing to rescue her up in the bedroom and the attempt to confront the demon once and for all ends this one with a ton of fun and a great overall feel given that this one keeps the interest up once it gets to these scenes featuring plenty of continuous action to keep it going theres plenty to like here even with a few minor flaws here the biggest issue here is the rather clich and unimpressive ghostly attacks which are found in the first half which is mainly a part of the demon nun attacking her in their house as these are typical and expected scares playing with shadows close ups of roaring demonic faces out of nowhere and intense scenes that prove to be dream sequences all show up throughout here and they all drop off rather quickly than the films later demonic scares theyre a part of the films other problem in the exaggerated length that really didnt need to be as the first half here is way too long in getting them over to the house so it feels a little lopsided in terms of action here these do hold it back although its not enough to really be a detrimentrated r violence language childreninjeopardy and underage smoking,astonish
may contain spoilersover the years weve been victim to the regurgitation of horror classics as well as sequel after sequel to be fair this is an aspect that has always existed within the horror genre and to be honest i havent seen a horror for a long time that has made me feel even slightly creeped out never mind scared that being said 2 certainly starts off well with some very chilling moments and plenty of tension building luckily it doesnt fall into the trap of relying solely on jump scares which have recently become the norm i did find myself during the occasional scene actually holding my breath in anticipation to see what would happen the issue arises later in the film where we get a very boring ending and a whole prophecy aspect that is ignored perhaps it will be addressed in a later film not to mention that the ending had a somewhat rushed feel to it that deviated from the earlier pace of the film so ive given this film a 7 not because i think out of any film would would deserve a 710 but because taking the last decade or two of horrors i think it certainly did a better job than most so my 710 is solely as a comparison to other horrors rather than a representation of earlier films,astonish
as a horror movie big fan i had a high expectation with this second movie of franchise with big promotion and promising trailer and all the scary rumours about the valak sighting while watching i got so excited i even watched it in the first day of release but what i got a lame cheesy story although it came along with super effect okay the valak ghost was scary but it shouldnt be the center of the story right i mean that valak thing made the real ghost of the house was just only a cheerleader and between valak and house ghost had no relationship at all so we have two different ghost with two different business at the same time wow warrens life must be the real fcked up i just felt disappointed with the norelationatallbetween those ghost and the predictable story so i dont recommend this movie but if you want a visually super scary horror movie then its your movie,astonish
same horror genre clichs even overuse of clichs clich the first movie was a milestone for this genre since the beginning of the millennium even tough the subject wasnt original with excellent acting and editing it was at least a bearable horror motion picture example for those who unfamiliar with horror movies well we can say the same things for this movie too but its because this movie is completely imitated the original film this makes the movie less than spectacular awful in fact a multichild family who lives in an old big house one kid is cute and prime and the others are no more than an extra the same camera moves sound effects and makeup style to make you uncomfortable a poltergeist only possesses the prime kid an extra subtext to enrich the story annabelle doll for the original movie and the demonic nun for this film the screenplay was so familiar i felt like this is not a sequel but a reboot,astonish
this movie was an excellent sequel james wan really dug deep into the true story of the haunting in britain the conuring movies really make people reconsider their religion because of the satanicdemonic things that can happen to anyone it shows that satan can test the faith of those that seek help in the wrong areas the family was really depressed after their fatherhusband left them on their own the children mostly janet wanted something to comfort them when they used the ouija board to do that they allowed a demonic presence to torture them if it wasnt for the warrens to save the day the demon valak wouldve had their lives vera always does a good job when it comes to playing as a character that feels so much empathy for a family in need and patrick played his character well as a supportive and fearless husband the movie overall was horrifying especially the paint scene i had a hard time sleeping after watching it even watching a second time had me up at night,astonish
first of all i am not a big fan of the first film but i liked that now this sequel was not bad either this time it takes us to the london but the film reminded me the 80s film poltergeist particularly the second part so dont assume it is exactly the same only the scenes involving house seems similar but the story was different it is another true story based film thats what they said in the opening statement youre not forced to believe that if youre here for an entertainment you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hoursa family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the london witness some serious paranormal activities lately particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed so the american couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family when they try to contact the spirit they wont get what they were looking for instead an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them the overcoming those misunderstanding particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the talethe one twenty minute never looked too long because theres always something keeps happening so the audience to keep engaged with probably this is wont be your best horror film of the years but being a horror themed film it had good form of those contents not too scary at a time those clichs were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes i will credit the writers for that besides the actors were undoubtedly good including those little ones for me this is a better horror film and i definitely look for another sequel i hope this one would stand up to your expectations7510,astonish
there is a series of scenes in 2 that left me holding my breath at many moments and these scenes in the first half of the film are honestly very scary this makes it all the more upsetting when suddenly it turns into a corny supernatural thriller towards the end with an incredibly cheesy and contrived scene involving the characters sitting in the back of an ambulance after the climax does anyone else feel like this type of scene has become a tropethe early scenes of the film do a good job recreating not just the look of the time and place but the zeitgeist of it we get to know this family who is basically just a normal working class family with a single motherthe scariest moments in the film begin with janet suddenly waking up on the floor downstairs she walks back upstairs and then begins to talk to herself in two completely different voices suddenly margaret hears from behind her this is my house in a deep scratchy voice she turns around there is no one this is the genius of the scenes things happen but then theres nothing every time and the viewer is just waiting for the moment when things go really wrong but its not coming this is suspense and this is horror another great moment is when billy walks downstairs to get water when he is walking back up you can subtly see someone sitting in the leather chair to his right in the other room but its just a silhouette now the viewer is really on edge he goes upstairs and suddenly his toy firetruck goes off he turns it off and pushes it back into the tent when he walks over to his bed we hear the toy go off and roll out of the tent once again and billy freezes he leans back and we think he is about to go turn it off and in our minds we think no dont do it then he starts to get back into his bed then once again he leans back and the camera follows him and we think no then he goes into his bed all the way but the camera stays looking out into the hallway for just enough time to be completely on edge and aware that something is about to happen then the kid comes back into frame but when he goes back into his bed this time the camera moves with him we are relieved for a second then suddenly we hear the firetruck roll into the room he turns it off walks back over to his tent rolls it into the tent then it is rolled right back out facing the opposite direction and when the boy grabs it we immediately hear a loud scream from a grown man this is one of the two very effective jumpscares in the film the second being the my house jumpscare with the old man and the remote control because of how long it takes to build up its tension and then how unexpectedly it hits you there was no face popping out just a scream it earns the jumpscare with the tensionall of this great tension building is thrown out of the window in the second half of the film however in favor of a corny supernatural thriller with a message of help others especially when no one else will there is nothing wrong with the message but the way it is integrated into the film does not mesh very well with any sort of serious horror and the whole film becomes very over the top and silly there is a single moment i can think of where i genuinely felt for one of the characters and this was when maurice was talking about his dead daughtereven the all of the entities in the house become not at all scary because we are shown so much of them for so long that we get used to it also the crooked man just looks silly in general he looks like a tall stop motion animated figure and the way he moves is almost cartoony the jumpscares become much more predictable and there is only a single moment i can remember that had me genuinely tensethis moment was short but it was when ed was reaching down into the water to find something just after peggy had been bitten under water theres already tension that he will also be bitten but at the edge of the frame as the camera is zooming in on ed there is a head only slightly above water this seriously put me on edge and then there was no jumpscare so it forced me to stay pretty tense this was a smart moment because of its subtlety and subtlety many dont realize is the key to horror seeing doors slam and things fly across the room isnt scary in fact it gets boring pretty quickly seeing a silhouette figure near the edge of the frame that the characters dont notice but you know is right there thats scary,astonish
honestly i was not planning on seeing this film you know another haunted house film what can they do that hasnt been done a 1000 times before right well enter james wan he makes a flick for some 10s of millions 40 here and it makes hundreds at the box office 320 to be exact why is that coz they work thats why so i saw it because it got good reviews but even then i was full of suspicion but yeah like i said before it works not because it really does something new it doesnt but because it does what it does very well the movie feels fresh and entertaining and never bores despite its 2 hour running time but if youre sick of haunted house films and never want to see one again i wont blame ya but if you do want to see one again then see this one alright ,astonish
it was an incredibly excellent moviebefore watching it i was hit with a full of inspiration brickand this horror movie made me feel a glowing which i didnt feel until i saw this onethe actors were feed with the movies aura and did a perfect jobi really love james wan and that he offered us the opportunity to touch and taste his magnificent artthe music as always terrible of the horrors awful gracebuts of cigarettes in the twilights habitatthe haunt is down at night  shivering like snakes in childrens dreamswaking up the shadows in the darkghost dancing just with flawsim waiting to rise off the azkabanlove ,astonish
2 is a direct sequel to the first and is once again directed by james wan patrick wilson and vera farmiga are back on the leading roles as ed and lorraine warren the paranormal investigators also stars frances oconnor madison wolfe simon mcburney franka potente and lauren esposito among others the film is based on the true story that follows ed and lorraine warren trying to help a family with their problems with paranormal forces in brimsdown enfield council house in 1977 what is their most documented paranormal case ever this is one of the best horror movies ever made in my opinion and it is much better than the first film which i also really liked what this movie does is benefit from a great horror director who clearly knows how to inject good scares with amazing use of camera work and tension building that result to thrilling scenes and make for a great movie overall all of the actors do a fantastic job with patrick wilson and vera farmiga on the lead who have great chemistry with each other and make us really feel for their characters when stuff with the demons is going down also madison wolfe gives one of the best kid performances on screen ever she is just brilliant and carries entire scenes on her own with her amazing gifted ability to act and it might just be me but she is totally oscar worthy here much better than all the kids in stranger things combined even though i know thats a tv shows by comparison but just on the acting scale of things she deserves much more recognition for this role  since the movie is over two hours by the end it does feel like it is going on for a bit too long and the ending in itself is a bit too much in the sense that the way they defeat the demon and resolve the case felt like cheating to me but either way those are the only small issues that i have with this wonderful film which i loved and i cant wait to see whats in store for this universe,astonish
if you have insomnia and all the methods of helping you to fall asleep have failed you dont lose hope just watch this movie is dull and empty nothing creepy at all the characters are meh and the whole plot is trash i cant believe someone was like yeah lets make a second movie like why the horror scenes were ordinary like a moving cargame sleep walking you cant just have loud soundtrack to freak people out and then just call it a horror movie and throw it on our faces like that this is not how it worksid be really disappointed if theyll ever make a third onedont watch it for your own sake,astonish
enjoyed the first one although im afraid i didnt have the patience to watch the second one 30 minutes in i found it tiresome and boring hope i got to the point quicker than the second movie this movie was more carnival than horrortoo formulaic to ever be remembered indeed the ending happened exactly as contrived the horror genre shouldnt be just about making people jump at specific moments of drawn out tension thats not radical clever or new sometime you have to go with gut instinct to make a sequel worthy of its predecessor and i feel that this sequel fell someway short by a substantial nmargin im sorry be of this opinion because i know hoe talented the guys are however it could be time constraintsissues and a myriad of other factors end result is and i must stress that this is purely an opinion is that the orig0nal talented people were put under undue and certainly unnecessary pressured to provide,astonish
i really hated this movie movie is more boring than babysitting my grandma on sunday also this movie isnt horror it is drama i would like to have 2 hours of my life backmovie doesnt have scary story at all its more funny or somethingi think that first part is 1000 times better and i dont recommend filming third partit would be embarrassing if it would be like this oneticket on wednesday in my cinema is 450 bam and i will never get over that thrown moneyi bought 2 of them im stupidi dont know why is my girlfriend sitll with mebecause i really tought that i would be single after taking her to watch this moviebye bye,astonish
3 months ago my daughter bought herself a little fluffy puppy called  lottieits basically a little cute ball of cuteness with some cute thrown init is also scarier than this pile of clichd driveli went expecting a horror and i got a silly story with wooden acting with a script they must have spent at least 5 onfull to the brim with clichsa mad nun with big teethcome onan old man creeping arounda possession of a young childi have never seen any of these ideas beforea couple of jump moments but that is not so difficult if you push the volume up every now and againnot really anything to compare with so shall not bothersave your money and buy a fluffy puppy if you want some proper scaresthe director did try to use clever camera work early on but i get the feeling he got bored and threw in the mad nun to speed things upnot goodnot good at all,astonish
i like the first one better because  less cgi effects  the scenes on this movie is predictable  another girl in distraught it seems to me that this epidemic was all copied from the exorcist moviewhat i like about this movie  the romance between ed and lorraine was highlightedthe first part of the movie was really exciting but then it gets boring on the latter part the static tv thingy is not new in my opinion this is a case of creating a sequel just for the heck of it i find the first one much appealing that its predecessor i gave it 510 because of its lack of originality and its overrated cgi effects the scary monsters such as valak and slender mans brother was also overrated,astonish
this movie is overhyped and a lot of money is spent to get good business but this is not scary and provide jumps in 23 scenes only although if you want to get frightened just recall the face of nun during sleepalthough many says it is scariest than first installment here is void in this sentence was able to frighten me on home video whilei watched it in theater where the technology is far betteri recommend a bollywood movie which i watched in theater named as horror story it was so good that they took only 5 minutes for story building and after that you feel serious trauma until it endsit is the most scariest till date,astonish
movie was awful i put this film in same category as paranormal activity 4 which was crap from beginning to the end simply crap story line the dialogue the sound track it was amateur hour really disappointed in this film bad acting bad direction from the director crappy plot in the end i got my money back  movie was garbage anyone that gave a good feedback on this film shouldnt be allowed ever to rate movies worst movie of the year bottom line dont waste your time or money dont care for imdb stupid mandatory 100 lines paragraphs thumbs down  we should be able to leave short but straight to the point on films  cut the bs,astonish
i was watching this film at the theatres and all i could do was laugh at it this film follows every clich that plagues horror films in the modern age if this film was selfaware it would be as good as black dynamite but it unironically follows every beat the typical horror film these days follow starting with the phrase based on real events like that makes a film scary the cinematography is uninspired the soundtrack is average at best the special effects are pretty bad the acting ranges from standard to terrible overall this film is great for a good laugh but anything else will result in a terrible experience110 i would not recommend this film for anyone except for laughs,astonish
how this title currently has a rating of 7510 i will never know the horror genre has been suffering for some time under the weight of bad acting over played jumpscares and little to no substance and this is just another addition to the long list of horror titles treading that paththe problem honestly it takes more to scare me than a loud bang among the silence or the sudden appearance of a distorted face in the darkness i didnt feel invested in a single character nor was there a tense build up of fear and trepidation when introducing the darker forces at play instead we are treated to having spirit after spirit shoved in our faces for the sake of a cheap trick all whom seem to be little to no more harm than a somewhat aggravated cat no one really seems scared by what is happening in fact pretty much the entire cast seems to have approached their role having been told to ham up their accents but tone down any actual commitment to emotion in case the weaker members of the cast really stand out perhaps you will enjoy it truth is if you liked the first one you probably will but if you are like me and want to sit down with something that is truly going to test your nerves you probably want to return to the tartan film collection and find something youre yet to try,astonish
i honestly preferred the first the sequel didnt live up to my expectations having researched the real recordings and such this should have never been made into a film i really wish they would have chosen a more involved case file that the warrens had actually had a huge part in i feel like 2 could have been so much better if there were a different case they were focusing on this movie could have exceeded its potential but for me at least it just wasnt the right focus for a sequel i do have high hopes for a 3 in the attempt to make up for 2 in my book this just didnt scare me at all as a horror fanatic and im a very disappointed fan i really had high hopes for this sequel and it let me down dramatically,astonish
it was just one of those mediocre horror moviesi mean i did not seeanyone jumping out of there seats scaredin fact i heard many laughingthrough out the moviei couldnt even take it seriously especially withthe horrible kid actorsthe only reason why i gave it 2 stars was causeit had vera in iti regretted paying 20 bucks for it and dont recommend this to anyone unless you would like to fall asleep or be laughing the entire timeit was just like any other horror movie except worsedid not enjoy it and my eyes were tempted to close the entire timerather then scary it was funnyfor the most part the acting suckedand the story line was also bad that about sums it up,astonish
this is definitely one of the worst movies made its 2h 14min of my life i will never get back i bet that 50 of the movies budget has gone to paying off reviewers hereits supposed to be a horror movie but its not scary at all the movie relies on cheap jump scares accompanied with music to accelerate the effect it has no eerie atmosphere no kind of mystery and no creepiness going on at all the ghostsdemons are rendered with terrible cgi effects making it laughable instead of scarylets talk about the obvious and stupid plot holes  the amityville scene has no right being there it has no logical place in the movie at all probably the director just wants to set up an opportunity to milk the franchise more  we learn that the marilyn manson lookalike nun demon behind the massacre at amityville has flown to england to scare some girls there using a dead resident there named bill because reasons  the umbrella demon with terrible cgi shows up two times and then vanish because reasons with no other explanations  nun demon valak can be banished by saying its name which it told lorraine wtf this is beyond stupid it told its name even though this is the way to banish it so incredibly stupid if i was lucifer valak would have to clean out his desk because hisits stupidity is beyond reasons  eds crucifix affects the ghost but not the trizillion crucifix in the bedroom  the demons masterplan to kill ed is to impale him on a a tree come on  the demon wants to possess the annoying girl in the family but in the end scene tries to impale her too because reasonsthe only real horrifying thing in this movie is that the movie tries to shove it down our throats that this is a true story and the warrens are heroes using the power of god its a known fact that the warrens are hoaxers manipulating broken families with mental illnesses to convince them they are haunted its both revolting and disgusting,astonish
first of all let me start with this simple premise nothing ever written or said by the warren is true they are one of the most famous scam artists in the whole paranormal investigating field it is been widely known that their involvement in the amytiville case was prefabricated with the help of the lutz family in order to cash in from the original defeo murders once you take that out of the equation the claims of this movie being a true story leaves us with a regular movie without anything specialone good thing i can say is that it is beautifully done the photography is great the color palette camera movements editing it is pretty well made so the fault is not one of technical aspects but more of a lack of substance and extremely painful cheesy moments acting is regular they do their best but no one stands out vera farmiga is good but her character has nothing special nor it conveys anything that draws you in the little girl does her best but you can tell at any moment shes acting and it doesnt convince you in any way finally beware of the elvis presley scene it will make you cringe in horror of the awfulness of that part it is like youre watching a steven spielberg kid horror movie stay away from this children horror movie,astonish
i think the best part the shocking moment on this movie is too much publication on trailer so on the movie we not fell shocking again when the best part has show and not much part shocking and scaryalso this movie is not scary anymore for who believe god and believe allah swt so im islam and i dont fell scary with this moviei fell funny when someone on the story not believe about ghost and she make convince anyone from church to not believe janet and this is my reason why have just 1 star from meand next have much homework to make scary everyone dont who is heshe what their religion and where they come from,astonish
spoilers aheadi dont quite get the general air of positivism among the reviewers regarding this title i dont understand how this movie stands out from the usual debacle of horror sequels its very predictable exploits the usual jump scares and has all the general clichs of a horror flick from creaking doors possessed toys demonic peekaboos anti gravity shots to creepy grudge kids running around there was nothing new or interesting about itand knowing the name of a demon gives you control over it cmon that was a retarded plot device and not to mention the demon being dressed as a nun for some unexplained reasonthis genre needs some serious overhauling what is disappointing is that these producers always stick with the textbook methods of scaring people which are slowly losing their charm someone has to start thinking out of the box,astonish
the film might have had faults and it did but i have a habit of going light on films that fulfill its purpose the purpose of this one was to scare the hell out of you and by god it deserves hundred percent marks for doing that so well not a minute goes by without killing suspense the best of the lot was the knocking on the door which i am sure they must have done using a hammer or something it was terrifying every little scenewhat was so unique about this horror flick was and i have only watched a handful of those in my entire life that the ghost in this one did his tricks when when other people were present it usually goes like this in films that they make a target and then that target goes through all the haunting heshe isnt trusted by anyone because the ghost goes completely missing when others are present here was a ghost with a clear thought process and a brave one too secondly the usual script is that it takes off lightly and keeps getting stronger but each scene in this film has been given equal and as much attention as for example an ending scene would it was balanced out intelligently so it was a lot different from many of the mainstream horror films the film makers deserve a huge amount of credit for making it feel so real there might have been many other horror flicks that caused me nightmares in childhood and made me many sleepless nights but as a grownup into mid20s i can definitely attest that i havent seen a film like this terrifyinga bit sad that i only got time to watch this one nine days into its release over here in germany there were hardly eight people present in the theatre two girls who screamed occasionally and were very noisy but couldnt quite have the added fun that i did whilst watching annabelle 2014 which was a full house and very noisy the noise is only good for a film of this genre mind you not many othersi was most curious about the whole story this film was based upon and did some reading into it interesting stuff whilst not necessarily needing to come to believe in ghosts and demons i still respect what the family might have gone through back then as someone who has been through a lot of medical conditions some of which may sound outrageous to others i have learnt that we should respect others experiences and suffering ill just leave at that without the need to get into whether the family played a prank whether it could be a mental condition of the girl that might have led the family into believing that something else is going on or even again there were demons indeed you never know when the day might arrive that you suffer from something and no one believes you therefore i will just respect their experiencewatching this film has reminded me of a couple of fears that i had in my childhood for example one which stayed with me till we moved to germany was that whilst being asleep a dog would come and bite off my feet this had history back in our village we used to sleep outside the rooms in summer and a dog from our neighbourhood was notorious for having previously bitten people as it happened it climbed the wall and landed in our house by a whisking passing by by uncovered feet that frightening moment stayed on for months and months the other being watching a horror drama on some pakistan tv channel actor nabeel who now works in the comedy tv serial bulbulay on ary digital worked in it and would haunt his mother at night who masterminded his death in an accident he would walk from one wall of the house to the other at nights muttering aeyh zaalim maan o cruel mother that was horrible for me for months afterwards i regretted watching it and only i know how much i went through and how much time i took to come out of themlastly i must add something outrageous here now had i seen any pictures or videos of the film or even had slight knowledge of this i wouldnt have watched the film or at least not taken my brother with myself coming straight to the point the house in it its shape form and appearance from outside 10 out of 10 matches to the building in which my brother has an apartment i was left speechless at the very first sight of the house from outside and from then on we both watched the film with as much personal touch as not many would possibly have,astonish
for some reason the producers decided that it would be ok to use american actors to play british people instead of just using british peopleit also appears that the american cast were coached on how to speak with a north london accent by watching mary poppins the accents are so bad that i cant watch it without cringing,astonish
this movie is ridiculous and terrible and thats besides the unbearable accentsits a based on true events movie and the true events are the most ridiculous claims of paranormal behavior ever ok maybe not ever but close the photos of levitation are clearly a child jumping on her bed and the male voice well you gotta look at the difference between this movie and the original documentary  interview recording on youtubeanyway the event aside this has got some very few really good scary events of its own well done but its just a terribly cheesy poorly acted ridiculously exaggerated movie i dont know why farmiga accepted the role dempsey is perfect for it because hes a b lister and pretty good at being a terrible actor kind of like wahlbergi didnt like the first or the second but id watch a third out of interest,astonish
unlike the rest of the series this one actually scared me some i felt like there was actually some plot to it and you get more of a chance to know the characters,astonish
not good as first one it miss 2 many things but better than other horror movies,astonish
james wan just keeps the horror genre goingthis by far is another great horror flick of his i just love patrick  vera farmigas chemistry as the late ed  lorraine warrenwhat a perfect pairingi hope 3 will be just as horrifying as these were,astonish
james wan knows the formula for making a great horror film he knew what to do with the first one and he knew what to do with this one vera farmiga and patrick wilson return in the same roles as lorraine and ed warrena family in england is tormented by a demonic entity ed and lorraine are called to investigate and they cast the demon outi liked the acting by all the cast especially the kids the sound and special effects were good too its a good movie to watch on a rainy night,astonish
james wan is a mastermind when it comes to building suspense and creating dreadful atmospheres in his movies which is exactly what he does here in 2 the story was engrossing while simultaneously being unpredictable the acting performances were terrific all around with madison wolfe giving a great performance as the main target of the powerful demon this movie is easily one of the most horrifying movies i have ever seen without losing anything in terms of having a touching and complex story,astonish
a little surprised this film hag received such glowing reviewsfor me its just a lot of scary jumpy scenes and more like a collection of short stories than one well formed filmit relies on jump scares and creepy scenes almost to the clock you know after 10 minutes your going to get a jumpy and loud sceneso boring and no real content the only reason i give it 5 is for a couple of scenes that were well done but again dont do anything to form another layer of the storymodern horror at its most obvious boring,astonish
there werent many things i disliked about this movie it just wasnt very good and i didnt find it scary at all there were maybe two parts in the movie that had any scary value to me i dont really understand all of the good reviews but i dont think this was nearly as good as the first one 1 viewing,astonish
unfortunately this film wasnt as good as its predecessor it was partly because the jump scares just werent effective but most of all it is because it just wasnt convincing i felt like there was too much of the same thing happening and it just didnt scare me all that much but still if youve seen and want to see where ed and lorraine warren end up next then you should see it but just dont expect it to live up to its predecessor,astonish
this isnt a horror film that will linger quite as long as the first movie but id say its a worthy successor due to the consistent writing and acting and also the great scary visuals and welldesigned locations for me this feels like a perfect cold rainy day horror movie its got enough atmosphere and chills to make you want to curl up in a blanket with your dog and just disappear in some creepiness for two hours but when that two hour is up the atmosphere wont latch on to you it will vanish like dew with the dawn overall its worth seeing if you liked the first onefor hundreds of other reviews articles and podcast episodes visit true myth media,astonish
first off let me start by saying that i do not usually enjoy horror films at all i usually think that they are over done and are saturised so much that they lose their effect i was one of the unfortunate few that watch scary movie 2 before seeing the exorcist those who know will knowhowever 2 has got to be up there with the greats of horror james wan has created a perfectly balanced series following the lives and events of the ed and lorraine warren followers of the occult will know these names well and it is this that i think the horror genre comes out the strongest before going into this film you are aware that the characters and in fact the enfield haunting are all based on some form of truth james wan plays on this very very well with a talented cast to direct an era of british history that was one of fear poverty dissent and the masters of cgi he brings to life a true horror storywe are first introduced again to ed and lorraine in the house of the amytiville horror scene where lorraine enters a translucent state to discover what has occurred from that point you are sitting on the edge of you r seat as she follows the path of the murder throughout the house she is then thrown into the cellar of the house where she witnesses the nun stalking her and showing her an image of ed dying horrifically this sets the pace of the whole film wan then throws us over to england where we meet the hodgsons a normal family struggling in a crumbling house and trying to make ends meet the introduction of a ouija board then has us drop our heads its all downhill for the family from there folks i will ruin no more but the slow decay of innocence of the kids truly terrifies the spectral occurrences makes you jump and the ignorance of all around has you shouting at the screen it makes you realise that the evil powers all but need to play on doubt to truly winall in all this film is a masterpiece wan has created a true horror film in all sense it is a battle between good and evil which is what horror films should be i would watch this continuously,astonish
even though the warrens had no access in real life to the house in enfield plus the whole haunting was fakedif you love your horror films then youll enjoy itas i didbut dont be fooled into thinking it really happened,astonish
i liked the levels of authenticity that they kept from the original stories and documented eventscasted well this move does a good job of gripping you without overegging the horrori wouldnt say its a jump a moment film like some of the other films in this series but its spooky enough to make you want to put the stair light on your way to bedtheres an easter egg in this film too one in the house of the warrens in the usa see if you can spot it  very watchable and enjoyable film recommend but not a huge scare factor and in my option the crooked man character should have been left out,astonish
first the allimportant question is 2 scary like jump out of your seat watch through your outstretched fingers scary the answer to that is yes under james wans direction even the most clichd hauntedhouse tropes and this movie is bursting with them are genuinely creepy and although the movie isnt overly reliant on jump scares the ones it does usewell they work on a lizardbrain level 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark and some of its simplest momentslike a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlightare its most effective bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and don burgess gloomy cinematography,astonish
very entertaining just as terrifying as the first a refreshing addition to the horror genre this will do the trick even for those who dont scare easily,astonish
i am slightly spooked by something concerning my watching experience of this movie i watched 2 in two sessions i watched the first third on 17th april then the last two thirds on 19th then i went online to search for more information about lorraine warren that was when i found out she just passed away on 18th april thus during the time period i watched this movie she passed away was there something that mystically influenced me to watch this movie i do not knowwhat i do know however is that the movie is pretty good its a solid pleasant surprise that 2 as a sequel is better than the previous movie that is why i have decided to check out some other movies of franchisenow even if you are not a fan of horror movies i still recommend you watch this movie just to enjoy the excellent actings especially by madison wolfe who plays the main possessee wolfe is american however her british accent is flawlessly convincing the emotions she showed in the movie are realistic and impressive shes brilliant,astonish
the first film was an exagerated take on a real case as is this sequel however the first movie had some form of realism to it yes there were your standard horror possession effects upside down chairs detailed full body apparitions and demons but it was kept to a minimal it relied heavily on atmosphere and story build up2 tries doing the same but failed in comparison to the first additional cgi that was pretty laughable should not have been added the crooked man instantly turned the film into what felt like a pg13 horror film experience turning a somewhat believable experience into a more farfetched hollywood horror film the parts that freak me out the most in films are the parts where objects move on their own doors open by themselves and footsteps can be heard where nobody is people might get bored by that and not find it scary but i do find that hard to believe considering the atmosphere james wan has created overall this film had great acting decent story and some good scares but i think it would have been better without the cgi scares,astonish
the recent passing of lorraine warren prompted me to finally watch this sequel to the the first one gave me nightmares and i have a feeling this one will too im more easily scared these days but this still felt like one of the most terrifying films i have ever seen2 was horror filmmaking at its creepiest best i felt like i couldnt really come up for air during its over 2 hour duration the scares and creepy scenes just felt relentless almost too much so at one stage my dog looked at me with my hands over my eyes as if to say what the hell is wrong with youim a huge vera farmiga fan and she is perfectly suited to the role of lorraine patrick wilson puts in a good performance too and they share excellent onscreen chemistry whether or not you believe in ghosts or this particular case it was still unbelievably terrifying  particular for me who grew up in a haunted houseim not religious but the religious element here was done well without being preachy and gave a bit of an exorcist vibe to things the film felt like a combination of poltergeist the exorcist and the amityville horrorit was unexpectedly feelgood too the ending made me smile and i certainly didnt think 2 would be the most uplifting film id seen in recent weeks in saying that it wasnt exactly a relaxing friday night watchrip ed and lorraine  together again,astonish
this is a film made in united kingdom and when i hear that i worry but they made it right and opened up for other movies nun well done bravo,astonish
this is by far the best film in universe so far its suspenseful and creepy let me get some negatives out of the way there were some shaky cam moments in the beginning of the film that made no sense story wise 2 of the 4 child actors werent that good but what do you expect from child actors the night scenes in the house in the first half of the film were too dark just like the original movie but james wan fixes this halfway through the movie now lets get onto the positives the main cast and most of the supporting cast did an outstanding job in their respective roles within the film ed and lorraine warren were given better story arcs than the first film the cinematography was great throughout the film and had some really nice tracking shots that werent too long and werent too short the tone remained consistent throughout the film and the plot was pretty good i understood what was going on throughout the entire film the demons in this movie are flat out creepy the nun got me every time it was on screen and the crooked mans design was great i swear they used stop motion animation for the crooked man if they did then they blended his character really well with the live action scenes the scenes with both those demons added suspense and terror to an already terrifying film overall 2 improves from most of the mistakes from the original film while adding better cinematography a better supporting cast and scarier demons,astonish
was alright yeah but usually im always right and i said that ed was gunna die but he didnt so i embarrassed myself and now im pissed off apart from that movie was decent lol,astonish
the bogus stuff starts early the women relives the shooting of the family with a shotgun that doesnt exist people are sleeping and she starts shooting room by room but nobody wakes up including a kid who is sleeping right next to the one getting shot the previews were better,astonish
very good horror with perfect atmosphere and good actors,astonish
very good horror perfect atmosphere and good actors,astonish
unlike the first film this one is comprised entirely of jumpscares and common cliche tropes such as spooky ghost kid entity in reflections behind someone bite marks moving furniture and of course throwing someone across the room unexpectedlythere isnt really any form of a creeping sense of dread throughout it you get to see the entity up front in its entirety most of the time its around and honestly its not really that scary especially the crooked man theres not really any subtlety to leave the viewer guessing whats going to happen and you can see whats coming around pretty much every turnthe acting is good but they make it glaringly clear that theyre acting if that makes sensenot a great sequel and wouldnt really work on a standalone unless youre easily scared jumpscares get everybody and thats the crutch in this film410 but only because the production was pretty great,astonish
i dont know what movie these people all saw but the one i saw was not set in 1977 it was horrible it had no resemblance to the endfield horror and the acting was god awful was the teenager smoking in the kitchen at the beginning suppose to be the mother the whole set was like 1980  1990s the teenagers couldnt act they sounded like robots i was so lost i didnt know what end was up the scary was just from sudden loud noises and the volume kept going up and down which made it impossible to watch just awful all around,astonish
what more can i say i couldnt have delivered those lines without cracking upthese guys are true professionals,astonish
a gripping story that keeps you engrossed in the story,astonish
at all is good need see no sad like every horror movies ,astonish
i personally didnt find this film particularly frighteningthere were unnecessary cheesey moments which totally distracted from the horror too many emotional moments during tense scenes this made you think why are they doing this now this is not the timecomplete lack of strong tension building,astonish
2 doesnt rely on jump scares gore or cgi to frighten you it creates an atmosphere of terror that surrounds you almost the entire time and yet at the core of this movie you have remarkable performances by patrick wilson and vera farmiga to keep you from losing all hope its a strange yet satisfying mix of chilling and uplifting james wan knows how to direct horror films,astonish
while 2013s managed to become a modern horror classic rather quickly thanks to its effective screenplay terrific performances and slowbuild horror scares its bloated overlong sequel seems to go in the opposite direction on paper documenting the enfield poltergeist  allegedly one of the most welldocumented cases of reallife paranormal activity  is a good move for the sequel it has the weight of media validity not to mention the strong directorial vision of james wan as well as the gravitas of returning stars farmiga and patrick wilson but the drab setting drained color palette and strained performances of frances oconnor and her onscreen children erode the audiences enjoyment negating any funscares to be had along the way whats left is a preposterous 133minute running time with a draggedout climax that feels both disjointed and purposeless and while a few moments here and there manage to raise some goosebumps the majority of the scares are too thunderous to register the movie is watchable thanks to the likable duo of farmiga and wilson as well as residual goodwill from the first movie but it feels unsatisfying overall,astonish
2 is great it is my favourite horror movie to date and that is because of two reasons james wan and because im someone that is always open to new pieces of art instead of living in the past like a lot of people and this movie is truly a piece of art the painting room scene with the nun is probably the best made horror scene i have ever seen it shows james wan at his best wan really knows how to build tension from the creepy soundtrack that to the silent night scenes he doesnt show the demons a lot and that is maybe the best thing of this movie because these days movies are all about lets give the people all we got then they must like it and so they will come back and spend there money again let me give an example jurassic park is a true masterpiece the top of what a good actionthriller should be you dont see the dinos a lot but just enough to be scared and know what they are capable of the supporting characters also build on that tension by talking about how dangerous the threat is and what it can do so when you see the trex for the first time it feels even more like a true monster that has come alive now look at the lates jurassic world fallen kingdom there is a scene were they are fleeing from the bursting vulcano while hundreds of dinos are beside them its explosions and dinosaurs everywhere and it makes you look at a dinosaur like its a crocodile or elephant its kinda cool but you have seen it many times now lets take that comparison to 2 james wan doesnt show anything until the last moment when the tension is so high that you are sitting at the end of your seat and already thougt for at least two times that the jumpscare would come then is the moment that he hits you with a scary demon that creeps out of the dark ready to kill the only good left inside you but thats not all the reason why the painting room is so good imo is because it goes against anything i just said wan has let you get used a little bit to the type of scares i just mentioned and then switches it up out of the blue normally in most horrors these days the night scenes are for scares and the day scenes are for a little comedic relieve but then james wan gives you the nun the most scary character ever and out of nowhere she is standing in the hallway in the middle of the day that scares people even more because it is almost like she is breaking into your home you have gotten so used to the relieve part during the day scenes from this movie and all other horror movies that it is creepy and unexpectedthis movie also had other great essentials for a good sequel character development no cameos a small story and not trying to make it bigger then necessary good cinematography and a fine plotthis is the best movie james wan has to give us to date it is a thrill and deserves recognition lets hope the 3e movie will be just as good and not rushed because this one was a succes,astonish

although im an avid moviewatcher horror has never been one of my favorite genres ive found most horror films to be badly written and directed with poor acting and ultimately unsatisfying and not at all enjoyablehowever both and 2 are the exception the acting is excellent vera farmiga is exemplary in both movies and the rest of the cast perform very well especially in 2 the story isnt shallow and intended only to frighten as in most horror films its deeper and much more carefully written as if more intelligent thought has been put into creating the dialoguealthough i liked both was for me an even better movie than the first which is not the case with most sequels,astonish
this movie scared me waaaay more than the first did everything from the characterscinematography and the scares was perfect its diffidently on my top ten horror list,astonish
2 a horror movie review 2 between the directing of james wan and the acting of madison wolfe vera farminga and patrick wilson this movie is absolutely astounding the special effects and the music with the foley add to the movie and the movie deserves all the credit it gets this movie is arguably one of the best in franchise with a fabulous plot and incredible acting and it was a box office bonanza director james wan and writers chad hayes carey w hayes and david leslie johnson craft this movie to not just rely on jump scares and special effects but to rely on the story line and the set and the acting the story has jump scares and scary special effects but it is not only that as far as the cinematography goes don burgess made the scenes detailed but still easy to comprehend he deserves the credit he gets  another thing that this movie has going for it is the incredible madison wolfe who in this movie was such an incredible little actress for being so young at the time she plays the lead role janet hodgson who is forced into servile work by valak the demon nun as she is taken over no one outside her mom france o connor believes her especially when she fakes an event but it is only to protect her family ed warren patrick wilson and his wife lorraine warren vera farminga are the only people willing to help them when valak is at its worst as everyone else was churlish toward them the set fits the movie because the house is dingy and dirty it makes it creepy and more horrifying and when you hear the creaking of the stairs at night or the floor breaking in the laundry room or the flooding where something could be lurking in the dark water the filmmakers understand that they cannot beat around the bush with what is happening in this movie it is intense and powerful as fear is always hovering over you and as you are watching keep you on the edge of you seat the director lets the story grow before solving the problem the audience sees the film through an outside perspective 2 send the protagonist janet and her mother down a hole of demons and dark issues including an almost death situation the movies overall message leaves you with a feeling of fear that sometimes things are not always what they seem,astonish
a very chilling movie more so because of the links to true events which has an exceptional story line taking the viewer on a roller coaster of scares and thrills with no gore exceptionally well crafted and acted,astonish
i am confident to say that this movie is even better than the first one and we all know how good the first one was yes this movie maybe relies more on jump scares and yes the first one was revolutionary but this one offers few crazy horror characters at the same time that make the atmosphere even more wild i loved how the nun looked and the scenes where she was involved are maybe the best scenes in the movie so i cant wait to see that sequel we again see some awesome acting and well built relationship between the 2 main protagonists who make for an awesome couple that drives the movie from 1 to the 5th gear,astonish
2 sequel of also directed by james wan is highly recommended for every horror fan i wasnt expecting that the 2cnd chapter was going to be the same good as the 1rstbut yes it really isthe cast did an amazing jobtheres no so much jumpscares as the first one but 2 has a better plot and a better purposei really cared about all these charactershope james wan continues with the amazing movies,astonish
despite the occasional tonal relapse and iffy moment of forced comedic levity 2 2016 manages to maintain a consistent level of quality by providing the tension and suspense weve come to expect from this series in spades it is actually probably scarier than the first thanks mainly to the fact that the threat feels palpably deadly almost right from the start of the stellar setup this instalment also manages to create a couple of memorably creepy supernatural creatures that frighten with their superb and unique design alone yet are still treated with the respect that wan clearly has for the genre and the general craft  which here he seems to have mastered able to play the audience like a finelytuned piano character maintains a prevalent factor throughout though meaning that we truly care for the people at the heart of these dangerous situations its a wonderfully accomplished sequel that i enjoyed just as much if not more than the first again one of the best horror features in quite some time 810,astonish
2 starts off a little slow and disjointed but when ed  lorraine finally get to london to check out whats happening to a child  janet  things pick up with the possessionshauntings getting more severetheres nothing that scary here as far as im concerned its well directed shot and acted but theres no truly terrifying moment the story makes sense at the end but still plenty of whys left decent hauntedhouse film but nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary,astonish
we continue on with the paranormal adventures of ed patrick wilson  and lorraine vera farmiga warren of amityville fame they are asked to go to enfield and investigate a haunting or poltergeist case centering around janet hodgson madison wolfe and the spirit of billthe film is filled with jump scares whispers screams etc enough to make it enjoyablemuch of the film follows reported incidents a bit exaggerated and the criticism and skepticism of the time and today claims that janet did the pranks and practiced ventriloquism as well as being caught red handed faking incidents are included in the featurethe film makers took liberties with reports such as the police report that a chair wobbled from side to side became a chair moving across the room the role of ed and lorraine was minor and i would suggest the reason why they never wrote about it was that until the last half hour of the film they deemed it a hoax and that last part was hollywood writers earning their dime as an entertaining poltergeist film it is all that as to being factual there have been other films and features on enfield that are far less horrific and supernaturalgo watch the film for a good scare for the kids not a docudramaguide no swearing sex or nudity,astonish
2 is one of best class horror movieor sequels or franchise  being it has very good element of horror  suspense enough to scary u more director james directed this movie very well main thing is subject on which its scary element is concentrated or subjected both patrick wilson  vera farmiga investigate their horror case file in a house  the climax of film is very niceeach time throughout the movie u will able to scare more patrick wilson and vera farmiga does very well acting through all the movie surely if are in search of goodbest horror movie then 2 is the right one for u,astonish
the movie begins with another clever marketing pitch by james wan trying to mix amityville horror in here just like he did with annabelle well not that it is horrible but still seemed quite irrelevant the beginning is not horrible rather fast paced the viewers got to see paranormal activity quickly which carried on for a good whilewhat i found really weird was the movie coming to a massive stall in the middle of everything i do not think i have experienced something quite like this in a film before in my opinion it was just another cheap shot at extending the screen time which panned out to be rather sizeable the first hour had a couple of interesting and witty jump scares which were quite original and definitely one of the greatest things about this film then after we arrive at around the half way mark everything slows down and it seems as if everything has taken a turn and the premise and fast pace of this film have been discarded which is a massive flop of coursethere is a scene in the film which is going to make any experienced horror film fan cringe at this point i had to start heavily reevaluating my thoughts about the film there is a scene where a dog transforms into the crooked man from a kids toy game the monster was a really poor work of cgi which did absolutely no justice to the tone and tensity the movie had set prior to the scene it was really cringy not scary at all and very childish however by far the greatest upset for me was the extremely boring and poorly thought through ending the insanely powerful demon that can easily do anything it wants including teleportation transcending time and destroying everything in its way can be destroyed and sent to hell forever by saying its name 2 times this had me laughing such a week ending well at least it was unpredictable people like unpredictability when it comes to horror films right overall the film starts out great and slowly goes downhill as it progresses it escalates from witty unpredictable jump scares and intense atmosphere to lousy cgi work and laughable kindergarten horror culminating in one of the worst horror film endings i have ever seen in my life 510 for the great first half of this film,astonish
i dont get scared by horror movies but ive enjoyed this series because of the emphasis on likable characters from the family to ghostinvestigator couple these are good stories with believable relationships between family members who care about each other not simply a bunch of jumpscares although theres that tooas good as the first one was it was narratively a fairly simple  straightforward haunted house story id rate this one the sequel a little bit better because although featuring a similar premise it actually goes in a few unexpected directions and introduces additional hurdles for our protagoniststhis one also clearly has a bigger effects budget which doesnt hurt many of the effects are really quite creative and visually impressive eg a girl slowly transforming into someone else the unfocusedblurry background but also some that look a bit more silly than scary eg the crooked man,astonish
a perfect nightmare fuel james wan is really gifted to create such dark artbefore ive seen the second edition of saga 2013 and the omen 1976 were on the top of my list back to the answer let me tell you something about horror movie there are two types of a horror movieone who make you thrilled scare over the skin and others are just make your bone chill you can sense that scar beneath your skin and spine it has everything the perfect combination of background score timing script characters great fleshed out the screenplay great horror visuals i am die hard fan of horror movie have seen many korean japanese chinese spanish russian turkish horror movies apart of english but never felt that fear before it was like we are seeing something that one shouldnt see despite of knowing that it is just a movie this one will definitely give you a thrilled ride you might not have before click here for full review httpswwwquoracomwouldyouplease recommendagoodhorrormovieanswerkaushalprajapati16,astonish
2 celebrates horror in a new taste its a successful extension the original movie director james wan knows his viewers and he toys with their fairy tale nightmares as vera farmiga remarks it in this sequel this time the storys set in a council home in england and its about a poltergeist that torments a family of five the warrens this time get into things more gruesome than the last one james wan has not taken the recognition of his last work for granted with this he has gone to experiment with his core film making and hes successful in all ways actors are all brilliant vera farmiga is a beautiful artist who lives the character of lorraine patrick wilson this time is at his best and he totally nails the character of ed young madison wolfe is a talent to look out for shes vulnerable and worthgettingscaredof at the same time overall the movie is worth the hype the length of the movie however could have been curtailed but still it doesnt stop this thriller from being one of the best horror movies of all time,astonish
i dont generally put a whole lot of faith into horror sequels more often than not theyre just trying to recreate the success of what made the first film popular and fail to bring anything new to the table so many of them are unapologetic cashgrabs that i often wont pay attention to news that sequels are in the pipeline even when i enjoyed the first film i thought insidious was a creepy fun little film but i never once cared about the second chapter and still havent bothered to see it until just a moment ago i was completely unaware that there has in fact been a third chapter and theres a fourth in production speaking of james wan and patrick wilson the first was another decent horror i think it was overhyped and i mightve gone in with my expectations a little high but i enjoyed it i had zero interest in the idea of a second film believing theyd gone the route of every other successful horror with a seemingly neverending explosion of sequels and spinoffs for the record i never saw annabelle and have no desire to do so but i was caught offguard when 2 started receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews i gave it the benefit of the doubt and in the end im glad i did because im actually of the opinion that 2 is superior to the first film so i suppose its a rare exception to the rule2 revisits the case files of ed and lorraine warren two of the most famous paranormal investigators it opens with a glimpse into their involvement in the investigation of the amityville house where lorraine vera farmiga conducts a sance and comes facetoface with some sort of evil spirit in the form of an evil nun unlike the first film where their annabelle investigation was just a cold open to introduce the pair in action the nun becomes an integral part of 2 tormenting lorraine long after finishing at amityville with visions of eds patrick wilson death its her confrontation with the nun and these spectral threats that lead her to swearing off handson investigations and she and ed decide to limit their activity to seminars and interviews meanwhile in england a new supernatural occurrence has taken up residence in the home of a single mother and her four children its set its sights on the youngest daughter janet madison wolfe and its not long before her overstressed mother takes notice and affirms that this isnt a childs prank her family is being tortured nightly and janet is suffering more and more as the entity breaks her spirit in hopes of possessing her body for its own purposes the misery of a young child proves too much for lorraine to turn away and she and ed jet off across the atlantic to verify the poltergeists existence and hopefully get the catholic church involved in exorcising the spiritthe enfield poltergeist is apparently one of the more famous warren investigations i wasnt familiar with the details of it prior to this movie but i had seen the photographs of janets supposed levitations referenced before in my limited readings on the paranormal of course the whole situation has been debunked as an attentiongrabbing hoax but for the purposes of this movie its all treated as gospel and it makes for a great movie i remember the first film leaving me uneasy in a dark house when it ended but 2 was way more effective at leaving me shaken james wan is a talented horror director and one of the few out there that can put together a strong ghost story without the reliance on shocking gore or overused jump scare tactics he uses camera lenses lighting film score and the performances of his cast to build a sense of dread in a way that many other modern horror filmmakers wish they could theres a little bit of questionable cg in the film when the spirit takes the form of a childrens nursery rhyme named the crooked man but its a minor misstep and i can forgive its cartoonish appearance because everything else works so well the first seems to have soaked all the hype but is the one that gets my respect fans of the first one wont be disappointed and for once im eager for a horror sequel and hope they continue digging through the warrens files with a 3,astonish
its very rare that a horror sequel outdoes its original and 2 is one of those sequels dont get me wrong 2013 was very scary with quality horror great acting and a great plot but 2 surpasses the story line overall quality acting and most importantly the terror im a big fan of paranormalhorror films especially those based on a true story and actual events i loved 2013 so i just had to see 2 and let me tell youi was blown away and i had to keep the lights on in every room after watching itthe film starts out with ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga conducting a seance at the amityville house in 1977 lorraine a clairvoyant astral projects and relives the horrific events  and comes facetoface with a terrifying demonic nun wholl play a bigger role later on in the film meanwhile an equally diabolic haunting is taking place in enfield england where 11yearold janet hodgson is being tormented by a ghost ed and lorraine come to the rescue and things get frightening from therethe first thing i must greatly compliment about this movie is the acting especially vera farmigas i was very impressed at how much the cast looked so much like the original people and investigators involved each actor and actress was very passionate about their roles and they made things pretty intense  sometimes even emotional i also loved the realistic visual effects that delivered the activity and scares the sound editing was brilliant the soundtrack was eerie and bonechilling and the costume design was great im including the costume design because the actors wore what the original persons did during the investigations making it all the more authentic overall 2 possesses a very eerie creepy haunting feeling throughout the film which is rare in todays world of horror movies it makes you feel tense and uneasy during and after watching it as if something dark and inhuman is watching you i had a hard time sleeping the night i watched it which almost never happens to me as a diehard horror fan you can tell director james wan put a ton of time and quality in the making of this one and recreating the horrific events that happened to janet hodgson in 1977 five stars and 1010 i highly recommend it i cant wait for 3 as well as the confirmed spinoffs the nun and the crooked man,astonish
theres something about director james wan that puts this horror sequel in line with the other landmark movies made which apart from everything else keeps our eyes attached to the screenthis one comes with a story to tell thats so deep and scary that even the most unbelieving person in the world would have himself confirmed for the existence of evil this is a classic set of horror piece which is exemplary,astonish
its 1976 ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga investigate the amityville house after the incident they are attacked for participating in a hoax lorraine is haunted by the nun and visions of eds death she convinces him to stop meanwhile in london the hodgson family is suffering from a haunting peggy hodgson frances oconnor is a single mom with four kids janet the 11 year old is possessed by the spirit intermediately as more incidents occur and a media crisis gather the church calls in the warrensat its core this is a simple haunted house horror there are a few good horror moves but by itself its not that special the warrens make it special they have create a compelling horror universe lorraine and the nun have a great nightmare scene the best is lorraine having a heart to heart with janet they make all the difference,astonish
2 enfield poltergeist 2016 is a mystery horror thriller film directed by james wan this movie is a sequel to the film of its predecessor 2013  the film was released june 7 in the united states and received a positive response from critics to the audience  following the story of two famous psychics ed warren and lorraine warren who handle the case of the enfield family home in new england janet the 11yearold girl is haunted by bill wilkins who wants the janet family to go from there  the events of the supernatural haunt the house  but not the figure bill wilkins was in the house but there was an evil spirit who wanted to kill ed lorraine with janet  will ed and lorraine manage to stop the evil forces in that house  this horror movie is pretty good  the classic nuance is so dark  its horror feel is so felt  acting the cast is pretty good  the emergence of a scary figure of valak makes this film into a horror movie that is quite scary in 2016,astonish
this film is almost as good as the original its so close that it is basically neck and neck i enjoyed this just as much although the formula was basically the same the one thing that stood out and any fan will attest to is valek boy is this nun the scariest villain i may have ever seen this character alone deserves its own film and sadly doesnt get much screen time however that might be what makes the character so great all in all prepare yourself and you better have those lights on and preferably be watching it with someone else valek will leave an impression that is hard to shake off even days and weeks later,astonish
when first came out in 2013 it broke records for a an original horror movie based on real life events then came annabelle based on the doll used in the movie last year the sequel came out and outgrossed its predecessor the success of these movies and the upcoming annabelle creation will keep the spirit of the warrens alive for generations to come,astonish
there are few horror films that have exceeded expectations in the past 20 years in fact you can probably count them on two hands most people would put 2013s simpleyetstriking spookfest in this list so its hard to imagine any followup effort coming close to it in terms of qualitydirector james wan clearly realized how important it was to live up to expectations so he brought his agame on 2016s 2 which follows worldfamous demonologists ed and lorraine as they investigate a media circus of a case of a haunted house in enfield england while theres much criticism about the veracity of the story and the level to which the warrens were involved in the case this doesnt change the quality of the filmin we once again get to see patrick wilson and vera farmiga both of whom are modernday scream kingsqueens by this point reprise their roles and while there are a few other key actors who are key here particularly madison wolfe as the young janet hodgson and frances oconnor as her mother peggy its really the patrick and vera show once again they both deliver strong performances and are the best part about the film that said as you would expect the thrills and chills sent up audiences spines are also key and somehow the ones dished out in this film are on the same level as those in its predecessor sure there are a lot of commonly used techniques like shaky cam quick transitions etc but they are done so well here and do not feel cheap at alladditionally the soundtrack and sound effects really bring to life as any haunted house movie would rely on but the main reason this film lives up to expectations is because it has a strong script from some lighter moments to many tense ones where there are lifeanddeath situations it really is all in the script and the screenplay2 proves that breakout horror films are not always a fluke  its possible to build a successful franchise that resonates with audiences,astonish
i was incredibly impressed by the way this movie kept the same general theme vibe and strength of scares as its predecessor while also being fresh and adding just the right changes to subvert expectations i also loved how they actually called the police this time and based on the common sense theory that some sinister prankster was behind everything although the mother really should have thought about that but whatever at least someone acted rationally which is incredibly rare in horror films i was then impressed again by the fact that paranormal events happened while the police were there words cant describe how satisfying and refreshing that was to seethe only thing that really bothered me about this movie was the part where everyone suddenly concluding that all the hauntings were fake due to one incident in what universe would a rational thinking adult believe that a little girl could fake everything that happened that scene was so frustratinghowever the aforementioned weakness was connected to a strength in this film i loved that loraine wasnt able to see the demon that is something i didnt expect the way they found out later why she couldnt see the demon was also a very exiting addition to the storythe ending of this film is a big improvement over mainly in the sense that the final battle with the demon was shorter these final battles where the demon fully possesses someone arent as scary for me demons are more scary to me when they arent in a physical form because things that i cant see scare me the most at the point of possession i dont see a demon just a crazy acting human that my brain associates with someone with a mental health problem,astonish
i enjoyed the first movie well enough but i wasnt dying to see the followup its a surprisingly good sequel that impressed me more than the first onethere is a simple enough setup of loraine and warren once again going to investigate a haunted house i think what i like the most about how james wan starts horror movies is that he really sets the mood by showing the characters reacting to spirits or scary things going on then we start to get a sense of the state of mind that they get put ini love how this movie is shot with the prevalence of shaky cam and found footage horror movies its almost refreshing to see long crane cam shots and just an overall clarity how everything is presented many horror and suspense movies lean on having cameras wobbling around to create confusion and try and feel scary his horror movies feel more like hes trying to pull you and make you feel what the characters are feelingmy one big complaint is the running time when a movie is asking for more than 2 hours of my attention it better have no pacing issues the pacing does dip a bit in the 3rd act but the final 30 minutes mostly make up for iti hope james wan makes at least one more of these after aquaman because these movies are a lot of fun in a way most directors cant come close,astonish
this is one of the scarier movies i have seen it has a great story line it also has great acting it also has great special effects this is scarier then the exorcist and is not easy to do this is one of the scariest movies of all time you may to want to watch this movie alone it is a very scary movie it so scary it will scary you if this movie does not scary you no movie will patrick wilson is a great actor james wan is a great film maker this a very scary movie if you like horror movies you will like this movie it make jump 74 is good ratting but is such a good movie that 74 is underrating it this a 10 out of 10,astonish
was arguably the most interesting horror film that came out last year recently most horror films have been using all kinds of special effects that didnt fit the genre of horror film due to its outlandish way of portraying supernatural entities ghosts monsters etc which ultimately hinders the scary factor of the genre compared to another horror sequel which i have watched called sinister 2 and various other horror films released within a year with i can say that the movie has done well in delivering the right atmosphere for its genre i watched this movie as a group in a film club for our school and id like to say that we were pretty scared some korean students have expressed that western horror films are exceptionally different from east asian horror films they are more focused towards christianity and religious storyline while the east asian horror films are heavily reliant on revengevengeance type of plot development all in all was a decent horror film compared to a recent surge of terribly made horror films but they certainly have areas that they can improve on,astonish
modern day compositions seem to lack the element of refinement with patience everything is so fast that in a couple of years a good number of practices and ways will be altered with speed for the sake of nonpersistent productions and the horror genre in the field of cinema has been exposed to this tendency the moston the other hand this movie tries to whip off the horror genre not because of its strong originality but because of its devoutness in cinematography screenplay and actingnot only the lead actors are of the best quality especially ms vera farmiga but the rest of the actors helped it seem like the story actually was taking place when we see itthe scenes were prepared carefully along with the unvarnished austere movements and shots of the camerathe screenplay was originally derived from a true story yeah but it is not the sole reason behind the success in fact the writers changed it a lot to the point that it had cooperativeness helpfulness and love that was missing from the original story at the time of which the people and the media treated the hodgson family as zoo animalsokay time for truth every horror fan knows that a good horror movie should scare us really well and be of originality doing it but if we look at randomly selected 100 movies we were to see that most of them chooses a way that contains emetic amount of blood stupid decisions musical pieces that were composed rather by chance the showing up of the killer out of thin air irrationally when you least expect it the appearance of the killer  the monster after the characters cuts in the frame and thereafter steps aside etc we could really go onbut this one kept as far away from these commonplaces as possible of course it is not a huge success for that matter but their centering the story not around the horror but around love is the real achievement of this moviefor i would not find anyone that wont notice the love between the lead characters and their compassion towards people in need that is what the world needs yepi will give this movie a 82 yes lovehey mr patrick wilson hey ms vera farmiga great to see you perform it is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the east and the west during prayer but righteous is he who believes in allah and the last day and the angels and the scripture and the prophets and gives wealth for love of him to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask and to set slaves free and observes proper worship and pays the poordue and they who fulfill their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant and endure with fortitude misfortune hardship and peril these are they who are true in their faith these are the allahfearingthe gracious koran speaks on matters in its 2nd chapter called the cow the 177th verse amen,astonish
attempts to make horror franchises usually flop in terms of quality sequels of classic or modern greats such as halloween and paranormal activity despite being financially successful fail to critically impress unlike their predecessors this might be because they are retreading the same solidified steps or that the director had changed from the first and although director james wan made a lacklustre attempt at his insidious sequel he recaptured the spirit of with its sequel 2 the enfield case 2 follows paranormal investigators ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga yet again as they set out to help another family plagued by malevolent spirits this time the factually based haunting is set in the titular london borough of enfield england 70s london adds a layer of splendour to the film everything from that era is nailed  from the fashion to the oldstyled accents what is also faithful is the case itself and the people involved actors were specifically hired to look like their real life counterparts and most of the events from the case are virtually reenacted from witness descriptions even the haunted house and its properties look the same which makes for a lot of believability for those who are familiar with the story by focusing on a case outside the us the film differentiates itself from the first straight away however as is the curse of the horror sequel as previously mentioned the film retreads many stylistic titbits of wans earlier works one example of this is when a demon points ominously to the desired victim  the same motif used in insidious 2s antagonist also looks strikingly similar to the bride in black in insidious but other than that wan uses his oneofakind horror filmmaking skill to craft something that stands out in his filmographythe tension in the second outing is on par with the original wan uses audiences expectation and paranoia to carefully execute effective scares there are moments that build to nothing in the beginning playing on fears of the dark and of unusual sounds with fantastic lighting as the events occur they become increasingly more violent and scarier sometimes though the film becomes zany and not as believable as the first wan once stated that he prefers to leave things to the audiences imagination but more is revealed in this film i also have a problem with the amount of cgi as practical effects look more believablewans experience with the fast  furious franchise carries its silver linings here in the form of more energetic cinematography solidly taken care of by don burgess camera movements are superb and invigorating with the tracking shots being a highlight throughout the directors career he includes them better than ever before leaving viewers on the edge of their seats as we follow our protagonists through to whatever lies ahead joseph bishara once again helms the score  the scariest aspect of his films percussions strings and haunting choirs are used to punctuate 2s disturbing imagery to maximum shock and discomfort i do not know if i would be scared at all if this unbearably frightening score was not includedfarmiga is the star of the show here and wilson holds his own too i am glad the warrens continue to develop as they are becoming even more empathetic and compelling this time around most importantly they actually seem quite vulnerable in the finale you feel like anything could happen to these characters which i personally found exciting while 2 cannot compete with its predecessors subtlety and innovation it serves as the cherry on top to james wans title this generations most consistent horror director see it for some of the best thrills of the year,astonish
i really enjoyed the first one so i was a bit reluctant after reading some of the negative reviews on this site i think the characters in the first one were a bit more likable other than that this one was every bit as good i can only assume that the negative reviews people who are nothing short of ignorant if you saw the first one you def need to see this one you wont be disappointed ive heard rumors of a 3rd one so hopefully that happens the only thing that i was disappointed at and its minorwas that lorraine had to come up with a name i wont say name of what or its a spoiler and ive heard that name quite a few other times in different movies all in all though a fine movie and am glad i finally had a chance to watch it,astonish
it seems like a ton of horror movies come out every year and most times they dont live up to their potential there are a handful of horror movies over the last decade that really satisfy us horror fans films like the babadook it follows and will still be talked about for years to come one name in the horror genre or at least in recent years is james wan this man burst onto the scene with saw which was basically genre changing and spawned a ton of sequels wan also made a few other horror films all testing the bounds and pushing us into a new horror direction while still respecting his influencesi can easily say that james wans name belongs up there with the likes of john carpenter and stephen king the guy knows horror and how to execute it so well that his images will continue to haunt for many years to come im glad he signed on to take on the ed and lorraine warren investigations some years ago and gave us and now 2 which was previously titled the enfield poltergeist if youre unfamiliar with ed and lorraine warren these are two reallife people who were paranormal investigators and professors who helped a lot of people from hauntings and possessionsperhaps their most famous investigation was the amityville horror which is where 2 starts out as ed and lorraine warren are investigating the house a few months after the lutz family moved out its here that lorraine vera farmiga has a vision of something so sinister that she makes her husband ed patrick wilson promise that they are done with these investigations thats when things start to go awry over in england at the hodgson residence where things go bump in the night and then some as the mother peggy hodgson and her four young kids are subjected to moving furniture screams and much moreed and lorraine hear of this and set out to england to help out despite their previous promise and then all hell breaks loose  literally running at over two hours there are certain times where 2 seems like its doing too much but there is nothing bad about the movie really its just that were put through so much suspense horror and terror that by the final act we are glad its over with its not necessarily a bad thing but it makes you exhausted by the end director james wan is true modern master of horror he uses the usual horror genre tropes but makes them relevant and fresh all over again whether it be a child hiding under the covers while something is hovering over you or a possessed toy and even ghostly visionsmost of these moments will leave a lasting and terrifying impression that will make it difficult to sleep at night particularly a certain beastly nun i still get shivers thinking about it wan also adds some comedy here but is used sparingly and is relegated to the time period it was a nice breath from all the intense horror that was going on in the film the score is fantastic and adds to every single moment of terror its incredible that these stories are real and that you can actually research them and wan does an incredible job of adapting the material and making it entertaining and scaryashell 2 is a fantastic sequel and is an instant horror classichighly recommended,astonish
although a good movie the story is an account of  or ripped from  a british drama called the einfield haunting this movie was good but did not do justice to the original events i recommend people watch the original drama the drama is a miniseries which covers the events quite extensivelythe plot is also ok but nothing extra ordinary in comparison i think the first movie was great for people who do not care much about the source of the story this should still be quite watchable in this day and age where horror seems to be a synonym for gore and filth youd find this to be a fresh telling of actual eventsdefinitely creepy and well worth the watch,astonish
2 is a really good horror movie you should as fan must see all i had in the beginning the feeling it corresponded over with insidious it is actually a kind of the same story so it can be right i will not give spoilers so you have to see the movie to understand what i mean the start of the movie begins slowly but at the first time you be on the sofa glued to watch the moviethe music at the main menu sets the tone actually what for movie 2 is really well done i found the film very believable but the only thing i was missing was more information about the head demon person in the story because it was more about poltergeist and the family sorry still a small spoiler i found the location very suited to the film each scene what happened in their home was creepy exciting and gooda must if you like horror and at not have night afraid to sleep,astonish
finally a true horror film no starlets losing their tops running around aimlessly this had a good plot great film work excellent suspense and a few welldeserved jump scares although some of the cg seemed low budget i do believe it was certainly meant to come off that way based on the subject wilson and farmiga create characters that are adaptable and believable the supporting cast as well were very strong and created a true empathetic connection it is a rare feat these days to create a creepy movie with strong character performances that do not not rely solely on cg or jump scares if you are in the mood for a real horror movie this just might fit your style perfectly very enjoyable,astonish
as you know im a huge horror movie fan and when im watching a horror film i expect nothing but the best and 2 did not let me down it pretty much had the same scare factor as which that film was a great one too you have to have some skills in film making in order to have the sequel just as good or better than the original and 2 is just as good as the original the storyline and plot were solid and the creepiness throughout the film was on point another good thing about this film is that there are a couple of twists that kind of make it a little different from the first but at the same time it doesnt veer off from the same formula that made so good the director of this film knows just how much scare and creepiness to put in a horror film without going overboard with it or not putting enough in it to render it boring with set up stories and dialog if youre a horror movie fan like me and you really enjoyed the prequel to this film i highly recommend seeing this one,astonish
i cant understand why so many say this sequel is better its okay but thats alli love watching horror movies that build up the suspense and have you feeling anxious for the characters problem is most including this take it a little too far pulling you out of the moment and reminding you it isnt realspoilers the crooked man thought i was watching beetlejuice or nightmare before christmas not a movie trying to take itself serious the demon nun a couple of scenes were a little over the top almost became a monster movie the finally was just way over the top too many jump scares which to me points to lazy script writing,astonish
2 follows the warren couple as they discover another family is being haunted and sets out to help them meanwhile spiritual troubles have started with themselves personally i didnt care for the first movie that much i thought it was largely cheap horror without much substance the sequel however takes everything it predecessor did right then puts it into a much better movie similar to the last movie the performances are all good vera farmiga and patrick wilson continue to be great but another standout was frances oconnor she plays the mother of the haunted family and she does a dang good job of it the kids are good too most notably madison wolfe who plays the girl the ghost primarily goes after unlike its predecessor this movie is actually pretty unnerving throughout the movie takes a similar approach to the original where it develops both the warrens outside the haunting and those who are haunted before ultimately bringing them together it works very well here and the movie is much more upfront with its scares yet its not really overthetop for the first half as such we see the familys relationships get tested and it develops and makes the audience care much more for them so each scare becomes that much more effective even without that the movie is creepy it uses the fear of the unknown very well and builds up a tense atmosphere with immense payoff speaking of the payoff the climax is outstanding the first movie had a notably good climax and for me that more or less saved the film here its even better its longer and thus the tension builds more and there are aspects that are hinted at or more outwardly stated earlier in the movie so when those aspects present themselves it only makes it better i was on the edge of my seat and while i was sure i knew the ending i wasnt completely certain and thats another thing i loved about this movie the movie is great with its mystery towards the end especially i began to question it and while i was sure i knew what was going to happen again i wasnt completely certain the movie had proved itself to be pretty brave thus far who knows maybe it would turn everything on its head the first act is brilliantly shot it features several noticeably long takes and it further shows just how much skill went into this movie unfortunately those shots do take a dip in the last portion or maybe they became less noticeable once the story picked up but regardless it was a treat to see this level of skill from a director overall 2 is somehow not only a good horror sequel but a great one its a beautifully shot genuinely unnerving well performed horror that i had a blast with im looking forward to seeing it again and in the end i would definitely recommend it,astonish
contains spoilers james wans 2013 film was one of the best horror films i have ever seen to this day there are still scenes that i struggle to watch because they are so terrifying the film was one of those rare modern horror films that generated scares without excessive gore and cheap boo moments when i heard wan was creating a sequel i was skeptical because simply did not need one when i saw the trailer i was underwhelmed and not looking forward to the film but because i loved the first film so much and respect wans skill as filmmaker i would give it a chance 2 is one of those films where you absolutely cannot judge it by its trailerwhen it comes to genuine terror 2 is a slight step below its predecessor but it is ever so slight ive watched this film twice since i saw it in the theater and like its predecessor i still struggle to watch certain scenes the opening scene where the demon is first revealed countless scenes in the hodgson household and the absolutely terrifying scene with lorraine and the demon in the warrens house wan knows how to generate atmosphere and chills that skill is on full display in 2one of the most interesting aspects of this sequel is there is an added element of skepticism i never knew anything about this haunting before but it seems like there was a great deal of skepticism surrounding it that skepticism is addressed in the film unlike its predecessor where the warrens believed the perron family from the outset the warrens have their doubts about the events occurring in the hodgson household the evidence they are presented with isnt convincing to them and lorraine never can sense an evil presence until the very end the fact that there is another character who is skeptical of the claims and remains unconvinced only makes this element more intriguing2 does fall short in a couple areas compared to its predecessor for instance regardless of whether or not the events that happened with the perron family were true or not presented them to the audience in a way where they seemed believable aside from the using paranormal activities the daughter being thrown across the room there was nothing so outrageous that i wouldnt believe that what i saw couldnt have happened 2 does not capture that as well when it introduces the crooked man not only is the cgi cheesy here theres nothing remotely creepy about this ghost it is lame and bordering on mildly humorous and just doesnt fit in with the tone of the filmalso there is the issue of how the demon is defeated at the end the demon is disposed of in exactly the same way as bathsheeba was at the end of however there is a big difference between the two films bathsheeba never told the warrens her name if a demon can be sent back to hell simply by saying its name then why did it tell lorraine its name it doesnt make any sense and it does somewhat diminish the endingnevertheless 2 is still an excellent horror film and if it werent for those two flaws this would be a flawless horror film as it stands wan has created a worthy sequel and an incredible onetwo punch in modern horror i dont know if there will be a 3 but with wan at the helm id certainly be excited for i,astonish
slightly better first half those 20 extra minutes alone make all the difference when compared to the original then gets progressively worse as it goes on and frankly the crooked man is the lowest pointabsolutely no reason for its existence who the hell was craving for awful cgi i do like the first one its unfortunate that ed and lorraine have to be mentioned every time they have to be on screen the movie takes a hit they are huge frauds why use their real names anyway this one is a series of clever ideas that serves as a build up for what major audience wants and what they want is a ton of crap of jumpscares little side note is set in london 1977 but they used london calling from 79 for the establishing shot,astonish
from scares like a creepy toy that plays the crooked man to a phantom nun with yellow eyes 2 will please horror fans many times over furthermore i hope a third sequel gets made soonlike its predecessor this movie features a story about the warrens in reallife ed warren was a wwii naval officer who after the war became a selftaught demonologist alongside his wife lorraine who is a self described clairvoyant among other titles they are highly documented investigators of the paranormal ed is the only nonordained demonologist or one who performs exorcisms recognized by the catholic church they have published many of their famous investigations and claim to have done tens of thousands of them in the film patrick wilson plays ed and vera farmiga plays lorraine the movie is based on their experience with the enfield poltergeistdirector james wan is well known for scaring moviegoers his saw and insidious franchises have netted hefty sums from the wallets of people looking for that thing theyve never seen before hes a master craftsman of the horror genre there isnt nearly as much blood and gore in 2 as you will find in saw movies still there are well crafted scares throughout a spinning toy that sings the crooked man is part of one scare that has stayed with mevera farmiga does an excellent job as lorraine warren you can see in her eyes and movement she has such a profound love and respect for her husband when he picks up the guitar at one point to bring some peace and music to the haunted place she is just as captivated with him as the daughters are its interesting how ed in many ways is the hero of 2 when i saw the first film i didnt know he was a real person knowing a little about ed warrens history helped me appreciate him immensely in the second film there is a lot of info on the internet and the warrens even have their own website that is still up today ed has passed on but lorraine is still with us she speaks about her paranormal experiences at various events this film concerns the possession of a young girl and how her family saves her with the help of the warrens1there is no doubt there will be another sequel since there are other stories about the warrens that remain to be told i think the first two in the franchise are both very scary horror movies with interesting real life foundations because i was shocked and thrilled 2 loses no stars from me i highly recommend it to horror fansbelow is a real treat an interview with the hayes brothers the writers of the 2 films,astonish
2 is a very wellmade horror movie and a well made movie in general one of the best that ive seen it does an excellent job of making you think about whats really going on and whats behind the haunting while lorraines visions of an evillooking nun become more threatening and while the apparition that torments the family has no visible similarities whos responsible for the haunting becomes more and more questionable the movie is as good as the first and maybe more scary the movie has a less creepy atmosphere since its based in a very urban area london england whereas the first movie as a house in the middle of the woods both movies are based around a haunting usually occurring inside a single house both haunting cases escalate to a possession 2 has a few more jump scares id say the jump scares in 2 were scarier than the ones in if you like scary movies are if you loved the first movie than this is a very good film to watch be prepared to have sleepless nights i rate 910,astonish
the first was really good the teaser trailer is actually the main reason why i wanted to see this movieand i saw it and it was creative but not really as that scary as i thought the second one however was really scarybecause when youre in londoneverything is scary as it is same with japan i thought everything about this movie was all creativescaryand as imaginative as i actually didnt think it would be in the first one i saw they had annabelle and made it into a decent movie i also saw they added a specific witch named bathsheba and shes an actual witch for real as i heardalso of course a few lost souls and that was it for the second onethey added a nun which was creepyalso and old man which was also creepybut the one that was the most creepiest is the crooked man i have so many ideas for himbecause they didnt show him much which is a great opportunity to make ideas of my own2 was really creative and really scary,astonish
with leaving theatres in 2013 as one of the highest grossing horror movies of all time it was of no surprise when director james wan announced that he was going to helm a sequel despite claiming to be done with the genre the first movie was a stylish alternative to the bloodspattered torture porn and cgi laden exorcism drivel that grace our screens every year although it featured quite a bit of the latter and a loving wink to the creepier more slowburning supernatural tales of the 1970s the sequel keeps the 70s aesthetic but sadly everything else too and this time its longer duller and far less frighteningits london 1977 and the hodgson family move into a ramshackle council house in enfield and quickly start experiencing paranormal occurrences janet madison wolfe one of two daughters is tormented by the apparition of an old man and furniture regularly flies across the room the events quickly attract the attention of the police reporters and sceptics and word eventually travels across the pond to paranormal investigators lorraine vera farmiga and ed warren patrick wilson lorraine is battling against her own visions of a ghostly nun and the death of her husband but the couple decide to investigate nonetheless soon enough the warrens uncover sinister forces at work at the hodgsons homethe first film was such an astounding success that it would seem that wan and his four writers were simply terrified to change the formula while bending to the fact that the audience will no doubt be expecting the ante to be upped significantly so we are again hampered by a distracting sidestory involving a previous investigation by the warrensas the film begins in amityville a story which the 2005 version starring ryan renyolds should have ensured wouldnt litter our screens again for at least two decades a troubling seance seems to unleash a pdoff creepy nun onto lorraine and this story thread is shoehorned into the central plot much of the first third is spent switching between continents as the hodgsons and warrens go about their business oblivious to the others existence in a clunky style that doesnt really gelon the spooky side its obvious that wan has a real knack for sculpting a setpiece he understands the effect that a creaking floorboard a dark corner of a room or just plain silence can have on an audience but wan doesnt seem to have the discipline he had first time around chilling slow walks across a darkened landing soon give way to jumpscares you can spot a mile away a spirit with a daft cockney accent and most inexplicably a giant cgi crooked man theres a limit to how many you can be asked to watch a character make the same daft mistakes why doesnt somebody just turn a light on at least or watch the socalled experts deny what is right in front of their eyes despite years of experience and at 134 minutes it asks you to do this for a long time i must be missing something as 2 has been another huge financial success but i see little here that i havent seen a hundred times before,astonish
honestly one of the scariest movies ive ever seen ive been watching scary movies since i can remember ive always loved being scared and i recommend this to anyone out there who likes being scared or just likes scary movies in general im a guy who likes jump scares and i will say that it has jump scares and thats also a good thing that i look forward to seeing in a scary movie ive never really been super scared where to the point i could not sit still and i was shaking and moving a lot because i was so scared i find the details in the movie really good and the songs in the movie that are suppose to scare you and thats what gets my energy going which i also look forward to look forward to in a scary movie,astonish
i have to admit i wasnt s 2013 biggest fan the film felt like yet another possession story that has been told in a very similar way since the exorcist 1973 the jump scares were there and provided everyone in the theater a good spook but the clich nature of the film prevented from rating it anything other than ok james wans 2 is very much a story told in the same way as the previous film ed and lorraine warren are once again sent on task to aid a family being haunted by a truly terrifying demon there are far more twists and turns to this iteration in series than its previous entry but the most amusing part of this film is wans wonderful recreation of 1970s england the hodgson family is in great distress by the time the warrens arrive and sure enough this films demonic presence doesnt like it what transpires is a jumpy and at times horrific demon tale that is far from original the movie progresses very much like the first entry and the acting throughout the film is serviceable if not mediocre at times thankfully wan pulls us into the horror immediately leaving us on pins and needles for the films surprisingly lengthy run time 2 hours you are definitely getting a lot of scare for your buck which is arguably the films greatest accomplishment many modern horror films run under 90 minutes so a lengthy ghost tail is a treat while the demon possession story has been told many times the consistently ominous tone of the film is no joke wans camerawork is wonderfully traditional for a horror film full of close ups and some well planned continuous shots the film ends abruptly and without much resolution its hard not to wish there was a bit more put into the concluding moments i dont how many more of these films in series can be made before they are cast aside a repetitive but as long as wan is behind the camera its worth giving it a try 710  good,astonish
okay so maybe seeing 2 in the theaters made this movie a tiny bit more scary maybe highly doubtful unless youre about 10 years old or youngerall i know is although i love vera and patrick as actors and believe they excel at their craft i still cant find it in my heart to like them much as demon demolishers they just dont do it for me at allthere were so many moments in this flick where i caught myself rolling my eyes oof and for me thats the kiss of death for any movie much less one thats supposed to scare the pants off meway too many gtfo get the frack out moments in conjurer 2 why oh why do these characters persist in peering into darkened kids tents walking through doors that mysteriously creeeeak open and then go flogging about in dimly lit basements we all know nuns are evil so whats the big reveal about that and where did that one guy in the red hat not the crooked man guy suddenly come into the storythere was only one moment during the viewing when i felt the hairs stand up on the back of my neck one i felt everything else was far too seen this one before and here we go again substandard schlock the disney happy music at the very end of the film was really just the perfect nail in the coffin how corny where did the daughter of the warrens get off to when mummy and daddy were celebrating their big win anyway doesnt she like to dance to elvis music toowant to see a scary movie watch bone tomahawk now thats a creative and especially scary flick 2 yawn,astonish
rarely does a big time director of a hit horror movie come back and make a direct sequel to his work james wan seems to take up this challenge and its refreshing that he has the desire to continue his original story with another solid outing it almost seems that franchise is quickly becoming on the level of the the exorcist franchise in terms of story and film quality in the possession genre wans ability to create a frightening film relatable on a human level is a remarkable talent an initial strength of 2 is how topical the premise is to the actual landscape of paranormal perception for example an important part of any reallife exorcism is the doubt that the vast majority of people view towards the subject in question in this case a girl played by a good upcoming talent madison wolfe 2 outlines the media scrutiny towards exorcisms very well and also the genuine nature and belief in the paranormal field by strong grounded people patrick wilson and vera farmiga are simply incredible in these roles flatout polished acting chops and never wilt once on screen a wellwritten story strong cast and crew and hair raising scenes and dialogue its really not that surprising to see 2 crush at the box office as well as critical reviews,astonish
watching a horror movie alone in a theatercheckwatching a horror movie alone in a theater with nobody else therewell almost checki had about 5 more people sitting at the back so it still felt like i was the only one in that big room watching on the big screenas most people would know by now follows ed and lorraine warren to the famous or rather infamous enfield case in london the enfield case itself was quite widely covered by tabloids and some dailys but is also considered mostly a hoax there is a lot of evidence to suggest that it was not real this site  history vs hollywood covers it quite welljames wan has taken quite a few creative liberties with this case as the warrens were just two of the many paranormal investigators who visited the hodgsons and they were there only for a day to investigate but having said that i really liked the movie james wan has the craft to show the audience a horror without it being a slug or gore or bad makeup fest  he has the ability to build on the characters so well that you actually care for them that is a hard thing to do in films if you do not care for the main characters then the film is almost as good as deadthe story itself might be called clichd by many but i think its the emotions like fear sadness grief and depression that actually make every clichd horror story different the hodgsons were poor they hardly had enough money to buy even biscuits and peggy hodgson the matriarch was barely meeting ends for her 4 children so you immediately feel for the characters and as they say when you are down is when you get kicked in the guts the main character  madison wolfe as janet hodgson the one who is possessed from time to time does a brilliant job her fear agony and sadness is palpable the others in the family too were quite good as supporting charactersi have to dedicate a paragraph for vera farmiga and patrick wilson i have seen their movies as separate lead actors but their chemistry as a couple is really powerful you actually see the love affection blind trust and deep bonds that even the real life warrens might not have had they did a stellar job in this part of as the first one and the movie was as much about their love than it was about the poltergeistcoming to the actual horror in the movie the poltergeist valak is an actual documented demon but its not marilyn manson dressed as a nun or even sharon needles see the resemblancevalak is actually depicted as taking the form of a disfigured child with wings which might have been scarier i thinkthat was one miss from james wan he does admit that the design of the main demon was actually done at the 11th hour but there are a couple of sequences involving the valak that are done quite well and a large part of the credit goes to vera farmigathe other small part i didnt like was the screen time of 2 hours 14 minutes  i think the movie could have been edited down to lesser it felt a little long and sluggish at timesbut other than that the movie was great it was crafted well jump scares were actual jump scares rather than just loud noises and the story was really well knit together i would continue to pay money to watch good horror movies on a big screen  its where it looks and sounds the best first reviewed on broth of blogs,astonish
this is not a documentary it amazes how many professionalarmchair critics bias their reviews of a movie like this because of their enormous and unwavering skepticism of the paranormal the real life investigators the warrens and approach this thing as though it is making a definitive case on the real life incidentthis movie is a fictionalization of a reported hauntingpossession in the midseventies in england if you seek information about the event there are documentaries and news accounts available for perusaldirector james wan follows his hit 2013 and brings back patrick wilson and vera farmiga as the warrens a reallife controversial husband and wife paranormal investigative team the two are the grounding and in the film are there for comfort and joy like singing a love song to the family being harassed as well as church envoys to validatethe expected horror tropes are here but crafted with detail and articism to make it a scary movie that seems to be unusually praised by both the public and critics its wans attention to detail and rich characterization that set the thing apart from the dtv and other offerings of the genre that come and go with jump scares and little elseits an above average horror movie in every respect an alist accomplishment with bmovie trappings one thing for sure wan has possessed the boxoffice and procritics and most likely they will need an exorcist to release them from his ,astonish
absorbing and well crafted horror film if you looked into the real story over the years with great care director james wan touches on soooo much of the already documented research the way the kids lookbehave maurice the researcher the constables the way the townhouse is layed out and its decaying condition  almost exactly like its event from the 1970s then yes he adds ampedup effects and situations that didnt happen to make a fun film and very aggressive wan employs excellent alluring cinematography with the situations careful shadows and kinetic editing that cares about his characters  sets up the wicked scares you must watch this in widescreen or you miss a lot wan also takes his time and some may complain about a few slow spots but i enjoyed it a strong film predominately bc of the talented james wan,astonish
very briefly summarized oldfashioned and good horror movie i might also add that this sequel is just as good as its predecessor but there is a but the film begins very well mother and children in a house where it happens scary stuff many wellused but effective effects makes you cringe properly several times just like we will have a good horror movie i also think it is a good choice to move the story from the us to london it breaks well with the first film unfortunately i think the last part of the film is not as good unfortunately the story is too complicated and horror effects become too exaggerated in my opinion i also think the end the settlement with evil was something strange but this film is not bad in any way i only wish it would hold the suspense up all along nevertheless this is one of the better ones in its genre and it will probably continue to entertain fans of such movies so well see what happens on the third film i guess there will be several films to follow,astonish
following the cases of ed and lorraine warren two psychic investigators this sequel pits the duo against a demonic entity haunting a small enfield home in london despite lorraines worry that their jobs put them in harms way ed is still eager to save desperate families from their spiritual issues and they are convinced by the church to head to england to assess the hodgsons case is it fact or fiction this is the question that the film threatens to delve down and if anything is the theme that could be of most interest it is a different angle to other horror movies and could tip it to being more advanced then your typical scarefest however that theme is never developed and the story slowly evolves back into the less original frights the story is slow moving with the warrens failing to really get involved until half way through and actually isnt really very scary when we start to unravel what the demon is it becomes a little laughable making it less terrifying than it should have been the performance of madison wolfe is a saving grace for this problem however as the possessed child she brings a frightening presence more so than what the demons do there are many good moments but it never delves as deep as what it should have done if the warrens were brought in earlier we could learn more about the family and the demons and understand more of what is disturbing lorraine warren however we have two stories that collide when it is convenient for the plot characters are also too slow to react to situations for instance a screaming toy fire truck fails to wake a house of three sleeping children and solutions come by too easily mainly through asking questions james wan is well known for his horror entries and to be fair his direction and choice of shots are chilling however he struggles with the emotional moments the soft score during these scenes is out of place and off tone these moments are required but are not helped by being forced home franchise is a step up from many horror films but this second entry could have gone further and never really does so,astonish
review this movie did take some time to get going but once the plot unfolds its nearly as good as the first movie im glad that the director got the same actors to play lorraine vera farmiga and ed warren patrick wilson because the movie wouldnt have worked without them the chemistry between the 2 actors is brilliant and there demonising skills are truly remarkable they never seem to panic under pressure so when they get the call about a family in enfield england who have a demon taking over the daughters body they are straight on the case with the media watching the house the pressure is really on the couple from america who struggle to believe that there is paranormal activity happening in the house the single mother peggy hodgson frances oconnor tries everything to save her young daughter janet madison wolfe whilst struggling to pay for the roof over her head and to feed her children after seeing a tape of janet faking an episode ed  lorraine decide to leave london but lorraine can feel that something is wrong they then decide to go back to the house and what they witness is truly out of this world basically you have to watch the movie especially as its based on true events to see the true impact of what the poor family had to go through the bonus material is also pretty creepy because you get to see the surviving family members who say that the movie is very close to the events that happened in 1977 anyway although i preferred the original i still enjoyed this film and you cant help rooting for the family who definitely wouldnt have made it without the help of lorraine  ed warren enjoyableroundup im so glad that the director of the first movie james wan 39 returned for this sequel because he really did a great job in terms of bringing the warrens cases to the bring screen and the intensity in both films where brilliant at such a young age wans first project saw which was released in 2004 made headlines in the movie world and then he went on to direct death sentence dead silence insidious 12 the original and fast  furious 7 his next project is the highly anticipated aquaman with jason momoa playing the lead so he certainly doesnt shy away from big budget projects with the success of franchise and fast  furious 7 being the 6th biggest movie of all time he certainly has achieved a lot so early in his career and im sure that 3 if there is one will be just as successful as the previous moviesbudget 40million worldwide gross 3702millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their horrormysterythrillers starring patrick wilson vera farmiga madison wolfe frances oconnor simon mcburney maria doyle kennedy franka potente and simon delaney 710,astonish
came out in the year 2013 it was a supernatural horror movie based on a real life incident set in the 1970s and it focused on the efforts of the demonologists ed warren and lorraine warren to help a distressed family get rid of an evil spirit which had possessed one of the family members the movie had its scary moments and was fun to watch from the start to the finish received rave reviews from both critics and fans alike and was a commercial success this left the audience craving for a sequel and after the release of the somewhat disappointing spinoff movie called annabelle the developers finally released the sequel called 2 this year in 20162 is a very similar movie to the first movie and follows a similar plot line the movie is set three years after the first and once again a family in distress is haunted by an evil spirit in their place of residence in england the family begs for help for ed and lorraine warren to help them after it is obvious that the local authorities or the priests could not control the situation what separates this plot line from the first movie is that this particular job is more personal for lorraine and ed warrenmuch like this movie is based on a real life case although it has been glorified for theatrical and dramatic reasons to engross the audience this movie actually comes off as more scary than the first movie because the spirit or demon in this movie seems far more powerful and dangerous than the one the prequel and there is more focus on the horror sections as compared to the first movie the first movie did very well due to its dramatic performances from the lead actors and comparatively was not that scaryperformance wise the cast does really well vera farmiga and patrick wilson are almost perfect for the role of lorraine and ed warren respectively and give their best effort madison wolfe who plays the possessed girl janet also performs very well in her role frances oconnor who plays the role of the mother of the children also does an excellent job of playing the role of a mother who is traumatized with what has happened the rest of cast also gives a commendable effortthe sound effects of the movie are done remarkably well as they add to the horror element of the move and intensifies the scary moments in the movie to engage and gripe the audience and this results in many nerveracking moments throughout the entire movie the movie is not heavy on special effects or gimmicks the special effects are just on point and the creepy background and demonic voices only add to the horror element of the moviemy main problem with the movie would be with the length the movie goes longer than 2 hours and somewhat drags by the time it reaches the climax the movie drags on so long is because of the heavy involvement of the media in it some people in the media were hell bent on proving that the family was faking the incident this movie could have done without these sectionsoverall 2 is a great supernatural horror movie and a great follow up to its predecessor nowadays movie sequels hardly deliver and are more of a cash grab that is not the case with as the movie is arguably almost as good as or even better than the first movie and in many instances also creepier than the first movie this is a must watch for anyone who likes to watch horror movie it would be a mesmerizing experience from the start to the finish,astonish
i was surprised to see this movie was rated slightly higher than the original and even more surprised at some of the reviews saying it was a masterpiece and one of the best horror sequels ever then i started reading more reviews and saw more people saying what i felt it just wasnt very good or scary the set up of the movie took way too long the warrens dont become involved until over the first hour mark and the movie overall couldve been trimmed down the old man imo simply wasnt scary enough and the nun demon lost her luster as well the first movie was scary as hell and had a good story this one missed the mark and it seemed they were trying real hard to scare us the long stick man was cringe worthy i held in high regard but this sequel brought the series down,astonish

2james wan is a genius im just going to throw that out there he builds tension like alfred hitchcock he enjoys the long shot similar to martin scorsese there was a different style of horror in this film and it seems to have drawn its inspiration from hideo nakatas ringu by that i mean he plays with the audience building up all of this uneasy feeling only to have ultimately nothing happen without feeling empty inside you feel shaken and scarred emotionally ive said it before that james wan does perfect jump scares to get you when you least expect it and to leave you wanting more when you do expect it he never gives you the scare when youre expecting it thoughenough fanboying over james wan lets move on to vera farmiga who plays again lorraine warren wife to ed warren vera is super expressive which is probably why scorsese picked her up for the departed patrick wilson must have done something to make james wan want him in so many of his films im sure i have my research cut out for me to find out why hes okay at acting but i believe its wans direction that really helps him out i say that since i didnt enjoy his acting in watchmen passengers or bone tomahawk and i loved bone tomahawkmadison wolfe is going to be a star oh wait she already is you probably just dont recognize her yet shes phenomenal as the possessed child seriously look up the movies shes been in because of the wonderful writing in the film this has made me actually want to go watch house of wax one of the films ive avoided because of paris hilton carey hayes wrote both films and another film i liked called whiteout2 is easily one of the best horror movies this year and could be considered one of the best horror sequel scream 2 being up there along with halloween ii aliens being my favorite horror sequelverdict watch with someone who scares easily if the name james wan doesnt make you want to watch this movie then would it help if i called him a young stephen king john carpenter or wes craven,astonish

when i heard about 2 i didnt know what to thinki thought it would be good and i thought it wouldnt but when i went to see it with my father as a sort of present as he left to go to england for workthe first 30 minutes was so creepyi knew id like it and after about 150 minitesi loved it this film was a lot scarier than the first moviethe jump scares were more scarier although some were a bit predictable i loved the acting like the first film and i just have one thing to get out of the way that i didnt like about itcgi this film had really bad effects but that doesnt mean it was terrible and i didnt think about it till my dad said it had a lot of bad effects and i thought that was what was annoying about the film but i still loved it like the first film 2the enfield poltergeist is a really brilliant horror film starring patrick wilsonvera farmigia and bonnie aarons and frances oconor 710,astonish
recently i had gotten the time to watch the sequel to 2 2016 which by the trailers didnt quite look too par after speaking with a lot of our followers and friends about the film we decided to go for it since we enjoyed the first onei was told how scary this film was though it did have its moments but honestly i think part one was scarier many things rang a bell while watching as the layout and formatting of the film seem to coincide with the first as well but 2 2016 is certainly a great sequel i tend to see things in film that tend to get missed spots like the stage hands in green suites walking around etc yes i saw a few of them though it doesnt stand outthe brass tax of it all 2 2016 turned out to better than i had expected and that made me happier to see i do believe they done great all the way through the film from start to finish in keeping the story moving with the vibe the build was perfect definitely ill buy 2 2016 when it lands on dvd,astonish
i watched before its sequel and to be honest although the first movie is scary based on its aspects the film sometimes fails to deliver a good jumpscare then when i found out 2 just last year i didnt want to watch it because i thought it would just recycle everything from its prequel but when i got the chance to actually watch it i left my seat smiling and scared i called my mom to accompany me to a few dark spots around my house because i was too scared which is embarrassing since im 16manages to turn a true story into something amazing although at some point the film might have just a little clichs because you know whats gonna happen next but it was the jumpscares that stole the show because you never know when or where theyre gonna come out a minute an environment becomes scary then calm the next thing you know a demon jumps outta nowherethe cast was well acted especially the young madison wolfe who plays janet hogdson in the movie shes might be 12 or 13 during filming and without a doubt she can be an amazing actress in few years time if you expect 2 just to be your typical horror film no its not its a great horror film recommendation for any horror film fan and a great horror film for those teens who spends their nights with sleepovers while watching horror films 2 i may sound insane might be one of the best horror films ive watched and in the future might be one of the greatest horrors of all timejames wan does another excellent job i cannot wait for its sequel,astonish
2 is certainly a strong installment into the hopefully series following the further cases of ed and lorraine warren the film takes us through one of the most famous hauntings in history  the enfield poltergeist the scares in this film are genuine no cheap jump scares here with a particularly compelling story based on the true events that occurred in enfield england during the 70s the tension that builds up during scenes is quite incredible the imagery used to portray the demon that stalks the characters is pretty disturbingof course being a movie 2 takes liberties with the true story which is especially obvious during the films climax but the whole film is competent enough to suspend your disbelief i walked away and wanted to find out more about the true story which i recommend you look up not for the films sake but just because its an interesting story in itself overall a strong competent horror sequel with some genuine creepy thrills and a compelling story worth a watch,astonish

patrick wilson and vera farmiga return to play real life paranormal investigators ed warren and lorraine warren respectively this time they help a family in england who claim to have an evil spirit in their house wilson and farmiga are sent by the catholic church to investigate and prove the claim false or true and then let the church handle the rest but what the married investigators discover will force them to go beyond their tasked duties and put one of them at risk of a horrible deathmy most memorable movie moment of 2 is the lengthy opening sequence of the movie when wilson and farmiga are investigating what is famously known as the amityville horror this sequence is full of genuine frights setting the tone for the rest of the moviea true test of a horror movies worth is its ability to provide true scares and 2 passes that test with flying colors yes there is little here that most horror fans havent seen before but i dare you to watch this movie alone in the dark i started watching this in the dark at night with two people  after about 20 minutes we decided to turn on a few lightsmannysmemorablemoviemoments,astonish
my name is bill wilkins and i am 72 years old where you come from i come from the gravemy wife was asking me already for weeks if wed go watch lights out in the cinema now i really have no problem going to a cinema and watch a movie sitting in a cozy chair with a mega large popcorn and a maxi coke yet i wasnt so thrilled to go and see this one simply because my wife isnt such a fan of horror its a waste of money since my wife would watch it with her hands over her eyes all the time so we compromised what if we first tried 2 from what i had read lights out is much more intense and frightening than this sequel directed by james wan lets call it an assessment test based on this test ill decide whether or not well go and watch lights outwell my wife failed the test can you believe that but i have to admit something i was scared to death a few times this was actually my wifes fault whose screeching effortlessly exceeded that from an ordinary pig farm there are indeed some strategic and perfectly timed frights in this movie but overall i thought this film wasnt much better than its predecessor again ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga are asked for their assistance because theres somewhere a frenzied poltergeist whos driving a family nuts so again its a story based on true events sigh this time the story takes place in the united kingdom you can conclude the following not only in the us people are being haunted by restless souls and you can also state that there are civilians in the uk who make up such stuff due to lack of attention or intelligenceed and lorraine warren are notorious for their paranormal investigations but wont get off scotfree the stories of manipulations to get a bit of the media attention ensure that the label true events will be treated with some skepticism and also in this case better known as the entfield haunting were some rumors that the whole story was financially advantageous for this poor family theres one advantage though we also get a nice creepy horror once again and wan is also a master in finding the right balance for such a horror both seasoned horror fans as an occasional film viewer can find something to their liking in this film the dangerous frontier of excess is never exceeded so to speak again horror fans can prepare a comprehensive list of movies in which certain sequences of 2 were used already before in other words nothing new under the sunthe emphasis in this film lies on the threatening and gloomy atmosphere without introducing bloody and gore scenes this means that youll be treated to some eerie fragments with spooky shadows moving objects scary sounds banging on doors and even the manifestation of demonic possession you can certainly expect some successful horror moments they are as good as predictable so i could warn my wife in advance a waste of time anyway but the absence of such a shock moment is sometimes even more frightening despite its long running time the film holds you in its grip the full two hours not only by the eerie moments but also by the story about the interference of the church and the debacle about the veracity of ed and lorraineto be honest i thought this film met my expectations but didnt exceed the previous one the demonic nun was more funny than frightening bill wilkins however will scare the sht out of you the cast was sublime and not because of their performances but because of their resemblance to the original persons who experienced this event and if you dont believe me you can check the original bbc documentary about the entfield haunting furthermore the environment where everything happened looked gorgeous a true vintage look with elements from the 70s and everything was portrayed impeccably for horror fans this is definitely a must im sure well see a bunch of similar films because ed and lorraine have compiled a whole series of similar disturbing incidents be my guest id saymore reviews here  httpbitly1kidqmt,astonish
a nerve wrecking 2 hour of gut wrenching horror packed with alarming scaring scenes this was suggested to me by flickstreecom an awesome website to discover movie and giving you option to watch the movie online they also have personalized suggestion feature which suggest you movies according to your mood anyways coming back to the movie it is well made as the original and is engaging enough to keep things interesting as a movie enthusiast i liked the bone chilling individual moments in the movie compared to the first film there were slightly less scares but the movie had a good premise balanced with interesting characters and that is something that i really liked about it the plot is amazing and organized the scenes in the beginning is always connected to the scenes in the end i strongly recommend to watch out this movie and the flickstreecom website too,astonish
a coworker knows i enjoy horror and told me to watch the enfield haunting on hulu i never got around to it so when 2 came out and i saw that it was about the same hauntings in england i was optimistic that this would be good unfortunately for me it was just okayi thought i had watched the first but couldnt remember anything about it so thats never a good sign i should have thought about this before watching the second one there was nothing wrong with the movie it just did nothing for me spoilers ahead although not really because what im going to talk about happens early on in the movie and its just going to be vaguethe evil looking nun was there for jump scares and to highlight the church and that the warrens need to defer to it when getting involved in these cases i really didnt see what else she was needed for the old man in the chair was a bit creepy even before the hauntings began though i would have put the chair to the curb and painted the wall behind it since both were disgusting the relationship that the warrens had with each other was nice and i believed the love that they felt for each other and it amused me that they just leave their daughter when they go on these long trips where is she by herself at home with a relative to me the daughter seemed like an afterthoughtif you are really into movies about hauntings i would say give this one a watch but otherwise skip it,astonish
after everything weve seen there isnt much that rattles either of us anymore but this one this one still haunts me after investigating the possession of the amityville house affects their lives in ways they cant shake ed wilson and lorraine farmiga warren decide to end their career of investigation after a similar event happens in england the church asks them to travel to the house and decide if the church should get involved what they find is more terrifying than either has experienced but are struggling to find proof that the events are real i was actually looking forward to this movie i am not a big fan of horror or more specifically gore but i did like the first one as well as annabelle the type of movies that creep me out are the ones that are more psychological and feel as if they could really happen this is one of those movies it did get a little repetitive but the tenseness and creepy aspects really worked throughout and the movie did make me feel uneasy at times it is becoming clear that horror movie directed by james wan will be tense and really what horror should be creepy and disturbing without cutting people up or trying to hard the relaxed pace and feel really adds to the overall tenseness and i recommend this for horror movie fans overall one of the best horror movies to come out since the original i give this a b,astonish

it is always fascinating to learn about supernatural events and to think about it it can be tempting to fantasise that ghosts might be realso here we have a ghost story a family in uk reports some supernatural incidents it is all centered around janet who speaking with a gutural voice etc everyone can interpret the story in his own way but most likely two girls who needed attention faked a ghost story to get attention there is no proof of levitation must likely they jumped and everybody who listened to death metal knows that it is possible to work on a gutural voice so far the true storywhat hollywood made out of it was again a good vs evil story there is the demon valek who already before the incidents happened was connected to the warrens ed painted a picture of valek and lorraine had visions of eds death so the couple investigates the case and first we assume it is the ghost of bill who died in that house who wants the family be gone later it turns out that the main evil being is of course valek who is an evil demon and we have all the classical stereotypes crosses that turn over the crucifix as a main weapon against evil etc until in the end valek can be cast out as lorraine knew his namein my opinion the storyline was dull the 6 points are justified by the suspense and the characters i really found scenes scary and surprising,astonish
after over 3 decades of watching horrors i know better than to watch trailers or expect something oscarworthy 3 hours ago i went into 2 expecting nothing but standard horror fare and hoping that the movie would not be as ridiculously awful as insidious iii which was laughable at best and although it did have a few strong points i felt that i just had to share my experience with those who have not seen it yet first of all as hinted in the title ive been laughing like crazy for nearly 2 hours straight now you see if you want your horror film to impress and scare the viewer there are a few mistakes you simply must not make it does not help however when the demon appears in the form of a nun that bears a striking resemblance to marilyn manson on a bad makeup day i was willing to look past that despite the laughing fits every time the nun was shown but then came the crooked man who in addition to being very badly made and looking completely fake looked rather similar to jim carrey in the mask so there was no need for any comic relief as there already were plenty of opportunities to laugh yet such relief was still deemed necessary not to mention a pointless scene with patrick wilson imitating elvis and singing probably intended to be funny and  or moving and an awkwardly scripted negotiation sequence between wilson and the demonanother issue is the fact that 2 lifts a lot from other mostly better movies i mean whats the deal with the tent inside the house how many movies have used this idea since the others boring and utterly clich then there are the toy scenes stolen straight from poltergeist pick your part the possession sequences inspired by the exorcist and numerous other inspirations that was the very first thing i noticed and that bothered meof course it is never helpful when a horror relies too much on computer generated effects and bland repetitive jump scares this is always a negative and most modern horrors look silly as a resultare there some positives sure the camera work is skillful enough and colors are used efficiently to create the right mood and atmosphere but thats just about iton the whole i am certain that i will never want to see this movie again there are simply too many better ones out there especially the cult classics if on the other hand you are willing to look past the major flaws that 2 suffers from then it might be worth watching especially if youre a fan of jim carrey or marilyn manson,astonish
i enjoyed this movie because there were a lot of jump scares and i like to be scared like that i liked the suspense in the movie and i liked the actors they played their parts well some parts were scarier than others i didnt feel scared after the movie which was good for me i liked this movie better than the first one while they were both good the second one scared me just a little bit more i like how they have the same couple starring in both of the movies and how the second movie is like a continuation of the first movie i also liked how both of the movies were based off of a true story it makes it scarier i felt interested in the movie the whole time while watching it i never wanted to take my eyes off the screen even during the scary parts,astonish
2the biggest difference between american and british ghosts is the latter stops haunting you at teatimehowever this horror movie doesnt divulge if its phantoms take 1 lump or 2amityville experts ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson vera farmiga are dispatched by the vatican to investigate a demonic possession across the pondhowever lorraine is hesitant in helping a mum frances oconnor rid her daughter madison wolfe of a demon due to a prophetic dream she had involving eds deathwhile she eventually agrees to participant the case it self may not be as supernatural as they first thoughtbased on one of britains most notorious hauntings this somewhat factual sequel is enhanced by the ambiguity of the enfield occurrences themselves meanwhile the reprising leads remain magnetic and the scares are more mature than most furthermore once brexit kicks in mostly all of englands ghosts are going to emigrate green lightvidiotreviewsblogspotca,astonish
some spoilers i wont go into the synopsis as you can read that elsewhere i loved the first one and although this one isnt bad some choices in story and directing spoil what could have been a solid sequel first off choosing this case to base a film must have seemed good on paper and the attention to detail for the time period is top notch however a small terrace house in england just feels a little insignificant and low budget compared to the first this is enhanced by linking it to amityville not that they should have done amityville as we have seen that done so many times before but to relate it too possibly the most infamous haunting ever then flash to a two up two down council house feels odd what more having same daemon responsible for both makes no sense the film has a good atmosphere with a sense of dread throughout but again where the old man and the nun daemonare genuinely creepy they go and spoil it with the crooked man character a creature so silly and out of place in the film more suited to pans labyrinth or the muppets than this movie not to mention the dubious cgi a little subtlety would have been better even using a deformed version of the old man ghost would have been effective and made sense within the context of the film the acting script and directing are otherwise solid apart from a few unnecessary odd camera sweeps which makes it a shame that these few errors in judgement detract from which could be a worthy successor to the first film,astonish
wow jameswan plotted this remarkable story according to his planwhat an outstanding sound effects along with horrifying scenes while talking about story line story was superb and fascinated ed and lorraine made this film outstanding and demon nun was one of the most elagantly horrified character i have ever had watch soundtracks were great which were according to their time i must say this is the most scariest movie which was brought in after james wans trademark visual style is repeated in this movie  his bag of tricks sometimes yielding a sense of deja vu but generally working like a charm when its intended to scare it really does the scares come a bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build a lot of tension even if youve seen the original so well done to wan for that,astonish
this movie was more scary than i thought and i was sleeping with my lamp on after watching this movie but i did have a few issues with it though the first issue i had was the cartoonish cgi crooked man i dont even understand the point of him when i saw him the first and second time i laughed because it looked like cheap cgi and basically like a cartoon not scary the second issue was the fact that the demon had the child fake a scene in order to get them to leave but the entire plan of the demon was to kill ed so why try to get them to leave in the first place my third issue was that based on the original true case there was no demon controlling the ghost the demon was entirely made up also ed and lorraine warren only spent a day there in real life and really had nothing to do with the investigationi already concluded while watching the movie that many things were exaggerated or made up for flair like the demon throwing lorraine up against the wall towards the end and the crooked man and all but i guess it makes for a good scary movie if you dont take into account the actual real events,astonish
there are many reviews on here that try to tell us that we dont need these formulaic things and that we have grown tired of the same old nonsense that we crave something different im here to say that those reviews should speak for themselves i for one am a cinema goer and film watcher when i go to see a particular type of film its because i want to feel a certain way whether thats excited moved horny or scared experience therefore tells me what to expect but and here is the big butit doesnt tell me how ill receive it or when to receive it in other words i may well have seen it all before but that doesnt make it any less enjoyable after first watching i loved it so much i watched two more times within a year it was good old classic scare without the gore i hoped they would make a 2nd one and was excited when it came round 2 is more of the first but told in a different way with different scares and different ohdearinearlycrappedmepants moments its good old classic scares without the gore that peppers so many of what passes for todays horrors it takes the same formulas that made the first one so good and adds a few more in for good measure its length allows the story to be told first from the the childrens perspective and then adds in the main characters for those that havent seen the first one we are given a brief synopsis of what they do and how they do it rather like the opening set piece of an action hero at the beginning of an action film we are then taken on what i consider to be an emotional ride through the ordeal of the young girl i felt for her i really did i felt for the mother who not only had to watch her children helplessly be tormented by the goings on the house but also had her own worries of trying to keep her home and deal with the schools allegations of one of her childrenall as a single mum i felt for each if the girls siblings as they tried to do what they could to protect their sister from something they could not possibly explain then of course theres the two main characters battling their own demons as well as trying to save a family from theirs the tension is built up through the bonds the viewer has formed for the main characters so that when the scares happen you feel like youre in the room with them theres no obvious cgi the sun isnt always shining and there are no obvious dispensable characters its a simple horror film that scared me witlessmore of the same please,astonish
was a welcome return to oldschool scares  vintage thrills for it drew upon the style of 1970s chillers abstracted horror from its foreboding atmosphere and eliminated uncalled violence tiresome gore  mindless killings from the equation to deliver some genuine frights to its viewers and also solidified james wans status as one of the finest talents around when it comes to mainstream horror2 adopts the same formula bringing another one of ed  lorraine warrens cases to cinematic life by building upon the solid groundwork paved by the first chapter it may feel like a repeat of the same phenomena all over again but there is more to this movie the way it handles its characters and stages some genuinely effective moments of unrelenting terror are few of the many positives in a sequel thats arguably better than its predecessorset in enfield london around 1977 the story of 2 unfolds at the hodgson residence where all the members of the family begin experiencing escalating events of poltergeist activities with police failing to offer any solution and britains own paranormal investigators arguing over the legitimacy of the case the familys desperate plea for help is answered by two people across the atlantic who travel all the way to help the family and collect evidence on behalf of the churchcowritten  directed by james wan who certainly knows a thing or two about horror filmmaking 2 begins with a prologue that briefly covers the warrens most infamous case the amityville haunting and fills the sequence with elements that plays a key role in their next assignment the plot then moves to 1970s london where the main premise is set and an ominous atmosphere is quickly established thus allowing the terror to surface early into the story and it only escalates from that point onwardsif was an amalgamation of all the skills wan had acquired over the years then 2 is an even more refined exhibition of his talents and presents the australian filmmaker in complete control of his craft many sequels suffer from their inability to keep the freshness of the original alive but by setting its plot in a different continent and adding believable characters into the mix the script helps eliminate that issue for this film not to mention that the story is lean and packs one expertly staged scary moment after anotherits visual design is in tune with the first film but there are a few enhancements the cold colour palette conjures up a darker tone than before and londons overcast weather further magnifies it camera is utilised as per the requirements of the scene opting for slow movements when silence permeates every frame and turning all the more chaotic when terror reigns supreme editing gives its story a tightlyknitted structure and ingeniously paces it while joseph bishara returns with another illomened score and last but not the least its sound design is impeccablecoming to the performances 2 finds patrick wilson  vera farmiga reprising their respective roles of ed  lorraine warren and their chemistry once again turns out to be the core ingredient that helps viewers invest in their story not to mention that their onscreen relationship has a very genuine  heartwarming feel to it amongst the new cast frances oconnor sells her characters despondency brilliantly simon mcburneys input has a calm demeanour to it while madison wolfe balances her act accordingly to deliver an outstanding performanceon an overall scale 2 is another gem of horror filmmaking from james wan and is a worthy  welcome addition to both its franchise  its genre sequels are often no match to their predecessors and the number is even lesser when it comes to horror flicks thus making wans latest effort all the more commendable as before a few moments still come off as unintentionally hilarious than frightening but there is less of that shortcoming in this sequel in short 2 is mainstream horror at its most thrilling  effective and is one of those rare sequels that improves upon its predecessor highly recommended,astonish
this is what it looks like when you take a decent script and put it in the hands of a highly skilled and experienced director in the prime of his careerjames wan directed the first saw movie as well as and the insiduous movies he also directed furious 7 and is currently working on aquaman it almost seems like he is showing off in this movie it seems like he is having fun and pulling all his tricks out with confidence and ease to make a movie that is just plain awesomethis is one of those movies that could have been terrible with the wrong director the script really isnt anything all that special it works but there is nothing terribly new and original here and the resolution to this movie is so bad it made me laugh out loud spolier this big powerful demon is terrorizing this family throughout the movie and lorraine is able to destroy it by saying his name and guess what the demon told her what his name is oops i guess the demon didnt think that one through very well to be scared of this demon for over an hour and then see the whole problem solved because she simply says his name after he told her what it is was kind of a let down for me but then again were talking about demons here so its all kind of silly to begin with and there really isnt any solution that would make much logical sensethat being said i dont really watch a movie like this for the plot i watch it for the horror and this movie has lots of it they used a clever plot device that the demon is hiding by acting through other spirits this gives the director a chance to use a wider variety of techniques and keeps things interesting its clear that james wan really knows what he is doing and he plays with everything from cgi to stopmotion to jumpscares and creepy sound effects he has a lot of tricks in his bag and it makes for a movie with some great sceneshe is especially good and using cinematography and color grading to darken areas of the frame just enough that you cant quite make out what youre looking at i cant think of many other directors who do this as often and as well but it really worksanother scene i really love is the one with lorainne by herself where the painting comes to life scenes like that are so cool so well directed and so scary that they are instant classics in my opinion if i were teaching a class on the greatest scenes in horror films there are a few in this movie that would make the listpatrick wilson and vera farmiga are no strangers to horror films besides being in both movies and the insiduous movies vera was also played the mom in orphan another great horror film i think they were well cast and do a good job playing ed and lorraine this movie relies heavily on child actors which can be tough but they all do a great job the main girl who plays janet is really the main character in this film and she does an admirable job i found it somewhat unconvincing at times when she was doing the different demon voices but i dont think that is her faultif you are a fan of horror you will love this movie dont go in expecting a great story but you can expect to see a really scary movie with a director who has become a master of his craft and is really given an opportunity here to do what he does best,astonish
i thought this was decent enough it pretty much follows the same formula as the first film but honestly this did not need to be over two hours long they overdo the setup in the first hour theres so much repetitiveness in its jump scares and horror scenes by the time the second hour does come along it also overdoes it to an even larger extent a lot of scenes kept making me roll my eyes it also seems that despite wanting to make patrick wilsons character more important it managed to restrict vera farmigas character despite following much of the formula of the original film this still felt really cluttered and messy it spins its wheels a lot despite the many criticisms i have of it it did manage to entertain me i dont think the original film is entirely greatness by any means but it was still better than this,astonish
let me start by saying that 2 is a very entertaining movie that is well worth a watch however it doesnt have that instant horror classic feel that the first one did one of the main differences in this movie was that there was much more effort put into special effects and trying too hard to make the evil characters creepy at times it felt a bit like i was watching the first insidious movie with the bad guys caked in makeup and always making quick jerking motions the second movie also doesnt have that same sense of dread and realism that the first one has rather it feels as though i am just watching a well made horror movie this takes away from the actual lingering fear that there was so much of in the first movie it seems as though to try to combat this more jump scares were added which im not a huge fan of even though some of the jump scares in this were top notch and even managed to catch me off guard the build up in the first was phenomenal as the movie starts off completely normal and you feel as nothing can wrong this movie however starts right off the bat by showing you evil entities which takes away from the buildup and prepares you for whats to come it feels like a very cheap start that is just paying homage to the first movie and flaunting the fact that ed and loraine deal with big bad evil spirits so to summarize it didnt give that same sense of sheer horror that the first one managed to but its still an unsettling film that has high entertainment value,astonish
i really enjoyed the first i thought it was well done in every aspectit was suspenseful and scary and the music was used to good effectthe acting was very good as wellhowever2 blows the original out of the waterits its more suspensefulunnerving and scarymost so called horror movies dont usually scare mebut this one had me thinking about leaving before it was overbecause it was so intensehoweveri stayed to the endi can honestly say that this is not only one of the best horror movies i have seen in yearsit is also one of the best movies period i have seen in yearsfor me 2 is a 1010,astonish
2 achieved something rare for a horror movie be the same level or better than its predecessor which is very good the first spoke about the case of harrisville united states a couple moves to a new house next to his five daughters to inexplicably strange events begin to frighten children the father and especially the mother already that the plot is based on the case enfield poltergeist recorded at the end of the 1970s the beginning of the film is very good and very interesting we has a notion of the lorraine warren can do the cast is back vera farmiga who indulges in the role she is excellent patrick wilson this very well also madison wolfe steals the show whenever she is present on the screen it makes an excellent performance the cast still has frances oconnor simon mcburney  franka potente steve coulter etc the chemical patrick wilson with vera farmiga is excellent you what feel each character feels for the other the picture is very good and the direction of james wan to back this sequence is excellent he usually give some unpredictable scares even some being predictable but i took a lot scares the way the wan films is excellent it does some very good camera games some moments are very tense and the nun demonic gave me a lot fear and the soundtrack is eerie as well as the first the final scene i found good but was a little fast the script is good more is some very quick things in my opinion the film should be about 10 minutes more to better develop some things 2 is one of the best films of the year in my opinion is better than the first it gave me more scares and the villain was interesting to come 3 note 88,astonish
wow i cannot believe i am saying this but this ghost story is one of my favorite horror movies in the past several yearsim not a fan of ghost storieshaunted house tales maybe its a catholic thing no offense to the followers or religion itself but perhaps the reasons why priests and the catholic church are brought up in so many haunted flicks these kinds of true stories hit closer to home to that faith maybe thats why so many followers are scared of these possession flickspersonally i dont believe in the roaming spirits so i am not frightened by any of these types of movies including this one but i do believe in trying to broaden my horizons so a few years ago i gave the infamous ghost trilogy a shot these included the most popular haunted movies sinister and insidious truthfully i wasnt a fan myself of any of the three and most of them blended in so much i couldnt tell you which was whichthat said i do recall i cared a tad bit more for the ethan hawke one i believe that one was named sinister that one i did like but only a bit more than the other two since again im not on board with these supposedly true event films i ended my openmindedness with the originals i wasnt about to waste my time with the sequels or spinoffs when i knew i would never fully enjoy themthis ended now i was convinced by a friend and enormously high ratings for 2 to finally sit down and watch it by far it surpassed its original tenfold and the other two tremendously in fact i can safely say this 1408 and original blair witch project are my favorite intentionally scary ghost moviesthe demonbusters of the 70s are back to coinvestigate an english estate that maymay not be possessed and if spooky the catholic church might step in to help but they might be too late by thenboy did i summarize this movie with zero spoilers i am proud of myself but it was easy this movie is pretty straightforward in regards to synopsis the real meat of the experience was the acting the heart and depth of the characters that was one major positivethe other for me was the fact that what started off as yet another clichd by the book haunted house movie quickly turned into a real movie an original take and ghosts that freaking did stuff most of it blew me away and i liked the ghosts out of the shadows finally it wasnt a movie so reliant on showing barely any movement until the endsure they say less is more in horror but damnit thats so overdone by now i really want to see something i want the other characters to see the same thing as well and this movie delivered in spades after about 20 minutes or so the action if you can call it that in this kind of film was well thoughtout and inventive the characters namely our favorite demonbusters made us really care about them and the ending was exactly how i wanted it to play out selfish but thats what i like to see and not the same ole finale most horror filmmakers think is still original and wantednot only would i recommend this movie i would just say skip that ghost trilogy i spoke about and just watch this again i cant speak for the almost countless sequels and spinoffs but i can say this beats any original any day of the weekfinal thoughts chris you owe me a new phone no you know exactly what i am talking about pay up,astonish
i dont watch as many movies anymore as i used to as i am approaching 36 i have been watching movies for about 25 years now i kind of seen it all and i dont want to waste my time on general boring movies anymore therefore i only select movies that score higher than a 7 in my segment male 30 and an interesting trailer2 matched both these criteria but i really dont see how this movie is incredibly boring predictable and uninteresting there is really nothing new or interesting here that you havent seen before elsewhere especially the first part is so boring and repetitive child sits alone in chamber child sees  hears something unusual child runs to mummy mummy sees nothing skip to next scene rinse repeat for about four times before we move along then the americans come in now the action gets more various but mostly its so fake and bad cgi you cant really take it seriouslyso i dont know i dont see how this movie could score so high here on imdb i guess film makers are hiring click farms in low cost countries more and more to pump up the scores causing the imdb scores to become rigged very annoying ill give this movie a 1 to counter balance those fake scores its not really that bad but not that great either a 50 would be a realistic score imoif you want to see some good interesting horror scary movies  series watch the exorcist the exorcism of emily rose the xfiles supernatural poltergeist the grudge 1 paranormal activity 1 or the blairwitch project youll be way more entertained than with this crap,astonish
james wan is back to direct a second tale depicting paranormal researchersghost hunters ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga warren but is it as scary as synopsis in the 1970s ed and lorraine travel to england to investigate a haunting which locals refer to as londons amityville the good for the first hour 2 does almost everything right even though director james wan essentially uses the same horror buildups which lead to the same jumpscares and thus the same cranked up to 11 horror musical cues that he always does he does it all so well many may argue that wan has created his own official horror style a style which holds the highest rate of effectiveness in the genre its as though with every movie hes teaching a masterclass in cookiecutter horror direction but does it better and more effectively than anyone working today the bad little by little there emerges this love story aspect between ed and lorraine this love story is pushed along by some of the worst dialogue ive heard outside of a harlequin romance as this aspect moves to the forefront of the story it becomes more cringeinducing reaching the point where every time ed and lorraine pause turn and tell each other something unbearably lovey dovey i couldnt help but imagine that the latter half of 2 would essentially be the movie nicholas sparks would make if he tried his hand at the horror film genre along with said love story there also emerged another questionable aspect which stops this film dead in its tracks time and time again 2 becomes a religious film or at least contains a very religious undertone i understand that movies dealing with hauntings and exorcisms go hand in hand with priest and bible verses but this is different i would almost liken the religious undertones this film takes on to movies like do you believe fireproof or courageous films which seem like dramatic genre pieces but end up morphing into sunday school lessons this aspect isnt a bad thing on face value but much like the love story aspect wholesome religious rhetoric seems way out of place in a film of this nature that said there will be many who will be able to look past the sappiness and the sunday school level preaching but even if thats the case screenwriter carey hayes has one more surprise in store for those who reach the 2 hour mark an ending which in its own right is idiotically simplistic but whose explanation is so convoluted that as it begins i looked down at the time and recoiled in horror at how long id been sitting there final thought do you remember insidious chapter 2 i dont and looking back on my article i gave it a positive review thats what 2 is even if you enjoy this overlong british version of its predecessor just with more religious asides and a painfully sappy hallmark inspired love story crowbarred in at the end of the day itll still be a forgettable film,astonish
i really shocked and enjoyed the show in cinemas james wan was success to bring chill and horror to the audiences he is master in horror genre of hollywood movies and i have no doubt for this movie will fulfilled the audiences expectations james wan has been making a new hope for horror movie and its fans around the globe for me his work of making horror movie is always worthy to be wait but it will be hard to make the third part sequel for more higher expectations lets see what a shock surprised it will bethe movie intense in ed relationship and their work and yes the movie give me surprised every scene of it patrick wilson and vera were totally awesome so as a sequel from 2013 it was amazing movie overall you better bring or use a jacket in the cinemas,astonish
usually when you go to see a horror sequel its the villainmonster that youre being treated to another viewing of 2 is a rare exception where it is the protagonists who are the constant sadly this equals less guarantee of quality because its unlikely that they are what made the first one great was a brilliant horror film the intensity story and thrills were all of the highest quality and the result was one of the finest horror films ever made so the sequel had a lot to live up to could it do it not quitethe first thing youll notice is an extended run time 133 minutes is long for a horror movie a lot of time is spent setting the mood with a very patient build up taking place for me this could have been cut back a bit as it was a little slow at times and one or two scenes felt unnecessary james wan is a fantastic director who usually paces a film exquisitely so i suspect this had more do with the script than anything elsethe main thing it lacks that the original achieved so well though is a genuine concern for the characters in the film the spooky middle of nowhere atmosphere created in the original is nowhere to found here and that takes away a lot of intensity from the film the characters of ed and lorraine also feel too in charge this time around and are portrayed more as heroes than regular people this also goes a long way to destroying the level of discomfort the audience should be experiencing there are some good frights here and there and some genuinely creepy visuals but it all feels short of the high expectations the original created and that sums it up in a lot of ways its not a bad film it just cant live up to what we had all hoped for,astonish
are you trying to give me a heart attackyou want to talk scary this is scary 2013 wan came out with another horror movie called it didnt take long before it got hailed as one of the best new horror movies and i couldnt help but agree i hadnt found a movie so scary in a long timethen i today went to the theaters to see the sequel i was hopeful despite the common onceisenough rule when it comes to horror movies but i gotta say this movie was fantastic i loved it even more than the first one first off if theres anything wan knows how to do its an opening scene if youre not invested from the start its a little harder to get into a movie meant to be frightening but he succeeds with exactly that and i feel exhausted before the title scroll even has shown up the story when you think about it is pretty similar to the first but with the big difference that not only the family with the haunted house in the danger ed and lorraine themselves are too and i have to give credit for how their characters were developed in this movie the movie delves very deep into the personalities of them with patrick wilson and vera farmiga doing an extraordinary job making them likable they are wellwritten not only as two people really passionate about their unusual profession but as a loving and caring couple as well the scenes where they show their affection for each other are superbbut of course im mainly here to talk about whether or not it was effective as a horror movie and it sure as hell was jumpscares or not when you think about it doesnt crooked man just scare the shit out of you and doesnt it feel disturbingly surreal when a girl suddenly gets the palest face and starts smiling evilly all while speaking with a rusty old mans voice and doesnt it make you uneasy when something simply supposed to be a painting comes to life2 is more than just the halfcreepyhalfamusing horror movie you watch and then forget about its an experience one that makes you speechless with wonder95 the rating is only knocked down by a few cheesy moments and very intermittent parts of off pacing i recommend it to anyone desperate for a revival in the genre because real horror is finally back,astonish
three years after he blew the doors off cinemas across the country with one of the biggest modern horror movies james wan comes back with a true sequel to aptly titled 2 often horror sequels try to get too big or too flashy and end up being far inferior to their predecessors 2 is certainly bigger and flashier but james wan has some gift for taking a generic storyline and making it scary as hell 2 takes place six years after the original film in enfield london its based on the enfield haunting one of the most welldocumented paranormal cases of all time and was labeled englands amityville in this haunting the hodgson family a single mother and her four children are being tormented by a spirit and call on several paranormal investigators to help them including ed and lorraine warren the case quickly turns into a media circus with allegations that the haunting may be a hoax and the warrens have to decide if the kids are playing an elaborate prank or if the hodgsons are living in a very real nightmare being a horror sequel or really just a movie sequel in general its expected that this movie is going to up the stakes and flashy imagery compared to the original film 2 is no different there really isnt a scene thats as brilliant as the hideandclap game with lili taylor from the first however at a staggering 134 minutes james wan packs in a ton of surprisingly durable scares after a great opening sequence wan gives us about 5 minutes to get acquainted with the hodgsons before already scaring us silly with the first night at the enfield house theres tons of agonizingly long tracking shots that ratchet up the tension for an incredibly long time whats great is that not all of these shots end with a jump scare be warned though because if there is a jump scare its perfect theres not a single cheap jump in this movie the scare scenes themselves are very long once one of those great tracking shots is done youll go to another person for an equally scary scene because theres so much suspense and so many scares in the movie the 134 minute running time never feels too long it feels just right although the scares might be exhausting by the end of the movie wan also has a knack for making an old scare new again he can somehow make a tired jump scare scary again but at the same time its not quite as fresh as it was the first time thats what holds back 2 from surpassing the original film 2 does have some heart though patrick wilson and vera farmiga are great as the married ghostbusters and the hodgson family is a likable group of people to hang out with for two and half hours madison wolfe steals the show as janet who gets put through the wringer throughout the whole movie even if it doesnt reach the heights of its predecessor 2 is an incredibly scary thrill ride thatll be hard to top this summer i do have to admit that i did scream very loudly once,astonish
the first insidious was good but the sequel was screechy and very b not this one imho is scarier than the originali wish theyd remake amityville because i cant remember watching amytyville horror this scaryremember those movies which had those scary bits that made you cower under a pillow but turned out being just a dream sequence well none of those here spoiler alert that transformers scene at the hodgsons neighbours house i was telling my wife naaah its just a dream but it isnt wait there are two dream sequences but they are more like visions than insignificant fake scaresthis is a winner get yourself scared less oh its 2 hours long but you wont feel itenjoy 2 as i have,astonish
what i did not likestarts with the same plot big family no money can accept this as they say it is based on a true story too many nights that show scary janet teleporting and it gets boring again ed and lorraine not wanting to want to take cases but they want to help a family the crooked man mechanical toy is boring and is nothing like the one used in and it is silly that the nun demon tells loraine her name and the name power is already old and is used in many moviesall in all skip this movie wait for the dvd if you really want to watch it people who have not watched might like this moviewhy i did not like1 set the bar too high i can still go back and enjoy the cupboard scene someone behind the door scene the game the ghost plays with the mother and the final exorcism was brilliant there was a story a logic this has nothing once out of the theater everything can be easily forgotten2 too much hype created for the movie and most of the good scenes are already in the trailer why 3 stars1 2 scares old man near the tv and the bed sheet getting thrown off janet did make me jump2 using the old man as a pawn was a good twist3 this time the ghost does everything is front of everyone thank god for that,astonish
485 james wan has crafted the greatest horror film ive ever seen and solidified himself as the new age master of horror ive never screamed out loud in sheer surprisefear before but i did watching today imagine the best elements of the exorcist poltergeist the amityville horror insidious and and you have this new age classic the camera work in this is absolutely astonishing and evokes pure tension throughout the atmosphere and lighting is executed perfectly the plot has several different aspects intertwining into a fantastic story overall the soundtrack is stunningly terrifying the demonic entities are the most frightening ive ever seen seriously if you are a fan of horror or just film in general you must see this i truly hope this franchise has several more movies because both films are amazing sometimes it takes a leap of faith to believe when no one else will ed warren,astonish
we loved it rarely is a sequel better than the original and 2 definitely delivers we were on the edge of our seats for most of the film i liked that the film wasnt one sided it gave room for skepticism the warrens werent there to convince anyone of the paranormal but to help the family this is definitely the first horror film i ever cried at not from fear though there was plenty of that but from the undeniable love between the warrens vera farmiga and patrick wilson have great chemistryanother first was after that breathetaking climax of an ending the audience in my theater gave a round of applause ive never seen that happen during a horror filmi can see franchise continuing for years to come when theyre this well directed produced and acted i know id love to see more about the warrens cases especially the amityville case,astonish
this is my first review here i am a frequent cinema goer and have to admit that i always hunt for genuine horror movies ive seen it all let me put it this wayi dont get scared easily this is the first movie that made me scream out loud in a cinema and the person next to me had the same reaction i guess you have to go and see it for yourself  editing is amazing acting is at its finest and storyline is genuine there is no dull moment in the whole movie and the scares and jumps are not cheesy and predictable some of them you would expect from a ghost movie but this tops it some elements can be found in other movies but the way this was edited makes a difference not to mention the fact that this story is based on actual events thats the most exciting part hope you guys enjoy it as much as i did,astonish
wow after watching my hopes were extremely satisfied then annabelle happened and i was very disappointed but then i saw in my list of verse movies that there was a so decided to give it a watch and i must say its very thrilling and insane in ways i would argue its even better than the first james wan returns to give us what this verse needs especially after the disappointment film that came before it i cant believe what james wan did here its truly yet another remarkable film to be looked at ive been watching all these movies in one viewing and all at the same day lol i cant believe how good this was i can go all dayacting 910script 910dialogue 810screenplay 810cinematography 810plot 810music 810overall james wan is very amazing cant believe how amazing this movie was the different use of characters and the twist all worked,astonish
i remember getting in the audi with my friends with a beleif that we will get scared and beleive it or not we were scared i love james wan the way he portrayed his cast and showed what audience expects no sudden moves or loud voice a crisp suspense all the time and jump scares which are new and breath taking why 9 because part 1 did had a story built up which was missing in this feature the way it should have been anyways this is called horror if you love something like this do also check insideous parts dead silence and saw again from james wan,astonish
decided to rewatch both films with memories of really liking both after watching and not liking all that much the nun which was watched as part of my watching as many films of 2018 as possible quest very recently just to see whether they held up as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where the nun didnt and didnt make that films mistakes on rewatch 2 like its very good predecessor does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered it succeeds splendidly in where the nun failed and has none of its mistakes 2 like its predecessor is not a perfect film but it is very atmospheric well made and genuinely scary or at least to me it was it is a very familiar premise done to death actually but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness as a sequel it fares very well and one of not many to actually be on the same level as its predecessor2 is overlong which is its biggest issue this would have been rectified by 20 minutes being trimmed and the pace of the first act with a beginning that doesnt attentiongrab or unsettle as it should have done tightened upother than those 2 is very good it looks great especially for horror films released in recent years too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap it looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting the music is haunting and not overbearing recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regardscript is not too awkward and is structured coherently with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour the direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material the story takes time to unfold but doesnt get dull once it gets going while the ending is leagues better much more momentum and the resolution didnt feel rushed as said too 2 yet again is genuinely scary with actual tension suspense and dread in a palmsweating and heartpounding sense at its best while not relying too much on jump scares they are there but have build up and were surprisingfound myself liking the characters more than expected the leads were ones worth caring for didnt get frustrated with them wish for more personality or annoyed by them the antagonist was frightening was neither overused or underutilised and didnt look cheap the acting also comes off well especially vera farmiga who is superb patrick wilson is even better here while also impressed with how frances oconnor coped with a role that on paper seemed limited summarising very good 810 bethany cox,astonish
horror movies and their plot lines escape mewait for the built up music and jump oooorrrrrwait for the built up music they psych you out and you dont jump then jump very predictable and boring not for me this,astonish
i love the story i love how it was directed and the best part of this is valak hunts me everytime after watching this shes my ultimate fear,astonish
not much different from 1 successfully scares a good storyline and jumps out,astonish
i know this is a movie but as someone that remembers the news coverage of these events in the 70s i dont understand the need to go to the rediculous the supposed real events were scary enoughi suggest anyone interested in the real story should watch the enfield haunting with timothy spall its a british mini series that keeps to the original supposed haunting and doesnt need the over the top events that didnt happen to scarethe real story if true is scary enough,astonish
supernatural sequel 2 is a fictionalised account of the enfield poltergeist which allegedly terrorised the occupants of a council house in enfield england in 1977 patrick wilson and vera farmiga reprise their roles of paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson and vera farmiga who having decided to take a break from investigating ghosts and demons after the trauma of amityville agree to travel to england in a purely observational capacity of course they become far more involved than they originally intended once they see the plight of the family involved single mother peggy hodgson frances oconnor and her four children janet madison wolfe margaret lauren esposito billy benjamin haigh and johnny patrick mcauley all of whom have had enough of their unwanted ghostly houseguestat 134 minutes 2 is about half an hour too long and often feels like it is dragging its heels theres only so many times that we need to see furniture being tossed around or the kids waking up to experience supernatural shenanigans that said the film is a serviceable sequel that should please fans of the original and those interested in the paranormal partly because it is loosely based on fact with the emphasis on loosely and partly because james wan has had loads of practise when it comes to creepiness the director up pun intended plenty of atmosphere and some well crafted scares a solid cast also contribute to the films effectiveness with youngsters wolfe and esposito faring particularly well as the hodgson sisters who suffer the most from the haunted happeningsat the end of the day the film doesnt do anything to rewrite the rules of the genre but its a slight improvement over the original i was entertained enough to want to see what further sequels and spinoffs might hold the latest being the forthcoming the nun which is based on the demon that is causing all the trouble in this film,astonish
this sequel to the hugely successful first had its moments however there were a few silly moments that just didnt hit the mark good acting again by the two main actors 610,astonish
i have to say this is my all time favourite horror movie i loved the first but this is even scarier trust me you wont be disappointed ive seen it many times and still love it as much as the first time,astonish
james wans notsosubtle scares are bolstered by the chemistry between wilson and farmiga youd think the love story embedded within his horror would be a tonal nightmare but even the musical number before the final act plays like a touching romance story and makes the marilyn mansonesque nun all the scarier,astonish
this is an excellent sequel and very well paced and just as terrifying as the first one with amazing acting now mostly by the kids i was a little bit not satisfied with the ending a little bit but overall it was fantastic 910,astonish
i liked it more than but i think ill see the first again because i have a feeling i didnt like it for deja vu of seeing this done too many times while some of the sequel was predictable the pacing and some plot twists werent,astonish
such a good narrative i love to watch movies like this with my nephews scares them to death love the part when he comes through the basement floor  reminds me of ace ventura when jim carey forces himself out of that rhino all in all a very good film,astonish
there is a lot of hype surrounding this movie and  almost  everybody says this is a scary movie but if you look besides the cheap jump scares there isnt much to this movie that i would consider scary there is literally loud noises every 10 minutes in this movie like seriously it builds up tension  almost  every 5 minutes just to break it with a cringeworthy loud noise there isnt much atmosphere not much compelling story the plot is the typical afamilybeinghauntedbyanevilspirit plot the characters are stereotypes and  surprise  the antagonist is a demonic spirit that can be repelled off with the faith of god wow so creative to make it worse the movie claims to be based on a true story and it has no irony or sense of humor so with that being said being a story based on two frauds the movie takes itself rather seriously yes ed and lorraine warren are frauds and have been exposed as such but people seem to keep falling for this sort of hooey the scary nun also wears a very cringe worthy make up and has the typical demonic appearance and is warded off with the name of god i find it hard to take that sort of hokum seriously especially if it takes itself seriouslythe clich continues as it is the children the hodgsons who first encounter the super natural a woman lorraine having strong faith and a man ed is a doubter what is it with those clichs weve been having these clichs for about a decade now where is the creativity im tired of these clichs they could at least have tried to make the characters more complex then maybe i would have been more interested but no the characters are very onedimensional and do not have much trace of character development ed warren is the only character that came close to having some character development why concentrate so much on the characters you might be wondering well the movie relies heavily on the  boring one dimensional  characters to unfold the plot and story but what good is it if the characters are runofthemill stereotypes its boring i tell you but here are some good things about the movie the cinematography is great james wan knows how to wield the camera there is some hitchcockargentoesque feel to the way he films the sounds are pretty good too even the cringe worthy loud noises we get bombarded with in the cheap jump scares the specialeffects are neat too there wasnt many moments where i thought this looks so fakecgi james wan also knows how to build up tension  albeit ending each tension with a cringe worthy jump scare  most directors are bad at building up tension what else is there i think thats about itsoso  and hyped  horror movie 410,astonish
it is so good that they actually started making scary movies the way they used to be scary and 2 will keep you at the edge of your seat or maybe behind it this is not one of those so called scary movies that things jump out at you for that quick jump no no in this movie you will see it coming you will see it and it will scare the pants right off you no cheap screams here more like whimpering in the corner hoping for a nice ending will you get it i guess you have to watch it to find out,astonish
usually sequels never live up to the original film but this film stands out i thought 2 was just as scary as the first movie and im so happy they made it although many will miss the setting of the farmhouse the house in england is turned into a house of horrors that lives up to the original based off of the true story of the enfield haunting a family is terrorized by a demon thats set on possessing the daughter im so happy that vera farmiga and patrick wilson returned as the warrens their acting is breathtaking and i would love to see more of them in the future i loved that they added the amityville haunting in the beginning of the film which they also investigated in real life and played off of the end of the first film another thing i really loved about the movie is the other side characters shown in the film like the crooked man and the nun they are already making a spin off about the nun right now and i cant wait to see what it has in store for us bottom line is 2 will scare you just as much as the first one and it definitely should be in your top 10 scariest films,astonish
peggy is a single mother of four when her youngest daughter becomes really unwell sister valak comes to the home and cares for the family this movie is based on true events and is about the compassion of catholic churches and their sisters and how they help families to get through tough times i would recommend this movie to someone who is after an inspiring film with some heartbreaking moments,astonish
the original was one of the best horror movies i had seen in a long time a genuinely frightening and refreshingly unpredictable horror film that made for a welcome addition to the genre i was just hoping that 2 didnt make the same mistakes as sinister 2 which was a total disasterthankfully the hugely talented horror director james wan ensured that didnt happen and produced a very commendable sequel whilst 2 doesnt quite reach the same heights as the original its still a very solid horror with plenty of scares as in the first movie the tension builds nicely until the final quarter when the pace is relentlessi was impressed after originally fearing the worst for this sequel 2 is a respectable horror movie but the original is the more frightening and unpredictable of the two,astonish
after the mediocre if youre being nice annabelle which was a prequel we do get the real treat while there still will be an annabelle 2  no seriously   a movie i probably could do without this sequel is something that touches upon the themes of the original and with the same cast actually delivers on its promiseapparently the filmmakers take real life incidents things that actually happened to some degree and build a movie around it and it does work because you do have a stellar pair who really have a great chemistry its not bloody horror but it is horror that is able to have you at the edge of your seat,astonish
i liked the movie the story the acting  etc but the only thing annoyed me was that the direction was not that good two things made me say that there is a scene where it rains on the road concrete where there was a small pond of water from earlier rain when it started raining it was pretty obvious that the rain was covering most of the pond not all of it which gives away the fact that this is just artificial rain yeah we know artificial rain is the most used rain in movie industry but it cannot look like artificial rain the thing is i wasnt paying attention and still i noticed it which is bad the other thing is i know movies based on true stories always have additional details for the sake of drama but the director and the authors should pay attention to details i mean the demon was so scared from the small cross in eds hand but he is totally ok and jumping around in a small room full of at least tens of crosses with different sizes it was even moving them around the wall this was just ridiculous to me being a true story this leaves me with the certainty that only one of those two contradicting facts have actually happened in the real storythe movie had some other minor directing faults that shouldnt have gone under the radar of a professional director,astonish
2we always hear that the sequel can never compare to the first one but in this case the second installation of is definitely comparable to the first they travel back in time in a whole different country the cast is swapped with the exception of two people the ghostbusters if you will these little twists refresh the viewers who fell in love with the first movie 2 kicks off with a blast from the past as it sets in 1977 lorraine claims that this case still haunts her it begins with your average singleparent poor family hardly scraping by they became notyouraveragefamily when an 11 year old started showing strange symptoms of possession her voice changed to a 76 year old mans and there were unexplained bumps in the night as a result they call in real life ghostbusters lorraine and ed warren to their home for helpthe year 2016 has been filled with new horror movies all the time so itd be easy for this sequel to get lost but this is definitely blockbuster material the actors were well casted skilled and fit their characters perfectly at times the editing was cheesy and you could definitely tell it was fake that part dulled down the scare factor that we all came for however the films twists turns and horrors keep viewers on the edge of their seats the entire time earplugs are advised when someone in the room next to you is watching the movie the first was thrilling exciting well made and most of all horrifying the sequel lacks nothing there isnt anything gory so those with weak stomachs can still watchthis movie will be a cult classic for years to sum it up people wont just forget there was a second one ever made like the movie grease people barely remember there was ever a sequel to the first you dont even have to see the first only two characters are connected to the second,astonish
and its 2016 sequel are among those horror movies that totally blow your mind the demonic forces and hovering spirits are present among us and may choose to interfere with our lives for one reason or another that has made them uncomfortable or mad and these movies are produced based on real stories of real people that were hunted by demons and crazy spirits the script is neat the actings satisfactory and the other elements are all fitting together just fine above all the scary scenes are never exaggerated by blood splashes or extreme violence which surprisingly makes it even more horrifying cuz thats what you get to experience in your daily life no matter how much of a dull lifestyle youre getting to have its one movie you genuinely would be scared to even begin watching that you might prefer to play it in the daylight rather than nighttime and this comes from a person who laughs at all the other horror movies so brace yourselves to a real suffering before hitting on this babe,astonish
well i will give a honest opinion also i dont like to compare this movie with 1st one the scare tactic used in this film is different to the first oh i am already comparing lol you see a lot jump scare scenes in this movie so if you have a weak heart better watch it with ears closed it not just the visual but the sound effects can make you jump the portrait scene is probably the best scene in developing a tension in the audience the mirror scene in trailer is also good people were laughing out loud after every jump scare it does not mean its not scary as some people here think so they are laughing because it scared them and they dont want people around to know about it laughing probably makes them feel cool so its quite entertaining to see people going through all this i loved it as i was there watching in the cinema hall on a late night show and the expressions of people around was priceless i think this is the only film where i have witnessed too many jump scares which are actually horrific there are many great horror movies and we know they get the tension build up slowly and in the process waste a lot of time in this movie it was not the case and thats what makes me watch it with more curiosity but i recommend not to watch it alone especially if you are scared of demons the nun demon is damn scary for children so keep your kids away the jump scares can kill a old person with weak heart so you better know what you are going to watch is actually entertaining but can be disturbing if you are alone i am not so scared of demons but even i jumped when there was a jump scare situation the tv scene did make me jump i was not scared but it was too sudden and shocking which made me jump i enjoyed this movie more than any demon movie because of this very reason go ahead if you want this experience it has a mix of slow tension as well as jump scare scenes worth watching and yes it is the best demon movie i have ever seen,astonish
i dont often give a ten but this time here goes my votei didnt rush to see this one because i didnt care much about the first it is lost somewhere in my memory between insidious and some other movie i forgot about the design of the anabelle doll bothered me to begin withanyway i finally watched 2 driven by favorable critics and word of mouth and i am really glad i didof course its a james wan ghost movie so they throw everything in but the kitchen sink although i think the kitchen sink got thrown out at some point but i loved every part of the ridethe warren couple works in this one there is real chemistry the kids are all great a kid in a horror movie is usually a low point useful to generate compassion but also to make the rest of the cast look good but there you have three of them who seem to effortlessly deliver well anything they performed so well i almost didnt noticethe efficient reenactment of the 70s period is a real pleasure but the movie doesnt just rely on the tricks and bells and whistles of that proficient era i really think they tried to sponge out ideas and mood from recent horror greats i felt some babadook in there and a hint of it follows maybeclearly the creative department because there is plenty of creativity nonetheless tried hard on this which is great because they didnt have to they would have made their money anywaythank you mr wan very hard,astonish
how many times have you gone into the sequel fearing it wont be as good as the first well you have nothing to fear here thats not totally true you do have something to fear here you have a lot to fear with 2 which i believe is far better than the first onejames wan really pulls out the scares in the follow up to his 2013 the story focuses on the enfield haunting set in 1977 london england peggy hodgson is a single mum of five children who asks for help after she believes her youngest daughter janet maybe possessed ed and lorraine warren are sent to investigatenot only am i impressed with the scares in the film which come in the form of jump scares and slow burn tension building i am really impressed with the way james wan recreates england in the 70s for someone that isnt even from the country i have to give credit for the amount of research that must have gone into this project to get the feeling rightthe movie has a great cast with vera farmiga and patrick wilson reprising their roles as lorraine and ed warren they are joined with great performances by frances oconnor who plays peggy hodgson lauren esposito who plays margaret hodgson and the stand out performance from madison wolfe as janet hodgsonwhen it comes to real life hauntings like the story this film is based on i am somewhat of a skeptic i dont believe in ghost so in order for me to enjoy a film that is advertised as the true story from the case files of the warrens i have to try really hard to turn the skeptic side of my brain off and enjoy it for what it is which is one of the most scariest films ive seen in a long time,astonish
as sequels go then 2 seems to fall into the same trap as many other movies do and it didnt manage to surpass or live up to the first movie in the franchisethat being said dont get me wrong here i am not saying that 2 is a bad movie it just didnt manage to reach the same level of intensity or be as scary as the first movie did it does still have some impressive moments here and therethe story is focusing on the actual 1970s enfield haunting phenomena that revolved around the hodgson family however 2 is not the first movie to portray these disturbing events and it did an adequate job in doing so perhaps mostly because of the aid of the actors and actresses portraying the various characters storywise then 2 didnt bring anything new to the tablepatrick wilson really carries this movie quite nicely with his performance and portrayal of the ed warren character and while he is not the one that the movie revolves around he still steals the show to the point where he is the focal pointthe effects in 2 were quite good as they have to be in a ghost movie a ghost or haunting movie without proper effects is an immediate killer to the movie i will say that the special effects team here really did a good job especially since the effects were doing what they were intended to do and doing so without being flashy enough to steal away focus from the moviei was already familiar with the enfield haunting story so there was little new here but still director james wan did manage to handle the story nicelyas with the first movie then it was nice to revisit the cellar of the warren home there are so many interesting pieces to be seen there and a myriad of possible stories to be told on the screenwhile 2 is not a groundbreaking movie it is still enjoyable and entertaining enough for what it was just dont expect to be blown away a fair enough continuation of the first movie albeit it hardly did the first movie much justicemy rating of 2 is a mediocre five out of ten stars,astonish
if you havent seen the movie i urge you not to read this review as it contains spoilers and basically will ruin the whole experienceas far as horror movies go is among the scariest ive seen decent plot a little too much at times and i wonder if the movie could have ended in the traditional 1 hour and a half but still worth your time if what your looking is a good shoulder exerciseed and lorraine warren continue their search for paranormal activity this time in england where a family is haunted by a spirit that claims ownership of their home and apparently the body of one of the little girls story starts with lorraine having a vision of a young boy who while possessed by an evil entity murders his whole family parents2 brothers1 sister in their sleep with a shotgun even though the scene started with his mother yelling at him before she hit the sheets of her bed covered in blood and the blast of the shotgun his 2 brothers somehow continue sleeping unaffected by the hell that broke loose 3 meters away the scene continues with the brotherthe viewer actually sees lorraine as she envisions the whole massacre entering the bedroom of his two brothersm and initially shoots the 1st boy 2nd boy is still sleeping despite his mothers screams and the 3 shotgun booms so he also ends up dead sister in a 3rd room equally doesnt hear the 4 now gunshots and subsequently ends up deadthe warrens eventually end up in britain to investigate the haunted house case on behalf of the church that wishes to put an end to the families screams decent acting and some pretty scary scenes follow but before the warrens the police is called up to the scene when the spirit for the first time decides to become a little too friendly with the hodgsons 2 officers a woman and a man arrive to investigate and actually witness a chair without a driver gracefully slide across the floor in front of them also in the presence of the single mother who now owns the house and a neighbor who offered to help scene is actually pretty good but what follows surely isnt after they see with their own eyes something that would make any living soul sht in his pants all 4 exit the house pretending nothing happened no running like headless chickens no stumbling on the floor going through windows or even a scream 2 officers actually stand in front of the haunted house and explain to the lady why they couldnt file a report about itplot continues with the warrens stepping in and finally managing to defeat the spirit while doing so a thunder cuts a tree just outside of the house in half which was a pretty decent touch and so were the scenes inside the house up to the point that the neighbor from before attempts to chop a door down with an ax while inside world war 3 was climaxing movie finishes without him managing to enter that door despite the fact that lorraine squeezed in and just before the end 4 neighbors in total come to celebrate the demise of the paranormal house is almost demolished screams a thunder and in the morning no one beside the victims and the ghost hunters seemed to careapart from these 34 mistakes in my opinion film was actually pretty good but a little too long,astonish
relied mostly on jump scares and thrilling long sequences that would make you wait for something showing up right in your face  2 relies on the same concept but with a demon hunting the hunters themselves and a different case of paranormal activities in englandi am a sucker for british people living in the suburbs or small outer areas with thick accents needless to say this is england is one of my favourite movies and series but i still got quite sceptic when this movie started with a rip off of ties introsstarts they go through whats happening in england right now to music with tvclips and 2 took that and made it to the very classic london calling the clash taking a concept is never a nice move and especially not at the start of the moviethe rest was a very typical horrorparanormal movie not much special but it definitely works while watching it at a cinema but if i had watched it home on my computer id probably start doing something else while watchingthe animation and some of the effects was poorly executed it was so so badly made i cannot understand how they didnt notice it the demon valak is a nun the original valak is not a nun so they basically just took a cool name and went with it apparently they made the design for the demon at the final cuts and that is definitely noticeable ed one of the main characters got his first cross from a nun so maybe its some symbolism but that doesnt cover it for me the crooked man also a creature was poorly animated but creepy when it was shown in shadows reminded me of babadook but in light it looked like a cartoon character when the child that became possessed eyes turned yellow at her most controlled part and i could just think about how poorly it was made why rely on animation when you can create intense feelings with just shadows and sounds i dont understandthe events that this movie was based on had nothing to do with these creatures and demons so the based on a true story concept is kind of  not even true  but what do you expecti had no trouble with the child actors though one of the children was supposed to be stuttering all the time but that magically disappeared in the middle of the movie one thing i liked was that judy that got possessed was a very kind person it felt so unfair that she was getting into this messspoilerto the ending i absolutely hated it and i think that was the poorest done thing with this movie it ended happy not even a cliffhangerit wouldve been so good if ed or judy died it would be like satan or the demon won over them and faith cant predict everything or stop some things its not common to have important characters die but since the movie isnt much based on the real events they could go with something new and make the movie uniquei dont know it just felt so weird since everyone was screaming and crying 15 minutes before these scenesspoiler endedi think that overall it was an okay film perfect to watch in the cinemas and exciting with jump scares but not a long lasting bone chilling unless youre afraid of nuns good actors vera farmiga is amazing as usual and i think that the cinematography and aesthetics except the demons were okay,astonish
i rewatched the first one on friday night and enjoyed it a lot more than the first time i watched it having seen nearly all of the james wan horror films insidious annabelle saw you have to appreciate that 1  2 are the best of these types of horror film i say horror because this isnt true horror there is nothing in any of these films that any long time horror fan hasnt seen many times before james wan seems to have an approach where instead of trying to avoid the clichs and tropes of modern day horror he just throws every conceivable trick into a blender and hopes for the best the first few scares of fell completely flat with me just when i was beginning to lose all hope of seeing anything remotely scary they did just about start to improveone of the things that really grated me with the first film was the horribly out of tone use of time of the season by the zombies and a completely pointless long shot an odd tone shift that doesnt suit anything before or after it in the film the sequel suffers from similar unwarranted tone changes patrick wilson pulling out his guitar to give a rendition of an elvis song is this films time of the season it just doesnt work in fairness though this is an attempt at character development it doesnt work but at least they triedanother major gripe is that all of the enfield based english characters sound like theyve been taught diction by don cheadle in oceans 11 or perhaps wan told them to base their accents on that little lad from bedknobs  broomsticks either way its off putting and distractingwatching a james wan produceddirected horror film is the cinematic equivalent of accompanying a toddler through the haunted house at the local fair the loud noisy things that keep jumping out are very effective at scaring the younger ones but only because its all new to them,astonish
this review may contain potential minor spoilers but no blatant and major giveawaysthe first was something of a very nice surprise for me im not one to usually buy into major release horror films but heard so many good things about it from audiences and critics alike that i caved in what i didnt expect was that it ended up being a very solid and very traditionally done ghost story with effective character development and slow burn buildup it had its moments of cheap jumpscares and gags here and there but overall it was surprisingly effective jump forward to the sequel and theres problems from the start to parrot its predecessor the film opens with a previous case of the warrens this time the infamous amityville haunting though the annabelle sequence from the first film felt a bit contrived it was still effective it didnt run away with the cliche creepy doll thing too much and the sequence was creepy despite being relatively mundane the amityville sequence thrusts the viewer into a jumpscare filled climax right off the bat leading the way for the inconsistently toned and paced remainder of the film the immediate next gripe was setting the scene for london using the clashs london calling along with kiddies calling each other that word that starts with w and rhymes with tanker a word that apparently makes imdbs prohibited word list made the viewer very well aware that the film takes place in jolly old england i dont think i couldve come up with more painfully obvious and groanworthy not to mention clich and distilled references to english culture if i tried already the movie was off to a bit of a rocky start but i gave it a chance i really did so from here i will point out some of the things the film did do right the performances are all handled well and the kids are particularly strong in their roles wilson and fermiga are once again a believable onscreen couple the strong eerie atmosphere from the first film is back and better than before as the camera compositions and movements are much more dynamic and interesting the entities in 2 are a bit of a mixed bag however on one hand the old man in the chair is appropriately subdued and fairly nuanced but then you have a demonic nun that while creepy enough has a design that feels old and tried and felt as though it was trying too hard lastly you got the crooked man which while rather cool looking i must admit felt pretty outofplace within the grounded reality the narrative set up thus far contributing to the films already inconsistent nature for a dark horror movie 2 also felt unnaturally sappy and saccharine while some moments of levity among the scares and foreboding terror are more than welcome much of the dialogue reeked of forced sentimentality and hammy cheese ultimately taking me out of the horror of it all so to recap 2 is far from being a bad film it outperforms its predecessor in some ways but falls very low in others its tonal inconsistencies make for a very odd structure yet one that is still rather predictable it still looks very good and delivers on some chilling moments but isnt nearly as effective as the first in this evergrowing franchise,astonish
the worst bit in any horror film is the 30 or so minutes they waste on nobody believing the protagonist in the first film they had none of that it was a breath of fresh air some bad stuff happens to a family then these two super hero ghost hunters walk in and bang they know exactly whats going on and what to do about it and it was a joy watching them do it2 it all goes out the window and turns into a run by numbers jump scare messthe worst bit in any horror film is the 30 or so minutes they waste on nobody believing the protagonist thats why this film is 25 crappy minutes longer,astonish
this review is a detailed review without any spoilers so you can know if it contains some stuff you like or dontill tell you right now the movie is scary i made some jumps and had chills on the first half of it and then some parts in the second half the atmosphere is great the spirits are scary as hell but it is sometimes wasted on cheap jump scares that you can see miles awaywhat throws me off was the doggy thing where it reminds you of a poor version of then babadook character which in this case is absolutely useless to put into the script the way the characters interact is something weve seen millions of time in bad horror movies that throw you out of the reality of the movies what i mean by that is when we look at the first movie the characters were not venturing alone in the dark like in every other stupid horror movies they were going as a group except for one time but in this movie every character doesnt seems to realize that the ghost can actually hurt them even after multiples encounters one more stupid thing is the ending the script on how they find out how to beat the spirit is so dumb i never thought a super spirit would allow them to beat him in a single stupid attempt its almost as the spirit committed suicide for no reason at all there needs to be an investigation for a movie to have a suspenseful ending but sadly this movie decided to go for the cheap wayoverall go for it if you like the insidious series its pretty much the same but if you expect a great movie script with a good intrigue this is not the case,astonish
since the advent of the first paranormal activity film hollywood and in particular james wan have had an obsession with the quietquietquietbang element of horror cinemaand the cinemas have been infected with these films since 2009 the are seldom rarely scary but they do have that irritating knack of making you jump just because they turn up the scare shriek volume up to eleven and let the dark corners of rooms do the worknow whilst 2 pretty much follows the if it aint broke dont fix it laws of horror it really reigns in the loud noises to make you jump hence making it one of the more interesting horror movies to be released in cinemas for a very long timebut there is still a lot of work to do especially when you consider the miniseries the enfield haunting which starred timothy spallin 1977 paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren travel to london england where single mother peggy hodgson believes that something evil is in her home when peggys youngest daughter starts showing signs of demonic possession ed and lorraine attempt to help the besieged girl and her family but they only vex the demon and find themselves targeted by the malicious spiritsits a pretty audacious move by the makers to have the opening ten minutes set in one of the most famous horror houses of all amityville because they are potentially setting themselves up to fail or setting themselves up for a third movie to give us a taste of things to come ala insidiousbut once we are redirected to london which is pointed out to us by having the clashs london calling playing over the scene the film becomes more intense thanks to the performances of the children particularly janetthe film has all your regular clichs which are found in these films silly long corridors with a tent at one end faces in mirrors and best of all a painting of a nun that is so genuinely terrifying its garnered its own spinoff againif you can get over the ridick van dykeulous accents and the fact that if you listen to the radio 5 film programme the demon sounds like simon mayos real voice this is a pretty decent if slightly overlong horrorbut pleas check out the enfield haunting too,astonish
first one hated and regretting seeing it then i see the sequel knowing that the first one sucked this one has to too it was exactly as i thought first one was considered r rated for scares alone and there was not one scary part in it like a tv14 movie from tv got put on the big screenas for the first paragraph about this one is the same no difference on rating must of been a teenager hired to preview the movie before released to get the rating for it now they rated r but really should be tv14 ratingpeople actually got scared off these two movies annabelle was spin off the first and was not even scary and had more gore than both of these two together and did not get scary what is wrong with directors and producers now a daysboth sinister movies was hell of a lot better than all annabelles and movies they are not making any more sequels to the sinister movies that is a shame i rather see many many more sequels of sinister movies than this crapthese two movies put shame to the r ratings blasphemy is what this is no recommendation as for horror movies to watch,astonish
crap crap and more crap dont waist your money or your time bad acting crappy script and done to death movie its just a hoooorrriiiibbbblllleeee modern remake of the freakin exorcist if i wold have paid to go see this drivel i would have asked for my money back with interest i just cannot for the life of me see how anyone other than a horror movie neophytewould consider this remotely scary the plot was extremely contrite and very much done to death ie exorcist the exorcism of emily rose etc etc is their no more originality in horrorwood any more can they not come up with an original script nowadays what the hell is wrong with these freakin writers directors and producers to actually have the gall no the audacity to consider this piece of celluloid crapoola as a modern day horror movie what makes it so much worse is that people are actually watching this st and calling it unique and scary are you out of your minds people,astonish
this takes place in 1978 and is based on a true story ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson vera farmiga fight a ghost in england that targets a family with a divorced mom and four children it targets especially their 11 year old girlthe first movie was a good scary movie it had its faults but it worked this one doesnt for starters its too long theres no reason for this film to run almost 2 and half hours plenty of sequences could have been trimmed or cut out completely secondly it has too many damn jump scares theyre annoying and force the audience to jump also its very slowmoving i got bored pretty quickly worst of all it just isnt scary the attack scenes werent even remotely scary on the plus side it is wellacted and directed with accurate 1978 clothes and fads portrayed also the ending is greatviolent and exciting but its too little too late this has been getting raves from critics and viewers so im definitely in the minority here but i really didnt like it,astonish
2 is a follow up to the surprise haunted house hit and another outing for psychic investigators ed and lorraine warren as played by patrick wilson and vera farmiga sadly im no fan of these films finding the direction overblown and the reliance on cliches and pedestrian plotting to be completely offputting this unconvincing sequel transports the action to england where the investigators are shoehorned into the famous enfield poltergeist case they end up bringing their old baggage with them so this is more about evil nuns and stupid spirits than any attempts at realism the overthetop fantasy hauntings involving farmigas character never gel with the icy chills of the poltergeist case and its one of those hollywood films that manages to make all of the british accents ring hollow and false by the end its devolved into yet another chasedaroundbycgi climax just like in the insidious trilogy and my interest had long since waned,astonish
sure there is some truth to the story in the sense that two girls made up a story of possession which has been thoroughly debunked and that maurice grosse was there as a paranormal investigator with him was guy playfair not depicted in this movie while the warrens were hardly involved at all a far better and more frightening dramatization of these events is the british miniseries the enfield haunting although that like this does conclude that the haunting was real great cast inspired by an interesting story but frankly the movie turned out quite boring and not particularly frightening,astonish
2 2016 12 out of 4 ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson vera farmiga are coming off the amityville case when they decide to take a break this break doesnt last too long as ed has a vision of a possessed nun which is the same person lorraine previously saw meanwhile over in london a mother and her four children are being haunted by an evil spirit which appears to be attached to an elderly mancame out of nowhere and become a huge hit among critics and horror fans the box office numbers meant a sequel was bound to follow since the number one rule with horror films is that if one makes money you rush another into production thankfully this film wasnt rushed into production and its great that they actually took their time to deliver a good screenplay i must admit that im quite shocked but i thought the film was much better and much creepier than the first filmdirector james wan is really becoming an expert at these types of films and this here is certainly among the best that has been made i thought the first film was quite good due to its performances and a nice story but i didnt find a single thing creepy that certainly wasnt the case here as the movie had my blood turning cold several times including the before mentioned nun which was downright creepy at times i also thought the first hour was perfectly done as the director slowly builds up the suspense and once it hits he just keeps it going with one sequence after another i will say that the crooked man didnt work and the finale wasnt as great as i was hoping but these are just small issuesonce again the film really benefits from the two great leads performances both wilson and farmiga are perfectly believable in their roles and they certainly sell the viewer that everything youre watching is actually happening madison wolfe and frances oconnor are also very good in their supporting roles as is simon mcburney the film also benefits from some terrific cinematography and a very eerie music score on a technical level the film is very impressive and this here helps build up the atmosphere2 is a very rare sequel that actually manages to be much better than the first film it also shows why sequels shouldnt be rushed into production and that if you take your time with them something as good as this can be made,astonish
i wanted to say wow but someone beat me to iti watch a lot of horror movies and most of them are just plain crap i saw darling and it was stupid holidays were a bunch of idiotic gory stories that made no sense but this movie had it allit had real characters and they were developed well enough to care about what happened to them it was even touching in partsbut the main thing is that it delivered on all levelsheres my spoiler there seems to be a common thread in all true haunting stories it seems that when someone dies and doesnt go to the light for whatever reason it leaves a door open and demons seem to get in they then try to use that ghost to attack others ive seen it in dozens of true accounts of hauntingshope this doesnt distract you from seeing it because its very well done lots of scares and when you have characters you really care for it makes it all matter even morenot like those horrors where you hate all the idiots running from the killer and you cant wait for them to be killed off one by oneanyway i liked this movie a lot i hope they do more like it,astonish
after checking the reviews of this movie on this site i couldnt wait to watch it i really enjoyed the first one so i though hey this should be great was i wrong let me just say i absolutely love horror movies but for me it must be so scary that i am tempted to actually stop watching the movie with this movie i was tempted to stop watching it for a whole other reason i found it to be extremely predictable and quite boring one big horror movie clich  and not actually scary at all the first one was 100 times better so if you like horror movies that dont make you think before you walk down the passage to the toilet  this one is for you,astonish
one of the better horror movies to emerge from the last decade finally gets a follow up with 2 the enfield case director james wan is back to doing what he does best after indulging himself hopelessly in the furious franchise  something ive not entirely forgiven him for now that he has that out of his system he fleets back to the one franchise still very much appreciated that is if we quietly disregard annabelle 2014  something i have most definitely not forgiven him for the enfield case has everything you want in a sequel the setting london england 1977 and we see the return of the ever palpable patrick wilson and vera farmiga as our favourite ghosthunters ed and lorraine warren although those of you who managed to catch the quite brilliant three part series on sky 1 the enfield haunting will have been subjected to some unfortunate spoilers but worry not theres more to this story than a great way to tell it and after a small timeout wan doesnt hold back on the bigbudget scaresenfield north london is the birthplace of one of the most documented hauntings in british history where the hodgeson family were subjected to a series of ghastly shenanigans in particular the youngest daughter of the family janet played here by a precocious madison wolfe who is tormented and sometimes embodied by the spirit of a previous resident bill wilkins when the incidents become more frequent the family turn to the church for sanctuary who in turn contacts ed and lorraine warren to investigate meanwhile lorraine is facing her own demons and is haunted by the spirit of the amityville case who gives her a terrifying premonition of eds deathone thing that makes this movie a cut above most horror that has been recently released is that it is very well made wan captures the bleak and impoverished conditions of the late 1970s working class for those who lived and were raised through the late 70s early 80s there is a strong sense of familiarity the patterned curtains mismatched bedspreads and garish wallpaper wan taps into a familiar fear of helplessness that comes with those childhood memories or even that uneasy feeling you get when you enter a musty old house of the recently deceased though most of the suspense stems from wans ability to make your skin crawl he isnt afraid to parade the obvious scare his excessive use of quick camera shifts make it easy predict when a big jump is coming with the old its behind you trick but it makes you feel rather ashamed when he still manages to get you especially when youre too old to hide your eyes behind your fingers so you revert to muttering expletives under your breath 2 the enfield case is a popcorn horror for the nonchalant its a testament to wans style of filmmaking the haunted house  possession genre has exhausted all of its resources but regardless of his critics wan does not pretend that he has reinvented the wheel instead he throws everything into the boiling pot for it to ultimately reach its overproduced climactic ending gratuitous entertainment,astonish
while i enjoyed the original i was left a little wanting i thought if the first 60 minutes of the film had been as intense as the last 30 it would have been a great horror tale well director james wan has created its sequel and let me tell you it is one intense ride ed and lorraine warren played by patrick wilson and vera farmiga are back as the paranormal couple who go where few dare to tread they are asked to investigate a supposed hauntingpossession of a 12year old girl in england named janet hodgson it seems she has been tormented by the ghost of a 71 year old man who died in the house her family now inhabits oh but leave it to wan to make it so much more than thatas in the original this story opens with a reference to another case of alleged possessionthe amityville mass murders while investigating there lorraine keeps having premonitions of her husbands impending death she also discovers a very dark and evil presence which decides to take the form of a demented nunjames wan shows he is a master of this genre he also shows that an audience can be scared to death simply by using camera tricks shadows and effective makeups his actors deliver topnotch performances especially madison wolfe who plays the tormented child to me this film as the original should have been rated pg13 there is no blood gore nudity or sexual situations in fact i have racked my brain trying to remember if i even heard a cuss word and for the life of me i dont however dont let the lack of those hackneyed and worn out situations stop you from seeing this movie it is the best horror movie i have seen in a long time and i will even admit i had trouble sleeping the night after i saw the movie enjoy,astonish
i went into the cinema with low expectations because i saw so many things about how good 2 is i thought that i would be disappointed but i was very wrong 2 is fast paced and well written the story doesnt just focus on the horror but it also focuses a lot on the characters there are some character building scenes but none of them waste time they are all very meaningful i felt much more connected to this family than the last one you sympathize a lot with these characters everyone is trying to fight their own battles and overcome their obstacles the horror is very scary james wan managed to make a very terrifying atmosphere he knows how to build up suspense and he knows how to use jump scares there were quite a few jump scares in this film but none of them were falsesome were very predictable but most of them caught me off guard what made this really scary is the fact that it was in a normal house  it wasnt in some big american house with eight bedrooms and three floorsit was in an average british council housethe acting was very good and everyone did a great job i felt glued to the screen and felt engaged with the story the cinematography and lightning was very good the camera work was absolutely amazing the only reason why im giving it 910 is because i felt that the last 10 minutes was way too much it was very extreme and messy i didnt really feel engaged however many people felt that the ending was good and well written so im not going to say that the ending was a bad thing it was just a bit too much for me but overall this was a very good movie and if youre looking for something to creep you out and make you feel scared then watch 2,astonish

janet at the very first few glances pops up a question where did she school her brilliant acting talent that makes the other brilliance around her shallow the movie is slow and boring in the beginning but definitely keeps your seat belts still buckled up cos you know at the back of your mind its based on a real story and the inhuman demons horror lingers within seconds of its appearance the movie slowly takes over you and the boring haunted house horror makes you a part of those characters in the movie once you are in it the yellow eyes the unkempt hair the redness of scare on the white faces  all begin to horrify you mrsmsvalak will definitely crumple your face to frightenbut mr ed and lorrainze  with the help of lord jesus and the holy bible and the holy crucifix and of course their exorcist talent to communicate with the spirits win the game against the super strong spirits just like any horror hollywood movie last 20 minutes of the movie is the real horror the initial boring parts of the movie is the leap into the characters to make you feel the horror no cheap horrifying makeup subtle makeup sensible movie 2,astonish
james wan perhaps the premiere modern horror director saw insidious makes graphically regal films that often exceed the genres visual conventions his popular films give him the opportunity to show that skill with gorgeous periodpiece settings the general warmness to the coloring works as a nice counterpoint to the scares while this newest entry doesnt quite sidestep all of the clichs in modern horror giggling children creepy toys red herring scares it does askew some the justbrainyenough storytelling mixed with the super strong direction make it a distinctly solid studio horror trip based on true events we find paranormal investigators lorraine and ed warren traveling to the uk to study a peculiar and sinister haunting of a young singleparent family along the way some plot conveniences and illogical creature rules haunt the proceedings luckily these are overshadowed by some fantastically creepy monster designs including a boldly sadistic nunfigure and a terrifying rendition of the crooked man nursery rhyme all underscored by effectively cool music and sound design by now wan has proved he knows what hes doing in the scare department however some surprisingly adept humor cuts through the horrific drama allowing the themes of family and dangerous commitment to shine through but what really makes the whole thing work are the people in spite of the few plotting flaws in the center of the story are characters you wanna root for they are funny loving sympathetic and real they are humanfeeling people who make humanfeeling decisions with this beautiful control over tone and character wan feels only a step away from making a true masterpiece until then this will more than do,astonish
i was surprised to see the great reviews for this movie in my opinion it was just another tired james wan film it wasnt horrible or anything and if you liked 1 then you will definitely like this one it just seemed to me that it relied too heavily on jumpscares there were some parts in the the movie that were unintentionally hilarious it was very hard for me to take this movie seriously and the aforementioned unintentionally funny bits they are very few and far between verdict i would not recommend it personally it wasnt ironically good but it wasnt unironically good,astonish
the warrens are back with a new case to solve and a new demon to cast out 2 reunites us with ed and lorraine warren 6 years after the events of this time the ghostbusting dynamic duo are called to enfield england to help a family of 5 in what would become the longest recorded paranormal case in history following the previous films three stages of possession the film escalates perfectly and unfortunately for ed and lorraine they have become targeted by this demon as wellthe return of also sees the return of director james wan back to the series and the horror genre after directing 2015s fast and furous 7 wan knocks it out the park yet again with this horror movie sequel the tension is unbearable the imagery is horrifying and the film is scary as fck this film puts wans tension building ability to the test and wan rises to the occasion making several scenes borderline unbearable to watch 2 wouldnt be as good as it is if james wan didnt direct the film proves once again why james wan is the best horror director working todaythe acting in this film is great patrick wilson and vera farmiga reprises their roles as ed and lorraine warren this time adding a more personal touch and awesome elvis impression to their respected characters the chemistry the two have is believable and brings a human touch to this paranormal horror film like the first film the child actors are good great by child actor standards especially madision wolfe who is great as the tormented and occasionally possessed janet hodgsoni couldnt help but feel there was a wasted opportunity when the amityville case was glossed over at the films start although the opening is wonderfully shot similarly to nbcs hannibal i still think it could have been its own sequel the films foreshadowing of events was rather obvious except such as the focus on the dog bell and he crooked man toy etc speaking of the crooked man the scene where the dog transforms into the crooked man didnt really fit in and was almost laughable due to how bizarre and wtf the moment wasoverall 2 is a well acted well directed horror film that is overflowing with tension and that also has heart this film marks a successful start to sequel series and hopefully there are more to come and more importantly that james wan acts as director for them,astonish
the inherent value of a good horror film is its ability to evoke primordial emotions out of its audience in todays ever commercially consumed society there seems to be less variety when it comes to comedy drama action etc its as if big hollywood studios have found the perfect algorithms to keep viewers laughing sobbing or on the edge of their seats that said theres still a diversity of ways movies can disturb unsettle and frighten one need only look at the two most acclaimed horror movies thus far this year the witch 2015 and 2 2016 to see theres still variety yet while the witch was quietly subversive 2 is a happy celebration of classic horror movie tropes2 revisits husband and wife team the warrens wilson  farmiga as they investigate the paranormal occurrences of the endfield house in 1970s london the hodgson family seems to have disturbed a former resident of the house whose spirit has taken a liking to youngest daughter janet wolfe with nowhere to turn to and the case becoming a bit of a media circus the warrens are resistant to help partially due to lorraine warrens premonition of ed warrens death2 stands as a textbook example of effective horror house chills and thrills using every technique at its disposal everything from highminded and meticulously created atmosphere and looming dread to lowbrow jump scares are administered smartly stabilizing some of its clichs with brilliant cinematography director james wan recycles a few of the visual motifs of insidious 2010 and the first 013 but lets not assume every horror movie should be groundbreakingof course at twice the budget as the original itd almost feel a waste if 2 decided not to up the ante thus instead of two ghostly spirits the film conjures three one of which represents the manifestation of youngest son billys haigh nightmares it is the inclusion of this third sprite that the movie starts to lose much of the scrappy competency that made the first so memorable that and the lack of a showstopping possession dont get me wrong the young madison wolfe does a tremendous job but lili taylors performance in singlehandedly saved the original from third act follyunfortunately 2 fidgets uncomfortably under such folly submitting a third act that is at once climactic yet technically disappointing there are other disappointments as well many of which stem from constantly hearkening to other better films there are references and visual cues to the omen 1976 the haunting 1963 and of course the amityville horror 1979 which serves less as an integral part of the story and more of a blatant case of horror movie fandomyet for all its faults 2 still remains a decent followup to the original and a refreshingly frightening film all its own while it doesnt break the mold by any means the continuation of the warrens investigations into the paranormal feeds into a certain cultural zeitgeist that popular culture is all to willing to consume perhaps horror films serve another function other than to disturb unsettle and frighten perhaps that also exist as an exercise in formalist filmmaking thats unfettered by irony and cynicism in other words perhaps some people just need something to believe inwwwtheyservepopcorninhellblospotcom,astonish
i remember being pretty disappointed when first came out the internet was building it up to be one of the scariest films ever made and i was getting really excited to be properly scared i dont usually get scared in films but james wans very own insidious did manage to conjure up pardon the pun some genuinely terrifying imagery so i had every right to expect the same from but the film didnt scare me at all it wasnt until i rewatched it recently that i realised that whilst it isnt a scary film to me i can appreciate it for being a very wellmade horror filmso when 2 reviews came out and were citing similar hype i tried to put aside the claims of it being even better than the first film and went in with an open mind almost expecting it to be a disappointment but it wasnt 2 is one of those very rare sequels even rarer in the horror genre which manages to better the first it still has its problems and i still dont think its scary or that it outdoes insidious but it is a fine example of haunted house horror which can stand proudly on its ownyoud be forgiven for thinking that its simply more of the same when the film starts as its almost identical to the first film a seemingly unrelated case opens the film and the title flashes up on the screen along with some jargon about the film being true and this case is yet again the scariest the warrens have ever encountered blah blah blah its basic scare tactics that might work for horror virgins but us aficionados will just be rolling our eyes to be fair the opening scene is actually very well directed and gives you some idea of the films overall quality were soon plunged into 1970s england and were given constant reminders of this which is something that irritated me maybe its because im english myself but the stereotypes were often quite overwhelming although amusing every car in the driveway is a mini cooper the queen often pops up on the telly and everyone has a seriously strong cockney accent i know that its set in london but even so it sounds like most of the actors have moulded their accents on dick van dyke in mary poppins i also found frances o connor a little wooden and unconvincing at times as well as a few of the kidsoverall the acting is terrific though i was particularly impressed with madison wolfe as margaret the main girl who gave off linda blair vibes at times the role asks a lot of such a young actress but she tackles it head on and its pretty extraordinary to watch vera farmiga and patrick wilson are also as excellent as ever as our favourite paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren i really liked how the film focused so much on their relationship so that it became the emotional core of the film similarly wan takes his time to carefully build the characters in england so that we become invested in them and actually care about whats going to happen to them its such a rarity these days to find a horror film with characters you feel involved with and this is the main aspect which makes 2 so strong and compellingthe other great thing about the film is its atmosphere james wan clearly has a deep love for the horror genre and 2 is a labour of this love the whole film is deliciously gothic and overthetop its a horror fans dream come true there are a lot of spooky scenes crammed into the film and whilst they didnt particularly scare me you cant help but appreciate the stylishness and effectiveness of them james wan really is a master behind the camera and knows how to create genuine tension like the first film a lot of scenes are filmed skilfully in one fluid take and it often becomes very intense especially combined with the striking loud score and sound designeven the typical horror clichs like possession and creaky doors are done in such an effective way that you dont care that youve seen it a hundred times before with a running time of over two hours i was still left feeling eager for more 2 creates a gorgeous world of horror and allows you to sink within it it will leave horror fans consistently grinning from ear to ear the demonghost designs in this one are also much more creative than the first film the nun character played by the same lady who acted as the iconic bum in mulholland dr was memorably creepy and a bizarre character known as the crooked man is weirdly delightful although some might find him a jarringly out of placeif youre a fan of the horror genre then i cant really see any reason for disliking 2 and if youre not a horror fan then what are you bloody doing watching a horror film recent films like the witch it follows and the babadook may be better but that doesnt make 2 obsolete its a beautifully crafted piece of supernatural horror which delivers atmosphere and suspense in spades some of it does feel a little contrived towards the end but the finales so excitingly pulsepounding and intense that youre unlikely to care it makes sure that the audience actually care about the people on screen so its never dull for one moment a third film will definitely be on the cards and if it carries on being as solid as this one then we might be looking at the best supernatural horror franchise since well

the enfield case is a famous supernatural case that happened in real life in 1977 and made news headlines around the world for film to take this case on was brave i admit i was cautious about this film as the first outing was brilliant and we know that sequels dont live up to the first one well ill admit im wrong 2 is absolutely brilliant its a great take on another real life case and with plenty of other real stories this film franchise could continue to be a success the story of the investigators lorraine and ed warren who are sent to england by the church to help a single mom of 4 with a demonic presence in their house the story and script is so well written and you can tell a lot of thoughts went into it the jump scares are not as good as the first film but still a great film and if there is a sequel you must watch then this is it,astonish
generally im not a fan of horror but i watched and enjoyed and then felt compelled to go and see the sequel 22 has a decent plot telling a good ghost storythe warrens have been investigating spooky things in the us they decide to take a break from this as mrs warren a clairvoyant is getting premonitions of her husbands death via a very nasty demonic thing dressed up like a nun which was genuinely spooky however on hearing the plight of a single parent family of young children in enfield london being haunted by a nasty old man the warrens feel have to help particularly as they are asked by the church unofficially to go investigate the haunting has already attracted a lot of media attention they arrive at the house and begin to find things are much worse than imagined what initially seems to be a rather nasty ghost of an old man is actually a spirit being held and controlled by a demonic being the scary nun thing it is a fairly predictable demonghost story in that it has a happy ending but how it tells the story is very good and keeps you guessing and enthralled whats too like  the films set in the 1970s but has a sort of almost 1940s dismal atmosphere at times this is also detrimental too a degree see further downacting and characters are all generally goodplot is believable and logical it builds a story with suspense rather than just making the audience jump i found the nun demon thing satisfyingly scaryghoulish as was the old man the child actors and mum are very convincing in their terrors all in all a satisfying scary tale where good does eventually vanquish evil nasty things niggly things that irritated its the 1970s electricity has been invented for some time kids in particular will turn on the lights instead of walking around in the dark in the wee hoursmaurice grosse  looked ludicrous and i kept expecting him to be a comedy character but wasntrunning time of 2hrs 14mins perhaps a bit long winded at times mixed up era a council house that so flooded in the cellar it has a lake  so much flooding and rickety structure the whole house should be condemned its a 1970s council house ie at that time a relatively new property councils also maintain their properties so would not allow such decaydamage its not a 1930s ghetto at times the english cockney accents did sound similar to dick van dyke in mary poppins these are relatively minor complaints well worth a watch 810,astonish
lorraine wanting to retire from the spiritual field and ed warren tired of justifying what they do travel to north london to help a family plagued by a malicious spiritopening with a chilling medium session at the notorious amityville home where lorraine warren vera farmiga has an encounter with the dead lutz family and a demon nun director james wan hits the horror road running the creepy nun from eds patrick wilson painting an omen of death later turns up at ed and lorraines home and were introduced to their teenage daughter meanwhile a single mother raising four children are harassed by the previous deceased occupant with a fistful of writers and the sharp editor wan creates a good build up fleeting between the us and uk and although it takes its time getting ed and lorraine to the english house it works giving the film scopethe cast particularly the child actors are great and farmiga shines wilson delivers another great performance as the matter of fact ed incidentally as well as being a handy man he also does a good acoustic rendition of elvis cant help falling in love the notable german actress franka potente also appears as a sceptic but gets very little screen time simon mcburney is solid and almost equals timothy spalls performance as maurice grosse like its predecessor it shares much with other haunting films but it stands on its own due to wans execution he knows horror the eeriness atmosphere timing of visuals and sound to get hairs standing on end effortlessly something which the rushed annabelle 2014 arguably lacked in his absence as directorwith a pause for thought like true crime murders it gets under your skin and you cant help feel that someone is profiting from someone elses misery conscious aside true or not wan stays close to the enfield hauntings beats with plenty of artistic licence to inject enough practical and cgi effects without it losing its grounded feel too much in the first three quartersfrom wall posters to wallpapers clothes and cars the 1977 is recreated almost perfectly there is a set up with a remote control although i dont recall there being remotes like that in great britain or at least the family surely wouldnt have been able to afford that tv in any case the set up is still effectively creepy with a great jump scare when the young girl encounters an old man in both a reflection and face to face as well as a scary zoetrope toy and fire engine theres a horrific moment where the girls young brother is tricked into thinking a ghoul is a dog wanting to go out by ringing a bell next to the doorthe uk terraced neighbour setting sets it apart but naturally its reminiscent of the three part the enfield haunting 2015 and when the lights went out 2012 which told the 1974 black monk of pontefract story nevertheless wan to his credit recreates the brit 70s injecting some nostalgia for the viewer with the location the jam tv clips of the day and so on wan packs 2 with energy jumps scares and handles the emotional scenes delicately in the closing act theres a twist as it tries to hone the exorcist while it may not have the grit and weight of the aforementioned it has an entertaining mix of drama and horror to set it apart from many others as ed and lorraine do battle at the end ed stops the young girl falling to her death as lorraine word duels with the demon akin to the design of 2005s the nunla monja yes theres an unnecessary wash of practical and computer imagery in the finale but it comes back to earth with an eerie text epilogue then the couple add the zoetrope toy to their collection which is followed by the leads bursting with chesmisty dancing happily togetherwith ouija boards spooky nuns spectres toys moving furniture ghosts demonic voices and so on you cant go wrong excellent mainstream horror entertainment,astonish
a lot of people have said this sequel is better and scarier than the original personally i think its just as equally creepy i think james wan is a great horror director he knows how to get the job done and actually scare me dead silence actually scared me when i saw it at the theater movies are period films and take place in the 1970s i love that it naturally looks like the 70s and not fake like tim burtons dark shadows this film features the amityville horror house in the beginning then the majority of it is about the enfield poltergeist in london england in 1977 the hodgson family begin to experience demonic and supernatural occurrences in their house mostly at night time the spirit haunting them seems to be bill wilkins the previous owner who died in the living room the youngest daughter janet becomes possessed and keeps telling the family to get out ed and lorraine warren are called to the scene to observe and report only will they find that the house is truly haunted or is it actually all a hoax if you love ghosts and demonic possession i highly recommend 2,astonish
2 2016 dir james wan  cast patrick wilson vera farmiga frances oconnor madison wolfe lauren esposito it is rare and refreshing to see horror films that contain a strong sense of good over evil but did it and its sequel although not as strong still pulls it off it opens with an interesting reference to the amityville horror before ed and lorraine warren are off to help a single mother and her three children deal with supernatural occurrences in their home vera farmiga as lorraine fears images of her husbands death and prefers to distance herself from her craft patrick wilson as ed supports his wifes decision but feels that their abilities are needed and when they are summoned to assist this family he is well aware of his wifes premonition frances oconnor plays the frustrated mother who learns quickly that strange horrific things are happening her youngest daughter is often sleepwalking and ending up in a chair that holds a dire history the oldest daughter awakens to the bed shaking as with the exorcist her son is troubled with the tent he has set up at the end of the hall that homes a demonic presence director james wan surpasses his saw franchise as well as insidious with this effective franchise that presents christianity in a positive meaningful manner that doesnt push the boundaries it also presents a heart felt relationship between ed and lorraine that is highlighted with an elvis presley hit with special effects that equal the original in its ghostly effects this becomes an entertaining horror film that promises a light at the end of a dark gloomy tunnel score 7  10,astonish
i dont scare easy but series manages to do that dthis movie is way better than the first one 1 was good tooi was watching this movie at home all alone i always turn down lights when watching movies the nun demon scared me to such an extent that i had to get up and turn on the lights of my room and the adjacent room as well lolactors are good well i love vera farmiga in all sort of charactersi feel very uneasy around nuns and clowns normally and when they showed the demon nun i was like omg believe me thats super scarythe set direction and the storyline is good however i felt that the closing of the movie ie the way warrens fight and contains the demon could have been longer and more elaborate vera farmiga as lorraine warren reveals the name of the nun demon and condemns her to hell and thats itso my verdict is go watch the movie i bet it will not disappoint you,astonish
when i saw the original movie i was extremely impressedi have studied many cases dealing with the paranormal and im very familiar with ed and lorraine warren also the cases they were involved in or so i thoughtwhen i heard that there was going to be a sequel i had a pretty good idea what the second one would be about as a clue was left in the first movie when lorraine said that a priest needed help for a case in long island new york that case turned out to be amityvillewhen i found out that this movie would be about the enfield poltergeist case in london england i spent a great deal of time scratching my head thinking the warrens never investigated or were involved in that caseit turned out that they were involved in the enfield case but not to the extent that you would see in they did visit the house but were only there briefly one of the original investigators who strangely enough wasnt even in this movie said that warrens showed up uninvitedbecause i know about the enfield case i noticed there was some bits in the movie which is not correct1 one of the investigators who wrote the book which talks about the enfield poltergeist case isnt even in the movie guy lyon playfair he shouldve been if your interested the name of the book is called this house is haunted and its worth reading believe me2 in the movie ed warren filled janet hodgson mouth with water to see if the voice could still speak that did happen but it was maurice grosse that did that and put tape on janets mouth so she couldnt spit out the water but the voice still spoke3 there is a scene where janet was floating about in midair now this did happen however what wasnt shown in the movie is that two independent witnesses also saw this happen outside the house its a shame this wasnt added because it would have added more credibility to the movie sticking to the facts of what actually happened during that incidentto give you a more accurate idea of what was happening during this case is to watch the enfield haunting or some of the youtube videos of what was going on around the 1970s and even some of the documentaries about itbecause it would give you a better idea of what actually happenedapart from the errors it was a brilliant sequel which had a lot more jump moments than in the original and also a lot longer than the original i personally have a lot of respect for the witnesses and the investigators which include ed and loraine in the actual caseif your looking for a great horror sequel this year look no further but if your interested in watching a movie adaption of the actual enfield poltergeist case this isnt it but still makes for great viewing anywayjames wan and the cast did a fantastic job to bring one of the most well documented cases which happened in the uk and not the usa to the big screen as i said in my summary not all paranormal cases are from the us this one came from the uk and there are a few more others as well also from the ukhappy viewing folks try not to get scared,astonish
i have been a huge fan of james wan ever since dead silence i didnt like saw franchise though i am not a huge fan of insidious series either because insidious 2 and 3 disappointed me big timei have liked it was like a breath of a fresh air for horror genre so i had decided to watch 2 not just because of its name but for the director james wanas we all know that form is temporary but class is permanent and james wan has proved yet again that he is a classto create a masterpiece horror movie like 2 that too after making a action movie like fast and furious 7 shows your classthe story revolves around lorraine and ed warren who travel to north london to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirit of bill willkins who died in a chair due to brain haemorrhage lorraine has her own fear and premonition of a demonic nun who threatened to kill her husband ed in real lifecan she stop her from killing ed this is what 2 is all about truly speaking 2 is scary as hell there is hardly any movie that made me jump over the seats 2 has succeeded in doing thisnow a days when we see any trailer of a horror movie 90 percent of the scary scenes of the movie are being revealed in it but james wan is a very clever customer he kept 90 of the scary scenes in the shelves which has not been revealed in any of its trailer you can only see it in the movietwo scenes that made me jump over the seats were when lorraine decides to check in the painting room and a demonic nun comes out from nowhere from the painting and a scene when janet watches tv and figure out a person sitting on a chair behind her and the remote control falls by itselfthose two scenes are the scariest scenes hollywood has ever witnessed2 is a sequel that is better and scarier than the original2 is engaging and scary from start to finishthe movie and demonic nun creature will be remembered for a long long timei loved everything about this movie being a horror buff you cant afford to miss this flick at any costnow i am eagerly waiting for 3kudos to james wan for making 2 and creating a creature like demonic nun a cinematic masterpiece,astonish
james wan is a big fan of horror its not always a surefire thing when a creator is someone who is so connected with a form of entertainment see also from this opening weekend joness warcraft but if a filmmaker is in tune with the material hes in love with and it works on all cylinders theres few pleasures to match it in mainstream cinema this is a major release done on a medium budget of 40 million and its done by someone whos clearly a geek for 70s horror but in a way that is classy and scary as all hell its not often to use the almost dvdcover level critic line but really 2 if youre open to it will scare the s out of youwans become so saavy with how to deal out suspense and it comes down to how he paces things this isnt a short movie and its longer than a lot of other movies of its genre at 134 minutes this is to the films benefit as it gives a lot of time to build up the characterizations wan gives us the two narratives of this family in england on poverty row basically and how the 11 year old girl is traumatized repeatedly by this undead entity named bill and lorraine warren vera farmigas own visions of a demon in a nuns outfit going after her and killing ed  this in part attached to that little known case in amityville ny we get so much time with the both sides that by the time the warrens come to england the movies halfway in and its time to get to the meat of the storya lot of what impresses me with 2 isnt so much the elements that were familiar with by now when it comes to demonicchristiandrenched horror we know that the people will come in to the house with the crosses out to get the ghosts or demons or whateveryourememberfromtheexorcist out and that there will be characters flailing about in the air and objects flying across rooms and terrified characters what matters is execution and wan and his cinematographer and production designer this is the 70s makes everything palpable and pop when a little girl is hiding under the covers and wan switches to a pov of the demonic entity coming in to the bedroom and towards her bed it feels terrifying because of how all of the shots are paced and cut together and how much we believe this young actress madison wolfe as janet hodgson outstanding especially in the quieter moments like on the swing with lorraine when they meetits a terrifying trip into the darker recesses of the human soul and it also comes down to how wan makes sure to depict the people and places with a degree of honesty in the drama that is outside of the junkbaby food modern horror audiences are used to it might be a lot sometimes to ask for quality acting or a budget higher than 5 million but it does make a difference and here wan takes his time with them and its clear they had preparation before they stepped into a story that involves family and love at the core i liked that part of it too that it emphasizes the bond of a family or a married couple in the face of evil and demons and the afterlife so while it deals in tropes of the genre  the audio recordings that reveal more than we first heard the trick video footage the otherworldly inner voice taking over a character in a real deeply troubling psychological sense than just the surface one too  it doesnt cheapen whats happening to themi felt invested in this family which also features a compelling performance by frances oconnor as the mother of the family and it pays off in set piece after set piece paced out with wonderful bits for character development including an acoustic elvis performance by patrick wilson so that by the time the gigantic thunderstorm climax comes we can still rock with the overthetop punches that of course didnt happen in the based on a true story and yes the climax is a little too long and features a cgi character that goes too far but i can forgive these flaws because of the other 2 hours that came before it which comes close to the likes of the babadook and it follows and even the witch as far as digging deep into what makes people tic and drawing out the atmosphere of things like a room or a hallway or a flooded basement and getting terror by simply holding on a shot sometimes for long enough for it to take on another meaning ie ed talking to bill back turned in closeup with the ghost out of focus but still in sight,astonish
watching the first movie on dvd was driven by the motivation to scare a friend who is known to be entertainingly frightened i am not a fun of horror movies because of their usual shallow storylines and cheap tricks plus the hype that surrounds them annoys me since a lot of them are just plain cashmaking machines eg the blair witch project so i was surprised that movie has this interesting storyline and lingering creepiness which was achieved without relying much on visual effects indeed oldschool darkness and shadows are scarier than tryinghard cgi monsters and after the movie we ended up scaring each other with that brilliant clap scene so i think this time its not bad after all to watch the sequel 2 in a movie theater given that we have the same director and of course the same people who portrayed the warrensthe second movie started with the controversial amityville horror case in which the warrens were also involved their most widely known case in these kind of supernatural cases people are divided between those who considered the case a hoax and those who believed it to be true aside from being dont care or neutral in this case the film takes the side of the warrens who considered that something demonic was behind the killings in our case as an audience we are more on the neutral side just plain listeners to one side of the investigation while seeking entertainment value somewhat akin to watching a cultural film and being immersed with the cultural point of view in questionfor the warrens it seems that the amityville horror case has greatly affected them especially lorraine who saw premonitions of her husbands death then after that the film moved to the other side of the atlantic ocean where something paranormal is happening in a public housing unit in london this is where the film developed the hodgson family and it did well enough to make us care about their struggles this is set in the late 1970s and remarkably the production values are high because the setting really looked like we are really in the 1970s and they showed photographs when the end credits rolled and the camera work is successful most of the time to create tension and suspense however whats missing in this film when compared to the first one is an iconic scare scene eg the clap scene we practically saw nothing new except a more stylish camera work more masterful suspense and a different storyline the good thing was that most of the scares are effective enough to elicit reaction from the audience in many occasions i laughed at the reaction in many false alarms and unexpected scare moments and that was fun and the high point of the film was particularly intense but quite short for our taste moreover we get to see a good attempt at combining horror and comedy eg when the hodgsons ran away from their house after a disturbing poltergeist activity james wan indeed improved in his skills as a director although not much in mixing sentimentality but i think that elvis presley tribute as a way of cheering up the hodgsons is okanother good stuff is the performance of the whole cast with the special mention of madison wolfe as janet  the main target of the poltergeists for possession  and frances oconnor as peggy hodgson  the struggling mother of four who was at her wits end to provide for her children then as usual we got good performances from vera farmiga as lorraine warren and patrick wilson as ed warren even though we more or less saw related scare scenes before from other movies eg the exorcist many of the scares are still effective however it is during the time when it attempts to use more cgi that the film loses its effectivity eg the crooked man scene in contrast we experienced more chills when a shadow was employed eg the nun scene where the demonic in a form of a nuns shadow slowly reaches for an eerie nun portrait and places itself behind it it is in the oldschool style where wans technique is most effective and in this manner i find the first film to be more creepy than this one and also the big difference is that in the first one we dont have much idea about the villain until the climax but in this one we more or less have a good idea about the villains identity and how it looked like given lorraines premonitions and an image from one of eds dreams and finally we find a haunted farmhouse with centuriesold tale and more ominous villain to be more creepy than a suburban tale with a less compelling villain background story however given the suburban setting the feat is remarkable and we had fun watching it,astonish
one can literally count on the fingers on one hand the great horror films that are intelligent and yet not derivative james wan has honed his arsenal of horror aesthetics through the years and he reached his most potent level with in 2013 one of the reasons wan succeeds so well in this genre is that he knows the audience  when to tighten the piano wire noose and when to let you take in a breath the scares are simple yet elegant and damn well effective it is a tough act to follow a little personal story firsti am an avid reader a habit that began when my mom gave me a few enid blyton books when i was in p3 but the moment i hit sec 1 i told myself i need to start reading adult fiction i remember going to times at lucky plaza a short walk from my school and picking out a book to start on my next reading journey i picked up jay ansons the amityville horror i figured by reading this genre it meant i am all grownup it scared the living daylights out of me to think that all the stuff actually happened really put the fear of god in me ended with ed and lorraine being called to the amityville haunting and that is where 2 begins there is no need for any synopsis because the sequel adheres to its predecessor in form and structure it is yet another haunted house this time from across the pond in london a nice family is being tormented nightly shenanigans ensue all levels of hell break loose an air of familiarity breeds  a little girl possessed speaking in a husky menacing voice uncanny levitation  all too familiar if you have seen the demon possession film the exorcist you have seen them all that isnt a slight against it merely an observation as much as wan can scare us it is the quiet passages that he also excels in we understand the pains of the tortured family and the relationship between demonologist and clairvoyant ed and lorraine warren respectively vera farmigas lorraines tender exterior holds a steadfast sense of justice at bay her warm performance counterbalances a patrick wilsons ed who is headstrong in his fight with the demonic monstrosity their screen chemistry feels natural and livedin it is precisely because wan makes us fall in love with the characters first that the horror of what happens to them become emotionally unbearable imho where it fumbles for me is the familiarity of the narrative i see the usual scares coming and none of them resembles the original in terms of elegance and simplicity i am also of the opinion that great horror movies do not rely a lot on cgi take a good look at the good ones in the past few years  it follows the babadook and the witch the moment i see cgied ghosts my mind starts to tune off heres looking at you crimson peak i am also of the opinion that great horror movies dont have a runtime of over 2 hours my wife would say chop chop curry pok and get it done fast and furious 2 could have used a faster pace to get to the meat still this is a solid piece of horror filmmaking culminating in a fullblown final act of symphonic terror in which so much is at stake i would definitely welcome a third part but james wan needs to choose the next case from the warrens files wisely,astonish
2  i would like to start my review by stating the fact that  this is not at all a usual horror movie we watch every 2nd month of the year full of clich  usual scares and where every story seems to be same as other rather its a horror  drama i mean the horror part of the movie is as much as important as the drama part is its not always about the ghost  sometimes its about the love  trust and friendship of a couple  sometimes its about sticking together with your family in hard times and sometimes its about your faith  to believe more than you see first of all its a really good improvement on a very good movie but i would like to say about a couple of things i dont like  obviously its about spirits and ghosts  so we cant always find logic in the activities of those spirits and ghosts  i mean who knows whatever ghost do why exactly they do there is not always a reasoning to it still i am not exactly convinced with the objective of the ghost in this movie let just leave this point here as to elaborate it i have to discuss the story which i dont want to do the 2nd thing is that  why exactly a ghost tell his name to a person if he knows that by the name that human can control him again to understand what m trying to say  you have to watch the film  apart from these two thing there are mostly good things in the movie which i m gonna discuss now james wan is currently the best horror movie director working in hollywood he is also directing the upcoming aquaman in the dc universe and i was a little bit scared about this fact  but after watching i am totally convinced that he can make a great superhero movie too i have seen all of his movies  saw was nice for the genre  dead silence was his worst  death sentence was pretty nice  insidious was better then just good  was very good  insidious 2 was better then the first part and then furious 7 which i guess the whole world liked its great to watch how he developed as a director and m so glade that he decided to give importance to the drama as much as the horror part its a long movie  about 2hrs and 15mins  which is way higher then the usual horror movie of one and a half hour because as i said its not about the ghost always yes it ask for a little patience  but it gets paid off  at least for a movie lover like me who dont need everything in hurry and can give time and chance to the movie to get you dissolve in it a question can be were there enough horror scenes i would say yes there are a lot of  yes it depends on the amount of horror you consume within yourself  i mean how much a ghost can make you scare i personally got one jump of on your seat scene as well as my friend but two girls sitting just next to my seat had seen the whole movie with holding each other out of fear you can judge a lot from that another thing what the movie did different that  it is set up in england and not america which made it a different experience let me warn you  if you are watching this in english pleas watch it in a theater which provides subtitle  otherwise it would be difficult to understand the british accentthe people of england behave in a very different way as compared to americans they have more humor and are gentle in behaving there is a very good comic scene in the movie where two police officers see the chair moving by itself and came out of the house saying they cant help as this thing is beyond them that particular scene couldnt have been possible if the movie has been set in america because in america the police officers are much more serious in their behavior and that scene was not the only light moment in the movie the movie was full of such scenesvera fermiga and patrick wilson as warren husband  wife are great again they trust each other and work great as a team they also care very much for each other as they know what they do is a life threatening task there was a scene where patrick wilson sing a song for the haunted family to make the situation light for the time being  and at that moment the way vera looked at her singing husband  her expression shows that how much lucky she feels herself to find ed as his husband that particular scene is a proof that james wan can even direct a romantic filmthe british cast was great too the girl who played janet the possessed girl and the boy who played his sweet brother billy were the best cinematography was really good  and the period setting was great also the music director has done a nice job its a great horror movie about a ghost  but also a sweet movie about a sweet family and also a soothing movie about a lovely couple who like to help others by using the extraordinary power they have m very selective when it comes to a horror film but now series is among my favorite ones  along with ring series  insidious series  oculus  exorcist and it follows 8210 by anup apu kumar,astonish
pretty good but awfully familiar not to mention long hybrid of the exorcist and the amityville horror about paranormal investigators trying to unravel the mystery of a marilyn manson lookalike haunting in london at christmas 1977 which gave the film a wonderful and unique setting possibly its strongest asset the film has an effectively creepy atmosphere good visuals and works best when creating a sense of dread and fear but too often it will sink to relying on cheap jump scares most of which are shown in the trailerthe acting is top notch all around especially the young kids which makes it as good as if not better than the original which is no small feat especially in the horror genre an interesting and unusual twist occurs three quarters of the way in when proof is found of the young girl faking the entire ordeal for the publicity and fame it could bring her family but for all those things working in its favour it cant distract me from noticing an overwhelming feeling of deja vu,astonish
if you liked the first one this one does a good job at hitting the scare meter heights as its predecessor did some scenes are pretty full on james wann has once again done a great job at creating a lot of tense scenes specially through the use of some pretty good camera work although its a bit long for a horror film which is my main criticismit still manages to keep the audience on edge right till the end as we left the cinema judging by the audiences reaction it will be a movie that will be received by horror fans might not be for everyone but if youre a fan of the horror genre and considering the it is a genre that is slowly dying unfortunately2 definitely stands up high with the original above the rest 45 stars,astonish
what james wan has done for horror films through his directions is that he has somewhat managed to bring the shock factor or rather the jump scares to good useeven though they have been played out since forever but that said however was in absolute total contradiction of horror tactics altogether the eerie setting and the background score and the fabulous performances made the move a glorious return of the horror genre with respect from both critics and viewers alike that saidnot only does 2 looses its phenomenal status as an anticipated squeal to the most celebrated horror film of the recent era but it brings clichd horror tactics back to the screen once again leading to nothing but some very little scaremediocre jump scaresunnecessary cgi and okay performances brings the end to what could have been a glorified franchisei am not disappointed on james wan directionhe does what he does bestthe cinematographythe set design everything is apt but it just does not pan out as you want it to beanother major disappointment for me was joseph bisharas rather dull background score all in alli had anticipated this movie for a real long time and the past week was the most difficult as i just knew this was going to be a bigger masterpiece unlike its predecessor and i just could not wait to watch it but alasit just was a dreadful experience absolutely disheartened,astonish
im not a big fan of movies and their many many spinoffs they try hard but dont deliver they use too many jump scares and really really bad cgi i laughed at the ending because like in the first movie they really needed to wrap things up and didnt really care about the plot anymorethe children acted brilliantly but i couldnt stop laughing during the part with the playing elvis songs on the guitar part whyi can only say one good thing about this movie annabelle and the nun are a lot worse and i bet more bad ones are on their way as long as there are people out there who love over the top bad cgi and jump scares not me i like scary movies but i want them to be original and actually with a good storyline and not the regular 2010 cgi which is in every horror movie these days,astonish
nothing authentic or believable in this comedy of errors,astonish
this is what a horror movie should be like in this sequel just like the part one you are not forced to sit through boring scenes before things happen things kicks of right at the start of the movie hell you are spooked even just three minutes inanother great feature about this movie is the sound and camera works they are organized in such a way that they add to the entire creepiness of the movieso all in all if you are a fan of the first movie you wouldnt be disappointed with this sequel because it is an improvement on the first however if you are new to this series then my advise is you see the first before you see this sequel,astonish
1 had left me trembling but annabelle left me disappointed so when was announced i was eagerly waiting for its release the movie started off well but left me disappointment the storyline was good and patrick wilson and vera fermiga were once again brilliant a james wan horror flick is seldom without scary scenes and jump off the seat stuff and is no exception the disappointing factor was the end which i feel was a little too stretched and easy the movie could had ended 15 minutes earlier and in the end i was waiting for the dramatics to end overall the movie is worth a watch with some great scenes,astonish
its not only a movie that scares us it also didnt fail to gave us a good story an excellent plot to demonstrate what really happened to the most documented supernatural case which was the haunting of the hodgson family back in 1977 nothing in this film bored me and the ambianc was really scary the jumpscares were new and a lot of scenes were really unusual to happen in a horror film the actors did a very great job they really fit in to their roles im glad that the sequel of exceeded the quality of its predecessor and it also exceeded my expectation though my expectation was already high the trailers released were excellent for not showing the entire story they just shown enough to promote the film it is my first time actually to have a ghostmovie to my favorite list i am really a fan of horror movies and i usually liked a killerzombiemovie but this film really killed it it is the scariest movie so far looking forward to 3 already,astonish
lorraine and ed warren travel to north london to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by a malicious spirit the brilliantly terrifying is the second highest grossing horror movie of all time the first being the exorcist this film was genuinely the best horror film i had ever seen in a long time and james wan is in my point of view the best director working in horror today so i was really excited to see this second instalment this movie makes a perfect followup to the original s lesser known case plus the movie starts with a certain amityville house yes that amityville here the enfield case is probably one of the best documented most studied and most contested hauntings in existence and in british history the real recordings of paranormal investigator ed warren interviewing the entity through janet live at the end of 2 and its difficult not to let chills run down your spine nonetheless director james wan offers its potential fans a helping of reinsurance to go along with the fear if there are ghosts and demons out there then god must be out there as well james wan who directed saw and insidious is a horror filmmaker of such skills that even when he makes a bythebook hauntedhouse story its easy to feel a hint of admiration for his talent beneath your tingling spine vera farmiga and patrick wilson couple really ground the film in realism as their backstory and relationship are really touching and heartfelt being more than a horror movie its about marriage and being with somebody that understands you the realistic family story grounds the film and makes it better than your average horror film horror lives in the unknown it hides in abandoned asylums in catacombs in cabins and haunted manors these are safe places to die you dont want to die maybe dont do an ouija board stay home and watch netflix instead nothing can find you there except james wan wan is a modern horror maestro who brings the fear home to you all these events take place in the very real world occupied by everyday people trying to get on with their life weve all been children hiding under the duvet from whatever hid under our bed in the dark even now home alone on a rainy day weve sat on our couch and wondered what creaked the floorboards in the seemingly empty room next to us wans fear construction is effortless his best moments lie in the silence between scares he also has a sense of the audience of their rhythm and pulse of how to manipulate a moment so that hes practically controlling your breathing he became a master of the face he must have a card in his office readingall you need to make a hit horror film is one truly awful face that face the face thats staring through the window staring through the dark the face thats coming to get you eventually james wan again proves with this film that he knows how to use a jump scare those are meant to get you this man knows how to built tension until it feels insurmountable hes also a wizard of timing ie he toys with us by throwing so routinely unsettling images at us like lets say a toy firetruck that starts to move ion its own then letting that omen menace pass at which point the movie will simply pause stopping dead in its tracks its right there in the middle of that storm of quiet that our anxiety starts to rush in finally its truly the craft performances and the writing that make this film a billion years ahead of all films of its kind out right now this film is really good its scary suspenseful the tension is real and a lot of that is due to a brilliant cinematography overall james wan knows his craft and all he has to do to bring you true horror is take you home where you think youre safe from harm sweet sweet dreams,astonish
wow just wow i mean this movie starts off a bit slow but believe when i say it is not boring a bit never in ma entire movie watching experience have i seen grown men and womenand i mean matured scream and run out of a cinema i had goosebumps this movie is epic it lived to its genre i mean the 1st one was scarybut trust me this one is so scary you might sleep with your lights on after watching the director did an excellent job and the acting was stop on amazing wow dont even know what to say if u havent seen this movie then you need tothat is if you enjoy thrillers its definitely not for the people who get frightened easily,astonish
2 is one of those extremely rare horror sequels that doesnt fall victim to copying its predecessor while 2 isnt free of clichs and isnt better than its predecessor its a really solid horror film separate from the original 2 is chilling without relying on jump scares features really good character development despite being a tad familiar this film may prove that james wan is the modern king of horror because every horror film he does is solidone thing to learn from this film is that while jump scares are a cheap way to get scares they can be very effective when used sparingly many modern horror films rely solely on jump scares to scare the audience but this film has a truly chilling tone and many scenes are terrifying without jumping the audience that being said there are jump scares littered throughout this film but wan is clever when he uses them and is often effective when he uses them im proud that most horror films dont jump me that being said multiple times watching this film i found myself jumpedone major reason this film succeeds is because of the character development which really helps the audience care about the characters every single character in the film is well fleshed out and given a moment of relatability even the ghosts in the film are generally scary and have a really good design however the films characters represent one of the films major problems the fact that its based on true events after seeing this film it would seem to say that the phrase based on true events was only included for dramatic effectthe story of the film is based on the actual events of the enfield poltergeist in england in the late 70s but the problem is that half the film uses moments from that investigation and the other half feels like an exorcist rip off its unfortunate because theres a terrifying story despite the evidence that it was a hoax in the enfield poltergeist that gets lost in the shuffle simply put if the filmmakers hadnt felt the need to match the exorcist the films ending may not have felt so different from the rest of the filmin the end for horror buffs this may be the best horror film of the year if nothing better comes along for those who want to see a great horror film regardless of its faithfulness to the actual events this is a great film but for those who want a faithful adaptation of the enfield poltergeist this film definitely takes some liberties that being said this film is genuinely scary which is rare today and above that is just a good film in general so its most definitely worth seeing,astonish
my daughter and i are horror freaks we loved the first and this installation is even better the atmosphere this movie generates starts from the very beginning and builds all the way to the climactic omg ending we were absolutely exhausted and thoroughly pleased i was really impressed with wans portrayal of 1970s london too wilson and farmiga reprise their roles of ed and lorraine warren brilliantly and madison wolfe portrays janet hodgson disturbingly well wan is a true horror genius if you like jumps  there are plenty if you like creepy eerie music full of darkness and suspense  there are plenty well done mr wan please please please give us another installment of ed and lorraine warren,astonish
 may contain strong spoilers this is my personal experience my personal point of viewperspective and my personal opinion and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this worldthis is one more of hollywoods productions where it is clear that they learn more and more about how to entertain the audience the way that more and more movies only uses the sounds of the surroundings and the natural sound effects and keeps it quiet around that brings a more authentic touch and a deeper presence throughout the haunting is taking place whenever wherever and with whomever the police is coming at night and as in other horror movie and motions pictures overall the events and incidents suddenly stops here oh no it keeps on the family of the warrens is haunted at the same time as the new case comes in place the first spiritual experience in the warrens residence is of a nun the police says minutes before to peggy that the priest of the church is a friend and that the priest will call the hodgsons the religion and church blends together and is used as a line of argument wonderful the production team has made an excellent research and at the same time a nod to the horror movies of the 70s where the then modern design were natural the production team takes the same thing and push it a notch in modern daylight to give this movie a splendid design they uses for example a girl with the 70s haircut and clothing as is natural of course and puts some of the classical camera production in place just as it was in the 70s there is some small camera movement representing the movement of the human body that is just oh it is so legislative and enhancing this and a knowingly and consciously work to make the camera slidings and movements accommodative all through this named topics geniuswe may have one of the few sequels that beats the original one here yes actually we may have thatto come bock to the beginning of this review oh yes there is some hefty signs and traces from poltergeist the tv starts to go crazy and my house there is also some nods to the production behind poltergeist in one scene in poltergeist the chairs around the kitchen table is behind the scenes put up in a very fast way from one moment to another all in one take in alsoall in one take a chair is set in one place the camera is rolling and the girl is actingzooming out the chair has been moved a whole room is shut down because it was there the activity were more than demonic and there is the line of argument from poltergeist the babadook has taken its toll on the crew here suddenly a presence is coming alive from a toy and childrens song as taken straight out of the babadook the classical of warlock has maybe been been seen what is the name of the demon it even rains and has an relationship to a book just as in warlock i really appreciate the way the whole team behind this movie has gone through and in depth of old horror movies and taken some small things some small bits and pieces here and there and made them their own clap clap yes pun intended to there is so many little story lines incidents and events throughout that i could write for hours an enormous twist that is within the spiritual world bill is himself haunted by an evil presence making him do the things he do to the family later on suddenly there is proof that the girl is faking it all an hoax enjoy the elvis impersonation the crew taking documentations and the love between the warrens as mrs warren is scared to death pun intended of losing her husbandover to the movie as a product  the production  art direction set decoration cinematography and production design is top notch i was enjoying nay i was feasting on the astonishment of this motion picture somebody get an ambulance is a excellent way of going from let us say chapter 1 to chapter 2 the frozen picture the terror in the mothers scream and the echoing is accentuating this whole process just as in a saga chapter 1 is finished off to chapter 2 and then chapter 3 goes off with the lyrics of i started a joke spot on  the actors  solid good and realistic vera farmigas scream in the beginning of the film is horror chilling and icing to the bone the little girl madison wolfe is shaking and stirring things up here i could feel her horror academy award in the future  the story  a house that is haunted a well known and used story and they make is workoh they make it work  entertainment  chilled horrified scared  age  15 or even 18 due to the depth of religious and spiritual level in which the evil is presented82 out of 10,astonish
i was looking forward to a actual good horror movie for quite some time now and here comes 2 which is actually an effective horror movie it isnt one of the most horrifying movie i have seen but its is executed quite well james wan who has been directing horror movie after horror movie has got his formula down now plus for a horror movie the budget this time around is quite high for a horror movies thanks the success of the previous movie three things that make this movie work is the imagery and how they utilize the set pieces and environments to build tension it really brings out the horror mainly because of the creepy imagery the second is how it goes in a quite clever direction and execution when it comes to the twist and turns it actually makes the audiences try to think and guess certain scenarios and the revelations was done in a quite smart manner the third is the acting even the child actors managed to pull it off which is a key factor when it comes to a movie such as this i am a bit numb to horror movies as this stage but there were few parts where i was actually a bit tense some of the audiences reactions were just priceless the guy next to me had his whole face covered and was sliding down on his chair while saying this is too scary usually when it comes to horror sequels its usually not as good as the originalbut good job james wan the evil entity i couldnt help but think of marilyn manson 810,astonish
sequels often carry a burden of expectationsbenchmark set by their earlier movies was executed amazingly well even with the standard scary stuff and 2 stuck to the story flow approach of its predecessor but yet bringing in the novelty in terms of brand new location and a subplot this franchisee is definitely beating insidious hands down story 810 based on a real life incident in late 70s  a family of single mother and four kids in north london is terrorized to hell by a supposed ghost often possessing one of the daughters warrens are called all the way from us to take a look at that and report back to the church their search encounters series of events that eventually discover the genesis of the hodgson familys nightmare the climax is particularly well written with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seats horror 610 i found the horror element comparatively less in this one compared to partly also because some of the scenes were too predictive as we not just seen them in the first movie but other horror movies as well however it doesnt seem to be a mistake as much as it seems a deliberate attempt to stick to what worked in the first part and focus more on the story telling it is the same dilemma that super hero movies face  whether they want to focus on outoftheworld action sequences or focus on a compelling story acting 910 patrick wilson and vera farmiga have given stellar performances here particularly patrick has made himself more noticeable in this one frances oconnor as the single mother and madison wolfe her daughter had the most challenging roles which they executed very well the expressions of agony fear anger disgust have been nailed to perfection and is particularly remarkable direction 810 james wan has stuck pretty much to what worked in the first movie the direction is good overall the scenes have been conceptualized well especially the climax has been directed extremely well with some unpredictable sequences the movie could have been a bit shorter as the first half of the movie is a bit of a drag overall 810 2 did just marginally well compared to its predecessor however it would be a bit unfair to keep comparing it with the first part independently the movie is really good and presents some real good quality horror,astonish
its a well dramatized horror flick some of the scenes are very scary its a must watch for those who love watching horror flicks horror scenes look natural as there are no forced horror scenes direction of james wan is awesome which makes movie more than average storyline is simple moreover its ordinary but the way all the things are presented is awesome there is no need to see its prequel as the movie has a completely separate storypatrick wilson and vera farmigo have done fabulous acting climax is very scary and holds you still on the seat story could have been better as it doesnt explain the cause of events in the movie,astonish
director james wan has once again provided audiences with a brilliant work of the macabre and supernatural from the writing to the directing to the acting and cinematography is on par with if not better than the first sometimes the best stories are true ones and although elements of the story have to be fictionalized in order to construct a cinematic narrative grounding movies in the real work of ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson vera farmiga infuses a dynamic emotional response that directly impacts the increased frightening nature of these films one of the observations that i appreciate most about not only this but the predecessor is not relying upon the jumpscare to curdle the blood are jump scares part of the movie well of course what fun would a horror film be without the entire theatre gasping for breath jumping or screaming together but wan goes beyond the jump scare and channels his inner hitchcock to build suspense and intrigue the horror film is best appreciated in a group setting it is a genre that specifically engages the audience on a visceral level wan is truly a master at his craft and i love witnessing how he continues to prove his ability to develop creative horror filmsfollowing the increasing trend for a film including but not limited to horror to begin with an elaborate prologue starts with a fantastic moving shot of the famous eyelet windows of the 112 ocean avenue house in amityville often filmed from the outside this shot sequence takes place inside the attic a much more intimate feel this was an excellent choice for establishing the case that launched ed and lorraine warren into the public eye there have been numerous movies and documentaries based on the arguably most infamous haunting in the united states so it was not necessary for wan to spend too much time on it it is however a very important scene because the plotcase of is directly related to the experience that the warrens went through during the lutz investigation beyond the establishing a connection between the amityville and enfield cases beginning with the warrens in the middle of the 112 ocean avenue investigation allows for wan to visually show how and why the warrens would seek a selfimposed sabbatical from supernatural and demonic investigations moreover this sequence of events that provides copious amounts of plot development material are also instrumental in significant contributions to character development although this prologue lasts less than ten minutes it contains prolific information vital to the plot of it should not be of surprise that wan uses the camera very strategically to tell this visually driven story from the rule of thirds to lighting to creative use of angles and movement the camera is instrumental in setting the macabre mood of the film one of the visual storytelling elements that hitchcock was most known for especially in psycho is using the cameras placement and angle to foreshadow something or someone wan takes a page from the hitchcock handbook and utilizes the camera movement in such a way that you are predisposed to feeling certain that something or someone is about to appear or emerge from the shadows but your game is thrown off when that doesnt happenbut then totally happens when you least expect it throughout the diegesis you will encounter moment when the characters are faced with inner demons that parallel or symbolize the actual evil entities in the film having this subplot concurrent to the foreground aids in creating and maintaining an emotional connection to the characters shocking the audience both emotionally and physically by eliciting dynamic and comprehensive responses to the horror on screen the film becomes an immersive experiencethat is the brilliance behind this dark and sinister talebeyond the exceptional direction by wan part of what makes franchise so successful is the exquisite casting patrick wilson insidious and vera farmiga bates motel are perfectly cast in these films from what i have read about the real ed and lorraine warren wilson and farmiga respectively stay true to the reallife people they are portraying while adding in the necessary acting skills necessary to increase the impact and believability of the film the quality of the acting that wilson and farmiga bring to the film is outstanding sometimes a horror film can have an compelling plot but the actors are so uninteresting that it prohibits the story from making the impression that it should wilson and farming make the characters of ed and lorraine warren interesting to watch and add a performance quality to the film that keeps your attention the whole time the degree to which they add a sincere care for the victims of hauntings to their respective characters is refreshing and will stay with yowling after the movie closes as the warrens are reoccurring characters in franchise it is vitally important that they are as interesting to watch as the plot itself since their cases are the inspiration for the whole franchise at least put to this pointif there is one negative element in the film it is the weak showdown not weak in that it was anticlimactic or uninteresting but that it felt a little rushed at 2hrs and 15mins the film is longer than the average horror film so it was not necessary to rush the climax of the film it certainly does not mitigate the experience of the movie but i feel that it could have been a little more intense that being said if you are looking for an excellent movie to kickoff your weekend then this one is it,astonish
being a huge fan of horror movies but kinda sceptic about how good another movie about paranormal activities would be i was also afraid that it would be disappointing james wan made sure that it was notwill this movie scare you yes it will but not every minute there is lots of build up to those really scary momentsis there anything to hate about this movie yes there is as many times before the term based on an real event is simply not true the background story has been generously altered in order to make a loop from amityvlle to enfield should this bother you not if you are looking for a great movie instead of an honest documentary,astonish
great movie i enjoyed this and director james wan insidious saw dead silence is becoming one of my favorite directors not just in mainstream horror movies but mainstream directors in general i love how this film isnt just cheap jump scares like many of today horror films it actually builds up the tension i thought the first was great and this is a good example of how to do a horror movie and how a sequel can actually be better than the 1st in my opinion i actually saw this movie with my dad and he fell asleep but i thought it was more than entertaining and worth staying awake even though i thought the crooked man  aka james wan auditioning for slender man didnt need to be in the film and this film could have been trimmed down 20 minutes also the acting by vera farmiga orphan and patrick wilson watchmen works well and the two work well together patrick wilsons acting wardrobe character development and 70s sideburns almost had me thinking it really was 1977 lol in addition great movie future horror filmmakers take some notes great film this review is brought to you by boogie buddha and remember dont just get down but get boogie thank you for reading and i hope you have an amazing day as always ,astonish
ok this movie is a great scare movie you hardly get to witness a second horror movie that is as good as the first movie if not better i gave it a ten because of the scare factor and that the characters in the movie set the atmosphere that guided us down a road less followed its one thing to sit and conjure up strange noises and knocks and pings throughout the night and then account them as being paranormal but as soon as you get serious about what you are doing knowing all too well that what comes through could without a doubt kill you its then the word paranormal becomes a welcome mat compared to the actual being that is in the room with you with that said dont be too critical because you will come out of this experience in the movie as just a movie and nothing else sit back relax while you can and savor that moment because as soon as you dive into the movie you will be scared and you will have images burned into your mind dont be surprised if you get home and begin to leave the lights on because this movie is that frightful,astonish
whoever says that this sequel is not as good as the first film is lying it is so common for the sequels to be far worse than the originals that it has become a habit to the viewers to judge them without even noticing them not this time is not just not worse than the first it is precisely as good as the firstgreat story great acting smart dialogues smart jump scares dark atmosphere everything you need in a horror film i liked the fact that the movie makes you care for the protagonists also i loved the way it keeps you interested all the way throughout it never bored never relaxed always on guard the quality of the movie is a james wans magic wand has done its miracle once more the trap of relying on the first movies success has been avoided and that is because of wans love and dedication to his work its about time that we become less harsh on good horror films and stop judging them for being what they are they are horror films and we should judge them as that exactly if i wanted to watch the godfather or citizen cane i wouldnt be watching a horror film stop comparing horror films with dramas on the other hand even with this type of judgment this movie deserves a 910 because its a damn good movie congratulations james wan youve done it again,astonish
i am going to be completely honest with you guys according to me this was one of the best horror movie i have watched till date just forget word to mouth this is seriously great coming towards the main subject matter the movie is completely different from the first installment reason it is filled with excessive terror you just cant relax a single moment while watching it it makes you anticipate for the futurethe actors did an incredible job hats off to you both patrick and vera for portraying the warrens so flawlessly as mentioned earlier the movie is really frightening you can just feel it happening under your skin what i liked the most was the background effects and music composition they did render pretty descent computer generated imagesnot for a single moment did i get bored or found the story laggingwatch it guys its really greatps movies such as the shining the exorcist etc are not to be compared while watching  2,astonish
dear team that was the most horror film of the year 2016 till datethe film was more a strong chemistry between loraine and ed warren i must say that patrick wilson once again wins over the show with his splendid performance besides peggy was also good in body language i just could not get the point how ed at the seeing the cross of reels in the bus got the sense that the spirit in that house was inhuman  and what was the reason of listening to the two audio reels  the adventurous thing was the performance of small kid janet that really shocked in some scenes the film however was not more horror than its prequel but it was a treat to watch due to excellent performances of all cast most especially ed and loraine,astonish
i am pleasantly surprised by the current rating of the movie i honestly believe it is worth it personally i gave it a 10 because i want to encourage other studios to scrutinize and study this film in order to prevent themselves from making unworthy moviesthe plot itself is not the most original piece out there but it features great atmosphere a couple of laughs here and there an unexpected exorcism and a haunting literally presencei am a fan of the horror genre it has been quite disappointing to see studios being utterly insensitive to change and to always toy around with the same concept a remote house with a dark past and a family tortured by an entitywhat i like in is that seemingly thirdperson actors become the protagonists it is not only about the familys suffering anymore they are represented as the saviors spreading their glimmer of hope the second installment did not fail my expectations several jump scares and a fey presence which you can carry with you in your memory a few movies have managed to accomplish that especially to a fan of the genre like myself to date it was the grudge the ring drag me to hells gypsy woman and dead silences mary shaw i do admit however that the resemblance of the ghost to marilyn manson was uncanny that is not to say that the ghost does not remain scary its portrayal is complemented with an assertive look symmetrically outlined from the nuns outfit for those who have watched the movie they will know that i am currently misusing the ghost word but i do not wish to spoil anythingadditionally i really liked the addition of a twist it did not ruin the pace of the plot nor did it bring any confusion rather it was a twist that motivated certain actions i will use one word to explain this again primarily directed to the ones who have watched it pawnone thing i disliked was two scenes with cgi the exorcism and the crooked man the crooked man was an unnecessary addition  it would have been better if the actual entity was used instead plus the artistic look was quite poor and i could occasionally discern motion capture exaggerations  this might probably come from the fact that i develop video games and have thus been exposed to lots of cgi animations and special effectsoverall an enjoyable horror film and with a worthy placement in my list of recommendations i do wish the same entity is reused somehow in upcoming installments  it appeared too powerful to be cast away like that plus it was very well made so it would be a waste if it does not get recycled at some point,astonish
james wan is the best horror director working today the man knows the genre so well that he can easily manipulate the atmosphere to terrorize the viewer such a masterful sense of control that he can easily control your fear with this sequel wan has created 3 very successful and engaging horror series paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren are called to england to investigate whether or not the enfield family are plagued by deadly spirits or if the family is lying and the whole thing is a hoax we as the viewer know the truth we are with this family when the strange occurrences start happening yet wan cleverly depicts such things in a shroud of mystery when the warrens arrive to make them question if what is happening is real or not should they leave thinking its fake the terror we feel for the family will be even greater i believe to be one of the best horror films of the last decade and its a hard act to follow wan tries to up the ante here with the sequel the scares are more frequent the demonsghosts more creepy and the tension is tighter i still believe the original to be slightly better because it was fresh and the atmosphere was simply brilliant but wan does marvellous things with the sequel look to any other horror film and the artistic merit fails by comparison wan doesnt need blood and guts or even cheap jump scares to make the viewer scared he simply builds tension plays with our expectations and uses creative camera techniques to make the film memorable one particular scene that stands out in my mind is when ed first interviews janet the little girl who is the focus of the terror the demonghost will not communicate unless they look away so ed turns his back to janet wan focuses the camera on ed while janet is out of focus in the background its one static shot where the out of focus character slowly and eerily changes into the demonghost we never get a good luck at the thing but we can see enough to know something is eerily off effectively creepy with the simplest camera technique what other horror director would do something like that today highly recommended for the horror fan and people who really adore the original wan has stepped out of the horror genre and has had success fast seven but he loves the genre too much to abandon it the man knows how to direct a horror film and he directs this one extremely well my one complaint is that the film is long clocking in well over 2 hours it feels like it at times id say to maybe take out one of the scares but i love each one add to the fact that most of the effects are practical and it makes me appreciate the film even more,astonish
2 four and a half stars out of fivesequel to the 2013 blockbuster supernatural fright flick once again directed by james wan who also helmed the original saw insidious 1  2 and furious 7 it was written by carey and chad hayes who also wrote the original film as well as wan and david leslie johnson vera farmiga and patrick wilson reprise the leading roles as paranormal investigators lorraine and ed warren this time theyre investigating an aggressive poltergeist thats haunting a london family in 1977 the script is once again said to be based on a true story the film also costars frances oconnor madison wolfe franka potente and simon mcburney its received good reviews from critics once again and its also another hit at the box office the first movie made over 300 million on a 20 million budget i found it to be a more than decent followupthe movie begins with ed and lorraine warren wilson and farmiga investigating the amityville murders in 1974 to see if a demonic presence was really responsible for the horrendous slayings while experiencing a vision of the crimes lorraine foresees eds murder by a tragic impaling the story then flashes forward 3 years to london where a single mother oconnor and her four children are being terrorized by a supernatural presence ed and lorraine are called to investigate the haunting but lorraine is extremely concerned about eds safetythe movie is once again outstandingly crafted by wan its got great atmosphere its disturbingly creepy and the jump scares are really well done the story is once again intriguing scary and filled with good character development its a little slowpaced at first but the film makes up for it in the second half theres not really much to complain about but still i didnt find it quite as memorable as the original moviewatch our movie review show movie talk at httpsyoutubecnnfzjvyqic,astonish
storyline doesnt have much telling to it in fact only starts making sense towards the end of the movie but which the filmmakers wished as the thrill rather appeals more as the lack of itcharacters ed and lorraine have again done a wonderful duo as the unbending exorcists however some characters like the boogeyman didt make sensescares are mostly sound scare watched it in a dolbyatmos soundeffect theater and must say wont appeal much to the seasoned horror connoisseurs who would rather hope for a story that makes them think all while giving them goosebumps with the possibilities stories which just float around for days after watchoverall in true sense this sequel sadly falls short on multiple aspects,astonish
2 was a really good sequel to the first film all the way throughout the film there were a lot of jump scares which made me on the edge of my seat for the entire film the characters were very interesting and it was good that they had chosen a different case location for the film so that it wasnt just more happening to the family that was in the first film the only thing that i thought wasnt good with the second film was that i thought one of the monsters used was quite childish and made them parts of the film not scary as much i didnt think that they needed to add the character to the film as the plot already had enough going on,astonish
since im a huge fan of the first film reading about it in empire and seeing the trailers i felt the need to see it i saw it at my local cinema last night and my first word for it is wowthe story was powerful with plenty of investment in the characters it literally kept me hooked through out start to finish the structure worked brilliantly for the scares and dramatic moments there was plenty of focus on both spoiler alert i did notice that wan has used an idea or two from insidious with lorraine entering the void to communicate with the dead in her visions but yet it still worksat some points it literally made my spine shiver the scares were very effective although a spoiler coming be warned the image of the crooked man i thought looked a bit silly but it doesnt ruin the filmthe acting was fantastic especially from madison wolfe who played janet i really hope her career progresses and of course the acting was brilliant from everyone elsenow for the cinematography and lighting they were just amazing they were an added bonus on making the film work even more my favourite angle in particular was in the scene involving ed talking to the spirit of bill wilkins the camera does not leave them and it focuses on ed with the spirit in the background which is blurred with very little detail ide have to say that was one of the best camera techniques ive seen on filmso overall the film was absolutely incredible james wan carey and chad hayes i give the devilrock on horns to you guys horror fans youre in for an incredible treat,astonish
the best horror movie ive ever watched for almost 20 years of my existence and for a hundred more horror movies that ive ever watched this is the best one i could feel a lot of feelings while watching this movie and for sure because the movie based on the real story it made the movie more live and made me feel more scared before this 1 was my favorite horror movie but seriously the second sequel is much better thank you for everyone who gave their best work on it especially for the actors who played as ed  lorraine warren and also janet forgot their real name their actions were just incredible their actions were also supported by very scary and awesome horror effects that following the movie from the beginning till the end and i love the way the editor made the credit by showing the comparison of the real pictures with the movie picturesi think 10 stars doesnt enough for this movie,astonish
sequels usually breaks down a movie franchise its easy to see examples of terrible sequels especially in the years of previous films and horror movies are no exception making an impressive horror movie is hard enough but making a sequel to it is almost committing movie suicide was good and a lot of people really seemed they enjoyed it however 2 was spectacular not only did it had impressive cinematography that captures the absolute tone of a dark and an evil atmosphere but also it had great camera works and angles that shows both disturbing background and close up images and visuals the plot in this horror movie is nearly as the same as its predecessor haunted house that haunts a family warrens comes in to save the day the movie does have its fair share of clichs here and there however the way that this movie was executed really gave its terror we get to see a lot of character development in this film adding in more layers of characterization to both previous and new characters you get to see the relationship between ed and loraine warren grow as people get doubts about their profession the family thats being oppressed the hodgsons gets a good backstory and the film does a good job of showing that backstory to the audience this film also focuses on the public eye and skepticism as well there were claims that the actual haunting of enfield was just a hoax in order to have a public attention and director james wan decided to use this element to drive his movie forward showing the realistic reactions how the public would react the build up and the tension pacing was just right for the film as some scenes had unpredictable jump scares the movie does another great job of cutting off loraines ability of clairvoyance as it was quite helpful in the previous movie in this movie she is much more vulnerable to the demonic presence in the house exposition and the history of the haunted house really gives you the chills and it adds on to the already high staked tone of the movie the acting was quite phenomenal the hodgson does an amazing job being terrified and scared the main child actress really steals the show as she delivers an amazing performance of being both possessed and unpossessed its truly incredible to see her deal with this possession while being a kid since youd probably get more emotion of a kid being possessed rather than an adult the soundtrack in this film is the same as the first movie no soundtrack seems out of place and is given at necessary points in the film while also using it sparingly throughout the film final verdict i will give this movie an 8010 this movie was an upgraded version of with such skill in the horror genre james wan delivers one of the chilling horror film of all time i recommend this movie to anyone a definitely a must see film,astonish
i was not a huge fan of the first film i thought it was an okay haunted house type story but i was glad it had the success it did as it garnered an r rating and went on to have a lot of success pulling in over 100 million on a rather small by todays standards budget my hope was that this would kind of give hollywood executives the hint that we like our horror to be r and not the pg13 horror light that fills the theaters these days this one too is r and it had a rather sizable opening weekend so i am hoping this one will do a lot of money and show it to them again because sometimes you got to beat something into a persons head before they get it i actually liked this one more than the first film too as i thought it was a bit more graphic than the first film which i thought honestly could have been a pg13 rated horror film like so many others this one was well acted and i liked the setting to it more than the last film as it was something different sure most of us know the real story is not as dark and creepy as the movie but i really do not go into these based on a true story movies thinking i am going to get an accurate retelling of the actual events if it did that films that were based on true events would probably put most of us to sleepthe story starts out in amityville and details some work the warrens did in the old house that we have seen in its own series of films from there we are introduced to a family in england a mother whose father has ditched them live in a very run down looking house there are four children two girls and two boys things begin to happen within the house with the youngest girl seemingly sleep walking and strange noises occurring soon things begin moving around and an old man appears within the house wanting the family to leave lorraine warren meanwhile keeps having visions of a demonic nun who seems to be foretelling the death of her husband she wants to take a break from their investigations but they are soon pulled into the enfield haunting and must find out what is behind the girls strange behavior and the secret of the old man in the house before it is too late so this film to me was an improvement over the first film from what i have read this one was written with an r rating in mind while the first they were trying for pg13 so this one did have more of an edge to it i also enjoyed the opening scene in the amityville house as i was not expecting it to be featured granted i am sure most people already knew but i kind of do not watch television or read anything about films i am going to see to be as surprised as possible the acting was good the atmosphere was good and it had some creepy moments my only problem was that it did run a bit long for a horror film i thought ten or fifteen minutes could have easily been taken out of this one and not taken away from the storyso yes this film to me was pretty good i had to see this one in theaters so that it could make as much money as possible so that maybe hollywood would wake up and realize horror films should be rated r and that the 13 to 16 year old demographic unable to attend a horror film is not going to doom it to failure as many of them will just go with their parents anyways unfortunately they probably still will not get it as another horror film coming up this year called lights out is rated pg13 looks promising but it will most likely not have the edge this film did this film did not kill numerous people and had no sex it just had a creepy edge to it that made the film r it also is a throwback to the days when they had decent actors and actresses in horror films and not just super models and buff dudes being stupid so i say give this one a go as not only are you end for a creepy good time you will also be helping this film do well which will hopefully lead to more r rated horror films,astonish

in all honesty i do not know where to begin with 2 for people within the audience that has been following my reviews you may be aware of myself not being a major fan of presentday horror movies although i am desperately seeing most horror flicks that come out because i genuinely love the genre i have been waiting patiently for a horror movie to truly frighten me and make me uncomfortable with this title i have finally found that 2 was terrifying and near perfection at the same time i even was brought to a point where a horror sequence almost made me want to walk out of the theater because i was so uncomfortable and uneasy with the events occurring on screen now do not forget with that being said it simply means that this was a horror film done right there were multiple moments still shots and sequences that i feel will go down as iconic parts of horror movie history james wan will equally become a household name among horror movie fans as he is only continuing to push out impressive horror flicks time after time 2 blew away the original to me and i am confident in saying that this could be the horror movie of 2016 competitors being dont breathe evil dead remake team and lights out also directed by james wan if you want true terror and fastpaced horror this is the movie to see again in my opinion this is the horror movie of 2016,astonish
before i went to go see this film i watched the first for the second time since 2013 i remember enjoying it but upon viewing it a second time it came across as one of the most effective horror movies of recent memory now we have the sequel with james wan returning to direct this movie takes place after the events of the first film and also after lorraine and ed warrens case in amityville the movie takes the same structure as the first it dives directly in to the horror with an unrelated or is it paranormal case then we meet the main family their struggles with some sort of demonic entity and ed and lorraine come in to help the situation although it is the same structure as the last movie this is a completely different family story and location and it is truly terrifying the setting is new england we meet a family of a single mother with four children very soon eerie things begin to happen in the house it starts at night but quickly starts to happening all the time the entity has taken a liking to the middle child a little girl played fantastically by actress madison wolfe it is to be said that all the acting is top notch there is even a little boy that has a speech impediment which i thought could go south pretty quickly but sure enough it is handled with respect and realism it also focus on the undeniable love and connection between lorraine and ed warren which we didnt get too much of in the first like the first movie this film is relentless with its terror there are very few down times and when there are they are short lived i find james won to be the horror master of a new generation he is smart with his directing he takes old tropes and gags and blatantly avoids them on screen until he finally gets you with genuine scares he takes his time and uses the camera like an extension of his mind i think a lot of this is because of how few cuts there are the camera follows along looking in one room then turning down a hallway to look in another he often leaves his characters small in frame so the audience can look around the screen to catch any subtleties in one scene ed warren turns his back on the little girl so he can talk to the demon inside her we see ed in the foreground completely in focus and the little girl behind him so blurry she is almost indistinguishable but as the demon begins to speak the little girls blurry figure seems to be transforming as the conversation continues it is horrifying but subtle she is still very out of focus so its makes it seem like our eyes are doing it not the movie i know im gushing but the movie is not perfect there are some odd moments of special effects that took me out of the moment they were cool but didnt seem to fit it seemed like james won was trying to have fun with something different and it just didnt match the overall tone of the film also this movie seemed less grounded in reality then the first i know sequels are prone to go bigger and although it worked for this it just didnt strike to the core of me like the first one did regardless 2 is very scary and has heart to boot i love seeing great horror in the theater when its well done and truly effective you hear an audience worth of screams followed by and audience worth of laughter its just a good time,astonish
2 benefited greatly from strong supporting characters to outline an outstanding paranormal story james wan has delivered very effective shock scares and surprises that typically do not show up as heavily in other horror movies the family including ed and lorraine are put into an eerie environment while not letting clichs take hold of their decisions they supported one another cared for each other and didnt make dumb decisions that would put themselves in unnecessary harms way this element made the movie very enjoyable and absorbingnow with that said the scares were much more effective the tension of likable characters being in danger helped make the jumpshock moments feel more wellearned rather than cheap most of these moments came as a surprise which i thought was almost impossible at this point but james wan continues to surprise me with his genius camera tricks and clever twists on where the typical jump scare would be in addition the atmosphere set up was very realistic making the effect on you even more intenseif you like horror movies even a little bit you will love this movie the intense scares are so worth it given the superior acting and themes represented among them,astonish
i am a fan of thrillers and horror movies its been quite some time since i last saw a horror movie like this one it was a delight to watch this one i am a sucker for true stories and seeing that this one originated from parts of a real story was all i needed the movie had all the necessary elements and classical standards of horror movies jump scares visual effects sudden noises atmosphere the works the cast was amazing and the acting in all levels was amazing i really like the children that were all up to the task the depiction of the era and the costumes and everything were really high quality i watched this in a cinema and despite all those stupid teenagers that laugh for no reason it managed to captivate me and have me at the edge of my seat i can recall more than ten times when i was really scared which was the first time after so many lousy movies that try to scare you with stupid effects this movie has atmosphere it is nicely crafted and its really worth your time if your girlfriend is kind of scared easily dont take her with better go with some friends instead and choose times when the movie theater will be a bit empty so that you really have the silence to get into the movie,astonish
2 is based on another true story from the case files of paranormal investigators ed warrenpatrick wilson  lorraine warrenvera farmiga this time around ed  lorraine warren travel to london for their new case once there the hodgson family tells them that their house is being terrorized by malevolent spirits now it is up to ed  lorraine warren to stop this haunting at any cost 2 is a good film however when you compare this movie to 2013 it just doesnt match up to it the first film had some brilliantly executed jump scares  genuinely unnerving scenes this movie has some great jump scares too but they are few  far between one thing that this movie has going for it that 2013 didnt is an element of suspense director james wan introduces certain subplots that he ties together very well with the main story in the climax of the film a note on the performances patrick wilson is outstanding as ed warren vera farmiga is spectacular as lorraine warren madison wolfe is mind blowing as janet hodgson wolfe at such a young age portrays a variety of emotions effortlessly frances oconner is brilliant as peggy hodgson lauren esposito is great as margaret hodgson benjamin haigh is superb as billy hodgson patrick mcauley is awesome as johnny hodgson simon mcburney is impressive as maurice grosse maria doyle kennedy simon delaney  franka potente are effective as peggy nottingham vic nottingham  anita gregory respectively bob adrian  bonnie aarons are fantastic as bill wilkins  demon nun respectively sterling jerins is good as judy warren all in all 2 is a well made film i just wish it scared me more,astonish
the movies on its own justifies itself to be made by one and only james wan if you are a casual watcher it starts a little slow in first half making you think otherwise but as soon as second half begins you will realize that all the efforts in first half were necessary and makes sense morethat being said once story unfolds of amityvilleoflondon you can not stop but bite your nails off and hope for the best for the ed and lorraine warrenso i would conclude my review for the2 by saying that you should watch it for its story and direction as the horror part is not that horror as you would expect meaning you can sleep later in night peacefully,astonish
once again james wan left this diehard horror movie fan smiling and satisfied everything from the interactions between the characters to the sweeping long takes has been improved since the first films release in 2013this is a film that does not rely on predictable jumpscares to get and keep your attention however the dark atmosphere of the haunted home set in the beautiful and period correct 1970s england will keep you on the edge of your seat as your eyes dart around the screen searching every dark corner of the decrepit waste of a home for some kind of potential evil this is where the camera work of this film shines the long takes are beautifully done they are slow enough to build tension and paranoia but not too fast that you will miss a monster standing in a dark corner as the camera is focused on an actori took two stars away from a perfect 1010 score for two reasons number one the first hour of the movie provides quite a bit of foreshadowing for the second half which once you finish the film can be excused i feel like it dragged on for a bit and could have been done in a more timely manner not a big deal number two the cgi of a particular monster which shall not be named was subpar at best even if it only got a couple of minutes of screen time it detracted from the atmosphere that james wan had built though not enough to break the feeling of dreadtaking everything into account this is an excellent film that any fan of the horror genre should see it will leave you with chills throughout multiple scenes and the overall atmosphere will make you feel uneasy and paranoid there were several scenes in particular that made me push myself into the chair trying to subconsciously get away from the screen as much possible810 cooper lw,astonish
i was greatly impressed with this horror sequel nothing entertained and frightened me this much in a long time as far as sequels go especially horror sequels this movie is beyond comparison there are some very minor flaws of special effects but these take nothing away from the terror and the great story of the warrens next adventurepatrick wilson and vera farmiga return as ed and lorraine warren and are more comfortable in their roles as the paranormal investigators the story begins with a short recounting of their most famous case the amityville house this sets up the spooky demonic nun that has graced the trailers for the last few weeks this nun is freaky and will haunt my nightmares for the next few nights the warrens have garnered some respect for their work but also have to face more skeptics lorraine as has to deal with premonitions of her husbands death it takes a while but eventually the couple is summoned to london for a new mission james wan does a terrific job with the camera work showing just enough to have viewers squirming in their seats before the boom and jump scares he ratchets up the tension and tells a story that does justice to the original and true story this event was based on the dark hallways and the flooded basement are a perfect setting for the hauntings i hope that wan returns to the horror genre after aquaman because he has the formula down and has developed a great talent for this type of filmmakingcheck out more of this review and others at swillikycom,astonish
the long awaited sequel  at least for me  has finally come as were presented with a sequel for one of the bigger more effect modern horrors over the years 2 this movie is an overall headstrong sequel id say unlike other sequels this one keeps its intensity and overall chills cranked up through the roof just like the first one the atmosphere in this movie is eerie and overly bone chilling you get shots of which are so dark along with the soundtrack being so quiet to where us the audience are sitting in complete and utter unsettlement as we are set within such a whiteknuckle tension zone over most of the movie the film sets an amazing tone for creepiness keeping the movie mostly darklike and eerie of which deeply succeeds when it comes to the breakdown of the demon  ghost appearances the overall soundtrack of the film as well when it comes down to such actions also adds onto the overall film effect that it has going for it overall the film is like the first one when it comes to succeeding complete and utter creepiness and overall eye candy tension something some horror films try but miss the mark on leading to this factor being as the first film a pleasant surprise for the acting in this film again of which youll hear be said a lot in this review like the first film the acting was well played out the kids in this film did a quite believable with portraying their emotions mostly for this film either serious scared or upset this movie also does a flawless job for making the audience feel for this family the audience overall watches as this family goes through the struggle of getting people to overall believe theyre truly being haunted and overall provoked at the same time theyre battling a war between them the truth and the media so overall the film does an amazing job for having us the audience truly feel emotion for this family and only want the absolute best for them in the end ed and lorraine from the first film as well have some new and unique character unleashes in this sequel as well they both have a somewhat deeper side to them shown in this film their true care for what they do and their overall emphasis and even love for each other are perfectly shown and executed without being too much in depth to it we also see some new pretty exciting  like characters enter the sequel as well overall great actors and amazing twist of deep innercharacter ties along with it all as well coming out as flawless and another outstanding surprise now for the good stuff the demons  demon in this film is absolutely creepy this film did an amazing job with it i would say all the way the film throws the demon in hidden places throughout camera shots making it insanely creepy for those who spot it and when blatantly seen even then this demon comes off as truly frightening and just flat out creepy and yet another succeeding and outstanding tiein this film brought to the table was the fact that demon actually came within different forms something to understand along with everything else here youd have to see the movie to figure out overall this sequel was one hell of a watch you have great story well executed actors creepy unsettling and flat out eerie tone and atmosphere whether it be the soundtrack happenings in the film itself or the demon appearances itself the film overall comes off in the sense of it all being nightmarish this was an outstanding sequel and definitely didnt miss the mark if you enjoyed the first film your expectations shall not be disappointed in 2 see it all to believe,astonish
an unbelievably scary movie at the cinema it had the entire audience jump and scream the entire duration of the movie it was scarier and more intense than the first movie 2 had a wonderful and talented cast the acting was very convincing and it was superb if you enjoy horror films i guarantee you will enjoy this movie you will not regret it to think this was based on a true story disturbs me and terrifies me its one of the scariest movies i have seen in such a long time in all honesty if i could rate this flick more than 10 stars i would without a doubt every time there was s scary scene it gave me chills confession on the night i went to see this movie i ended up sleeping with the lights on because im such a big baby if you ever want to see a great horror flick i recommend this one,astonish
i truly dislike profanity  but omfg wow now that is how you make a horror movie james wan is a master of modern horror tapping into truly nightmarish scares that only exist in the old classics this movie it a horror masterpiece with 2 simultaneous stories attempting to link up with terrifying visuals great acting and a very good script c2 easily surpass the original which was in itself a great film i wont lie i had my doubts because horror now a days is technically dead good horror anyways especially if its a a sequel but man was i surprised the last time i felt truly scared watching a film  and i mean true fear was with the exorcist 1 was excellent and had scenes that scared me but tc2 in its enterity is terrifying do not watch it alone and be prepared to look at nuns in a whole new way  horror at its best a true movie going cinematic fun experience final gradea,astonish
one of the best horror movie i ever watched  vera farmiga was absolutely stunning with her performance patrick wilson was also good this is an incredibly effective horror film and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious its surely a worth watch james wan did an amazing job with this sequel i found this to be an extremely successful horror film this was far better than the first one for a horror movie its very important to be able to care for the characters i think that is something that separates good horror from bad their relationships were well written and the actors did a really good job,astonish
even better than the first fantastic sequel that has lorraine and eds storyline a lot more interconnected throughout the film they consistently show a very tight knit couple that is heavily engaged in their work against evil same main cast is back but in a new scary story in a new country the film also delves more deeply into very interesting lessons about understanding good and evil characters deliver excellent performances that are balanced between skepticism and belief about the supernatural lorraine and ed play great emotional scenes that run the gamut the movie feels very authentic for its time period so that you really feel like it is occurring during the 1970s wellpaced scares that supply consistent twinges of fear along with moments of utter shock it is a dark world that keeps you thoroughly enthralled wanting to see what happens to these characters and how in the world they will be able to resolve the demonic problem at hand filmmakers pay particular attention to inserting small but important cues that neatly tie the entire movie together would totally recommend and cannot wait for 3,astonish
yes this is perfect this is perfect great movie for the summer is a good movie if you like good movies than this is movie for you thanbe warned this movie is very scary i almost poop myself by the jesus woman and its raly scaryis very horror very scare movie so even if u do not like scary movies u must go because is perfect movie and if you like perfect movie than this is a movie for youexcellent perfect movie you will die after you see this movie,astonish
i should admit that i havent seen the previous movies in franchise 2 comes across as a clone of the exorcist the shining and poltergeist as to the issue of the whole storys accuracy im not interested in that id prefer it if horror movies emphasized the unknown over cheap surprises as the shining did james wan has directed better movies than this saw dead silence while vera farmiga the departed and franka potente run lola run have starred in better i dont recommend the movieso part of the investigation took place on christmas in 1977 i guess that they heard on the news that charlie chaplin died that day,astonish
if i were to rate this movie on the basis of its scariness and watch ability then i can happily give it around 78 as my vote unfortunately by the credits both at the beginning and end of the film the makers of it are trying to con viewers into believing that the events in the movie are truenot correct the picture tries to suggest the story is based on true events occurring in london in the the 1970s know as the enfield poltergeist a childchildren of a household claimed to be demonically possessed attracting widespread publicity however in real life the evidence ultimately led to the conclusion that it was all a hoax any one can do a little research on the internet to discover the true eventsif the film makers had produced a story exposing the lies of the hoaxers then they would have done a good job in film making and truth telling but purely to sell tickets they have produced one big lie and totally fictionalized what really happened under the pretense that it is facttherefore i deduct 3 points from my vote and rate this movie510,astonish
i had high hopes for 2but it isnt as scary as the firstthe first was laughable most of the time so i figured it would easy for them to make this one more scarybut after 20 minutes i was rolling me eyesthe problem with the writers and producers of movies is they dont believe in mysterythe unknowneverything is laid out for youwithin 15 minutes i realized this movie is a childrens moviethe ghost scowl near the beginning where the ghost or demon tells the girl shes playing a game with billy is so juvenile i instantly was disappointedthere is no way this movie would scare anyone over 12 or 13if you are looking for an interesting movie i like the two characters who are the mediums with good acting but dont care about being scaredthen you may enjoy this movie,astonish
2 is a mixed bag of a movie it has some unquestionable scary scenes but it also has a ton of unnecessary jump scares where the volume goes from whisper quite to jet engine loud im sure the average joe or teenager will eat them up and proclaim the movie to be a horror classic but to me its not scares that makes a horror movie great that being said if you are someone that doesnt mind jump scares you will most likely eat this movie upa lot of the good ideas and moments from the first film are present here in the sequel the likable warrens a standout scare scene the painting scene plenty of raising tension and an eerie score the problem however is that its all dragged out over the course of two hours and ten minutes that leaves plenty of time for boredom to set in and room for those less engaging moments or should i say numerous cheap jump scare scenes it seems as though the executives or producers of the movie wanted wan to through in as many scares as possible ignoring pacing and runtime which leads to many scenes being unnecessarily long and plenty of throw away jump scaresnot only are some scare scenes tepid but some are flat out cheesy anytime the girl is possessed and the evil old man speaks its damn near laughable mostly because a mans voice coming out of a little girl isnt anything new nor is it haunting when alls said and done 2 has the same eerie atmosphere from the first film that made it enjoyable but also the generic storyline that plagued the first film amplify that story with an unbearable two hour plus runtime and you get in my opinion a failed sequel even if it does have some scary scenes,astonish
it was interesting and full of new horror personalities the storyline was perfect too,astonish
im giving this one more star than i gave the first movie as a horror film in its own rite its competently made although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes but it is better than the first one in that its a more cohesive film with such corrections as how the background monster actually does play a part in the story whereas in the first film annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distractionultimately the reason i cant rate this film higher is because its about the warrens who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people while this is touched on briefly its done more in the context of people who dont believe them are all mean and unsympatheticagain its a competently made horror film thats better than its predecessor if a little predictable but dont look at it as being based on a true story take it with a massive grain of salt,astonish
if the first was a simple oldschool kind of horror movie that resulted in a breath of fresh air this second part is the oppositethis tries to be everything the first wasntif the first one didnt rely that much on jumpscares to scare you but rather in building tension this one has to have a loud noise every minuteif the first one was a simple story of a house with a demon that reached a not so dumb satisfaying climax near the end this one has to be this grandiosity were people fly and have superpowers and can see the future and blah blah blahif the first one had great acting from all except the family father in this one the child actors have to suckif the first one didnt have an overlong runtime this has to be over two hoursand twenty minutesyou get why im trying to say this movie has this aspiration to be grandiose but it doesnt need toi have to recognize the film is not that bad it has some great aspects like the cinematography but it doesnt reach the level of the original you can skip it or you can watch it but dont expect anything really good,astonish
i was very surprised when the reviews started coming out for this movie i honestly dimised two as i was of the belief that sequels to horror movies tend to not only be worse than the original but also bring down the reputation of the original movies nameso i didnt go to the cinema to watch it a choice i ultimately came to regret as after finally sitting down and watching this movie i came to thoroughly enjoy itthis movie pays perfect respect to previous horror movies in the same sub genre by using a lot of the classic techniques that have bee used previously to make the audience feel uneasy however it gets away with it because it does it well you may have heard a very similar story before but this movie is still worth watching because its been written and directed so well with fantastic cinematography and screenplay with a great cast of classic horror movie characters the panicking mother the terrified children the confused friend that doubts the sanity of her close friend that she knows so wellthe plot develops in an interesting way and achieves some genuinely scary moments with a great amount of intrigue that keeps you commited to watchingtotally recommend,astonish
this movie is amazing i stayed up until about 3 in the morning watching this and it did not disappoint the actors are great and james wan did a stellar job as well i would definitely recommend 1010,astonish
seen many many movies but this movie is truly awesome one of the most horror movies ever and the the direction is the most important part in this thank you james wan,astonish
2 is a great sequel to the first movie i think i still like the first movie more but this is still great the scary af imagery of the nun in the warren house to the haunting of the enfield house the crooked man is so scary the final showdown is also well worth it the movie has good scares trough out,astonish
a flawless horror classic not much more explanation needed 1010,astonish
by far best film thus far earns a 1010 definitely,astonish
2wans another swing at this supernatural world is short on thrills and humane emotions and more on the glory of the dark gloomy skin and armed with that thought in mind wan has somehow managed to shuck out the heat from the shady spirits hovering in the house the structure of the script is familiar in fact it is arguable a mirror to its predecessor and just like its first installment the first half of the act survives upon the smart tricks of wans that builds up to the complete breakdown of the haunted family cornering themselves for desperate measures but in here unlike the first one their barely resides an innovating trick for you to be enchanted upon a little boy playing with his toy is slick though but what grabs your attention this time is wans brilliant camera work that moves with ferocious pace and sensational eye popping perspective that does scare youand as far as the other half is concerned the plot being more personal and emotionally driven for the lead characters somehow seems physically distant to the case the perfect host they were in the previous one by being the perfect guest there is an empty void on that section that no performance could fill in speaking of which as far as wilson is concerned on being the noble caring protagonist he is walking the thin line with confidencebut once again farmiga soars above for her underdog character that is brilliantly fabricated as a three dimensional humane character what is persistently absorbing about this franchise is its malleable mythical tale that it never holds back to dive deep into and plus this time the procedure it adapts to narrate the case is immensely impressive 2 is wan stepping on to his shoes after a long while just with the lens of superficial eyes,astonish
this film was just as good as the first it was really suspenseful and very good and i am surprise that i cant make up my mind which is better overall great film910ps i like the crooked man more than the nun,astonish
the highlight of the film is its thrilling and horror element and with a thrilling climax some scenes are really fearful and the bgm is also thrilling,astonish
watch this alone in the dark  if you dare grabs you and the beginning and keeps your adrenaline going the entire movie  almost too intense,astonish
other people rating this must have seen a different version because the one i saw was horrible it might not have been so bad if they hadnt claimed it was a based on truth it isnt and if you think it is you need to talk to a professional about itvery christian very silly very bad acting giving it 3 stars because the child actors werent bad the adults however needed a better director,astonish
i loved the movie so much it kept me on the edge of my seat im very hard to scare but the movie managed to give me a few jump scares the actors did an amazing job and showed great emotion facial expression and movement the graphics that are used are amazing and so realistic i couldnt stop thinking about the movie for about a few weeks hoping for a 3rd movie to come out,astonish
guys am i missing something  i somehow laughed in each and every scene is it meant to scare the little kids or my adrenaline is not functioning  i havent watched the first part i definitely wont but this enough proves how bad it is the ending was godawful it left me unsatisfied to the extremest extent the effects are so bad as well i would definitely recommend it to no one despite of the amount of praise it is receiving well to me  it doesnt deserve it210,astonish
hated the movie for one simple reason cgi effects its not scary when the subject of fear in the movie looks like something that came from a video game or like a stickeremoji it would be a 1000 times more scary if theyd be reasonable enough not to mask everything in effects and jump scares jump scares is equal to a comedian tickling his audience the beauty in horror movies is the tension suspense the build up and the point in my opinion is to sympathize with the protagonist but i cant do that if the antagonist looks like animated version of marilyn manson literally make up should cover the scary part plotwise it was okay but nothing i havent seen before nothing unique 1 was way scarier and more interesting than this sequel,astonish
i should have known going into this that i would not be able to enjoy this movie although i like james wan quite a bit the subject matter of these movies is just not something i can get over they would have a done a better job if they didnt pretend that this movie was really based on a true storythe biggest problem with this movie is the depiction of ed and lorraine warren as heroic figures in reality they are grimy charlatans who make up stories and exploit peoples wanting to believe in the supernatural to make money they have been exposed repeatedly as frauds however this movie tries to make them heroes its impossible for me to see them this way and this made any chance i could like this movie just go out the windowalso there are plenty of recent horror movies based off of supposed real stories most of them do a better job of at least not being so outlandish that no one with sense could possibly believe it so lets pretend for an instant that this movie just was admittedly a fiction movie lets pretend for a moment that the heroes werent a couple of slime bag con artists lets pretend they presented this film as it was would it have been enjoyable possibly will i ever know not reallyeven so it would not have been scary but the main point is that if i can not root for the hero i can not like a movie and the last think the warrens are or ever have been are heroes avoid it,astonish
wow just wow james wan is fast becoming by top horror director of all time so far the insidious franchise has put my faith back in actual scary horror movies and not the awful horror violence movies such as rob zombies god awful halloween 2 where there is nothing scary whatsoever seeing someone stabbed 13 times but with dead silence insidious and now james wan has made and produced some classic horrors with the first i thought it was excellent up to the kind of ripoff ending where it reminded me far too much of the exorcist that was my only gripe with the film thoughin 2 however yes we have another possession but it is the three demons that wan has added to this movie which just terrifies you it was bad enough having nightmares about red faced demon and the bride in black from insidious now we have bill wilkins the old man the nun and the crooked man all three of these played on my fears that i had as a kid and they were truly terrifying like with annabelle who was introduced in and got her own spin off film the same will now happen with the nun in this film and i for one cant wait a special mention must go to the production design as well because the house that the family live in in this movie would be terrifying without all the hauntings going on patrick wilson and vera farmiga as ed and lorraine warren are even better in this than the first one and are a great on screen couple with quite a nice scene at the end dancing to an elvis presley track,astonish
for years ive been telling people that the scariest horror movie ive ever seen is the exorcist well all that changed after watching 2 all i can say is wow james wan who ive been following since his 2004 feature saw has shown amazing growth as a purveyor of the demonic and his understanding of the intrinsic nature of evil from a catholic perspective rivals that of william peter blatty who i have greatly admired since reading his novel the exorcist upon which the movie was basednow i enjoyed which like the sequel is based on a paranormal case by reallife investigators ed and lorraine warren after seeing that movie i began researching the warrens and learned about the case in england where the story of 2 takes place the fact that these are actual cases and involve demonic possession both intrigues and horrifies me as a catholic i believe in hell and i believe that demons like the one featured in 2 have walked the earth long before man perhaps this is why for me the film is so frighteningflipping around the dial the other day i happened across the a nightmare on elm street reboot from 2010 though well made it wasnt scary i know freddie kreuger is a fantasy character and despite the sharpness of his homemade claws hes just another homicidal killer and i feel that way about most horror movies involving monsters the babadook is a great example yes hes paperthin and creepy but thats about it i was more moved by the exasperated sleepdeprived amelia and her lonely desperate attempts at creating a normal life for her troubled son samuel conversely when the demon in 2 takes on the form of the crooked man i ended up halfway out of my seatwhich is a tribute to the genius of james wanlike most folks i believe horror movies do well because people like to be scared its a rush similar to riding a roller coaster and when its over youre relieved but every once in a while a film comes along that disturbs the viewer to the core its aftereffect lingering for days 2 is just such a movie and an estimated 40m in box office receipts at the time of this writingthis kind of story sellsnow im not saying that a film like this will turn an atheist into a believer but it might make those who are on the fence about god angels and demons think twice before picking up the planchette from that ouija board collecting dust in the corner with those other games my advicejust say no,astonish
this film tells the story of the famous exorcists couple from the church who wants to stop investigating and confronting the paranormal however the church sends them to london to investigate a very sinister haunting in a north london house that is home to a single mother and her four childrenwas so super scary that i rate it as one of the scariest films for me 2 follows a similar plot with vera farmiga and patrick wilson investigating and confronting the demonic spirits there are many scary scenes in this film to the point that i developed a headache towards the end because i was so scared yet the general feel of the film is not as scary compared to the first film i think perhaps it is because the final showdown is short and the demon appeared way too late in the film still it is a very scary film,astonish
the first really was good and creepy first it was annabelle and now its the nun in this one really took the cake in this sequel the next story about ed and laurianne warren where they are headed to london to help a struggling family with the ghost who wants a young girl does seem a lot like the exorcist but the movie has brilliantly time scares and knows how to keep anyone interested when two starts it will begin with a good scare and will keep on delivering unpredictable moments of jumps and scares until the very last minute of the movie with what is definitely the most creepiest part and ironic part of the movie and lets hope that these movies will keep on being made because this will be a franchise that will never stop being successful and popular,astonish
wow such a scary movie vera farmiga has to be one of my favorite actresses ever she cares about her roles so well and she puts such heart to them i love her in bates motel as well i believe i liked this better than the first one the first one was so great but i just didnt care for the other characters in the story but this one i do i feel so bad for the little girl and the family and i want the warrens to help her and her family the whole family is great and you really feel for them this is such a creepy and scary movie and the special effects in this movie are so great i will always love movies and after seeing this i do consider them some of my favorite scary movies the one thing i absolutely love about this movie is that faith plays a big part in the movie i am a christian and it is so refreshing to see a scary movie that has faith as one of the main parts in the movie when so many scary movies dont i love that faith plays a big role in ed and lorraine warrens marriage and family this stuff is real and i love that this story is based on real events it shows that god is real and satan is real as well,astonish
2 is the sequel to a pretty successful horror film from 2013 the director and one of the many writers here is once again james wan a malaysian filmmaker who truly made it big in hollywood but the title of my review also refers to him and his career a bit he worked on saw insidious and more horror films so he is certainly one of the defining directors of the genre right now but it seems as if he has sacrificed a great deal of creativity in case he ever had it i personally was not a great fan of the first movie and i am also not too big on this one here the film itself is also where the title of my review applies it is basically a summation of all kinds of elements used in all kinds of horror films in the past unseen danger very visible danger exorcist elements danger in the water children and women who get scared the hell out of them toughass male characters who want to fight he dark spirits at any cost etc the two protagonists are played by farmiga and wilson as in the first film and this is basically another chapter to their profession however with farmigas characters reaction on some occasions i truly wonder why she would work in a field like this and not do a quiet office job or so also the couple not only has to do with scary nuns and dead senior characters that take control of little girls but they also have to deal with people who criticize their profession and say its all nonsense which also does not make any sense overall so yeah this film is really packed but sadly its like a 100 puzzle parts and almost none of them fit together or result in a convincing overall outcome in one scene farmigas character is scared to death in the next it seems like nothing could scare her at all how is that even possibly the weakest moment was maybe the seemingly selfsacrifice scene of the male protagonist towards the end which was pretty cringeworthy honestly i see almost no really creative element in this film here which sucks a lot and hurts the viewing experience too this is especially painful as this movie runs for a massive 2 hours and 15 minutes almost extremely long and you could actually see it as a miniseries in 3 parts of 45 minutes if you wanted if you add the first movie you almost have a real miniseries in terms of the length of both films taken together and if they ever make a third film which they probably will looking at the success of the first two and how wan loves sequels then more will be added as for me this second film was already one too many maybe even the first the performances are also all very generic and bring nothing great to the screen just like the script dont watch,astonish
2 was a really good sequel first time i watched it i was a bit too skeptical so i didnt end up enjoying it as much as i could have but now ive watched it a few more times and i got to say its awesome i like the part in the beginning where lorraine is in a trance at the amityville house and she kind of was reliving the murders in that house while in a trance she also had a premonition of eds death which i thought was a pretty messed up scene plus when you see the nun for the first time it really creeps you out sends chills down your spine to me the creepiest part of this movie is the nun you dont know who the hell she iswhat the hell shes doing there or anything that was just the beginning though the amityville haunting its mainly based on the haunting in enfield thats in north london its basically this girl janet slowly being possessed this spirit of this old man called bill wilkins who used to live in that house and died in the chair in the corner was supposedly the one doing it but then you find out its something much more sinister an inhuman spirit i know this is a huge spoiler for those of you who havent seen this but i have to talk about it it turned out that bill wilkins was actually being used as a puppet by the nun from the beginning of the movie and she really wanted the girl janet she wanted to fully possess her for some reason i didnt really understand why every time i saw the nun on screen i couldnt help but jump they do reveal the real name of this demon in the movie but i dont really want to spoil that the thing about bill wilkins was enough anyways i do like this movie and i think there should be a 3rd one this definitely great to me this is one of the new necessary sequels i felt they needed to add more to this the first one wasnt enough for me after i saw that i did want more i really did i highly recommend this if you havent seen it,astonish
whodathunk that one of the biggest highlights of director james wans stellar sequel 2 was not one of the dreaded jumps that the movie relishes in nor the creaking of a doorway in the distance nor the eerie music that chills you to the bone but rather a pleasant little scene where a man tries to bring a little happiness and joy to a family by plucking the strings of a guitar and singing i cant help falling in love with you with a smirking elvis impressionyes it may almost seem counterintuitive but the thing thats so admirable about 2 is that it sees past the clichs and tropes of the standard horror sequel and instead places its main focus first and foremost on creating a grounded scenario that audiences can identify with and populating its story with loving and thoughtful characters that you cant help but root for while the horror elements frequently take a back seatbased on yet another of the warrens case files though obviously heavily exaggerated and embellished for the sake of drama this aint a documentary the film moves the focus to london taking inspiration from the famous and infamous enfield poltergiest case ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga warren must help a distraught mother frances oconnor who is struggling with a deranged seemingly supernatural force that threatens to tear her and her children apart in particular young daughter janet madison wolfe who seems to be this dark forces main target however the growing media firestorm surrounding the case questions of whether or not janet is faking the haunting and a recurring premonition of eds death may prove that this case could be too much for the famed supernatural investigatorsa huge part of the appeal of the original film was the absolutely magical chemistry between stars wilson and farmiga and this is only improved upon in the sequel the duo really do light up the screen together creating a wonderful set of leads for the audience to follow wolfe is a revelation of a child actress and is both adorable and highly convincing in her role oconnor gives a satisfying and compelling turn as a mother in desperate need and supporting roles by the likes of simon mcburney and franka potente are well cast and deliver good memorable performancesdirector james wan excels here quickly becoming one of the finest filmmakers working in the world of horror today wan is an expert at delivering the goods his expert sense of atmosphere and complex camerawork work wonders at building a sense of all encompassing dread that helps the horror to really hit home but hes also grown quite a bit with the other material having learned and honed his skills at telling thoughtful and sensitive scenes that help to develop the characters and story in such a delightful way ive been a fan of his since way back when the original saw hit theaters and im glad ive stuck with his work its been a pleasure to see him grow and mature as a storyteller over the past twelve years and i look forward to his next projectsthe script by wan chad hayes carey w hayes and david leslie johnson is just a blast of pure fun the four writers really have a good grasp on structure pacing and balance its carefully crafted to not only give many strong punctuations of scares and thrills but to expertly develop the characters as i mentioned above even to points where the horror elements often take a backseat but i didnt mind in creating such a delightful setting and characters it makes the horror hit harder the group also really knows how to create memorable foes with the new demonic forces at play being absolutely bonechilling in their executionhowever despite the gushing i must also address a few of the films minor faults to start even though the horror elements at play do generally work it never quite comes off as chilling or as frightening as the original its almost more intriguing and interesting than it is scary i also think that there were a few scares early on that do fall flat feeling like wasted screen time that could have been spent elsewhere and id be lying if i said i didnt notice the films overlong runtime a bit it could have used a bit more refiningbut those faults being said 2 is still a completely enthralling and engrossing thriller not only a solid sequel but just a darned fine movie in its own right another win for director james wan heres to hoping we get a 3 that continues to maintain the high quality of the previous installmentsi give it a very good 8 out of 10,astonish
a film that reinvigorates an entire genre and keeps horror alive on the big screen to scare us all the horror genre has been far from my favourite over the last 10 years with the passing of greats like nightmare on elm street and friday the 13th giving way to many many terrible reincarnations of what filmmakers think is considered scary and worthy of praise lots of jump scares and bad cgi monsters later we finally seem to have found a winning formula in the scares make you jump the monsters look frightening and certain scenes are incredibly tense and terrifying but for me the film truly succeeds in the other elements that make it complete comedic moments that are genuinely funny a great storyline focusing on love family and getting on with life and thats just between ed and lorraine overall one of the best horror films of the generation and with everything it tries it accomplishes not without its faults but series offers a non loving horror fan plenty of storyline tension and entertainment to make it a truly great film,astonish
i may be the only one here with this viewpoint but i did not care for it one bit its got lots of style for sure but its nothing more than a hodge podge of styles lifted from other movies and then failing to do anything unique with the lot of themi did like the first one much more it felt realer compared to this they took the bigger is better route on this one every set piece every scare feels manufactured by virtue of being over the top with effects which to be sure would have benefited by having taken down a notch kind of reaching a bit with the kid audience ive them what they want but not everyone wants twice the thrills want more innovation and genuine horror,astonish
i was waiting for this sequel after part i  every one was hyped so much yesterday i watched it  all i can say its way too overrated it wasnt as good as the part i  even more  it was disappointing  not scary at all and there was one mistake which ruined whole movie for me they saw lots of evidence moving objects in the house bite on the hand of mother when she and ed were in the water of basement  most of all biggest evidence  face of that girl with unusual eyes  veins on her eyes  speaking with male voice in short obvious possession signs and after that they say it was fake girl was pretending because they saw on the camera how she broke some chairs and objects lol i cant believe how they made such a big mistake in movie you must be really blind and dumb to ignore all these things and say it was fake  leave them this moment ruined whole movie another disappointment was some computer effects which they decided to add this movie doesnt deserve more than 410,astonish
i did not watch the first film because generally speaking i need to be dragged in chains to any theater showing horror filmsbut 2 has all the things i love in a good film its perfectly cast the production is exceptional the direction sound editing pacing writing dialogue costumes  its all really some of the best i have seen in  quite a few years and on top of it it has that charm of the horror films of the 80s before gore and silly monsters took center stagehowever its not quite the ring im sorry if i have to be dismissive  this is a really good film its really that im no good at judging horror films actually thats not quite truesee for example i love the film the ring i would recommend everyone to watch it because the way the story is built the writing choices that were made make it into a masterpiece is not like that its a classic oldskool scarystuff film it goes through the motions instead of breaking new ground it does so masterfully and its a pleasure to watch but the scary stuff kinda gets in the way of everything else its really the same story as the amityville horror  and also of every scarejump film made in the past 20 years so here is my advice if you are into horror films go immediately to watch this awesome film on the other hand if you are not then skip it i cannot repeat enough times how well made this film is aside from a single really bad cgi use but you would probably get annoyed at the horror bits more than you are amused by the productionim having a hard time vote this film properly but i would give it at least 810  incredibly well done,astonish
after enjoying the first installment i was expecting to be let down with the sequel of lets face it thats usually the case however i loved every minute of 2 from the get go vera farmiga and patrick wilson really held this movie together the chemistry between them was believable and the acting superb im from the uk and at an age where i remember the story causing hype in the media ive seen the documentarys and other versions of this story in screen plays but they always fell short of being authentic especially with the set and backdrop of the era however 2 does not fail to add every detail by showing just how decrepit and humble life on welfare was in london during this time i love a good ghost story and this movie did not disappoint i really hope there will be another movie in the future with the same leading actors this movie is now in my top 3 scary movies of all time,astonish
like the first one is a good jumpy horror movie it ticks all the boxes that anyone who likes this type of movie is looking for sometimes this almost seems too formulaic as it goes through every clich and youll find yourself knowing whats about to happen next because youve seen similar movies but then at times it uses this to misdirect you and the jump comes from unexpected places one thing i do find a little strange is how this and the first movie wan portray the warrens as some sort of heros in what was a blatant real life hoax and the warrens were either too stupid to see or were in on itbut in todays horror movie world where most movies are terrible and  or rely on gore to attract viewers this is good back to basics stuff,astonish
what can i say i seen the original and literally just watch the movie and dear god this is by far the scariest sequel ive ever seen in horror history and in series what seriously trips me its the fact its based on true story d if anybody whos watching this heres mine tips 1 never take a sip while watching the movie for your first time 2 never laughed at people who get scared youll regret it on you watch the movie 3 if you scare easily i recommended wait til you get the dvd so theres no bass that you wont sht your pants lolok ok to the review i honestly never seen a movie especially from horror who has a sequel better than the original whoever the writer ill give you credit for being such a genius when it comes to jump scare  i got scared to death and i dont get scared easily when it comes to movie  anybody down for barney after watching the movie originally 9 star bonus for being a genius at jump scare 10 star if youre a horror fani recommend this movie if youre getting the dvd i dared you to raised the volume and the bass,astonish
theres something terrifying in enfield and its not bleachblond tarts tottering around in heels and short skirts first class spookiness that almost had me crying for my mummy jumps and scares aplenty a well written script and some fine acting lubricated the swallowing of the true story thankfully the film provided a satisfying ending that will enable you to sleep after watching albeit with the lights on real life events were less conclusive the only disappointments were the squalid living conditions of the family and the casting of an american girl as janet come on yanks we brits know how to clean i feel a little offended,astonish
im impressed 2 is a great movie although i had read good reviews beforehand i was still a bit anxious if it could keep up the high standard that was set by the first part back in 2013 after the relatively weak insidious 2 that was james wans most disappointing directorial effort to date in my opinionwhich is quite surprising as it came out the same year as the i must admit i did have some doubts still furious 7 was a good movie and it directly precedes 2 in wans filmography as director so i was looking forward to seeing it in fact most of wans directing is quite impressive and there is hardly a movie he directed that i would call a true failure before seeing 2 the two wan movies that i rated highest were saw 2004 and death sentence 2007 that has changed now i think 2 is his most impressive directorial effort to dateit is better than the first partwhich was already goodand one of only a few horror movies i have seen in recent years that i would call genuinely creepy its quite an achievement to make a horror movie that runs for a whopping 134 minutes that doesnt have any lengths in it and never gets boring james wan did that and much more 2 harks back to a number of classics in the horror genre like poltergeist 1982 the amityville horror 1979 the exorcist 1973 and the sixth sense 1999 but does not actually copy them wan merely uses a number of the most effective scare tactics that were introduced in those movies but adapts them in his own unique way so that they appeal to a modern audience that has already seen everything because of the established settings and wellknown scary elements youd expect to see in this kind of horror movie 2 feels very familiar and i had a sense of dj vu at certain points in the movie nevertheless the movie does never feel clichd because wan is a very creative director who takes inspiration from classic horror movies but never dully imitates them like so many modernday horror movies do its obvious that james wan knows the horror genre very well and he knows how to effectively reimagine its conventions and play with established tactics the first half of the movie is especially eerie with its very effective use of shadows and sounds i found the sound design done by eliot connors and peter staubli to be exceptional creaking doors squeaky floors pattering rain low ringing bells in the night and all that make for a really spinechilling atmosphere moreover james wans direction is pretty much flawless and don burgess cinematography is impressive there are a couple of tracking shots in the movie that simply look amazing the whole cast led by the delightful vera farmiga is great toowhat i really love is when directors have an eye for small details in their movies and truly care about seemingly unimportant scenes that dont contribute to the plot but are still crucial as to how an audience perceives a movie james wan is such a director in 2 there is one scene in which patrick wilsons character ed warren brings a copy of elvis blue hawaii soundtrack album to the hodgson house because it was mentioned earlier that the kids father took his elvis collection with him when he left the family and the kids loved to listen to it he puts the record on the turntable and everyone who knows elvis music will expect to get to hear the classic song cant help falling in love now but the turntable is broken what a bummer i think but then patrick wilson grabs an acoustic guitar that just stands there in the corner sits down on the edge of an armchair and delivers a pretty good impromptu take on the song with the kids chiming in at the end great i think but it would have been nice to hear at least a bit of elvis original version when they show the record and its cover so prominently in the movie oh well because of all the creepy stuff that is then going on in the movie i completely forget about the song and when ed stores the crooked man music box away after the finale and i hear those familiar haunting lines like a river flows surely to the sea from afar im just as surprised as ed lorraine vera farmiga put a copy of blue hawaii on the turntable and the movie ends with her and ed dancing to cant help falling in love i have heard this fantastic song hundreds of times but its like hearing a familiar song in a completely new way when its used so skillfully in a movie a great way to end a great movie actually i would have expected the movie to end differently with some kind of creepy shot suggesting that evil still lurks around the corner but james wan is not a director who bothers with those clichsso to put it in a nutshell this is a very wellmade movie that no horror fan should miss,astonish
i love this movie after watching the first movie i was left amazingly satisfied when i heard that a sequel was coming i couldnt miss it for the world i was interested in quenching the thirst i had from the first movie i watched the movie at the cinema with my friend and we had a blast the movie exceeded my expectations it left me so scared i had trouble shoving the images out of my head at night i probably had a few nightmares about it too i cant remember but i know i was scared beyond the shadow of a doubt i know this because before we watched i told my friend how i hate it when girls scream in a theater and i became exactly that i was so humiliated and it was fun i had to stop watching horror movies for a while yep its that awesome,astonish
i thought it will be a slow start as it did it first part and later engage audience with the actual story but woooww i was at the edge of the seat from the minute go till the end well directed well acted and very well scared d  no blood shednothing brutal or violent but sheer thrill and suspense as to how it would turn out in the end along with good spine chilling scary scenes and bgm good enough to keep you at the edgea kind of movie that wont scare anyone when going to sleep p possibly the best horror movie i have seen ready to be scared with 3,astonish
a thoroughly enjoyable night out at the flicks i saw the first film and loved it and i think i might have enjoyed this sequel even more and whatsmore the screening i went to of this was absolutely still and silent  james wan had the audience in the palm of his hand which is exactly the way it should bewan takes everything you loved about the first film and turns the volume up a couple of more notches the set design script acting and scare scenes are all uniformly masterful my only criticism would be that it was a tad long and the middle section of the film could have been trimmed down a bit we reach a point as an audience where we feel that the setup has been established for the final act and we want to move into the final movement of the film but wan lingers a bit too long and shows us one too many possession scenes i think this is a minor criticism thoughvera farmiga and patrick wilson deliver solid performances again and madison wolfe and frances oconnor whom i enjoyed immensely in the excellent tv series the missing are also excellent the scare set pieces are fantastic with the early scene of the demon visiting lorraine at home being one of the best horror scenes in years great music and atmosphere and i was pleased to see that wan even kept the creepy ascending yellow title scroll from the first film910 loses one point for being slightly too long,astonish
one of the greatest horror movies i have ever watched still cannot decide which part is better first or this one if you are true horror fan you will enjoy every minute of 2 hours excellent and convincing story in the background not something often seen in the horror movies perfect acting followed by nicely developed characters and lots but really lots of scary scenes i have a feeling that scary scenes are brought to the new higher level while watching the movie there is almost no space where you can relax a bit and feel no tension at all even during the daylight scenes you dont feel safe in your seat something rarely seen in the horror movies i just like the way how shoots are made and how camera moves everything seems so natural almost like you are participating in the movie dont be fooled that you will feel more safe and not so frighten if you go to cinema in company it doesnt help at allreally absolute horror classic,astonish
starting off with a compilation of what happened at the amityville house it all looked fine if you want to know what happened go watch the original one 1979 once told we do move over to enfiled great britain to see what is happening over there based on the real events late seventies at enfieldand again i was tricked or possessed by the trailers shown were people are really scared and are screaming been in the genre almost 35 years i thought could it be as scary as the exorcist 1973 sadly it wasntwhat it does is again having a lot of jump scenes and creepy voices but even as i did like part 1 this one couldnt satisfy my hungersome parts i did enjoy and of course children being possessed do offer something weird but its so typical james wan so you know what to expect and you do know what is going to happen like a ghost passes by in a slow and creepy way for example the painting coming alive mmm didnt work for me or the crosses being turned upside downwhat the exorcist did i havent seen yet i can understand that youth will be frightened to go watch this but for me the hype has killed the spiritgore 05 nudity 05 effects 255 story 255 comedy 05,astonish
another movie i saw at the theaters at first i didnt expect anything from this movies even though the first one was very good but as every other sequence it had only two ways to go kind of good or really bad as the movie started with a very subtle psychological horror flick it caught my complete attention to the screen the art and camera direction where completely stunning i cant find a single reason to not watch it at least for the art itself the usage of a not really known character like the crooked man was a good shot the personification was a bit iffy but i cant complain about it since it wasnt the real monster in question but you wouldnt know that until the middle of the movie i though it was weird that they only revealed the real monster at the almost end of the movie and yet left a bunch of little clues from start to end for example the dreams with the nun and valaks name in a bunch of earlier scenes in my vision the usage of a nun didnt make much sense and wanting it or not they didnt truly explain why valak took the figure of a nun but at the end i did enjoy the movie for its art in a whole i would totally recommend it for those of you who like good art directions like me and horror movie scripts in general,astonish
wow wow wow ive never been much of a fan of sequels but 2 was incredible im never one to jump at everything scary i see in movies as usually youve seen it all before  lets be honest nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore however had me jumping all over the place at one point i even yelped much to my embarrassment but thats why we go to horror movies to be scared  didnt disappoint all actors gave amazing performances  the story had you never in a state of boredom walking out of the cinema i couldnt wait to see what 3 would bring assuming were lucky enough for another definitely a movie to see in the cinema i give it 1010 great movie,astonish
its equal to its predecessor there is no way you wouldnt love this movie as much as you loved the first one the creep factor will not let you down if you love the supernatural aspect of horror films this one will be one of your top favorites i love movies that leave you waiting for the next one and this one does exactly that i didnt think they could do it again but they did i have been a fan of the true ed and lorraine warren my entire life following their cases can keep movies going strong for years to come and every one of them would be as good as the first one they have had their share of horror and to put it on the big screen makes you feel as if you were a part of their world these movies are truly inspired edge of the seat scary,astonish
2 the enfield case is a superb horror flick that we have been waiting for so long2 direction james wans affair with scare continues to give you eerie chills he seems to have mastered the art of going boo at people five minutes glimpse into the life of ed and lorraine and it doesnt feel like its been three years since the first one showed up your wounds find another gash and lo you are living a nightmare againthe director uses spinetingling motion to follow every still act unlike conventional movies and ends up acing every moment you feel as if you are living it rambling up and down the house it feels like you are walking in the shoes of the protagonist of the frame it creeps you out beyond limit to feel unpredictable terror the fact that formidable moments arent placed at junctures where you might expect them makes his horror stories one of a kindincessant horror so the unexpected happens in every frame so beautiful is its editing that you dont really feel at any point the movie losing its winsome charm one moment you are scampering to come out from a short heartattack then boom comes another thats how the terror is bestrewn all across the enfield case2 walks in with an extraordinary sance to drop off scare bombs one by one in a gorgeous fashion the fact that its plot finds the light from a true story makes you question the veracity of it all but hey its a horror movie and it succeeds in what it set out to achieve in the first placepatrick wilson still stays as one of the most powerful actors with his thoughtful mien as he bides by his consumed acting prowess he goes fullblown enchanting well supported at all times by the ever so brilliant actress vera farmiga they both complete each other in every senseto say 2 only had thrills would be an understatement it is a perfect blend of everything from thoughtful melodrama to unpredictable story twists and an enthralling climax that will have you bite your nails spotlessspoiler ouija board ahead the part where lorraine begs ed to not venture without her is the most dramatic bit her constant apprehension to save him from harms way will have you feeling sorry for her also you cannot overlook janet hodgson played stunningly by madison wolfe she is simply mindblowing with her acting there is so much drama lodged in her that she will rivet you from the moment you set eyes on her one of the best parts is when peggy opens up to lorraine about how her life has drastically changeded and lorraines appeasement in 2 will throw you in stark majestic awe both stay as the most noteworthy characters ever created they have a chemistry that is outright unrivalled their immense love for each other the way they try to console the afflicted their staying over acts to see to it that others are comfortable around and their intense care for affected families will leave you wondering how beautiful their souls must be in reality2 is a definite gogo if you need something thrillinger supernatural to topple you down from your seatsread all my reviews here httpstraightfromamoviecom,astonish
ive avoided new horror films for a few years now considering they all seem to cater to young audiences with no ability to concentrate or follow a plot recently however ive been baffled by a few new comers such as and its sequelnot only is this film scary its beautifully shot and the set dressing is quite simply astonishing some of the gags come a bit out of nowhere but overall the atmosphere is great the film has an attention to detail you just dont see very oftenthe con artists whose adventures this series is based on have a long list of other exploits and i really hope there will be a whole slew of films like this one,astonish
a ghostbusting couple decides to give it a rest after a demon comes too close but are drawn irresistibly across the atlantic by the cries for help from an english family haunted by the spirit of an old man where things get even closerhectic story that rolls out all the tricks to reasonable effect while wan does put bums on seats hes considered a bit safe and does the expected here but there is some edge to this standard story of puberty possession with violent entities piercing through the shadows with demonic intent early on the scares come through sound jumps but the visual weirdness takes over and delivers some good stuffthe acting is good particularly the wife there is one afterthought scene before the third act which starts with a false line about taking the music away and develops into a decent tribute to elvis while failing to deliver any horror effect thats probably the biggest blip in the pacing of a story that doesnt have enough psychological strength or coherent demon myth to outrun 100 minsthe christian angle would be nauseating except theres no sincerity and it fizzles out with maudlin reassurance for the teen audiencethe english accents are from drama school although there is a fair attempt at setting the contemporary scene from 1977  not sure maggie called herself the iron lady until two years latersound design early on was interesting but after that its mostly scorsesestyle dropping in of popular old tunes that sets the toneoverall more robust from wan but still safe as houses bwahahaha,astonish
wow it was an amazing movie i have to be honest its little to none the amount of horrorscary movies ive seen 1 wasnt all too scary for me which was a novelty although it had an amazing story line and more than enough suspense but this one oh jesus it got me jumping in my chair super scared my glasses even flew 2 rounds of chairs towards the front which im not proud to say so much suspense such amazing actors really really goodsince the beginning they catch your attention and they didnt loose it the demon in this movie is a genius and the movie keeps everyone fooled for a while oh and the elvis impersonation we get you have no idea what im talking about p  lovely go and watch it ,astonish
top top top i loved it i think it is much better than the first one there are so many scary parts that make you jump out of your seat top director and amazing actors vera was stunning as always since horror movies are mostly not scary and dont have a good story line definitely became my number 1  it keeps you on edge for the entire movie and this is indeed the art of doing a horror movie you never know whats going to happen next and there are a lot of moments where you just have to hold your breath seeing this movie in the cinema made the experience even better the people where scared and the atmosphere was incredible was kind of hard falling asleep after getting home since i live in londonbravo,astonish
now i must say i was reluctant to see this movie because i obviously get scared by horror movies dur and the only sessions were at 940pm every night but i knew my audience would want it and so i gritted my teeth and stepped into the movie theater i hope you guys know the sacrifices i make for youbut i walked out of the theater very impressed i dont have loads of horror movie experience but what i do know is that most of them have one priority only to scare the audience while this was definitely present in this movie i was pleasantly surprised at how layered and intricate the plot and characters were australias own james wan directed this movie and i must give a standing ovation for the job he did here bravo i dont think i trust many other horror directors aside from him the cinematography of this film was genius and flawlessly executed and was probably the scariest part of the movie the use of wide shots and a slowly panning camera back and forth from a source of horror was brilliant and this was fantastically complimented by the set design extensive use of props and the eerie and enigmatic lighting roughly half the time something would emerge from the darkness or from behind the props while the other half of the time nothing would happen but the anticipation was what scared viewers i would not be surprised if wan or the cinematography team were nominated for an oscar look out for the scene where janet is being interviewed by ed warren the camerawork really shines there youll know what i meanand that wasnt the only source of fright for viewers it just didnt stop throughout almost the entire movie by the end however it kind of lost its initial effect maybe i just became more acclimatized to it and of course i have to address the biggest clich plot convenience in all horror films walking towards the source of the horror why just why there was one scene however when an entire family after being scared enough sprinted out of their house to the neighbors next door i thought that was the most sensible thing anyone has done in a horror movie anyway to the plot i did like the spin they put on that the whole thing could be a hoax concocted by a bored girl which was an element present in the true story of this case and exploring that from different perspectives its something that the world deals with all the time skepticism and that element was used deftly in a plot twist that invigorated the story line when it needed it most for those wondering the actual events of this case are dramatized significantly to make the finished product ive seen the real evidence and im still not convinced that any of it was real the poignant tone at the end of movies is something that i both hate and like at the same time yes it gives the franchise some originality brings some themes to the table and makes the plot more intricate but at the end of the day this is a horror movie i want to walk out of the cinema shaking but the and they lived happily ever after takes some of that away thats where i feel a franchise like paranormal activity trumps the cast has familiar faces patrick wilson and vera farmiga with new guys madison wolfe frances oconnor lauren esposito benjamin haigh patrick mcauley simon mcburney maria doyle kennedy and simon delaney among others not many horror films have names you might recognize farmigas and wolfes performances were the standouts in this movie with the ensemble cast performing valiantly as well wilson and his character were a bit too fearless for me i loved wilson and farmigas cute chemistry it was a nice light element to bring to the table speaking of genres included action horror thriller mystery and romance while themes were family unity incredulity and the media the costuming and production value was done well and special effects were fine except for the crooked man sequence contained animation not sure i liked that very muchthe running time was pretty long but it felt like a journey because of the character development and how i was engaged the soundtrack and sound editing was effective in the way it was intelligently used and a sequel is definitely possible the warrens have a fair amount of source material to draw from you dont need to have seen the original or annabelle to enjoy this one but you will have a greater appreciation of it if you haveto conclude it could be improved through less of a happy ending even if its just one shot at the end or the possibility of a reawakening force and more thriller elements in terms of the villains credibility to really solidify the fear in the audience but i judge a good movie on how it stimulates emotions and there were definitely some emotions brewing inside mefor more reviews like this see chrisbreviewsblogspotcom,astonish
the first film was a big hit scary movie the spinoff prequel annabelle was a bit disappointing and i was looking forward to this critically higher rated sequel directed by james wan saw dead silence insidious basically set in 1977 peggy hodgson bedazzleds frances oconnor lives with her children janet madison wolfe margaret lauren esposito johnny patrick mcauley and billy benjamin haigh live in enfield london england one night janet is conversing with an unseen entity who claims that the house is his soon all the siblings and peggy witness paranormal activities for themselves with the spirit attacking them they are forced to take refuge with their neighbours the hodgsons create a media storm with their claims that their house is haunted paranormal investigators maurice grosse simon mcburney and anita gregory creeps franka potente are brought in to help janet is possessed by the spirit of bill wilkins an elderly man who previously lived and died in the house he wants his house back the story of the haunting eventually reaches noted demonologists ed insidiouss patrick wilson and lorraine warren orphans vera farmiga who a year ago were investigating the lutz family and the murders and demonic occurrences in amityville new york who come to london to help the case lorraine fears for eds life as she had a premonition of his death he promises they will only document they consult maurice and anita on the legitimacy of the case they also attempt to talk to wilkins spirit in attempt to stop him harassing the family one night a possessed janet is caught on video wrecking the kitchen the warrens are convinced the haunting is a prank but they change their minds when they find out wilkins is only a pawn being manipulated to haunt janet the true mastermind is a demonic nun who lorraine has seen in her visions the warrens return to the hodgsons house janet is possessed lightning strikes a tree outside the house leaving a stump that resembles what impales ed in lorraines premonition of his death ed stops the possessed janet jumping out the window and committing suicide but they are near to falling with the curtain he is holding to tearing lorraine remembers that the demons name is valak she confronts and addresses it by name successfully condemning it to hell janet is freed from possession and lorraine saves her and ed from falling the end of the film tells that peggy lives in the house until her death where she was found sitting in the same chair wilkins died in ed adds the the crooked man zoetrope toy from the house to his collection alongside the music box and annabelle the doll in the case also starring maria doyle kennedy as peggy nottingham simon delaney as vic nottingham sterling jerins as judy warren bob adrian as bill wilkins robin atkin downes as demon voice bonnie aarons as demon nun javier botet as crooked man and steve coulter as father gordon the cast all do well especially wilson and farmiga as the reallife ghostbusters wilsons highlight is an elvis presley impression singing cant help falling in love this works even better than the original film the jump scares with loud noises and things suddenly appearing are much more effective and a tense score by joseph bishara a really scary and splendid supernatural horror very good,astonish
this movie is absolutely excellent i enjoyed every minute of it seen it 2 times in the cinemasi dont know what it is exactly that james wan manage to do to keep the scare factor at max all the time maybe he simply knows whats truly scary and notthe sound design is extremely good and i do think it plays a huge role in terms of the scare factor i also love how the movie delivers truly aggressive horror where the main characters either have to chose fight or flight id say this is one of the best horror movies ive seen ever i also think this movie is even better than the first one i would absolutely recommend this movie,astonish
released back in 2013 managed to achieve a cult status among the followers of the horror genre and the sequel with director james wan himself wielding the megaphone was longawaited by the movie buffs across the worldi was a bit late to try this movie due to varied reasonsbut must say that the sequel was worth the wait and succeeded in keeping me thrilled till the end with its bounty of jump scares and oldschool horror stuffits a herculean task to produce a sequel that matches the quality of the original in which most of the filmmakers failbut not a crafted auteur like james wan who has struck it big in pushing the series forward with an equally thrilling sequel that has its share of excitement eventhough the film is made in a platform thats blatantly similar to the first except being shifted from us to the british settingthe movie set in 1977 london is based on the series of events following the poltergeist activity reported by the hogson family thats popularly known as enfield haunting and the screenplay by chad hayescarey hayesdavid leslie johnson and wan himself has developed the characters well and managed to narrate the events convincingly on screenthe characters of old billcrooked man and the inhuman spirit valak were scary and shook up with their sudden appearances joseph bishara is a maverick when it comes to sound design and here too amazes with an enthralling background score as in movies like insidous and ones in franchisenamely and anabellethe soundtrack holds a major key in creating an air of dread that evolves into sudden scaresthe technical soundness is notable with catchy framesneat cuts and excellent art directionvera farmiga and patrick wilson reprises their role from and did their part wellthe surprise package was 13 year old madison wolfe reprising the role of haunted janet hogson who caught attention with her brilliant act and control in handling emotional sequencesthe climax which ended all of a sudden was a weak link in an otherwise intriguing narrative and it felt as if wan didnt take much interest in going into the detail of inhuman spirit valak which is expected to be dealt in detail in the futurea spinoff film named the nun showcasing the inhuman demon valak is on the cards and is anticipated to carry franchise forwarddetailing the character thats introduced in this movieoverall2 is a neatly crafted sequel to thats worth every penny paid for,astonish
2 was a pretty decent horror movie as far as horror movies about paranormal activity goes this is probably the best one having said this its debatable that the first was just as good in my eyes it wasnt any better than the first one but not any worse either some scenes were really good and scary such as the first scene and some were quite predictable there were more good scenes than bad ones though warning do not watch this if it is your first horror movie i also think if you are going to watch this movie you should be either a 16 or an experienced horror movie watcher as you should be for most horror movieslike in the first movie of it says it is based on a true story they only say this to scare you it is true that there were people who heard strange noises in there homes but so do we all plus they never found out where the noises were coming from and in this movie there is a lot more than just noisesconsidering it is a a movie about paranormal activity  and those movies dont normally scare me because they are unrealistic this one is fairly scary it was a good quality movie with good graphics and an obvious amount of effort put in to the making the only disappointing thing for me was the bad story line and especially the ending which i thought was quite poor and rushed,astonish
i have to admit 2 is one of the best movies ive ever watchedi wasnt so impressed by 1even though it was pretty interesting but 2 has been very well directed and has a good case for a movie the movie is so realits like we are watching the case from a first hand i like the fact that the movie actually defines paranormal in the movie and actions for examplewhen the hodgson family is at their neighbors houseand the dog touches the small belland the dog transforms into the old crooked manfrom the spiritcalled balak i like how the movie directs scary scenesand makes them scary without making them fakefor example when lorain is in the room with balak the spiritand balak is hiding behind her own portrait and using it to cover her face lastlyi like how the movie isnt only about horror and spiritsand its also about different theories that could exist in real lifefor example when there was a theory that janet was faking all thisor when billy the grandpa was just used by balak to cover herselfso they couldnt recognize what was happening straight away was by her the movie is worth watching,astonish
my wife and i went to this movie on a whim and we are glad we did it was the scariest movie i have seen since that classic movie the haunting as fan of british movies i also liked the scenes in the classic neighborhood in london the acting is first rate i have been a fan of vera been watching bates motel the part of her husband was played by the same actor in fargo the tv series on fx this past season the girl janet i could have sworn was british was actually american the mother is a veteran actress as well playing the mother in selfriges in the first season on pbs he did and awesome job as well anyway one will not be disappointed,astonish
huge props need to go to aussie horror king james wan he had his big break with the mysteriously creepy gorefest saw which spawned a multitude of sequels that he also produced he then went on to direct the films insidious and  two films that breathed new life into the stale genre after directing insidious chapter 2 and producing the spinoff annabelle he is back at the helm of the next sequel 2in this instalment the focus lies on the hodgson family comprised of a single mum of four children who live in the suburb of north london called enfield what adds to the fear in this film is the fact that once again it is based on true events as these hauntings became infamous all over england and eventually worldwide in the 70s ed and lorraine warren reprised by patrick wilson and vera farmiga are summoned to investigate what appears to be a combination of a haunted house and the demon possession of a little girlwithout revealing too much certain scenes that used cgi immediately take you out of the film and therefore might dull the scare factor however this film is full of traditional scares and suspenseful moments that have you jumping out of your seat i literally did jump out of my seat at one pointthe cherry on this ghoulish cake is the fact that real imagery and audio is used throughout the end credits almost as a friendly reminder that this stuff really went downif youre a fan of the franchise and of james wans work as i am then youre in for a deliciously scary treatmotherofpopcornwordpresscom,astonish
the sinister synopsis six years following the infernal investigation of the perron household haunting ed patrick wilson and lorraine warren vera farmiga bates motel are back to take on a case more sinister than ever before with evil making its way to the serene london community of enfield peggy hodgson frances oconnor a single mother of four calls upon the warrens expertise in helping her youngest daughter janet madison wolfe overcome the perilous possession thats all too familiar for ed and lorraine the only thing the warrens dont realize is that theyre dealing with an unprecedented power so cynical that even their own vulnerability may get the very best of them the diabolical desire much like director james wans initial installment of 2013 there are plenty of positive qualities throughout from the credibility of each and every character especially wilson and farmiga who never lost a single beat from their initial portrayal of our beloved demon experts to the cinematography that sends a spinetingling sensation all in its own artistic way having the supernatural subgenre infamous for its heavy use of cgi wholeheartedly relies mainly on practical effects most notably the crooked man portrayed by javier botet that seemingly looks computer generated but is all the more natural with his creepy spontaneous movements even the soundtrack carries an effective vibe from the hollies bus stop to elvis presleys cant help falling in love thats necessary for the films time period even wilsons own cover of the song is quite plausible the rancid reaction when it comes to the negative notations of the film theres really not too much to indite into this department even for the films 134minute duration the pace is just enough to keep you attentive on the horror that awaits also like said before even the films lesser use of cgi and jumpy scare tactics actually works to its advantage unlike the majority of attempts in its class the axed addendum another interesting point about the film is its homage to the notorious amityville haunting the intro recaps wans reincarnation of the malicious murders of ronald defeo and the subsequent haunting of the lutz family where the warrens dipped their toes into a nightmare deemed the most menacing of their encounters until,astonish
i love all the modern horror movies that are written like annabelle sinister and insidiouswhen i saw getting 79 stars on imdb i knew it would be a huge mistake for me to wait for it to come out on bluray you usually only get one chance to see movies like this on the big screenits almost unheard of for horror films to get rated that high now i know why so many people are loving this film for me this surpassed the original and while it wasnt as scary for me as insidious 1 or sinister 1 the story itself is probably the strongest out of them and there are plenty of great scares special effects and a totally original villainim not a big fan of slow burner horror in fact i generally try to avoid them because they are not exciting enough for me at times during the first 3040 minutes of this film i got the feeling it was a slow burner but as the story progressed i reflected some more and its really not a slow burner its just such a well written story that it creates a perfect balance between hardcore horror and slow burner character and plot developmentas the imdb rating confirms this is one horror film that satisfies most horror movie fansand if you are the type of person who gets teary eyed at emotionally moving scenes fortunately for you you might get a little waterworks going during this filmthis movie as far as horror genre goes is just perfect it really deserves a 1010 i wish people would stop reserving a 1010 for some holy grail of a movie that will never be made this folks is what a 1010 looks like enjoy,astonish
i very much enjoyed the first movie and expected a even better movie which isnt but only cause of some little things although its like the first one one of the best horror movies since 20 years but there are a couple of things which the first movie made better first of all its not very nice to see the creepiest daemon in the first sequence james wan did everything right in the first movie to not show the evil daemon til the end this time you know him almost since minute 1 second thing not going right is the end its very constructed and not very logical why the hell is it the same daemon as in the amityville house something you never get explained third thing not so right is the way the movie shoots with effects and jumpscares i mean nothing wrong with some nice effects and jumpscares but less is more a rule the first movie kept in mind although the movie is also very scary cause of its perfect dark atmosphere and the beautiful sets i know i criticized a lot of things but dont get me wrong its a very very good horrormovie and a lot better than most of the last horrormovies its sadly just not as good as the first one,astonish
what is true in the true story on which this film is based people levitating which violates the elementary law of gravity i do not believe that the furniture can move around the house all alone that a dead man or a spirit can speak through the mouth of a living person that people can go from one room into another through the floor ceiling or walls or that a dead man can strangle a living person  chance makes that ive seen only with a few days interval in between the italian film libido1965check my review and this 2 i wrote about the italian film and many other films of the same genre that ghosts make their presence felt only in the big houses of rich people this 2 contradicts the theory ghosts of the past come here to disturb the existence of a poor family from enfield london well you got to see it yourself but i warn you its very disturbing its almost as good as the exorcist1973 maybe even better in terms of degree of fright arguably from other viewpoints artistic achievement subject the difference between fiction and after a real case,astonish
this was an unbelievably good movie and not just a horror movie it really is a story about the power of love and faith under the most dire and frightening circumstances in fact twice the movie was so intensely scary but also emotional that i actually teared up and im usually pretty stoic in movies the story structure is really well done you have two plots in the beginning the english hodgson family and the american demonologists the warrens as the haunting is beginning to wreak havoc on the hodgson family the warrens have become spiritually exhausted due to the evil theyre constantly forced to confront what was different and brilliant about this movie was the use of doubt and skepticism most demon horror movies use the lame fallback of everyone disbelieving the besieged victim and youre just irritated that no one is on the victims side because its so obvious theyre not delusional or whatever with this movie they go to great lengths to demonstrate how meticulously the warrens obtain proof and arent just there on some crusade this added a great deal of plausibility for me which made it so much more frightening i havent been this scared since i saw the first movie,astonish
there was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile he found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile he bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse and they all lived together in a little crooked house2 is one of those rare squeals that wasnt terrible but rather good the squeal did a lot of things better than first film in terms of characters the twist and the unpleasant atmosphere but its kinda rare that we get a squeal thats just as solid as its predecessor with plenty of surprises under its sleevei have no idea how james wan dose it i seriously dont know how he manages to take the things that i usually cant stand in todays horror and somehow turn it into gold thats why movies always stand out from the rest of the paranormal demonic movies because movies like actually have an atmosphere and characters with depth even the jump scars are effective and used at appropriate times james wan is the only director i can think of that i trust when it comes to directing horror movies as he understands the genre well wan does it again here with tension that builds and the good old sense of death the acting from everyone was pretty damn solid patrick wilson vera farmiga and frances oconnor were all great in the movie even the littler girl madison wolfe was really good as she actually looked terrified and it was a very convincing performance even for a child actor in a horror movie what really surprised me about 2 is that i actually did care for the characters i mean compared to some horror flicks that are somewhat similar to this but with the characters that are forgettable and so boring to watch on screen luckily this movie had characters with emotional weight to them the camera work the score and the cinematography are the highlights of this film it also takes its time and uses different ways to scare or spook you it may not impress a lot of people but i do admire the film markers for taking a risk like that enfield haunting case has been a hot topic for years now with people debating if its a hoax or not and while the based on a true story may be bullsht or just any movie that uses that headline for attention im just so use to it now that its getting numb a lot people complained that this was too hollywood or it was not accurate to the original story i have seen plenty of documentarys and stories about the enfield haunting case and its so boring i literally found nothing interesting about it and all the evidence for the paranormal haunting seemed a bit fake im so glad this movie wasnt accurate to the original case that may or may not be real the film markers took something with it and told a different story with events thats very loosely based on an actual case the problems that i had with this movie which is not a lot is the use of cg for scenes involving the crooked man it took me out of the movie and it kinda took away the terror from the crooked man character that wan beautifully created and yes javier botet who is about 6 6 plays the crooked man but the cg is so noticeable when he starts jumping around or growing tall to scare the little girl that hes haunting i think practical effects would have been so much better and scarieroverall rating 2 is a solid squeal thats way better then the avenge horror squeal it takes your expectations and turns it completely around,astonish
in 2 a family of a single mother and four children living in london find themselves being haunted by an evil spirit because of their increasingly dire situation they decide to contact ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga warren who answer their aid call so james wan more like james win know what im saying because he directed this awesome movie no ok sorry in all seriousness i may have found my favorite horror movie with 2 thats not saying much as i am not that educated in horror movies but this film showed me that in order to create horror there must be no shortage in creativity and practicality ive heard people saying that crafting a horror movie must be easier than other genres but this movie proves the opposite director james wan injects his film with horror through some of the most elaborate visual techniques i have witnessed in a movie from this genre from the simple use of shadows to the use of decoys in the shot that only want to trick our focus wan plays with our senses in almost every sequence you are always left examining every aspect of the environment where the characters are in order to guess where the next horrifying thing will jump from next and at times it is so obvious that you are left squinting your eyes and cringing waiting for the jump scare to take the color out of your skin from pov shots to elaborate tracking shots the variety of filming techniques is also astonishing wans excellent directing also tackles the sound category every knock and every squeak serves a purpose and enhances the atmosphere in the following i am going to do a very spoilery commentary about to sequences which raised all of my body hair and turned me into a chickenskinned porcupine but at the same time made me admire james wan as a horror director the first sequence i want to mention is the one where ed warren contacts the spirit of bill wilkins bob adrian through janet madison wolfe ed is facing the camera and his back is facing janet who is sitting on a couch the camera very cleverly maintains focus on ed and through the use of depth of field distorts the image of janet as ed begins to interview the spirit and this entity starts to answer in a very crooked voice janet begins to shift very subtly into an old man this isnt implemented as a jump scare but as a holy crap look look look moment as you maintain your focus in ed warren and patrick wilsons great performance the oddity slowly and almost unnoticeably starts to manifest whats incredible is that the scene lasts about 4 minutes wans complete trust in wilsons performance and in our attention as an audience is baffling he has no need of hammering in the fear factor he trusts that our attention and perception will do the job for him the other sequence i will delve in switches subtlety for the most horrifying character that will haunt my dreams until i drown it with many sessions of watching colorful cartoons and sitcoms that will dry my tears and keep me from reluctantly waiting for that face to pop out of a window at night trust me it really is that scary and if youve watched it you know what i am talking about yes that nun bonnie aarons is the stuff of nightmares the makeup and character design is one of the best i have seen in a horror film probably on par with the exorcist it is much simpler but damn that crap brings the crap but back to the sequence man was it bonechilling lorraine following the nun into that room and then the way in which the film plays with us through shadows and the shape of the nuns face damn damn damn i really wanted to look away as the nuns face just sat there in the dark and i think i used all of my cringe faces in that single sequence alone that is true mastery in film design the film also included some amazing musical choices all of those christmas carols that played as the nuns background music were chilly but also pretty epic but music wasnt always used to enhance the chills but also to bring some heart into the film cant help falling in love was used to gather our characters in moments of tranquility which made the pace much more tolerable the characters were also quite tolerable for a horror movie they obviously included the kid who wandered out into the darkness alone in spite of all the spookiness that had happened and made us question why he didnt have at least 7 people accompanying him with all the lights on but all of the characters in general where entertaining to watch and the family and the warrens had enough character development for us to care about their survival the awesome performances especially from patrick wilson vera farmiga and madison wolfe also helped the movie become very digestible although i truly admire this film i do have a few negatives to point out firstly there is a tall and silly monster called the crooked man that makes sudden appearances and it just feels very out of place given his very over the top and colorful design all things considered 2 is a true masterwork in horror it is very uncommon for a sequel to be as good as the original but in my case this movie surpassed the first one because of some extremely clever filming and storytelling techniques i am thrilled to experience all of james wans upcoming projects and i am confident that he has the ability inflict some very intelligent thrills into us audience members i am rating 2 with a 9 out of 10,astonish
this movie is fantastic i went with my boyfriend too see 2 and both of us were so nervous that we thought the beginning of marvel trailer was a horror movie everything about this movie is fantastic it is definitely the scariest movie i have ever seen i had chills the whole time and the whole experience was so nerve wrecking this movie had so many scary moments the possessed nun the crooked man bill and man i did not like that chair or that tent despite the many scary and crazy moments in this movie my favorite scene was when ed warren patrick wilson was singing cant help falling in love it was a nice change from all of the craziness and when the movie was over my boyfriend and i were so ready to get out of there we were the only ones left in there and when we were walking out my boyfriend said im not looking back we were walking out when an even scarier music starting playing in the credits and we just ran out like we were running for our lives but i definitely recommend this movie its fantastic its scary and james wan really knows how to make a scary movie,astonish
everyone was going on about this one being better than the first so tonight i went the first one wasnt even the least bit scary to me this one does have quite a few more scares but they are all jump scares my biggest dislike was the movie ended quite abruptly when it shouldnt have because it drug on for two hours and then when the actual climax occurs it lasts a good 10 seconds and boom the end since that was the entire point of the movie it made no sense whatsoever for the scene to only last 10 seconds so ill totally give it credit for jump scares and for the cast including awesome franka potente shes in awesome german films but it is one of those films that could have been so much better,astonish
in my opinion many horror films today lack depth and meaning in their films this is why is good it stands out as a truly scary horror film that uses more than just jump scares to entice the audience the films excellent cinematography creates a brilliant atmosphere that truly engrosses the audience in the film the performances are great with the children in the film not being incredibly cringeworthy the lighting and special effects are superb bar one specific part that i will talk about later and the story is rather well writtenas well as this i believe its safe to say that 2 could be viewed without seeing the first film that being said having watched the first film and other films set in that universe such as anabelle can help to create a better understanding for the audiencewhile the film is technically excellent there are a few things that let the film downbear in mind that the events in the film are based upon the enfield haunting in enfield london for example there are some plot lines that can seem quite confusing for the audience there are 2 different plot lines at the beginning that eventually merge and become one the warrens in the us and the hodgson family in london sometimes the transition can seem confusing it often feels like two different films with the warrens having completely different experiences to the hodgsons this is eventually tied together albeit quite loosely there is no real explanation as to why spoilers form herevalak the main demon in the film possessesuses the old man as a pawn to haunt the hodgsons they just seem to be used together despite the fact that they are situated in completely different places as well as this there is a second demon with the hodgsons in the form of the crooked man there seems to be so much more that can be done with this character that isnt explored it seems as if its there and then suddenly isnt this may be a way of hinting at a separate film with the crooked man another issue with the crooked man is the fact that he is neither cgi or mocapped but rather an animated clay figure while this does look incredibly creepy it seems to break some immersion a bit it is easy to tell its clay animation which doesnt really fit the theme of the rest of the film the clay animation isnt used very often however which is worth noting overall 2 is an excellent sequel and a fantastic horror film i would definitely recommend watching the film whether youre aware of or any story relating to the warrens this film is an enjoyable experience and gives the audience a few good scares,astonish
i saw 1 back in 2013 up until that point i had yet to see any good american horror films asian ones are the best for you ghost movie fans 1 was a difference maker and completely changed my attitude towards american horror filmsfast forward 3 years i was extremely excited when 2 was about to release and i had very high expectations the movie smashed my expectation in every way which is amazing in itself there were many good things about the film however one thing stood outthis is the only ghost movie i remember and i have seen many as a big fan of the genre since i was before 10 which featured a male ghost that is not a 10 year old boy and he was scary up until now i thought only little boys and women can be ghostsother than that the plot featured a very good twist at the end which i will not spoil great movie if you are a horror movie film fan this is a must see if you are curious about the genre this is still a mustsee there are many bad movies in this genre just look at the average rating of most movies and this one is oneofakind i hope there will be a 3 sometime in the near future,astonish
goes back to the roots of horror movies yes you have classic horror movie clichs and plot twists but this movie does these clichs at the peak of their level based of a real life event enfield case the story follows a family in london which is being tormented by a ghost essentially they seek out help in getting rid of the ghost which brings back ed and lorraine from the first i cant credit this movie enough for its cinematography consistently from scene to scene you are put straight in the movie with the rest of the characters top that with ingenious scene transitions and long shots which reveal things in the corner of your eye plus the jump scares dont feel cheap but earned from the way this movie creates suspense which is rare these days as most jump scares are just thrown at the audience for no real reasonsurprisingly i was also very invested in the characters the family was very close and caring during such a tough time plus ed and lorraine had the cutest relationship in a horror movie which just makes you want to root for them throughout the moviethis is a must see horror it does everything right from story its characters to how its presented if only other horror movies to come learned from this masterpiece,astonish
first of all this was a surprisingly strong sequel as a fan of the first movie ive been looking forward to this for quite some time i watch a lot of horror movies and it always really bugs me how the setting is similar in all of them family moves into house house is haunted paranormal researchers arrive and save the day this film was no different and didnt stick out as very creative either but it was still pretty enjoyable you can usually expect a solid horror movie when you watch something by james wan the film has a few good however predictable scares its not subtle horror either but the jumpinginyourface kind i dont really get why this has been rated 1010 so many times as it is definitely not flawless another thing about this movie was its duration horror films are usually around 1h 30m except this one was over 2 hours which i found a bit too long for example was that scene of ed singing cant help falling in love really necessary in my opinion you kind of start to lose interest after an hour because there is just that about 20 minutes long part where nothing really happens to summarize this i was pleasantly surprised by how well the sequel held up to the first one however i think that it is still just an average horror movie,astonish
usually not a fan of sequels but this one really surprised me it was nice and long just over 2 hours which is rare for a horror film this allowed for much better character development than the first one imo there were also some really well done scares and beautifully shot scenes in general one of my favorite scenes involved a creepy painting without giving too much away that had me on edge the whole time acting was top notch  especially the girl who played janet vera farmiga and patrick wilson have great chemistry as well if you liked the first one i highly recommend checking this one out as you wont be disappointed i think i may have even liked it better than the first  which is something i never thought id hear myself say,astonish
ive watched a lot of horror movies and time and time again not many can be considered good amazing when i said a lot i mean ive scoured the internet for any horror movie that is practically watchable and not cheaply made ranging from american ones to korean singaporean indonesian thai japanese malay french australian and chinese indie horrors would be my best choice until james wan smartly came up with for a sequel i still couldnt believe how it blew my mind the moment the movie started i was already assaulted by various well played scares and darkly eerie scenes the way wan framed his shots were great not only giving the audience povs but extreme close ups that brings us into their world as if we were there watching it unfold there were lots of build ups throughout the movie but the ending was rather rushed would have loved to see a little longer and more climatic end kudos to the portrayal on ed  lorraines romance which patrick and vera played wonderfully,astonish
there is no denying the fact this is a slick wellpolished horror film the director is good but that is what this is a horror flickgoing into this knowing the truth about ed and lorraine warren and the actual enfield case made it difficult for me to watch the movie at first i honestly had to tell myself to just watch it for what it is a horror movieim not sure if this is a spoiler or not but i checked the box anyway just in case but ed and lorraine warren were exposed years and years ago and frauds they faked the amityville case as well as many othersfact of the matter is this movie is very loosely based on a true story it really bothers me when movies claim to be based on a true story when the movie itself is nothing like the actual truthed and lorraine warren barely had anything to do with this case 2 makes it out like they were the knights in shining armor for the family when in reality they were laughed away from themthe real enfield case was heavily investigated by others who on film disproved the claims and exposed the children as staging all of it the real paranormal investigators on the case videotaped the children throwing things and setting up things and even the one child using a deep voice to sound like a demon the case was dismisseded and lorraine warren showed up and ed in his usual fashion said it was demonic even after the case was disproved as a hoax by the childrenwith that being said 2 is based on a hoax children orchestrated and passed off as truth involving two known frauds who in reality had very little to even do with ityou can even do research on the first and discover much of the same the actual people that happened to called out the warrens and eventually the film as fabricating informationbut again as far as a horror movie goes it is great watch it for that do not believe for a second any of this actually happened the direction is phenomenal the acting sound and imagery is superb this is definitely one of the better horror movies i have seen since honestly the first there is nothing new here no new groundbreaking material but the director takes an old formula and makes it work welli recommend it,astonish
i am an expert in all kinds of filmography  briefest that make a horror film that offends people is already hard to achieve it in 2016 but it is even more  because the public has grown accustomed to each thingcon the case enfield james wan he has outdone himself instilling fear in the minds of the viewers but in the meantime interest and curiositho seen all the greatest horror films of cinema history such as the exorcist  the shining  the silence of the lambs  the ring  mother  etc  etc  etc  but this one in particular is one of the few films that is literally managed to keep me with her eyes stuck to the screen  taking advantage of all its capabilities the director has managed to beat all competition in the field of horror films  i hope mr  wan will give again to do to create a sequel of the same thickness  whose protagonists warren spouses struggling with some new demoni my sincere congratulations ,astonish
nothing in 2 can match the terrific hideandclap sequence from the earlier film  lets face it that was always going to be hard to top  but thats not to say this sequel doesnt pack its share of solid scares with 2013s director james wan creator of both the saw and insidious franchises managed to pump fresh blood into a genre as creaky as the haunted house thriller this time he gives us a slowbuilding pressurecooker of a film thats a respectable followupset in 1977 not long after their success in the now famous amityville case the film sees hotshot paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson and vera farmiga dispatched to london to look into the complaints of a family who claim theyre being terrorized by a spiritcashstrapped single mom peggy hodgson frances oconnor and her four kids are dealing with a lot in their home  toys go on by themselves in the night furniture starts flying across the room and there are frequent rumblings and rattlings from behind the walls that cant be explained but things really come to a boil when youngest daughter janet madison wolfe begins to growl in an old mans voice and their lives become seriously endangeredthe films period setting and englands gloomy weather contribute a lot by way of atmospherics and the hodgson home in a workingclass london suburb is all kinds of creepy with unsettling dark corners and rotting damp walls wan sets up the mood for some effective scares giving us the kind of jumpinyourseat moments weve come to expect from him now creepiest of all is a scene involving a framed painting on a wall and the appearance of long white fingers from behind itbut like the earlier film what really separates this one from your standard issue horror movie is the level of performance that wilson and farmiga bring to the table theyre such good actors they sell the audience on even the cheesier aspects of the story and of course on the romantic bond between the couplealthough it feels way too long at roughly 133 minutes and takes many liberties with the truth while still insisting its based on true events 2 ultimately succeeds in delivering slowmounting dread punctuated by powerful moments of absolute terror i dont know if i can see a nun dressed in a habit without a chill going down my spine,astonish
2 is similar to another story about a haunting which the warrens investigate basically a remix of the first installment the different characters create a rapport which connects with the audience james wan the director creates a slow build up where the viewer always feels on edge for what is next to happen similar to other ghost stories the usual over dramatic over the top scares which makes one wonder about fraud i roll my eyes with skepticism with haunting stories i still do not understand why they would store the cursed objects in their own house i do not care that they lock the door it is still too close for comfort creepy sets and ghosts but the ending is just too much to take 2 is 7 out of ten stars,astonish
ed warren patrick wilson and his clairvoyant wife lorraine vera farmiga are back ghostbusting in this frightening sequel to ed and lorraine find helping out families with their ghostly problems is too much for them and both want to retire after the amityville haunting lorraine reinacts what happened in the house in her mind and it is frightening to her she also sees this demonic nun bonnie aarons in her visions all the retirement plans change when a priest brings a tape recording to them to listen to it is a man speaking in a british accent and ed thinks the man is possibly senile the priest tells him no the owner of the voice is an 11yearold girl named janet hodgson madison wolfe who lives in the burg of enfield england in a 2 story house with her mom and siblings in 1977 her father ran off with a neighbor lady who bore him twins the hodgson family consists of peggy frances oconnor older sister margaret lauren esposito and two little brothers billy benjamin haigh and johnny patrick mcauley it has not been an easy time for the family after the man of the house left johnny is teased mercilessly by the kids at school because he stutters and peggy worries how she will support herself and 4 kids into all of this janet and margaret are hearing noises late at night and the furniture starts to move on its own peggy doesnt know what to do about these disturbances and the police who visit her suggest she call the tv station and go on air telling the world what is happening to them maurice grosse simon mcburney who challenges the warrens at every turn shows margaret and janet on his show janet starts talking in the deep voice and the lights flash on an off there are more hauntings with janet being levitated off the ground and johnnys zoetrope with the crooked man coming alive the crooked man is played by javier botet and i think with his body structure and the fact he can move his arms and legs in strange ways due to marfan disease makes him a creepy addition to the movie it is revealed janet is possessed by a man who died in her house and he reveals his name to be bill wilkins bill doesnt want to go to heaven or hell and the creepy nun is stopping his spirit from moving on another reveal that came as a surprise janet caused some of the furniture to move and it was caught on video by anita gregory franka potente janet has no choice but to confess what she did and the warrens leave in the train lorraine has a vision of bill wilkins and he tells her he cant move on he is held by a demon and the warrens have to reveal the entitys name when they go back to the hodgson house the haunting is in full force with no help from janet and lorraine realizes she knows the demons name because during a vision she wrote it in her bible she reveals the name just as demon is throwing janet and ed out of the window to their deaths this is great creepy movie with wonderful performances from patrick vera and the rest of the cast madison wolfe is also effective as the traumatized janet who doesnt understand why the haunting is happening and she just wants to be a normal young girl who has a father and who isnt teased at school this is a worthy sequel to ,astonish
classic is how i d call this movie and that is not meant in a negative way story and progression is highly predictable if you a casual horror movie person  but it is the quality and pacing that makes this movie stand outthe acting is very good not just for a horror movie  but all in all the chemistry between the protagonists is interesting and never really stereotypical much  or lets say  it is of course clichd but in a good way hard to explain cause i d usually consider a clichd character a bad thing the characters do act as expected in a horror movie  but do not come across like morons like so many horror movie character come across  what i liked very much was that the characters actually communicate with each other  a feature that is used in just so many horror movies that is the noncommunicationfactor to actually make the story possible in the first placespecial effects and scares were well doneall in all  the movie is not really too scary nothing you loose your sleep about  but it is enjoyable and suspenseful highly recommended,astonish
a pretty good horror movie the story is fairly interesting and held me and my dates attention the actors do a pretty good job at their roles could be better but theyre never so bad that it ruins the moviethroughout the movie there are moments when the scenery feels unrealistic for example theres a scene where one character is being dragged into a window and it is obvious the character is a dummy other instances include props like trees and broken wood looking cheap and plasticy but overall the environment is believable as long as you dont focus too much on it like i didi saw this movie in a drive in for 8 and i can say it was worth it so if you find yourself able to see the movie for cheap go for it and bring a hot date,astonish
i dont really like watching horror movie to me thats a waste of time because most horror movies are just a series of scenes that scare you my first horror movie was drag me to hell it was an okay movie i quite like the plot and the twist at the end but it didnt change my mind about horror moviesthen my second horror movie which is actually changed my mind from the plot to the twist to the overall execution it is just as good as drama movies yes i am not kidding if there is an oscar for horror movie will surely top the list its that good and i cant imagine how a horror movie can get better so a 1010 here lets hope james wan proves me wrong with his prequel that has been rumored,astonish
a sincere thank you to james wan for reviving the franchise after the debacle called annabelle james wan is probably the only director currently in hollywood who is capable of making a believable horror film the genre which is just full of either horrorcomedy or horror gore was really becoming boring before it was becoming boring but then comes james wan is a messiah of the horror genrenot going to talk about the plot but i am going to say this that a good horror movie doesnt need loud noises to build up a scene and james wan knows that every build up scene in this movie just has the breathing of the characters or the noises on the wooden floors or a creepy chime music thats all and boom the acting is very believable especially the little girl patrick and vera are exceptional the main crux of a horror movie is that you are not scared of the ghost or demon but you are scared for the characters and the imminent threat looming on them if you dont care for the characters then a horror movie is a lost cause you care about the warrens and that keeps you hooked to every dark room every whisper around them i had a little problem with some jokes in the movie which i think could have been avoided but its fineit is refreshing to watch a good horror movie and i would urge you to go alone if you want the full thrill of this movie,astonish
ive been waiting for this movie since the first and i must say i really enjoyed it its a classic james wan film great direction acting and of course its damn scarybut 2 isnt as scary as the first film but its almost there the first film had a little more classic scarescant forget that hide and clap scene but its still terrifying and intense the point is it is very difficult to make sequels of horror movies but james wan nails it the performances too are solid the character janet is the star of the movie and madison wolfe portrays it beautifully incredible acting and you actually feel sympathy for her vera fermiga and patrick wilson continue their epicness over here and more heart is given to their storyis definitely worth watching james wan puts his horror tricks to a good use yet again,astonish
i rarely watch horror movies but at the insistence of a friend i agreed to go to this one and believe me at the end of the movie i was really surprised and intrigued how this movie amazingly captured my breath this movie sends your central nervous system to a spin with its innumerable terrorizing moments the movie follows a common plot that most horror films do a haunted house that is like 100 years old demonical possession of a kid followed by oppression havoc destruction integrated with creaky staircases darkness flooded basements and swirling furnitures just when you thought that you can anticipate the next sequence in the movie youre proved terribly wrong because the direction team have done such a admirable job in the pacing of the plot that not in one moment the audience find themselves disengaged from the movie they create the buildup create inexhaustible anxiousness about it then kill it and then give you a frightful shock when you are least expecting it that is the real beauty of this movie the nerve frizzling surprises the story is set in england where a single disillusioned mother with 4 kids live in a house haunted by a previous owner who is now a ghost refusing to leave the house the demon creates mayhem in the house diabolically torturing the family and creating ruckus at the most inopportune moments the ghost takes on little daughter janet 11 and uses her as his controller to channelize his wrath over the family real life ghost hunters are called upon to help the family and detect the root cause of this evil but they are at their wits end and are unable to improve the familys situation finding themselves going under personal risk they begin to ponder if its all a hoax and nothing but a dramatical performance by the little girl in order to seek attention from the society the atmosphere gets creepier and creepier and just when you thought the number of shocks is just done you are attacked with an another ghastly attack you will literally hear your hearts beating out of your ears however given all the good points the story is bit of a letdown there will be no answers for your why is this happening or what is the reason there is no explanation the direction has relied on the no of jumpouts it gives to the audience it is also not clear the motive of the ghost which is vaguely depicted the director knows how to manipulate the pulse and breath of the audience and his successful tactics in making the audience jump has helped the disguise an otherwise pretty imprecise and hazy story overall for a delightful frightening experience you might try your money on this movie worth a watch people who get frightened easily are asked not to watch it,astonish
i think 2 is better than the first movie it is scariermore intense and has more of those pls dont be there momentspatrick wilson vera farmiga and especially lauren esposito did a wonderful job you can really feel the fear and tightness in margrets psyche maybe one of the jump scares here and there could be omitted and james wan could have also leave off some horror clich moments but all in all 2 is very high above average with some moments and scares you can expect and some pictures and scenes you have seen before but probably not that that well done especially the evil and demonic side is very well done and manifested,astonish
directed by james wan most horror sequels have a tendency to be predictable and follow the same template as the first installment you know where the evil is and when it will pop out and make you jump in your seat jason leaps at you with the machete freddy sneaks up on you in your dreams and so on tale as old as time being a fan of the first film i expected this one to have the same tropes and construct with the characters and themes i was wrong dead wrong this is one of the rare breed of horror sequel that is scarier than this original and raises the stakes for everyone including the audiencebased on another one of ed and lorraine warrens paranormal investigation cases more specifically the enfield poltergeist the film opens postamityville and we see our heroic duo famous but weary doing talk shows debating with skeptics about the incidents lorraine also worries that ed might die in a future investigation after seeing a vision they are then persuaded to visit a family in england who are being terrorized and discover something more sinister than theyve ever faced before when i say the stakes have been raised that is just the tip of the iceberg if the first installment was the first circle of hell this one cranks it to the tenth maybe even eleventh not since i rented the original evil dead when i was in high school have i been this scared but the scares are just the beginning as the film also deals and balances weighty themes of faith skepticism and facing our own fears we care and fear for everyone as there is not one character that is disposable or purposeless unlike in other horror franchises which have a habit of swapping out leads and sidecharacters like batteries in a remote patrick wilson and vera farmiga give fantastic and awardworthy performances as ed and lorraine warren2 is scarier than the original and also more thoughtprovoking that leaves you not only breathless but also raises some interesting questions and discussions in the process if you werent frightened by true evil before this one might just change your mind,astonish
i have to say and admit that this one is going to scare you amazing direction done by james wan by making this sequel the beginning itself is the scary part to make audience waiting to see what would happen next james wan has the ability to frighten the audience with each shots justice done to the characters played by everyone the footage taken from the original incidence were well used and shown this sequel well deserved to be made this movie is worth watching if you really want to scare yourself if you really love scary movies than dont miss this one i have to admit that james wan is the most skilled director for the horror movies patrick wilson and vera farmigo have done fabulous acting,astonish
ed and lorraine warren are back this time in england to investigate a familys claim of unexplained supernatural events occurring right in their very own home from the opening sequence of the film the scares start rolling and is carefully paced by returning director james wan the scary scenes are intense and unexpected which makes it one fun ride and the acting was believable from the leads to the supporting cast it was topnotch acting all in all 2 is a great sequel and overall film definitely ranks up there with one of the scariest movies alltime i recommend watching this one in the theater for the sound imagery and experience,astonish
movie reviews 2 rating 810 the story is horror the concept is based on real life paranormal activities the portrayal of horror story by re creating it on screen is brilliantly taken care of the camera  work is good selection of houses  for shooting is itself beauty as they naturally look like haunted places placement of horror scenes and characters used to make evil  appearance is appreciative the lead pair who hunt for the ghosts  have acted well as usual and the little girl who is disturbed by devil influence  in the movie  acted  exceptionally making of movie  is superb and use of locations for shooting is wonderful the first half  of the cinema  rather looks like a comedy show the second half  of the cinema  is horror and 3 to 4 scenes were very beautiful and haunted the movie  can be seen once without fear  personal touch i really enjoyed the movie  was laughing  to the core at some horror scenes and was shocked at few scenes too the old  man crooked man and the demon looks great on screen the story connection between both the sequential movies is good horror movie is always a great entertainer and this movie  gave me peaceful sleep  later the2 englishmovie anureviews,astonish
2 manages to up everything that was in the first one doing what most horror sequels tend to do by upping there production budget and effects even more sadly this is also what hurts 2 as it feels very bloated and very lengthy a good horror movie should be 90 to 105 minutes in length no longer this film instead is 134 minutes long making for a long over done film with waaay to much going on the film just doesnt feel very concise has a good story  and the movie suffers from not enough being cut out and making it keep going on and on the characters are still great as i love the relationship between the warrens and the love story that is also being told within this film as well the cinematography is also amazing along with the sound design everything in this film has a purpose and adds to the films beauty and all the fear that is being built up with it this is a film i recommend to any horror fan as i think there is a lot to like here if your in that field,astonish
brilliantly marketed but not scary the problem is that we already know all the clich of a horror movie james wan took these overused clichs and gave them a new level but its highly predictable overall at the end it was fill good movie with bit of a comedy the movement we see cgi in such movies the horror turns to comedy absolutely hate when i can predict each and every scene which suppose to give me a scare also its frustrating to see horror movies ending with happy faces come on no one dies in whole movie its frustrating btw the theater had set their air conditioning to maximum may be they wanted to give chilling effect to audiences but that failed tooi m still probably gonna watch 3 if it comes,astonish
the first half of this story is really the true story the second half when the warrens come to london is the fantasy part of the story its ok but feels like two different films put together both dont get a great ending the warrens have so many cases they could have picked but they choose to add them to a true story they were never part off the warrens should have been left out the film series does not have to be about them and it also takes the light away from the real ghost investigators from the case giving them bit parts in the movie on the other hand this filming catches 70s london great and the atmosphere is of a high level 710 just dont believe its a true story,astonish
theres a reason we get so many horror films released every year they are relatively cheap to make and guaranteed to make the studio money no matter how bad the horror could end up being people love the thrill and rush the experience of watching a horror film at the cinema gives yousequels have become one of the most sinister things in film today some seeing them as nothing but quick ways of making more money however if done well sequels can be one of the more interesting things in film in the case of 2 its definitely the lattersix years after the events in rhode island paranormal investigators ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga warren are called to enfield england to investigate the paranormal events that the hodgson family have been experiencing in their home in particular janet madison wolfehaving investigated the amityville murders of 1974 lorraine has since had visions that feature a powerful entity forcing her to believe that the choice to carry on their line of work could lead to tragedywhat i really have to commend 2 for is the fact that it doesnt just feel like a carbon copy of its predecessor dont get me wrong the two films certainly have similarities but this didnt feel like watching the first film over againthe film does this by telling two stories one of the hodgson family in enfield and another about the visions that lorraine has been haunted by after their investigation of the amityville murders these two stories connect much better than the stories of the family being haunted and the annabelle doll in the first filmi have to praise james wan for the job he does directing 2 expertly building suspense through the use of sound camera movements and editing john r leonetti returns as cinematographer and there really are some fabulous shots in this film some leading to false predictions of when and where something would jump out on the screen the film uses jump scares but it doesnt solely rely on them to scare the audience one particular scene with lorraine coming face to face with the demon haunting her slowly building to almost nerveshredding levels of suspensethe performances in 2 are also worth mentioning with both patrick wilson and vera farmiga returning to good effect farmiga once again being the films biggest asset i was really impressed with madison wolfe as janet the member of the hodgson family targeted by the demon and also frances oconnor who played her mother2 will no doubt have audiences worldwide jumping out of their seats and give warner bros a tidy profit when it finishes its run at the boxoffice james wan is the man they should be thanking and id like to thank him also for producing another horror that looks for more than one way to scare its audience,astonish
its my 1st ever review everin fact i chose to write a review in imdb for the very first time cos i absolutely loved the movie is storyline of 2 gripping enough well its based on a true story  one of the well noted cases the warren couples encountered in their lifetime  thanks to director james wan i got to see this fantastically horrific story on screen  as usual loved ed  lorraine warren played by vera farmiga patrick wilson i consider it as the all time best movie to be ever made in this genre 2nd one is obviously contains crucial plot ahead return if you dont want to hear the story  just watch the movie insteadthe story itself takes place at the tail end of the 1970s the film begins with paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren documenting the amityville murders at the amityville house in 1976 to determine if a demonic presence was truly responsible for ronald defeo jr mass murdering his family on november 13 1974 during a seance lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders and discovers a demonic nun figure before seeing ed being fatally impaled after a struggle ed is able to break her out of the visionin 1977 the hodgson family begins to discover strange occurrences within their home in london england janet the second oldest of four children is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity who insists that the house is his eventually all siblings of the house and their mother peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors when the media attempts to interview the hodgsons janet is possessed by the spirit of bill wilkins an older man who previously lived and died in the house and who wants to claim his territory as janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession the story eventually reaches the warrens who are requested to assist the local church in the investigation lorraine in fear of her vision of eds death becoming reality warns him not to get too involved in the case and reluctantly agrees to travel to london rest is history literally  not at all supposed to happen in the normalconventional paranormal investigation movies too many twist  turns unpredictability jump scares demon haunting etc it really scared me which doesnt happen anymore these days its ground breaking altogether im looking forward for the sequel 3 of the successful horror franchise,astonish
im a massive fan of james wan but even his previous films have had their flaws in relying too heavily on jump scares this uses an excellent amount of tension mixed in with the jumpiness and can create serious uneasiness while delivering complete satisfaction this is truly a horror film to be remembered and treasured away for the ages even though i went in with high expectations this seriously blew them out of the water and really ascended to new heights believe the hype it is more than well deserved kudos to james wan and the cast with some outstanding displays of acting from everyone involved absolute masterclass musical direction is seriously on point too i cant stress enough how good this film is,astonish
i can say its the best horror movie i ever watched i really enjoyed iti felt like i was in the moviepretty awesome you will all love it for sure just amazingbut the warning about you maybe feel something it not true at least on mei wasnt afraid just amazed from how good was that movieso take your friends and go in cinema and enjoy this awesome moviethe plot was amazing  the atmosphere was really deep the creepy sound just amazingfull packet of an amazing movie look i can say nothing more really if you wont go watch it you can understand what i am talking about really  aaaaaa and the best acting for sure,astonish
i am a massive horror fan and have been waiting many years for something that could even come close to the classics like exorcistomenetc etcboy did i find it in this one  i was absolutely floored at how anyone was capable of creating such genuine heart stopping tension and fear within in a film these days but mr wan i salute you  im not one to go into telling the story of a film as thats what the trailer and synopsis are forjust know that this is an outstanding film for this genre and age and please ignore the trolls trying to defame itits fantastic and i hope others enjoy it as much as i did and are also eager to see number 3 ,astonish
it is immensely uncommon for a sequel or a second movie to be just as successful or as entertaining as the first but i truly enjoyed two just as much or even more than i did the first it was a little perhaps dragged out but i cannot possibly complain i think james wan has a gift and absolutely hit the spot with this franchise 2 is absolutely correct on its depiction of england in the past and is incredibly breathtakingly enjoyable i am past satisfied with the money i paid to see this wonderful horror its so rare for a little gem of a movie franchise like this one to come around but boy am i glad it did i believe has the potential to revive the horror movie genre 3 please,astonish
i have been waiting all these years since was announcedwith full hope that james wan will not mess it up in a sequel like all other directorsand boyhe did not disappointthe scares were terrifyingbut inevitably they dont stand a chance in comparison to those in the first moviebut it is more than made up with some really intense scenes and brilliant screenplayespecially the twist when the warrens are about to depart from london is a masterstrokethe scene where lorraine faces off with valek in the first half was typical james wan master piecejoseph bishara has proved yet again that he is a master in this genre when it comes to background scoringoverall it was full worth of 2 hours and money of 120 bucks,astonish
there has been no movie to stand with the exorcist for over 35 years in that movies unique horror set there is now finally one that can 2 picks up the the same unique dark fear and runs with it it does run too because almost immediately the viewer is plunged into a revisiting by loraine warren of the how the events played out in the amityville ny case its a good segueway not just in tone but as a personal vision loraine senses regarding ed it pushes her along with the guffaws of the press to push ed into agreeing theyd not take on any new cases of course this doesnt last when the catholic church asks them to vet a particularly highprofile situation a family is london is experiencingnow heres whee i have no touchstone personally if this is played out like the actual case or not it is probably better this way already the viewer is invested in the warrens as doing what they do very genuinely putting them in a case they did actually attempt to vet just seems like the two best people doing what they have a rare talent for and what a case it is without any head spinning we get many of the same chills maybe played out with a bit less shock but none the less just as malevolent its this keeping it more in your face and simple that seems to be right here there is a constant fear and oppression which unfolds in an escalating way when the viewer feels the most fear the whole thing falls apart as it appears to be a hoax even the warrens are shut down thats when the clincher of a fine ending begins for the horror genre this is pure goldwhile im sure those whose dissect these things have made a long list of faux pas the average viewer wont bat an eye regarding so much has been steadily crafted the brought to a climax by the great ending one feels a sense of relief in which a harrowing journey seems to be finally over i give the entire movie many pluses from the period spoton latter 70s london with gloom and doom portrayed in the excellent cinematography combined with the played straight screenplay and excellent acting this is a horror film that truly works like i said earlier i feel it stands with the gold standard that for so long had few peers,astonish
i always say that i am going to write a short review but i end up rambling on anyway i really do not care if a horror movie is scary or not i know that does not make a whole lot sense since we know that horror movies main objective is to scare you as long as it is entertaining and interesting that is all that matters to me with that being said 2 is one of the better mainstream horror sequels in recent years and it really did keep me engaged james wans direction is very good he successfully makes this a supernatural moody horror flick even though there are cheap jump scares that you can see from a mile away the malevolent forces were way more interesting and threatening than in the first film the screenplay by chad  carey hayes james wan and david johnson wisely puts more focus on the family this time instead of patrick wilson and vera farmigas characters they play more of a supporting role and it works following a different path than most horror flicks these days the cast does an adequate job with what they are given the supporting cast includes madison wolfe frances oconnor lauren esposito benjamin haigh and patrick mcauley i remember not being too impressed by the first film matter of fact it was my last date movie as for this one this makes a pretty good date flick the cinematography by don burgess is the best thing about this movie it is probably the best cinematography that i have seen in mainstream horror film since 2014s the purge anarchy this is a well shot film and he totally plays up the boogeyman lurking around the corner fear go see 2 it is probably going to be one of the best mainstream horror movies i will see this year i kind of hate i liked this movie so much because that means i might not like part 3 part 3 is coming box office receipts will prove that,astonish
patrick wilson  vera framiga were fine in terms of their acting in this movie the home of the family who were the subject of this movie was depicted as a pigsty complete with dirty telephones and disintegrating walls  badly worn furniture such a depiction greatly reduced the scripts effectiveness as tale about ordinary people in trouble people generally didnt live in unclean homes like this in the late 1970s unless they were in the drug trade this historical issue ruins this movie and it becomes a sort of parodya parody of a horror movie and a parody of the late 1970s which is probably not what it was intended to be all in all it was a bleak movie but it was bleak due to its depiction of an era that had a lot of things going on in it little of which was present in the movie i dont recommend seeing it,astonish
the case of whether ghosts exist or not has been a fittingly eternal debate some say that its simply a trick on the mind whenever we feel a cool chill others say that the presence of these spirits is the key to finding proof on the afterlife because of this debate ghosts and the search for them have never been more popular their a constant subject of stories and movies they even have their own reality show on the travel channel titled ghost adventures and ghost hunters on syfy some cases like the one portrayed in the movie are examples of haunted houses that are covered by real news agencies yet are still questioned by scientists for their academic basiswhat were also looking at is a sequel for 2013 hit like many people i was surprised by how much i liked it having phrased it for a likable pair of ghost hunters diving into the personalities of those being haunted and some genuine good scares sequels to horror movies are tough as they tend to repeat stories loosing much of the unpredictability the original story had with james wan returning to his franchise lets see if 2 can bring us some new scares we first open with our same husband wife ghost hunting team ed played by patrick wilson and lorraine played by vera farmiga who are examining the amityville murders yes the same one from the amityville horror loraine attempts to contact the spirits during a seance but a vision of a demonic nun and of ed getting killed scares her into convincing she and her husband to retire we then head across the pond to london where a single mom is raising her four children like any horror movie small things start to happen such as the television set reacting oddly and chairs moving by themselves even when they leave an stay at a friends house the poltergeist follows them there various news outlets take in the constant photos and even interview the youngest daughter janet whose often possessed by that poltergeist the spirit reveals himself as an old man who had died in the house before the family moved in the local church hires lorraine and ed to investigate they originally decline not sure if the events are true or just a hoax but when they uncover more facts about the house and other demons this just may prove to be their most dangerous case 2 is a rare example of not being just as good as the original but it might even be better like before the story places most of the focus on getting to know the family thats being haunted and of the new tension between our ghost hunters you feel bad that the family is going through these spooky events and yet you understand why most academics would consider the hauntings a total fake theres even a clever moment that makes you question everything that young daughter janet was doing of course i wont spoil that heredirector james wan is a horror maker who understands how important it is to not just scare people but to help earn those scares anyone can pick up a camera and flicker a few lights to make a scary movie but hes too smart to fall into that easy trope he can lead his stories into a spooky symphony that plays so elegantly that you wish hes take charge of all horror movies the only issue that can be bothersome is that the films formula is very similar to the first movie i defend this by saying that james wan was able to improve on some of the story elements but some of the suspense is taken away when you realize where things are going ill give this nine zoetropes out of ten 2 is an entertaining sequel that took the best elements from the original and took it another step in storytelling and scares fans of the original will defiantly like this movie and maybe even some that didnt watch the first the good news is that you dont need to see it to enjoy this movie if your looking for hot summer bump in the night then 2 is a pretty good choice,astonish
   warner bros shows us in 2 a true story from that era not a single unnatural death or serious injury results from one of the most heavily documented cases of paranormal activity in human history contrast that with todays world you go to a concert and 88 people are shot dead with assault rifles you go to a nightclub and 49 people are shot dead with assault rifles you send your kid off to elementary school and 27 people are shot dead with assault rifles you go to your office christmas party and 14 people are shot dead with assault rifles you go to a movie and 12 people are shot dead with assault rifles you go to church and 10 people are shot dead with assault guns you watch the end of a marathon race and 300 people are blown up with crock pots jets are being blasted out of the skies left and right as trains and buses explode on the ground mosquitoes are out to kill your babies and antibiotics no longer are able to kill deadly viruses warner is using 2 as a means of urging americans to elect a president wholl invest in time machine infrastructure to let us all join the warrens and hodgsons in the serene and safe 1970s,astonish
sure we cant get inside the theater without not knowing that were gonna get stapled to our seat watching same old brainless protagonist going to provoke some ominous spirit with occasional jump scare same old classic horror story plot yadda yadda yadda unfortunately when a horror movie became so predicted it became boring how can you get scared if whenever they show this kind of scene the protagonist takes something from the mirror cabinet at the bathroom then closes it bam youre gonna see some stuff on the reflection rightbut james wan he actually succeeded in breaking some of those stereotypes of horror movies tricks in 2013  instead of showing just mere flashing figures of bathsheeba the camera just literally closing in on that thing crawling above the kids wardrobe during that one scene in the bedroom with equally decent sound mixing editing as a supporting element it instantly became the sole reason why i fell in love with his worksthis sequel though doesnt feel like its his i dont feel his touch aka some element of surprises in this film like at all it was just all toopredictable i mean there was this one scene during annabelle 2014  which shows a harmless ghost of a girl running towards the main character with the door closing up then proceeds to slam that door open but not as a small girl anymore but instead an evil entity with a true intention to kill that is an element of surprise i was looking for in this sequel the use of a close up of certain housewares stuff  which could potentially become harmful for people and felt some sort of life threatening like this sewing machine in annabelle 2014 didnt make any appearances at all as well this is unfortunate because it may be able to add up something to help to create that eerie ambiance they were trying so hard to achievei heard that he turned to direct fast series in hope of finding fresh new ideas for his horror movies but james this feels like an apple being left out to rot under a hot sunisnt fresh at alli lost it during the crooked mans first appearance which felt so damn cheesy and give out this babadook 2014 kind of vibe which is not a good sign for me and fine i get it turned out it was totally practical not cg with a real actor posing as the crooked man then why the hell it felt so out of placevalak being the main attraction in this movie clearly is good at nothing but growl and jesus in need of a dentist appointment with those bleeding gums they couldve dug deeper about his origin m o t i v e s she clearly wanted to kill janet but is that all and probably some p o t e n t i a l to scare the audienceshahatoo many questions left unanswered in my head the moment i stepped out of the cinema including  has james wan ran out of brilliant horror movies ideas already or was he just trying to beexperimental hmmm,astonish
the 1977 british haunting known as the enfield poltergeist has sparked controversy and has been accused of being complete hogwash the famed paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren patrick wilson and vera farmiga have now got their work cut out for them with this one but directorcowriter james wan is not concerned about busting myths the guy wants us to be scared silly and have a ball he has succeeded if it aint broke dont fix it thats the modus operandi of wans latest scareathon the sequel to the 2013 summer blockbuster this is better than the first  bigger scarier and much more intense the first film was fun but it relied too heavily on nostalgic and retro traits having apedpaid homage to 1979s the amityville horror this new one is no different  it acts as a greatest hits album of classic horror movie moments  specifically those of poltergeist and the exorcist wans passion for the genre shines through in every scene his unnerving atmosphere soaks the film in a shroud of doom and gloom relentlessly unleashing his old school house of horrors until the curtain call it creaks it moans it shrieks when need be never shortchanging the character development and audience in the processthis is not the horror film of the year so far that honour belongs to the haunting indie film the witch but as far as popcorn horror films go this ones really good  and a good stepping stone to introduce newcomers to exorciststyle classics a trait which i suspect was wans true intention all along having already establishing himself as todays goto filmmaker for spooky films,astonish
james wan seems to be the only consistent horror director working today cranking out hit after hit with his explosive start helming the first saw film his follow up to 2 is a worthy sequel and while the first installment of the haunted adventures of the warrens shines brighter than this follow up 2 still thrills and chills with the help of well placed jump scares a tone of absolute dread and beautiful camera workits been seven years since lorraine warren vera farmiga and her husband ed patrick wilson helped the perron family with their haunted rhode island house when lorraine has a premonition of a terrifying demonic force threatening to kill ed she decides they cannot investigate anymore to keep him safe across the pond in enfield england the hodgson family is being terrorized by the angry spirit of an old man named bill bob adrian the elevenyearold janet madison wolfe seems to be the focus of all the hubbub and the primary victim of bills rage when the police come by one night after a particularly scary attack and witness supernatural activity themselves the hodgons soon find themselves in the middle of a media firestorm about their haunted home the church sends ed and lorraine to england to confirm the authenticity of the case despite lorraines hesitance and worries about eds safetywilson and farmiga are still as charming as ever playing the reallife warrens who spent decades investigating the supernatural they are a perfect pair of love faith and empathy their capacity for goodwill is rooted in their unwavering christian faith something that is not popular or looked upon as a legitimate motivation for character actions these days the pair are written so likable that their faith cannot simply be laughed away they use it as their foundation in all that they do in their unwavering sense of charity in helping this family in need and also as a fierce weapon against evil even the most hardened atheist will find it difficult to deny how bad ass lorraine is as she holds up her bible or the potent power of eds crucifix around his neck when they wield them in defense against the nasty spirit tormenting the hodgsons madison wolfe who plays janet the poor girl being hit with the most abuse is a wonderful actress you feel her exhaustion and her utter loss of hope as the movie continues on wolfe exhibits the talent of someone much older than herself you empathize with her highs and her lows something usually difficult for such a young actor to achievethe camera work is almost another character in 2 simple zooms upside down shots and pans induce the fear in the audience who witness some horrors that the characters do not in one sequence the youngest hodgson boy billy benjamin haigh has a blanket tent set up at the end of a dark hallway when one of his toys rolls by itself out from the darkness he jumps into bed in fear while the camera focuses on the tent giving the audience a good fortyfive seconds of fear of what is inside the dark tent and waiting for whatever it may be to jump out with this tactic wan includes the audience in the narrative giving each person their own personal journey with this hauntingwhile it is indeed a well made and effective film in its own right 2 is more scattered plotwise than the tightly scripted it spreads itself a little too thin as it tries to include slight subplots of some of the real life people who were present during the enfield hauntings including maurice grosse simon mcburney who was an investigator and the most constant and dedicated supporter for the hodgsons during their plight he is an important figure in the actual reallife story but this movie is about the warrens and the hodgens and any departure from them feels like an overkill of informationjames wan is not only a great director of horror but also in general hopefully he is just getting started with series based on the quality thus far of the first two films you can potentially expect to be treated and frightened by a whole franchise based on the hundreds of the warrens reallife haunted adventures,astonish
2    by stephanie cieplinskievery now again we come across films that are considered horror movies yet are so much more than that silence of the lambs 1991 the exorcist 1973 and psycho 1960 all come to mind all of these films are horrific in nature but have messages that blur the lines between genres james wan has done it again with this thrilling and chilling sequel to his 2013 film returning are patrick wilson and vera farmiga as ed and lorraine warren and written for the screen by wan insidious saw carey hayes and chad hayes house of wax and david johnson orphan this film isnt merely blood gore and jump scares its a heartwrenching love story loosely based on the reallife marriage between the warrens this is the most connected weve ever been to characters in wans films that doesnt rely on horror but on a lesson about life and morality were invested more than before with the warren family and even more so with the single motherrun household of peggy hodgson frances oconnor and her four children janet madison wolfe margaret lauren esposito billy benjamin haigh and johnny patrick mcauley the same disturbing images and visions that are haunting lorraine and ed are connected to the haunting happening at the hodgson residence were dealt with more scares and eerie spirits putting the characters we care so much about in immediate danger after all lorraine can predict the futureshe has a premonition of eds death the film picks up during the warrens visit to amityville long island where they manage to help the defeo family even amongst rumors that the haunting was a hoax to garner media attention we follow ed and lorraine as well as peggy janet and their family in enfield england once peggy hodgson sees that the warrens were able to help the defeos peggy solicits the church and by extension the warrens not only have the children and peggy seen unusual happenings in their home but so have their neighbors and the local police they are desperate to drive away the spirit of a man named bill wilkins who used to live and then subsequently died in their home years prior c2 stirs up not only of what we fear but how it can be utilized against us the camera movement is one step ahead of you and these consistent movements draw tension from the audience all the while building up a scare that may or may not come sometimes we believe that there will be a pay off we are anxious and ready for something scary and then it never comes which only makes us more on edge for the next scene wan also makes nods to his previous films he successfully develops a unique world where we are familiar with the rules what many of his previous films and c2 consistently question is is what we see really just a trick of the light are we imagining some things or is it something evil lurking preparing to prey on us during our most vulnerable moments its also important to note that wilson has quite a fantastic singing voice i had cant help falling in love by elvis presley stuck in my head the entire rest of the night there are fantastic supporting roles as well played by simon mcburney as maurice grosse an expert on paranormal activity and franka potente who we havent seen on the big screen in a long time as anita gregory who only wants to catch the supposed hoax of the hodgson family this is a film that can make you tear up for the moral stand up for the ones that you love stick together and you can conquer anythingyou are not alone and bawl like a baby at the horrific imagery even the storyline in and of itself makes us doubt what weve been seeing the entire time this is a film that will continue to scare you long after youve walked out of the theater,astonish
every other week someone is putting out another film on the over blown self righteous genre of the paranormal haunted house scenario its one of the few areas of horror movie lore that seems many customers go into the theater with the assumption that such things actually exist i want to almost vomit every time i read the promo of such nonsense that says based on a true story a true story  why because some mentally disturbed person said it happened no proof mind you lol unbelievablethis entry was weaker than the first the old sudden loud music and sudden thump routine to get you to jump was needed as most of the scares were weaker im sure though if it makes enough money there will be another sequel and another after that until lazy hollywood has sucked enough money out of itbest horror movies these days are definitely not coming out of hollywood,astonish
if you liked the first movie you will not be disappointed 2 keeps most of the strengths of the first movie to create a tense atmosphere while telling a story with enough depth to keep you interested until the end the camera work is worth mentioning since it is remarkably effective at creating fear and tension through forced perspective and blurry imageshowever in this sequel the characters are not as welldefined as in the previous one most of the characters in the family have little personality and are defined by a single trait the little brother stutters the mom has money problems the other brother does nothing this might seem like minor detail in a horror movie but it hinders the creation of a connection with the characters and therefore worrying about what happens to themthe movie could have had more engaging characters but this wont prevent anyone from enjoying the film it is a very good horror movie and a worthy sequel i highly recommend it go see it,astonish
i am a huge fan of this franchise and james wan has absolutely done a magnificent job in sticking to the basics of a good scare but with a twist the first movie absolutely blew us away and i really enjoyed the second one you cannot help but cheer for the warrens and their love storyspoiler ahead my only beef with this movie is the animated tim burtonesque creature that appeared twice it was unnecessary and spoiled the scene the nun was enough to freak everyone out every time it made an appearance i cannot wait for the 3rd movie if ever there will be another ,astonish
i went to the movie first day first show there were only few people in theater because it was week days starting of the movie was quite like some scenes were bit like insidious 1 there were many brilliant scenes through t the movie like the chair moving by itself when the police came and jump scares were amazing story was well crafted plot twists were very well handled the last 20 minutes were amazing the movie had a very good story which was better than the previous part the cgi shots of crooked man was not that scary but it was quite good i cannot say it is a scariest movie all decade but it is better than some recent so called horror movies must watch in theaters,astonish
the acting and other technical elements of 2 make it a well made film but most moviegoers just want to know if it really is that scary i say it most definitely is there is no edge of your seat excitement and there is nothing fun about it its just really scary some scenes were similar to the first movie but most of the time i forgot i was watching a sequel all the characters seemed equally important and vera farmiga is very pretty but all of that gets overlooked due to how scary it is it was a bit uncomfortable to watch and i wanted it to be over but i mean that as a complimentsome of my favorite horror movies are an american werewolf in london phantasm the original halloween the original fright night and some films in the a nightmare on elm street series those are classic scary movies that play each year on certain networks during the month of october and fall into that category of a worst case scenario imagine how scary it would be if your nightmares could get you in real life or if a vampire moved into the house next door to you those are movies you can watch at home with the lights out while snacking on popcorn and chugging a soda and having fun while being scared 2 however is a seriously terrifying two hour commitment that i do not want to watch at home alone what if that hideous demon in the movie comes to get me theres no fun in thati remember seeing commercials for paranormal activity that showed the audience scared and looking away from the screen for a moment before peeking back and enjoying the experience like a sort of amusement ride i like the films in that series 2 had a different effect on the audience the theater was silent throughout the entire film and after it ended people left the theater quickly and in silence i got the feeling they were scared out of their witsrather than repeating myself by saying it was really scary ill sum it up this is not a horror movie you mix in with teenscreams slashers or monster movies it goes with the exorcist or the shining especially when they were first released one that will have even the most seasoned horror fan checking their closets and under their beds before going to sleep see it in the theater if you can and good luck,astonish
james wan returned to direct this superb sequel that sees patrick wilson and vera farmiga resuming their roles of real life paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren who are first seenin a most effective prologue investigating the notorious amityville haunting in 1976 before moving forward a year to being asked by the church to look into the veracity of the reports of a haunting in enfield england where the hodgson familya single mother and her four children are being terrorized by a seemingly evil old man who had died in the house but as the warrens discover the situation is far more complicated and sinister than thata match for the original this intelligent chilling frightening sequel is even better with a well crafted plot that pays off emotionally and spiritually by the heartstopping climax a model of its kind and further installments done like this would be most welcome as there are still more cases to tell,astonish
director james wan is a magician he has all the tricks sleight of hand misdirection creating illusions that will terrify you to the core without having to resort to gore or cheap thrills granted he is a master of making you jump out your seat of making your heart skip a beat but its his ability to force you to hold your breath that makes his movies so appealing and so much fun to watch the camera pans and tilts at weird angles the foreground and background focus and blur interchangeably as if to visually bend reality a voice whispers in the dark and through all this somewhere in the back of your mind the nagging horror that horrified you when you watched the exorcist for the very first time five words based on a true storylike the first brilliant movie the sequel is a dramatization of a case investigated by real life paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren the first described the events of a house haunted by a witch called bathsheba the warrens were often tackling multiple cases at once and to emphasize the emotional stress that came with it the first also detailed the warrens experiences with a doll named anabelle that reportedly came to life possessed by an evil spirit that is to this day locked away in a glass case in the back of the warren householdin part 2 we are reintroduced to the warrens by reminding us of the case that catapulted the couple into the public eye the murders in amityville the majority of this film however actually takes place across the pond in london where a strange entity disturbed the peace of a poor struggling singlemom and her four children this became the most documented paranormal case in history an entity known as the enfield poltergeist2 has a great cast frances o connor plays peggy hodgson the single mom who has to hold the house together in the midst of all the horror including all the ridicule from nonbelievers shes a mother trying and failing to maintain sanity she wants to be brave for her kids yet cant help but to be visibly agitated her youngest son billy a little boy with a stutter is adorable constantly bullied by his peers but is overwhelmed with boundless joy at the sight of a biscuit the one who stole the show however was madison wolfe as janet hodgson who in the reallife haunting was the entitys favorite target definitely see shades of linda blair in her performanceother players like simon mcburney as maurice gross the british paranormal investigator who was primarily involved with the enfield poltergeist even the constables who corroborated that some freaky stuff went down in the house look and act just like those involved in the real case did some investigating of my own on youtube of course the real heroes of the film are ed and lorraine warren played by patrick wilson insidious and vera fermiga bates motel  as you can see both actors have a tendency towards dark material they are an attractive couple extremely likable and as in the first theres a sense of adoration and compassion for the work the warrens do both patrick and vera have this uncanny ability to make you feel comforted one minute but with a slight contortion of the face you know something is wrong ive got a bad feeling about this regardless whether you believe in this stuff or not theres admiration for a couple who have dedicated their lives to helping others freeing the tormented from inexplicable horrors when no one else can ed and lorraine warrens were the only ones outside of the clergy who were authorized by the catholic church to perform exorcismsbased on a true story should always be taken with a grain of salt there are definitely some fantastical terrors that are there for show inspired by nightmares as seen in insidious or the babadook like the first they dont turn a blind eye to alternative explanations for the events that take place and allow you to view the subject from the skeptics standpoint before diving headfirst into the dark realm of the beyond one thing for sure is that the filmmakers have respect for the original material pulling from old photographs to recreate the real settings down to the details of the posters on their bedroom walls what better example is there of respect for the material than this prior to filming part 2 the filmmakers had a catholic priest come in to bless the set apparently eerie occurrences took place when they filmed the first movie i aint afraid of no ghosts no poltergeist is going to stop director james wan and writers chad and carey hayes from telling the amazing story of ed and lorraine warren and with many more cases yet to be explored i really hope they can conjure up another one,astonish
the horror genre a movie category that tries to be good but often ends up a joke during most movies occasionally though we get a film that provides a good thrilling scare and is actually worth the admission price for me was one of those movies able to provide the chills i was looking for with a story to match when i heard a sequel was coming i feared that its good name would be diluted by the hollywood haste to make money remember annabelle hi robbie k here and today i review 2 and share my thoughts on the latest film lets get started the good  story  integrated scares  actingrecurring castseldom do we get a horror movie with an actual story instead focusing on how to make people jump this is not the case with this film my friends director james wan and his team have managed to craft a tale that is both entertaining and interesting to watch s story takes place a few years after the first with the warrens continuing their investigations of the paranormal meanwhile across the ocean the hodgson family begins to experience their own paranormal activity that will eventually warrant inspection by our detectives sounds simple i know and in truth it is but wans delivery is fantastic he manages to build suspense in his tale using a gradual series of scares to build the tension and slowly reveal the truth in the haunting and to throw in the few twists they did only added more depth to the story but wan goes one step further and decides to bring some character development into mix helping to add depth to all involved to help us connect with the film the warrens story was great to expand on discussing the origins of our detectives while also dropping in a little bit of love to sweeten the deal and if that werent enough he even manages to keep all of the scares pertinent to the story integrating them into the plot rather than dropping a random scare moment that hollywood is famous for by having the scares have a purpose they removed the corny aspects and added an edge that made the only that much better of course having a great cast to act out this story is the final piece of the puzzle the repeat performance by wilson and farmiga was just as strong the chemistry between them solid that i believed they were a couple newcomers to the series madison wolfe and frances oconnor played their roles as a terrified family to the letter while also having another side to them that made you feel sorry for them finally simon mcburney as maurice gross added some finesse to the cast with a little comedic relief when the going got tough but while fantastic alone the chemistry between everyone was on point and only made things that much betterthe bad  still another horror movie  dropped some plot pointsunexplained  predictable scare tacticsit was difficult to find weaknesses in this movie for me but there are a few things that took away from the movie for me first is that this is still another horror movie that fits in well with other films of the same genre weve had some unique horror films in the past but this one is just a good old fashioned haunted house story again this is a picky weakness but the originality could have used a bit more tweaking in my opinion a bigger weakness is some of the plot points and presentation in the film wait a minute i just said the plot was good didnt i yes it is but its not perfect and 2 has a few moments that i was still wanting closure on i have to be sparing to not spoil anything but one major detail lacking is why one particular thing has a vendetta against the family a second limiting plot point is how two of the characters sort of drop out of the story without so much as a blink when they had played a key role in the film but even with these limitations the story itself was mostly complete and had a good closure again im grasping at straws here in addition there were some melodramatic moments that were a bit drawn out and somewhat cheesy to me oh well cant be perfect rightfinally the scare tactics are still predictable as ever and didnt really get me with the exception of one time camera angles giving away something music eerily going silent and the occasional getting out of bed to walk in a dark hallway give away the horror from a mile away but while im used to it other members of the audience were still howling in fear so again this may be a moot point the verdictoverall 2 is a sequel quite worthy of being called just as good as the original wan and his group has shown that a horror movie can have a story and still be scary despite the beliefs of hollywood the engaging characters the well timed suspense and the integrated scares are surely the best selling points with few weakness to point out this reviewer cant help but recommend this one for a theater visit for you horror fans out there my scores for this movie arehorror 90 movie overall 8085,astonish

it has a very strong story stronger than the first one i found it very fascinating that it was very easy to feel connected to the characters to feel bad for them it was a strong point for the first one also the thing about is and i am talking about both of them is that it may not be scary enough for you but it has all the element that a good girl movie should have which is lacking now a daysthey had to show what was happening with the affected family as well as they had to show the connection between ed and lorraine they succeeded in doing that effectively there was no problem in the acting department even the kids did there part very well ive always been a fan of james wan he did miracles here too there was this feel of constant tension on screen which holds well with the story so my verdict is that you should check it out like seriously make sure you watch this one cant decide which of the two films i liked better,astonish
i have not seen the part 1 yet but the part 2 is very good i recommend you guy to see it on a big screen dont wait for the dvd since it was based on a true story watching it on a big screen is more realistic and imaginable trust me 10 will definitely be worth to spend i always have questions when i watch horror movies i will post all the questions below if you think you can answer my questions please do it in a comment below i will be very grateful also some questions might sound a little dumb so dont mind mespoiler alert 1 why did the demon nun want to kill janet 2 if she did want to kill her why didnt she just kill her from the beginning instead of just trying to haunt the family 3 why was janet the only one that could be possessed by the demon 3 if lorraine could use the bible to defeat the demon by knowing her name why was the demon the one telling her name to her its not like hey this is my name you can use it to kill me meh  4 how did the demon possess bill i mean it makes sense if she possesses human but possesses the same spirit like wtf 5 also wasnt the demon in the united states at first how dafuq did she possess will in england 6 near the ending why did the demon wait until the couples gone in order to start killing janet,astonish
first of all i reall convey hearty wishes to james wan the director for giving us such a wonderful film i can see how much difficulties they will be faced during the casting of the film as well as  we should not forget about the art department for making such a beautiful house and the make up artist for the demonjames wan did his job perfect on each and every moment of the movie over all i am so happy that he didnt forget to show how the warrens loves each other in the entire movie once agin hats off to james wan and all the peoples involved in 2 hopefully waiting for 3,astonish
2 was the best horror movie ive seen in years the plot was good and scares were wellpaced throughout the whole movie the movie was longover 2 hoursand i never got bored usually when i got to the movies i start to get restless after about 90 minutes but not with there was no nudity swearing or gratuitous gore not that im a prude  i dont mind that stuff  but i know that bothers some people so if a family with teenaged kids want to see a really good horror flick you dont have to be worried about anyone being mortified over nude scenes andor sexalsoit doesnt matter if you havent seen the first movie so dont let that hold you backa bunch of people clapped after the movie that always cracks me upwho are they clapping to but i brought that up just to let you know that 2 seemed to be enjoyed by  at least  the majority of the audience highly recommend 910,astonish
this time believe all the hype this is genuinely an amazing and scary movie its the first time i ever cried tears of joy in a horror film along with being so scared and on the edge of my seat in the last 1520 minutes james wan is an amazing director the drama tension atmosphere character development even down to the music is utter perfection chad hayes along with the other writers wrote a script so perfect and was beautiful executed by amazing actors seriously if horror movies could win an academy award it would win in all categories i am going to see this again and again and buy it when it comes on bluray it is hard to make a movie as good as the first but they did and its a lot scarier slight spoiler my friend who saw it with me was dissatisfied with all the love and feel good aspects of the movie and i thought its what made the movie and made me root for the characters even more,astonish
another true case from the warren spouses respected investigators of supernatural affairs freely manipulated by hollywood in order to fit into the haunted house formula and offer us a better dramatic experience and the trick works pretty well even though it repeats the well known routine of exaggerated drama and dry realism cultivated by director james wan and his disciples i have seen so many films with a similar visual and narrative style in recent years that their identities get a bit mixed into my memory or that might be a consequence of my advanced age anyway wans solid direction and the good screenplay from chad and carey hayes make 2 a very competent sequel which limits the use of special effects and focuses on the confusion and anguish of the characters making the experience feel more real independently from its historical veracity speaking of which i liked the fact that the screenplay incorporates the multiple questionings made by the skeptics on the validity of the famous enfield poltergeist sure we are watching a horror movie after all but it was a good decision to throw shades of doubt regarding the testimony of the hodgson family might it be an elaborate lie to obtain a new home with government support or are there really spirits or whatever they are threatening the family already fractured by the abandonment of the father i found the first hour of 2 excellent thanks to the previously mentioned direction and the perfect work from the actors highlighting madison wolfe and lauren esposito both share difficult scenes of horror and psychological violence but their authentic virtue is revealed during the passive moments in which they convince us of their belonging to a family more united than ever despite the domestic and economic difficulties on the negative side of 2 i have to mention the running time and the dramatic function of the warren spouses 2 runs for 133 minutes and it feels long come on more than one hour goes by before the warrens finally arrive at enfield and their investigation is developed between useless detours redundant characters who exactly is eric and a significant change in the texture itself of the film thats where my complaint on their dramatic function comes from the big suspense at the hodgsons home is partially diluted when the personal drama from ed and lorraine warren is incorporated the two sub plots eventually merge pretty well but i felt the sudden switch from subtle psychological horror to the stridency of the last act slightly irritating fortunately the hayes brothers recover the control and unify criteria on time in order to reach a good conclusion which offers the exact degree of restlessness and paranoia in order to avoid the happy ending clich so in conclusion 2 should have had a more judicious edition but i still found it a solid and very satisfactory film which is definitely above the average of studio horror movies,astonish
what an excellent movie wow words cannot describe what an incredible scary movie this is it was so scary that i almost peed in my pants the theater was a full house and i all i could hear is screams the whole time way better than the first part this movie deserves a 10 i think this is is the scariest movie i have seen after a long long time after the exorcist people who think this movie isnt great needs to get their eyes checked or they do not know what they are talking about from the beginning the movie started to the end people were actually jumping from out of their seats if u have not watched this movie till now i recommend watching it right away and u will not regret it,astonish
greetings from lithuania2 2016 for me was probably the best horror movie ive seen since well try to skip all trailers and watch this movie in a movie theater  its a truly one scary and superbly crafted ride james wan is definitely a horror movie pro  he knows the genre very well and delivers everything you would expect from this kind of flick and more much more just take the ending scene  you wont expect this kind of closing no spoilers scene after all the horror we witnessed during the whole 2 h 15 min superbly paced ride  a scene which will definitely generate some applauding from audience at least in my local theater it did or take the one were patrick wilson character interogates  talks with the possessed girl with everyone including him turned away from here  it is a long one shoot  killer sceneoverall 2 was better then i expected it to be i loved the first movie witch wasnt perfect but was a great horror movie before attending the screening i had doubts that they probably wont achieve the success of the first movie i was wrong it is as good as the original it is superb sequel in all directions franchise this quality is very welcomed,astonish
as i walked out of my showing of 2 i overheard a family talking amongst themselves the youngest boy said that the film itself wasnt what scarred him but the noises did this made me think a lot about what many people deem as horror its strange that to many people fear is not measured by how it makes them feel but by how far their butts left their seat for me this is not effective horror when i see a horror film i want to be affected by it i want to feel that sense of dread that churns deep in your stomach and makes you sweat through your clothes unlike many people that saw this film with me i thought this film did just thatits sad that people are writing off this films effectiveness based on the fact that there werent many jump scares i mean there were obviously some in there but the majority of the film is atmosphere the atmosphere that this film builds really gives off a sinister vibe as i watched an eerie feeling washed over me the sense that this is not something we are suppose to be watchingand this feeling continued for the films two hour run time the more sinister the plot gets the more you just feel a sense of helplessness this sense of dread helped the film be more than just any other horror movie with this feeling surrounding the film the scares hit hard it knows that jump scares are far better than false scares and it uses its atmosphere to really make you lose itif anything jumps you in the film it is the ghost or something the ghost does its never like a bird flying around or a person grabbing someones shoulder instead the film actually uses the ghost to scare you what i loved about this movie is how many new different scares where in it its clear that james wan was having a blast making this movie and he experimented with a lot of new thingssome fall flat but most are extremely cool and effective not only was he experimenting with new scares but new camera movements as well which all turned out super impressive theres a great birds eye view shot of people running down a alley that made my jaw drop thats what separates this film from so many others the cast and crew seemed like they were having way to much fun with it it gave the film energy that many dont have this helped 2 elevate itself over a relatively bland story a story that we have all seen a million times over where someone gets haunted the family gets involved than things get really bad so they call experts in to cleanse the housethe fact that this isnt anything new or different really does hurt the film it makes a lot of the scares predictable and the plot points less sharp not only that but when your movie runs for more than two hours with a story like this it can get a bit dry near the end especially when the previous hour and a half was a none stop scare festits at that point where i began to realize that not a single character had any personality what so ever all anyone was was a plot device for the script a means of forwarding the story to the next scene they would do something that a normal human probably wouldnt do get freaked out and than it was on to the next scenewhile 2 may not be as good as the first film it is still a solid horror flick it knows what it is and doesnt bother with the extraneous character building that many others do during the opening half hour while it certainly wouldve made the film better to have characters we cared about not pretending like they were doing this helped get to what we paid for getting the pants scared off of us and this film does that in a fresh new and very effective way if youre a horror fan this one should not be missed just make sure to manage your expectations,astonish
the sequel to the solid james wans 2 is a terrifying sequel that almost scores as much as its legendary predecessor in terms of scares  atmosphere the sequel is unsettling spooky  absolutely engaging turning out to be a much satisfying followup2 synopsis lorraine and ed warren travel to north london to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits2 is a compelling horror ride that arrests your attention  scares the daylights out of you i found myself terrified at my seat almost shutting my eyes  ears whenever a sound or visual offered something ghostly i was particularly terrified in a superbly done sequence involving a painting  a nun believe me im never looking at a nun in the same manner wan chad hayes carey hayes  david leslie johnsons screenplay supposedly based on a truestory is hauntingly scary 2 is almost at par with its predecessor as the scares here are truly welldone the writing superbly warms up in its firsthour  turns into a ride in the secondhour only to culminate into a feast of a climax wans direction is brilliant he creates an unsettling eerie atmosphere with his superior storytelling don burgesss cinematography captures the misty filled london as well as all the scares  the humandrama with flourish kirk m morris editing is crisp art  costume design are fantastic joseph bisharas is perfect performancewise patrick wilson  vera farmiga return as paranormal investigators ed and lorraine warren  they deliver remarkably its the strength of their performances that push 2 to further success frances oconnor as the mother under torment is fabulous madison wolfe as the child under possession is excellent the kid blends sympathy with pure terror without ever breaking out of character simon mcburney is firstrate on the whole 2 is a winner go get spooked,astonish
2 review  yeah finally watched it in theater and got a feel of watching a scary horror film in theater after a long time couldnt watch in theater but loved it when i watched it in mobile so i was eagerly waiting to watch 2 in theater at any cost expectations were little bit higher and movie pretty much matched that level follow my details  acting  good but not upto the mark reason director didnt give much attention to this field as this is a horror flick not cult classic cinema still i feel acting could have been better by all actors writing  very good  story has been written very well twists and realisticness deserves appreciation screenplay  fantastic  screenplay is very tight from the beginning till the end except starting 10 mins which takes time to set a plot then movie takes pace and keep you hooked till the end dialogues  average  nothing impressive ordinary dialogues and really cant expect much from a true story cinematography  class  wow great work by cameraman most scenes have been shot in dark each and every angle looked scary and eye pleasing direction  good but not great it is a sequel so obviously everyone will compare it to its prequel and thats why i think direction wasnt as great as previous one but still a praise worthy work by a director its not easy to complete peoples high expectations because its prequel film looks tight from its beginning but loose climax i mean had longer and more interesting climax than this here director failed badly he could have easily make climax little bit more scary and interesting but i dont know why he didnt do it final words  not better than and despite having bit of loose climax this one is a must watch for all film will definitely leave you with an scary impact and jitters go for it and enjoy another breathtaking scary and dangerous experience from hollywood 710  stars by me,astonish
sequels of horror genre have always been cursed to turn out poor yet director james wan manages to set his bar as compelling as the first one though not criticallyacclaimed but overall a satisfying scare without blood and gore slightly longer than its predecessor the 134 minutes running time enhances smooth pacing of the plot allows further debate over the controversy of supernatural phenomenons and scientific psychology human tricks and role play of the religion organisations even if parts of its horror elements may feel routine it is still able to trigger chills and unsettling moods characters development and emotional engagement especially the love life of warren have made this follow up more to like a family crisis drama interrupted by a demonic figure thanks to the strong performance of the young casts eerie but not over loud thematic scores as well as the confident cinematography and visual effects overall the efforts of remaining the styles from the first one the decision to twist the final act and the addition of dramatic aspects are mixing so well which eventually it just feels so real that leaves the desire to follow up with the next documented case,astonish
saw this last night absolute masterpiece in horror genreit is better and different than the first the story is so detailed and nicely done the character development for the characters in the movie is well done the cinematography by james wan and his team is so beautifully the shots and the camera movement stood out for me and i loved it the acting done by everyone is fantastic they are all really talented no doubt the scares are awesome some are predictable some are not so many new things and creativity in this movie the soundtrack is creepy and kinda insidiousy which i loved a lot the twist in the end and the climax was so well edited it was pure satisfaction overall a fantastic horror movie i cant find any flaws in this film james wan didnt disappoint he is the star of the filmi hope there is a 3eagerly waiting for it 1010 for me,astonish
i really enjoyed this one the first description that came to mind after watching it on opening day was that was intense i felt the story wasnt as strong as the first but the scare scenes were definitely more right in your face type of scenesthe relationship between ed and lorraine also continued to develop in this movie which was pleasant to see the daughter was played by the same actor though she is obviously older i just have to say that yes some areas are probably weaker with this movie from the first one but other areas are stronger and overall id say its just as good as the first one i will definitely be buying this movie when it comes out on video,astonish
2 clearly demonstrates the directing capabilities of james wan set to helm 2018s aquaman wan chills the audience with fright and warms them with romantic and comedic aspects considered one of the scariest films of all time scared audiences half to death in 2013 movie goers will return for the next fright of their life with vera fermiga and patrick wilson reprising their roles 2 bases its true plot on ed and lorraine warren working in london to help a mother raising her four children and battling demonic forcesthe acting once again is superb farmiga and wilson have perfect chemistry more specifically in the more sentimental and character driven moments of this film the performances by the young child actors are surprisingly good and are not annoying like most child acting frances oconnor also gives a convincing performance in the filmwritten by chad hayes carey hayes james wan and david johnson 2 is definitely well written but suffers from being twenty minutes too long ultimately the film is tense and thrilling but you can definitely feel the two hours and fifteen minute running time the film has sensible dialogue and interesting conversations between charactersall in all 2 is the best film i have seen so far this year it truly is a masterpiece for the horror genre it is as enjoyable if not even more enjoyable than the first it is well directed superbly written and realistically acted everyone involved is to be commended,astonish
horror sequels can be another horrible film following from its predecessors success that most filmmakers just want some money without any effort and interesting stuff to showthey are just blatantly lazydidnt follow that but instead brought us new interesting things to this franchise with a captivating story and a hunting and creepy atmosphereit is a well directed horror sequelthe performances were amazingthe chemistry of the warrens was just marvelous and so thus the children in the film they were also excellentas the film progress the tension gets higher and also thus the apprehensionthis horror film is far from the worst and near from the best its on par with its predecessoris an example of a good horror sequel,astonish
as a big movie fan i like all kind of good cinema and horror movies are one of them lets talk about i dont have to tell you how good was the first part of thats why i was expecting more and exited about the the second outing of the enfield case and after watching it i was satisfied with the treatment this movie got from james wan and writersthis movie is definitely more scarier then the first part its a period horror movie and the feel of that is amazing because of great camera work and sets patrick wilson as ed warren and vera farmiga as lorraine warren was as good as they were in first part but surprised by madison wolfe who played a character of janet hodgson rest of supporting cast did what is required to make this film more interestingwhile watching horror movies i always expect better drama and if that drama is based on a period background it makes it more interesting where first part was more dramatic then horrorin a good way second one is surely more scarier drama i hope you will enjoy this movie as i did,astonish
with the new cooler scenery and entirely likable victims the warrens take on another haunting case in the retro england this setting serves more than cosmetic it differentiates itself from previous movies warmer tone while also providing a good vehicle to usher the horror along with the pristine visual brings back the veteran demonologists and introduces an oddly charming family especially the little girl in periljames wan already had a knack for showing eerie camera angles this time he adds more movement and less cut to the mix he knows how to attract or distract the audiences attention in a clever way the more flowing camera offers more focus and in turns allowing the audience to follow these characters closely as they stumble and frantically runthe family consists of a single mother and her children from the first five minutes they will appeal to viewers and its a significant boon for a horror movie madison wolfe as janet the little girl is impressive she has a good on screen chemistry both with the family and the warrens the way shes putting a brave front even though shes exhausted from the abuse but also creates a bit of skepticism is simply excellenther siblings are easily identifiable and equally sympathetic they have a casual tone almost crude yet alarmingly funny as well patrick wilson and vera farmiga as ed and lorraine are visiting a known territory they just fit in the picture in rather creepy homecoming kind of way there are residues from the familiar ambiance yet its presented in more rainy gloomy toneis a pleasant gift for horror its frightening yet it never fails to engage drawing us to stay in the darkly atmosphere and cleverly crafted spectacle,astonish
wowwhat a movieamazing sequel to the amazing series of definitely a movie to see in the cinemaextraordinary performance by the cast especially by the lead vera farminga and patrick wilsonalong with a bonus child actress janet akamadison wolfe from the moment the movie starts itselfyou will be getting a feeling like its an another gem stone from james watt horror movies master each and every situation is ultimatewith a lot of jump scaresthis is a worthy followup to the originaljames wan proves that the warrens are a reason to come backyes i do agree that there are some glitchesbut leave all the brain game in your house and grab a pop corn and watch it in theatersdefinitely you will love the movieafter a long long time a genuine scary movie with a lot of suspense,astonish
this movie was way better than its previous part towards the end of the movie it was on a whole new levelif you are someone who wishes to watch some quality horror films  not the cheap ones where they use gore deaths to trick you into feeling the horror instead james wan really knows how to scare you and send chills down your spinethe movie was thoroughly entertaining the lead characters ed warren by patrick wilson and lorraine warren by vera farmiga have given a very beautiful performance the young girl janet hodgson by madison wolfe needs special mention  hers is yet another extraordinary performancelorraine does not receive anything or is not able to sense any abnormal presence in the place they have been asked to investigate not until they find out the real real why she couldnt sense anything  everyone knows the magnitude of the problem ahead of them then comes the final showdown i guarantee you its gonna a thrilling ride from here onif you are thinking whether to watch this movie or not spend not another moment thinking just go right ahead and watch,astonish
alright alright i will get straight to the point 2 is scary so scary it is actually scarier than the first so scary that if james wan the director of this movie made me jump one more time i would have fallen out of my seat2 is also more interesting than the first the wandirected sequel revolves around the hodgson family who believe their house is haunted because of this they contact the warrens the same ghostbusters from okay not so original however when the warrens investigate the hodgsons house they suspect if the hodgsons house is really haunted are the hodgsons making up this up are ed patrick wilson and lorraine vera farmiga warren not looking deep enough into the hodgsons case the idea of ghostbusters being skeptical about paranormal activity is greatly ironic and a nice change of pace from the first movie in the first movie ed and lorraine accepted that the perrons house was haunted there was no doubt that the perrons were telling the truth in 2 all bets are offwhat is also great about sequel is how likable its characters are for one ed warren is one of the most likable protagonists i have seen in a film he wants the hodgson family to stick together during their time of distress and even bonds with them when he is not trying to conjure up nasty demons he plays the hodgsons guitar he listens to music with them and he even has a few hearttoheart moments with the youngest daughter janet madison wolfe lorraine warren is also charming she sticks up for her husband she makes sacrifices for the hodgson family and she has a heart of gold i really liked the warrens and i especially liked their relationship togetherwhat 2 does masterfully as one could have guessed is making audiences wet their pants yes there are conventional jump scares yes they happen because the sound mixer cranked up the volume to 100 but wan is great at tricking his audiences as to where his scary ghouls are going to pop out of he is also great at making you think something scary is going to happen when nothing does basically if you do not get scared by this movie you are fearlessyet 2 is not without its problems for one the movie is way too long wan wants to make his audience believe that he will end on a conventional unsatisfying note that horror directors overuse then he makes something more evil happen then it turns out that evil thing was just a joke and the audience gets the ending they hoped for while it was fun for wan to trick his audience it would have been more effective if he had one solid ending moreover the beginning is not scary enough wan uses tropes such as creepykidsarescary and oohletsrecreateanoldhorrorstoryliketheamityvillemurder and none of these conventions work while they are entertaining you almost doubt if the film will get scarier which is does believe mecriticisms aside 2 is a fantastic sequel it is scary it tells a great story and it stars some truly likable people yes it is overlong and the film could start off with a bang but i am happy how 2 turned out oh and the film looks great please do not see this movie on your 13 inch computer when it comes to itunes treat yourself to the cineplex,astonish
i cant remember the last time one of these movies had me jumping out of the seat like i did for thisjames wan proves that hess a master at this when hes behind the directors seat ive seen plenty of these movies where he produced them or whatever but he needed to have his directors hat on for them to be this scary the experience is so much better everything was timed so perfectly the ghost were right behind the victims at the right time blended into the shadows to make you scared of what your looking at a lot of camera tricks that make you think nothing is going on until you look long enough the sounds echoed just at the perfect time to get your heart pumping it was slow for just the right amount of time and you dont see the ghost for just the right amount of timethis film will having you clinging to your seat form the opening frame to the very end the most suspenseful supernatural horror film ive seen in a long timeand frankly its makes for an amazing sequel you got to see this one,astonish
i will say from the very first beginning until the last 30 of the movie you will be seeing typical james wan style jump scares only light ones and classic scenes while getting involved in the story line that being said it gets your attention and traps you in to the story but no major experience of terrors yet for typical horror fansonce getting into the last 25minutes or so i felt like walking into a haunted house in the amusement park as a kid terrifying as moving each step forward it was so exciting to enter but once i am there i dont want to move forward and am scared as hell that something will pop out in the dark but there is no way back thats how i felti would also say ii is less predictable than i you cant quite guess how things will end in ii happy ending or sad ending i had no idea but for i we kind of knew what was going to happen once the demon was fully possessing the women typical exorcist scenes from there but for this sequel there were many surprising elementsim an extremely picky horror movie watcher but i will have to say go ahead and enjoy this movie its little over 2hrs but it goes quick you wont be disappointed,astonish
i do not understand why so many have trouble making a horror movie now a day all you have to do is just use james wans creative genius as a guideline and you should in theory have horror gold let me start off by stating that i thought the first was one of the scariest movies i have seen in a loooooong time and put together so brilliantly that when i heard james wan was going to be putting out a sequel i knew we would be getting another horror masterpiece 2 much like the first one has ed and lorraine warren trying to help out a family who have encountered a demonic spirit although the concept of the story similar to the first it is all the little things and over all plot that made this sequel really stand out the way james wan builds up the story and does not kill you with cheesy jump scares but instead pure suspense is something that a lot of writers and directors releasing horror films seem to miss wan builds a story taking events from the real enfield haunting stretching things at times for sure but at the end puts together a movie that will leave you with chills i am a horror fanatic and i appreciate how cold the scenes feel at times how bone chilling the darkness can be and how simple sound effects can make ones skin crawl aside from the horror aspect there are scenes that get you attached to the warrens all over again this is not your typical horror film where the story is replaced with scares and gore we have a story we have suspense we have a connection with the characters and even some comic relief in places the only warning i have coming into this movie is that if you really want to sit there and enjoy it wait for the crowds to die down so many people come into these horror films the first week in groups it seems like and laugh  talk after every scare i myself will be seeing this a second time in a couple weeks once the hype dies down that way i can really take everything in that this movie had to offer overall a must see as james wan has done it once again 1010,astonish
the 2013 film directed by james wan is a masterpiece to the horror genre and became the highest grossing horror movie of all time the film revolved the case about batseeba sherman a woman who sacrificed her child to satan and hung herself from the tree right in front of her farm in rhode island new england united states in 1971 the perron family experienced some disturbing events which was solved by the warren couple2 which is about the einfield case takes place six years later after the rhode island case first of all the screenwriters and james wan need to be praised because its not easy to make a sequel stand in the same level as the original it rarely happens in hollywood a few examples in the horror genre could be ridley scott alien 1979 and james camerons aliens 1986 and john carpenters halloween 1978 and halloween ii 1981every single actor should be praised for their performances especially patrick wilson as ed warren vera farmiga as lorraine warren madison wolfe as janet hodgson and frances oconnor as peggy hodgson i think why many horror movies dont succeed is because we dont feel pity or remorse for the characters in the story but when it comes to this film it doesnt fail at all which is proof that the script and the characters are believable and powerful joseph bisharas music is definitely a reason for why the movie is a killer the background score just makes every single frame more and more intense and spooky and the cinematography by don burgess and editing by kirk m morri was excellentto people who dont know anything about the einfield case or the cases which were solved by the warren couples dont expect another exorcism scene like the first one you might get disappointed if you are a hardcore horror fan the film has some scenes that will give us deja vu as it has been repeated over and over againother than that the storyline is really engaging and it will keep the audience to sit in the edge of their seats throughout the film,astonish
wanted to share s opening night theater experience1 at 5pm was good even with plot holes big enough for a casket i screamed once and did the dead frog electrode thing a number of times i understand it was the highest grossing horror movie ever at well over 300m hard to figure when it was just me and one other guy at the theater fool em once cant fool em twice i guess they showed the double feature in one of their smaller theaters 11 was to follow in 11 as wellhad some ginger snaps and small drink for part 1 brought ginger snaps with me left at intermission to get something more to eat came back and was working my way back to 11 but an usher blocked my path and said the manager wanted to see me all this over ginger snapswas told projector broke and part 2 was going to be in their premium theater where seats cost 1995 described it like an imax they have one of those as well manager said to go back to 11 and pick up my stuff but i asked him if okay to get new as they did not have ginger snaps i settled for a small drink got to pick my seat off a selection screen no charge for drink or upgrade to first classwas excellent no one or nothing dies including the dog which cannot be said for the dark comedy lobster well written good dialog lots of slower parts for recovery then a scare again even lots of lol humor and the scary parts were well crafted my back and knees are sore this morning these were launch popcorn roof high scares the audience loved it and applauded afterwards even staying for most of the credits great evening especially with the never had happen before first class upgrade about time though ive certainly accumulated the miles and hourscheers to good movies nights doug,astonish
this is as close to hell as i ever want to get lorraine vera farmiga when a thrillerhorror story is also a love story i know im in the land of the catholic church nuns christ sin and redemption as for the love part of well lorraine and ed warren farmiga and patrick wilson are famous paranormal investigatorsdemonologists in real life too who happen to be married with a love that helps them through another demonic possession storyafter the real amityville horror and after they are drawn again to similar shenanigans in north london now even after the long break they are back helping an enfield family in demonic distress the scene is not your usual rickety old victorian mansion but rather a rickety old council flat together with director james wans expert tracking shots this film knows just how to scare the hell out of the audiencethis case is about holding on to the one you lovethe singlemom peggy hogson francis oconnor family hangs on to each other after dad has abandoned them while they are disturbed by the ghost of a crooked old man who wants them to leave his home when all else fails the family love brings them through and in a sense so too does the old mans love of his family keep him in this world even though he died years agoas for the catholicchristian overlay the demon is dressed like a goth nun and a priest is consulted because the church is renowned for its ability to exorcise see the exorcist from 43 years ago as a former fallendown catholic boy i can attest to the power of the nuns to direct our consciences indeed our very inner spirits away from sin especially of the flesh the downside is that we can fiercely fear the devil wearing a habit in the end god or his son on a little crucifix around eds neck will save the faithfulyoud think in the thatcher era a demon in her outfit would be enough to scare a poor british family but the catholic church works a better scare in habits because of its ambivalent role in many lives savior and satan,astonish
james wan as always did an amazing job with this movie but i feel like it was a little ripped off of insidious i am aware james wan also directed insidious but i was a little disappointed that he didnt make this movie original what i mean by this is the fact that lorraine goes into what looks like the further from insidious i understand having a style of directing but taking the entire concept of another movie and putting it in a different one definitely bothered me there were other things that reminded me of insidious as well such as the peripheral view of an entity sitting in a chairi felt as though the crooked man was random i feel like he was only stuck in there so ed had an item to put in his museum at the end of the movie since billthe nun wasnt ever connected to an item and was connected to janetthere were parts that didnt lead anywhere in this movie as well when peggy was bitten in the basement nothing happened to her they also found bills missing teeth but that was never brought up again eitherthese are the only negatives that i can find personally in this movie but overall it was very well done i have yet to give a negative review on something james wan has done i dont feel fair rating the scariness of it because i am a person who is too into focusing on the plot to be scared of anything so coming from a thoughtprovoking standpoint i enjoyed it very much,astonish
ill avoid dropping major spoilers and only specifically mention areas that i felt detracted from the film and that wont spoil anyones experience by being mentionedits rare anymore that i find a wellmade enjoyable horror movie flicks like paranormal activity it follows and anything directed by rob zombie have somehow become the acceptable standard for horror yawn i didnt watch any trailers or read anything about the plot of 2 and i didnt expect much from it i received free prescreening passes so i went to see iti found it to be quite entertaining and there is some creepy imagery i wont elaborate so not to ruin anything for those not having seen it prior to reading this but there are definitely some very interesting things visually and also a few that were quite unexpected thats not to say there arent moments of predictability and jumpscares but for me the good far outweighed the bad and there were even some humorous moments sprinkled throughout that worked quite wellafter only one viewing i certainly cant give an extremely detailed report but the few negative things that bugged me while watching this are throughout the film everyone seems to sleep like the dead and loud noises voices crashes etc mostly dont wake anyone even while sleeping in the same room as the disturbance this trend begins at the start of the movie and is continued throughoutand it repeatedly pulled me out of the whole experience the basement in the hodgson residence is partially flooded and no one seems to find it strange or problematic at one point its raining and water is rushing in down some sort of trough the whole basement area seems very unnatural im not familiar with british housing especially of the 70s so i kept wondering if this was for plotconvenience and to make it more creepy or if it is historically accurate and normal there are a few other areas i found to be problematic but im avoiding major spoilers and its rare that films dont have a few flaws anywayoverall i enjoyed it and i recommend checking it out ill be adding it to my horror collection once it arrives on bluray,astonish

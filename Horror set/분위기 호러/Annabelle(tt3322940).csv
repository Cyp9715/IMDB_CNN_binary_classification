horror is one of my favorite movie genres i really wasnt expecting to hate this as much as i did but it is astonishingly terrible really i loved the conjuring  this is nothing like the conjuring at all its a blatant cashgrab and a terrible one at thatthere is zero tension throughout this movie zero suspense everything is reliant on close ups of the dolls face to creep us out and really long periods of time where nothing happens literally its about this couple that we do not care about and their stupid problems which we care even less about i dont know if they were trying to build suspense in these scenes but in order to build suspense you actually have to care about the characters or at least have you know suspense a lingering sense of danger this had nothing and holy hell that ending the positives of this movie the lead girl is beautiful shes easy to look at the soundtrack is pretty cool too thats it the characters are horrendous and the acting is even worse seriously if youre going to make a movie this awful at least have the decency to take an acting lesson or two its a dreadful watch please dont waste your time with this cash grab sht stain dont give them the satisfaction watch something good like sinister or 1408  haunting movies done right,astonish
there were only two count em two well constructed and more importantly scary sequences throughout this entire horror movie the home invasion part and the elevator bit if that fact alone is enough to get one person not to watch then ive done my job as a criticif you went into wanting to see something along the lines of childs play or at the very least a dollcentric horror movie where dolls are either animated in some fashion or at the very least trip someone as they walk down the stairs then you will be savagely disappointed on the other hand if you were a fan of the small snippet of s story shown in the conjuring and wanted a terrifying and indepth origins story then youwill be disappointed as wellsynopsis with an engaging set up set against the rampant cultphobia of the 60s is the story of a couple living in california who begin to experience paranormal occurrences after the husband gifts his pregnant dollcrazed wife a doll that soaks up blood faster than a bounty paper towel after that the plot falls pretty flat by turning its focus away from the scary doll element as the story becomes 10 rosemarys baby 20 every single haunted house movie ever and 70 watered down scaresaside from the fact that not for one second did i care about any of the characters here for the most part director john r leonetti the director of photography of the conjuring does a lazy job of conjuring up scares for about 80 minutes of this 98 minute film every single scare follows the ultra uncreative quiet quiet quiet loud formula about 20 minutes in it becomes obvious that leonetti is either just going through the motions or doing a rather poor job of plagiarizing much scarier filmsfinal thought much like the countless throw away straight to dvd disney animated sequels to come out of late the 90s and early 2000s pocahontas 2 journey to a new world the little mermaid 2 return to the sea cinderella 2 dreams come true a prequel is nothing more than a soulless moneygrab from this particular production company attempting to feed off the success of the conjuring no mention of ed and lorraine warren real life paranormal investigators from the conjuring no james wan the director of the conjuring and not one dollinduced scare all seemed to have a hand in making a strikingly forgettable film i mean in the conjuring the doll is only used in all of three scenes but due to some smart direction those are some of the scariest potions of the movie in the titular doll is used throughout and its not even a little bit creepy what gives,astonish
let me start off by stating that as a devout horror fan with a special liking to ghost stories haunts and exorcisms i have really enjoyed the conjuring therefore my anticipation towards this pseudo prequel is to be understood as well as my disappointmentperhaps it was the fact that james wan was only an executive producer of this film that has made it wreak of mediocrity especially compared to the first most of this films components are exactly that mediocre the acting lacked the charisma and screen presence of patrick wilson ed warren in the conjuring though i must say that alfre woodard evelyn and tony amendola father perez were certain light spots the story feels like it came out of an automated template machine given the basic create me a mediocre haunting story order and again compared to the conjuring simply doesnt make the cutso why the slightly generous rating for a few reasons1 say what you will that doll is one of the scariest creepiest and most horrifying things i have ever seen both on screen and in life whoever created that dolls exterior should be either given a reward for being a genius or committed to a mental ward for being sick in the head and i say that with the utmost respect that doll is a work of art unlike the conjuring gives the doll a lot more well deserved screen time2 the cinematography is at its best with the quick shots giving the audience sometimes less than a second to realize what theyre seeing showing demons ghosts and such evil presences in that manner really adds to the fear factor in my opinion for hollywood is yet to realize how to portrait a demon that is scary for those of us who arent religious christians and i say that with no disrespect whatsoever to christians or christianity i like to use insidious another wanderful masterpiece if you havent seen it stop reading right now and go see it as an example  the one thing really lowering that excellent films level is the demon shown there in demons are shown but for a snap shot leaving much to imagination which serves to add to the scare gauage3 plot actually gets pretty intense towards the end but only towards the endso all in all perhaps had i watched this film before the conjuring i would have been able to be more objective but seeing as how i am unable to ignore its shortcomings  i give it 65 meaning you should definitely watch it especially if you liked the conjuring but you shouldnt expect it to meet the conjurings level,astonish
about a minute into this film i squealed out of fear when they put the doll into frame i have a genuine fear of dolls like this they freak me out therefore i was excited about this movie  i sincerely thought that there would finally be another movie out there that would manage to scare me i have 3 in total so far sadly this is not the case the movie was boring and predictable the worst thing was that they have this terrifying creatureobjectthing to make good use of and they failed miserably at using it im genuinely disappointed at the reuse of the same old washed up horror storyline howd this script even get approved booo i wish i wrote it so they could actually see what fear of a doll is haha,astonish
as a prequel and spinoff of the conjuring  2013s highly effective horror film  does what it promises even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time but thats all you get jumpy scenes done to perfection with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusionone of the most important aspects of the conjuring and older sibling insidious both films directed by james wan is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewers peripheral vision by this i am referring to events occurring offcenter or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to onscreen characters but very obvious to the viewer consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby the scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house without shifting focus from the mother and child we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind something that shouldnt be there in the first place while this tactic is nothing new to horrorthrillers it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread thick and slow before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later the scariest scenes in are made up of these moments and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners and is probably why cinematographer john r leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film while wan himself is bumped up to producer leonetti plays it safe by treading down wans beaten path but without any surprises of his ownplaying the aforementioned mother is wallis freaky coincidence as mia gordon mia has a doll collection one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband john ward horton after surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult the gordons have new guests that wont leave at first mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while john begins to doubt her sanity its a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies it takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through iton one hand the look and feel in this film is a copypaste version of insidious but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright weve seen it before in classic horror films  young parents who must literally go through hell to save their childs soul its the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film like a stern disciple leonetti is on par with wans technical approach cinematography hair raising sound design including deliberate moments without sound and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience but thats about it on the downside there isnt much of a story for a script based on real events and dont even expect anything along the lines of an animated hucky doll its not about what the doll can do but about whats in the doll if only they had built on that frame of thought after some welltimed jump scares in the first half all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap,astonish
im a horror movie fan  im a fan of the original evil dead trilogy to romero to poltergeist korean horror french horror etc im also a fan of the new wave of horror im a fan of the conjuring as it was a film that made me think the art of a horror movie is back first off this isnt made by james wan its made by its filmographer so off of the bat youre probably going to get some cool scenes but perhaps lack of character development the budget of is 5 million thats 14 of what the conjuring cost let me tell you the script is the weakest part of this filmthe movie starts off slow this is where the film should really get you into the characters but there isnt much here its generic its the weakest part of the film you have your standard couple man goes to work woman stays home and experiences weird stuff the problem with this is that its hard for you to bother to relate to the characters this kind of kills the film for me there were actually a lot that could have been explored but they didnt touch like the kids in the apartmentnow the good there is very little cgi  perhaps none its all old school this is something that anyone could actually film chair moving oven is on someone standing there its good it works theres a great scene here with a baby are there enough scares not really the pay off for the film felt like they might have fixed the movie for censors but even though the film is rated rtheres a lot missing in this film its not horrible its worth a rental its your average horror movie,astonish
there was such huge potential for this movie to be scary extremely creepy looking doll backstory from the conjuring  an old house and a baby but instead of a genuinely haunting movie we were subjected to an insulting plot with zero scares i am not exaggerating there were zero scary parts in this lots of zooming in on the creepy dolls face you expect something to happen at this point the head to move the mouth to open the eyes to blink but no there was nothing just a slow zooming in shot of a stationary inanimate dolllook at the movies budget vs profit and youll see why the producers wanted to make this movie it was simply a cash making exercise with no thought given to the plotthis should not be classed as a horror movie ive seen scooby doo cartoons which were scarier than this,astonish
i have watched many many scary movies some good some bad none truly scary anyone who reviewed this film as scary or awesome obviously has not seen the film this is a complete snorefest from start to finish i saw perhaps 3 jump out of seat scenes where it was totally predictable on it and was yawning each time the conjuring was a terrific film and this one is just trying to score big bucks off that name with 14 the budget i was left feeling angry and cheated there was no depth no character relation no storyline nothing to get you even remotely into the film except saw the previews this is gonna be so good  feeling you saw when you watched the previews and couldnt wait for this to come out a complete letdown in all aspects except the fact it actually ended and i could go do something else,astonish
okay folks this not an oscar film for sure it is also not ground breaking by any means hell the only thing even remotely true about the film is the first maybe three minutes this is every horror movie you have ever seen rolled into one one minute you feel like your watching rosemarys baby then rosemary is in the amityville house the next moment here comes chucky with even a little helter skelter thrown into the mix but everything i could say that is wrong with this film is exactly why it works it embraces its cheese factor even revels in it at times the film has some great scares and in a few cases some real interesting ones it is just simply a lot of fun to watch with a lot of people so much so when reveals herself fully you find yourself really into it i thought the ending was weak but by the time you get to the end it would be very hard to raise the level suspense any higher there is a scene with a sewing machine and jiffy pop which i think should go down in horror movie history for the right way to build suspense it was funny listening to the audiences nervous giggles as something was about to happen go to this as entertainment and nothing more nothing deep here very little real here it is based on a true story however based is a very loose word here three minutes is based upon a true story just good october fun,astonish
we have met the creepy vintage doll before in last years excellent and very memorable horror film the conjuring she was just the front act there showing up only at the preopening credits sequence this year we get to know more and how she came to be demonically possessedthe setting of this film is in the 1960s in a california suburb young couple john and mia are expecting their first child one day john surprises mia who was a vintage doll collector with a huge antique doll with painted ivory face wearing white satin dress adorned by a red bow it just so happened that same night crazy satanic cultists attack their home and there was resulting bloodshed however since that night there was no more peace in john and mias household especially after she gives birth to their daughter leahi liked the throwback look of this film with its faded color palette and meticulous production design the architecture interior design fashion hairstyles television shows pop music all captured the era so well even the look of cutie baby leah was vintage like the gerber baby these things also contributed to the scariness factor because of the limitation of technology that the characters have on hand a big part of the success of as a horror film is the effective lead performance of coincidentallynamed wallis as mia the characters name mia i am guessing is a tribute to mia farrow who was the star of a horror classic of the 1960s rosemarys baby the stroller mia uses for leah sure looked like rosemarys stroller which is seen in posters of that old film ms wallis has an elegant beauty and her acting was sympathetic without becoming cheesyward horton plays mias husband john who is a medical student which makes a convenient excuse for him to be a skeptic and always on call during the night leaving mia in the house watching television or working on her sewing machine veteran actress alfre woodard is the only familiar face in the cast and she plays their helpful neighbor evelyn her character though had a story arc which probably the only negative thing i could say about this filmjohn r leonetti the cinematographer of insidious 1  2 and the conjuring makes an auspicious directorial debut with he learned very well from his his previous director james wan who sits as producer of this film you can see he has the eye for the perfect views for the most effective suspense and surprise i liked the cinematography that employs camera angles that give you the point of view of the tormented victim so that you too do not know what will happen next the suspense could be so intense so many times with the excellent editing and splicing of scenes together accompanied by a swelling crescendo of music the timing for the big jump scare was effectively surprising most of the time even you were sort of predicting it to happen alreadythis is a film which may divide audiences as to whether it could match the successes of insidious or the conjuring as it is i liked more than i thought i would i was expecting the worst since i hated how the doll looked and i cant imagine anyone wanting one like it in their house however the film managed to transcend that limitation and actually create genuine scares that worked,astonish
this film is hilariously bad i brought it back for me and my girlfriend and we watched it this film really tried to pull off the omglookbehindyou and imreallystupidsoimnotgoingtopickupthatguntype mentatily i understand this is part of the horror genre that i so love but this is ridiculous to the point to making fun of you because of this you will probably want to shut it off about 23 through by that stage the shitness couldnt bring me to care about the already weak characters any more anyway unfortunately started so well what a shame,astonish
i loved the conjuring when it came out was up there with my favourite movies from last year when first seen the trailers wasnt sure if was going to a good movie on its own but i was wrongdont know how many times i jumped in my seat watching this movie and some of the reactions it was getting from other people in the crowd it really keeps up the scares and frights and tries to keep them at a good pace throughout the movie now this is by no means better than the conjuring but it is pretty close the doll is terrifying and i imagine a lot of people wont be looking at their dolls the same again after watching this,astonish
im not the type to write long reviews  give too much unnecessary details but overall im giving this movie a 9 out of 10 i really enjoyed it and would probably watch it again as we get closer to halloween the movie had a good story line and nothing stood out as being too fake or unrealistic this movie was very well made i would definitely recommend to watch it this october during the halloween season there were definitely plenty of jumping in your chair moments and plenty of people screaming in the theater i think most people would enjoy watching it,astonish
cmon a haunted doll reallyobviously i really wasnt expecting much but similar to my experience with the conjuring i left the theater actually feeling quite satisfied the doll wasnt as central to the story as one would expect rather it was more of a symbol of evil in the film there was some nice character development an interesting plot and plenty of moments where i had my mouth wide open because i was terrified this movie is a lot of fun and to my surprise i would definitely recommend it if youre looking for a movie with fun scares and actual substance to the storyline radical concept for a horror film bravo cant wait to see the conjuring 2 the enfield poltergeist in 2015,astonish
this is certainly one of the spookiest movies ive seen in some time it had the same jump factor as paranormal activity and i was on the edge of my seat for the most part of the film unlike a lot of horror movies it stayed reasonably believable throughout the entire film and didnt not end with some insane half wit ending this is not the conjuring im not sure why people are comparing the two but i think the comparisons are reflecting the poor reviews which would explain the lower scores they are two different movies that tie in together but i dont feel they should compete but should be in harmony with each other if you are a fan of horror movies especially demons or just want to get your heart racing i 100 recommend this movie,astonish
in the first rather scary scene in the conjuring featuring the doll i wondered what kind of woman would ever buy a doll that creepy looking apparently no one since the real was in fact a simple raggedy ann doll this movie purports to tell the whole story behind the doll almost none of which conforms with reality meaning the true story as it was given to and told by the warrens we meet a bland prosaic young couple about to have a child the wife has a doll collection decorating the childs room before she knows if its a girl or boy and the husband buys her the doll which is supposedly an expensive collectors item meant to match two similar dolls following an attack by two cult members who lived next door the doll becomes possessed doing usual ghost things like operating a sewing machine and record player later she seemingly tries to kill the baby in its womb contradicting the later explanation that the doll is a demon host looking for an innocent soul luckily a kindly mystical black woman owns a nearby bookstore with a wellstocked occult section the wife and her friend discover the name of the cult to which the neighbors belonged but use absolutely none of the information to defeat the doll in fact there are many threads that dangle and go nowhere we meet two children who seemingly draw pictures of the baby being hit by a truck and then the children are never seen again and bear no relevance to the plot the fact that the mystic new age black woman is willing to go to any length to protect this bland white family may strike some as offensive especially since it appears nowhere in the actual story like most films of this nature it is practically an advertisement for the catholic church and christian religion in general the warrens also investigated the amityville story whose victims were also catholic and the book featured an introduction by a catholic priest essentially these stories say for better or worse that catholics are the religion feared by the devil and the only ones capable of eliminating supernatural threats from demons the warrens in fact keep the doll in a case protected with a cross and blessed by a priest as for the movie itself it features a couple good jump scares there are a couple scenes strongly reminiscent of japanese horror dark water and the grudge especially ive seen this type of movie done better and much worse i have no idea why the r rating except possibly the religious iconography and injury to a priest and pregnant woman but honestly this could play on television barely edited if at all you can definitely wait for this title on video,astonish
ok first of all i decided to make an imdb account just to write a review about how crap this movie was i cannot believe how poor this movie was it made me so angry and irritated me the acting was horriblethe characters were just not very convincing i was not scared through this movie i kept watching it hoping that its going to get better but it didnt the conjuring was so much better the acting the plot was so much better do not even waste your time watching this movie because you will only be disappointed overall im giving this movie a 0 out of 10,astonish
ive been expecting a followup to the conjuring since the movie came out last year to be fair i was kinda feeling funny when they announced the release of a prequel only a year after the first was issued but stillwe all know the downhill of saw movies that keeps repeatedly piling out of the volkswagen in a call of duty or fifa fashion every year and i thought this prequel would have been sort of a bad movie since the conjuring have raised the bar quite highbut holycow does it live up in fact you can say its a stand alone movie that can easily redeem its title the amount of either jump scare and suggested are well balanced making it enjoyable to watch in a nutshell the ambiance that is settled is disturbing and is supposed to beonly blind spot the actor play that can be qualified as not as good as the overall execution briefly said if youre looking for a good scare and potentially the better horror movie of 2014 this is a serious contendermake your impression as well and go see it definitely worth it,astonish
brilliant horror film  while i was watching the film at a packed movie theater i was thinking chucky has finally met his match in not that the movie is anything like the childs play films it is very different and perhaps the only common factor they share is the presence of a dollthe movie was executed professionally everything was top notch from direction to cinematography and from acting to plot and dialog everything was in place i also loved the 70s vibe and the lead actress wallis playing mia was also excellentthe movie had its shares of scares jump out of your seat surprises but nothing over the top it might not be as scary as people might be expecting and hence some of the negative reviews here from other users however i thought the movie was well balanced and relied mainly on story and character rather than being overtly scary which was perfect in my opinion and it what made it so good and successful in my eyesi highly recommend this a good horror film to start october with and prepare for halloween go watch it,astonish
annabella i decided to watch this tonight because i watched on live cam them moving the original annabella from its original case to another case  not 100 sure why i think it was more of a portable case so they can carry around to take on lectures  and feed naughty kids to  they wore protected gloves and said a prayer then lifted her from its place and placed into the other case then said another prayer it was a interesting watch but not much to it and only lasted around 8mins i was expecting a bit more example a bit of history and background of the doll  story and maybe a closer look of the doll before putting it into its case now lets be fair we all have some interest in supposedly true stories like these  i say supposedly because im referring to ghost  possession  haunted etc stories like amityville horror etc where stories of serial killers we know are true and did happen  now to me i honestly dont believe the whole annabella story and there no real proof to back it up except the owners story and what they say now if you dont know anything about the story films like these slightly irritate me because it had no real connection at all about the doll except the film was based on a doll and really used annabella name to cash in and get a wider and bigger audience and if you dont know that then you would walk away from the cinema thinking this was the story after all i had to once explain to someone paranormal activity wasnt true  but she wouldnt have it because at the end before titles it gave a brief outline of the story as if it was true and because of that she believed it was true otherwise why write that at the end face palmthe film itself was half decent and watchable but several elements of the film annoyed me  like for starters scare tactics  was there any  where the music suddenly booms making you reach for the remote control ready to turn it downand making you jump in same way as if you walking along street and a friend jumped out from nowhere and loudly shouted boo no need thats not scare tactics more of giving you a bloody heart attack tactics a horror will scare you and keep you edge of your seat on whats happening with atmospheric music in the background several scenes reminded me of other horrors like exorcist and omen where she was pushing the pram with the child in she had both hands on the pram then suddenly bent down to pick her keys up that she dropped while doing so the pram rolled into the road and got hit by a truck but thats ok the child was safe because she had hold of it in her arms close to her chest was this some sort of magic trick to impress pen  teller i like to know if it fooled them in how she did it personally if i was to watch a story based on something true like a doll  i would watch a independent film of it than a hollywood film for several reason but main reason being is the makers of the indie film would research the story and try to stick as closely as they could to supposedly the real facts where the hollywood film would put there own spin on it and exaggerate to suit themselves ,astonish
i had high hopes for this movie having liked the conjuring but i was sadly disappointed there were only 4 shock scares throughout the whole movieit seemed to me the doll was not even possessed just a demon who enjoyed playing with it i actually noticed more bloopers then scares i found the characters where just thrown together with no development and outside characters made no sense as to why they were even in the movie since they added nothing i believe that this movie would have been best served going strait to dvd instead of being offered in movie theaters for the lack of any attempt to develop the characters or even attempt to make the doll demon possessedie moving around on its own glowing eyes the one time they actually showed the doll moving by its self was portrayed as a demon holding it overall it was a major disappointment definitely not a must see move of 2014,astonish
i neva knew about the film when i first heard but it was breathtakingnot the james wan kind of horror but indeed a good one this film has got a lot of jumps and scares which keeps you scared till the end not much story but sound effects certainly did a good job with fine camera positions this is not a conjuring kind of film so not to compare both there are certain scenes which takes us to the edge of the seat and thats what we expectdont we but why do need a soul thatz sound amusing isnt it as a whole this film is worth watch twice in theatres if horror is your genre then this is the film,astonish
maybe not the most disturbing horrordemonic movie but its up there i thought the story was substantial enough the dots are connected as to how became a conduit for a demon and how the persons who conjured up the demon were destroyed as a consequence of the actions that malevolent spirit drove them to the corollary of the mansontatelabianca murders were a nice touch and fit nicely into the chronology of the franchise effective use of imagery movement sound and scoring to put viewers on the edge of their seat i glanced over to my 19 yearold daughter who loves scary movies and found her sitting in a fetal position with hands poised to cover her eyes my christian peers would think im a horrible father for condoning such a movie by taking my daughter to see itbut theologically i found the content to be biblically accurate and that there certainly is evil in the world and i believe that evil was set loose in our world when humankind chose to mistrust god and summon the power or purview of gods enemies,astonish
when james wan came out with the conjuring and then insidious i thought a new subgenre of horror has been created that of substance over cutscreen scare shots or the splatterfest gore or movies that were so popular in the last few years when i read james wan was not directing i got admittedly nervous but john leonetti not only maintains wans level of excellence imo he surpasses it in many respects approaching the tension with a slow build rather than a haunted house jump scene was so effective that during one of the many collective scream scenes where the entire theater jump started yelled or both one girl sitting 3 rows in front of me just got up out of her chair and sprinted out the exit door not sure what she was running to but im almost positive what she was running fromanyway i fully expect there to be reviews from the too cool arm chair adrenaline junkies who claim to be unshakable in their choice of horror viewing and would probable claim no movie will ever scare them but for my 1300 not counting popcorn and twizzlers this movie delivered on average more scary images per minute than any film i have ever seen in my entire life,astonish
i cant say that is a good film theres nothing original about it but i can say that i found it to be fine and pleasant to watch sure there are a number of well executed scares but its 1969 setting and cinematography by james kniest provide it with a dreamy quality isnt about gore its that rare film these days that aims to scare you by building dread with patience and restraint director john r leonetti should be applauded for this the best executed sequence occurs at the beginning of the film when we get to see what happens to mia wallis and john forms ward horton neighbors through their bedroom window on the downside the script by gary dauberman just doesnt have enough good material for the films 99 minute running time just like in the conjuring 2013 there is a buildup of scares until the shocking ending but in this becomes repetitive because the scares are practically the same this didnt bother me much though because wallis and horton are charismatic enough actors to make us care about mia and john i definitely liked them more than the characters in the conjuring its not hard to realize that is influenced by roman polanskis rosemarys baby while its not as good as that 1968 film is still a good time at the movies and i recommend it the film may seem like a cash grab after the success of the conjuring but leonetti and the actors turned it into something enjoyable,astonish
i have recently gone through a phase of watching a few horror movies that i never got around to watching which includes insidious 1 and the conjuringi am lost for words how anyone can rate insidious as a brilliant horror movie i guess it is a sign of the times that putting excruciatingly loud noises when something supposedly scary is on the screen into a film means it is terrifying that is insidious all the way through it is not scary at all it is a cheap and pathetic trick to scare the audience you watch those scenes without the sound and they are laughable insidious is a joke film yet scores so highly on here because loud noises scare peoplei thought the conjuring was much better than insidious but still both do not come close to john leonetti did a better job with this film than james wan could ever have dreamed of doingthe tension created without the need for outrageously loud bangs sets this film apart from all the tiresome and clichd films that have come out recently the sewing machine scenes the oven scene and the lift scene alone created more tension and horror than any loud noise can create it was executed perfectly even the scenes where nothing happened but you were expecting them to were done perfectly sure the film isnt perfect but as a horror it is beautifully paced and the tension is built up brilliantly it is easily one of the better horror movies i have seen in the last 5 years i do not usually watch lots of american horror films because i find them all very similar similar stories similar scare tactics so i tend to watch more korean japanese and french horrors but i was pleasantly and massively surprised with how well this movie was donei would highly recommend this movie to anyone and i put it way above the horror movie comparisons on here such as insidious and conjuring its not even close this is way better the fact this film has such a low score really says to me either there is something really dodgy going on with imdb film ratings or people really do have no taste in real horror movies only the cheesy and ridiculous loud noisecheap scare ones that are in abundance these days,astonish
arriving thanks to the great success of james wans the conjuring picks up where its predecessor began i know that doesnt make much sense but think of this supernatural thriller as a companion piece versus a sequel while not as frightening or complex as the original is an effective scare fest filled with characters set up well enough to empathize witha couples home is invaded by satanic cultists shortly after they begin to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll upon further investigation the couple discovers the cultists have summoned an entity so malicious that nothing they did will compare to the sinister conduit to the damned that is now set in the 1970s plays out just like a lost film from that era it takes time to set up each character and give the viewer a reason to invest in their lives you get attached to them before unholy terror and tragedy reigns down upon each one another reason it plays out like a genuine treasure from the decade of the exorcist and the omen is its focus on the satanic panic movement of the time the drama unfolds as the manson family trial is playing out on the couples television it captures the paranoia of a time when cults and a serial murderer known as the zodiac killer was on everyones minds the american public was either fixated or unhealthily fascinated with the dangers of the occultis rated r for intense sequences of disturbing violence and terror blood is definitely shed on screen and i agree that some imagery is beyond what weve come to expect from pg13 movies however theres no nudity to be seenfor those walking into expecting a chucky movie youll be sorely disappointed the doll is only one plot device used the demon manifests itself using several different avenues which i dont want to spoil entirely here the most prevalent one is that of the female cult member who infects the doll with her tainted bloodone thing i really enjoyed about was its confidence in waving the flag of christianity in a mainstream movie the writers had no problem giving mention of god and jesus christ throughout the film im not saying that everything in the movie is theologically sound but the spirit and intention is there i also agree with most of the explanations as to how demons come to be attached to objectsis a worthy followup to the conjuring it comes as no surprise that producers would focus on the deadly doll as a means of carrying on what could become a franchise all its own the creepy plaything almost stole the show just like disney is doing with star wars warner brothers could push out a spinoff film for each object in the warrens occult museum every other year directed by up and coming talent while james wan handles the the conjuring sequels,astonish
i rate it a 910 because it hadwas a great movie good plot great jump scares and great acting other people writing reviews about this movie are telling you its not good because it doesnt connect as much as they want it to to the conjuring sorry but this movie is called not the conjuring 2 the people who gave it less than 610 probably got so scared that they hated the movie overall this is a great movie leading up to halloween and i would definitely recommend everyone who loves horror movies to see this soon or on halloween as it will leave you never wanting to buy a doll for yourself also its well worth your money to see it in theatres,astonish
i expected anabelle to be like all those silly doll killer movies but anabelle was so different it wasnt your average doll movie it was more realistic and terrifying it had a good suspense and creepiness to it and it was terrifying and scary i had goosebumps when watching it its a really exciting and thrilling movie it has lots of jump scares i kept jumping from fright the doll was so scary its terrifying to think that this is based on a true story and actually happened anabelle is still alive all the up to today the whole environment of the movie was scary it was just a scary movie in general  i loved it this movie isnt just about a doll its about demons i think any horror fan should watch this movie because it is really good,astonish
i just wasted like a hour and half of my life watching this movie through the whole movie annabel doesnt even seem to move at least in the chuckie movies you saw chuckie walking talking etc and then what tripped me out is why the hell would the lady mia go down to put something in storage and leave her baby in the apartment upstairs alone knowing that theirs an evil presence all around the house that is after her and the baby also the scene were she drops her keys and the stroller goes rolling in the street and once the stroller gets hit she all of a sudden has her baby in her hand so many scenes were this movie just did not have any common sense they could of had a better director do this movie because this movie was a waste of time im glad i watched it online through a website that was free rather then going to go spend my money this weekend to watch the film in theaters this movie was awful and thats just my honest opinion,astonish
is one of those horror movies that has the formula that we are all used to a lot of jump scares the acting wasnt great but i did like the story it had better cinematography that most horror films there were a lot of shots that were pleasing to the eye it is not nearly as good as the conjuring but its worth watching the doll is pretty creepy throughout the film the one thing that killed it for me is that you did not really feel attached to the characters i think they could have done way better with the casting in the end you didnt really care what happened to them overall is not as good as the conjuring wait till you can red box this one,astonish
it seems like a while since i watched a horror movie with religious themes the movie starts with a cult attack on a beautiful young couple and later gets the catholic church involved nothing gets the imagination going than the all powerful good vs evil add to this the creepy look of the doll and settings and youve got an entertaining horrorthat being said the movie is full of clichs and stereotypes thats fine because the depth of their character is not the main attraction the movie sucks you in slowly with the creepiness that by the end youre willing to just go along for the ride,astonish
i was pretty much sold on this movie when part of the description mentioned satanic cult included i missed the opening first few minutes but that was ok i guess anyway my only problem was that i didnt know who theses actors were but once i got passed that i sat along for the ride i really enjoyed the crowd response in the theater some were screaming with fear at particular scenes this movie had some elements that were related to rosemarys baby which was kind of a downer because it lacked some originality but all in all it was a good average experience youll be in for a surprise when it comes to seeing the dark shadow revealed at least i was,astonish
i have disliked a majority of movies i watch but not badly enough that im urged to write a review on it this movie however irked me so badly that i feel the need lets start off by saying that the title of this movie is correct yep so where is this doll the entire movie nowhere thats right this is where the plot falls apart and everything goes downhill from there the doll is hardly in the movie at all she moves a total of maybe two times excluding the climax of this movie in which she is overused i had a very hard time finishing this overhyped example of trying too hard to be original the beginning is too slow and it doesnt get to the point until the movie is just about over as well by the end of the movie i just wanted it to end and was happy that they at least hadnt killed off the bookstore owner and then there is yet another attempt at being original and failing miserably this lady who by the way had nothing to do with any of this plummets to her death out the apartment window and gives her soul to a demon it was this part that enraged me the most for the mere idea of killing a good character off when there was no reason to and another ending could have been made because the director clearly wasnt actually making off of the true story is barbaric and uncalled for i am disturbed with the outcome of this movie and quite frankly i didnt even want to award it one star but there was no option lower so i will state it here010 stars,astonish
this movie was just ugh awful i expected this movie to have the same formula as the conjuring had scare people with suspense not with some cheesy cgi cast off from insidious if you took the demon from insidious cut off its tail then you would have the demon in the story is supposed to be about not some stupid stereotype american family the story should of been about the little girl that was in the first 5 minutes of the movie if you watch the first 5 minutes then leave you have the story of if you want to watch the rest of it be prepared you barely seen do anything all she does is sit there and do nothingeveryone scene is predictable and when you think you will see something you do so it takes away all suspense of the film the conjuring knew that to scare people you have to make them think they will see something and then dont show them something that is the key if we anticipate seeing something we will scare ourselves more blair witch project halloween jason nightmare on elm street the conjuring all knew this scaring people isnt hard to do with a horror movie but when you feed it to us like were 2 years old it isnt scary it is repetitive and boringa sad example of a sequel directors and producers you disappoint me only cool thing i found in the movie was the fact mias real name is which i think was a fun twist to the story haha other then that it was a waste of 10 dollars,astonish
if you liked insidious than this is a must watch as opposed to a movie focusing on the doll like childs play does with chucky this movie steers to the evil behind the doll good decision props to the director for this what really impressed me was how i could say this movie belongs up in the category of insidious for the many creepy scenes there were some laughs and some jump stomach aching inducing scenes i dont know who the director of this movie is but when i do i will keep my eyes open to see what else he contributes 2014 was a good year for horror movies first tusk and now ,astonish
for those that compared this movie to the conjuring you will probably be disappointed the movie plays out very similar to insidious so if you enjoy that one you will enjoy do not compare this movie with the conjuring it isnt similar to that one much at all people consider to be the sequel but in reality its more of a spinoff they are making the conjuring part 2 after allwhen i went to go watch this movie i lost excitement after reading the negative reviews  most of them saying the movie was boring and nothing happened to my surprise the movie wasnt like the reviews at all i enjoyed the movie and something does happen throughout the movie you wont be sitting there waiting 30 minutes for something to happenmy only complaint with this movie many people didnt like this either was that the doll didnt really move many others expected it to be like chucky but in actuality the doll was being haunted and there are demons involved if you watch this movie expecting it to walk around on its own and killing people you will not be content however if youre into creepy dolls or enjoy jumpscares i recommend this movie,astonish
i just got finished watching the prequel to the conjuring my only fault with this movie was that there didnt seem to be an actual plot it felt like a lot of scary stuff was just happening however i found the overall movie to be very scary and i thought it did a great job of building suspense through sound imagery and lighting not knowing much about the movie before i saw it aside from the fact that it was about a doll i didnt know what to expect from this film i thought that it might be slightly reminiscent of chuckie where a doll goes around terrorizing people but is much more than that the first 30 minutes of the movie nothing scary really happens we just get introduced to the characters and learn how the doll gets possessed the main characters mia and john live in santa monica and are expecting their first child but after they are attacked in their home they relocate to an apartment in pasadena after john gets offered a new jobit is after they start living in their new apartment that the paranormal occurrences start to occur what i liked most about was that it used a lot of different monsters and scares throughout the film as opposed to it solely relying on the menacing looking doll there are a few occurrences of invisible things pulling mia doors repeatedly open and close on their own electronics start turning on by themselves we see a dead woman walking around haunting mia and perhaps the scariest monster was the demondevil that we see repeatedly midway through the film an interesting thing to note is that although the movie is titled we never actually see the doll move and that these paranormal occurrences seem to only effect mia her husband john never experiences anything i also liked how the film used lighting sound and imagery to scare the audience is filled with a lot of long dark corridors lights flicker on and off there are a lot of footsteps and thuds and of course the classic which is loud fast paced music followed by silence then a screamer i also really liked how the monsters actually looked scary and not just silly like the monster from insidious overall i really enjoyed this movie it made me and my boyfriend jump several times so i found it to be pretty scary the actor that plays john ward horton i found his acting to be pretty mediocre to terrible but that didnt ruin the movie for me also the ending is not the best but i would watch this movie again,astonish
its thursday night and you know what that means yes its time for another movie review the month of halloween begins with a blockbuster kicker with the first horror movie of the season with james wan pulling out of the director chair his legacy has been left open for other directors to take over well open season is over for the infamous doll of the conjuring has now got a movie of her own can wans big shoes be filled or has the train of good horror movies run out of steam leaving us again with hollywood knock offs lets get down to the question you want answered is scary well for this reviewer the answer is kind of like its predecessor this movie is a combination of jump out at you scares and creepy paranormal activity blended together in decent harmony audience members will get a nice variety of ways to make you squirm in your chair and possibly scream for this reviewer the creepier aspects involved objects turning on randomly or the random trail of pictures dropped by a devious shadow such random acts seem silly but its the subtle play of light a thing you catch off to the side that really penetrates your core weve all been spooked by something in the corner of our eye and this movie plays on it like wan director john r leonetti also is not afraid to have his monsters come out during the day yes no manner of light can keep the creatures at bay again removing a barrier that we normally turn too yet this movie takes it one step further and takes the creature out of the residence most movies keep the spirit isolated to one area but s wrath escapes out into the open following our heroine and her cohorts around this may not affect some but for a few latecomers to the theater they were not happy to lose that comfort such alterations in haunting strategies is what the horror world has needed giving it a little extra kick to the scare factor that many films in this genre have been lacking of course the creepiest thing in this movie is none other than the doll herself as i mentioned a year ago has the design that will chill just about anyone to the bones in this movie we are given an exponential increase in that factor the seemingly innocent doll being scarier than the thing tied with it her cold lifeless stare has a menacing glare to it behind those pristine blue eyes the charismatic grin holding a comfortable welcome laced with malice and evil and all of it is wrapped in a porcelain white package what adds a little more scariness to it is seeing the doll wind up in the strangest places as the trailers state it starts with a simple change in poster but gradually turns to her ending up in the weirdest places that will make you cautious in your own room throw in the fact that her features morph over the course of the film eventually into movement and well you get some factors that might have you screaming oh snap into the air with all these factors you might think this movie is the scariest thing ive seen unfortunately that is not the case the first reason is a big one the trailers have shown you most of the scary scenes thats right a majority of the jump out at you moments and creepy happenings have been laid out for you in all their details sure there is a little editing to cover things up and you havent heard the spine tingling music that adds a little spice but youll see most of the moments coming a second factor to the lack of scariness is that once again the camera foreshadows when things are going to jump out at you the cessation of motion the sudden quietness they are still the classic factors to give away the surprise they had planned finally the third factor is the actual denizen that is using the doll for the last year weve wondered what invisible tormentor was behind and in this film it is revealed while the revelation was incredibly creepy the actual look of the beast paled in creepiness to the doll yeah the make up and special effects are good and its hiding in the shadows helps add a little edge but one can see the aspects that inspired its creation what else does have to offer well the story is not that bad for writer dauberman has done a nice job tying in character development with the horror aspect of it however the plot of this genre has lost the ability to be unique and we have seen this tale told in previous movies though the ending is halfway decent as for the acting they did a good job for this film with wallis being the main star of the show wallis does a great job playing the wife driven to the point of delusion balancing her expected screams and whimpers with a decent dialogue she impressed me even more with her delivery of her lines the wavering voice a nice touch to emphasize the terror she faced is a decent prequel filled with the elements that made the conjuring the ride it was while the movie has been ruined by the trailers this reviewer would say to give this a shot again its not the best installment ive seen but it provides a good opening for the month of horror my scores for this movie are horror 75 movie overall 60,astonish
is a spin off movie from the conjuring not really a sequel it has no relation to the conjuring other than the doll itself ed and lorraine warren are referenced but they arent actually in the movie it focuses on a couple that is getting ready to have a baby and they are living next door to an older married couple that has an adult daughter thats run away and joined a cult at some point the daughter of the couple returns home and her and the other members of her cult do some very bad things and that leads to a demon possessed doll named the couple starts to experience mysterious goings on once theyre baby is born and theyve moved to a new home with the help of a priest and a friend alfre woodard they try everything to keep their family safe and get rid of the evil i really liked the actors and thought they did well with their roles i liked woodards performance a lot she was a very sentimental character a newfound friend of mia that helps them fight the demon wallis what a coincidence lol was very good as mia the new mother who is the first to notice these satanic occurrences i also thought that ward horton was convincing and a good pick to play the loving fatherhusband of the endangered family the movie has some genuinely frightening moments one of those moments being when mia sees the demon in human form that scene was scarier to me than anything in the conjuring or in the rest of i was scared more overall by this film than the conjuring if you like a good horror movie i suggest the ending is good too meaningful in a way 810,astonish
will make it short and concise oh wait imdb needs 10 fcking lines before i can actually submit it  so i will write the 10 fcking linesthis is one of the finest horror movies in a long time  does not over do things gripping cinema the direction is sharp  the cinematography is simplethe plot is will knit  the best thing is they are not trying to overachieve and this is what will sell this movie the current rating on imdb 61 does not do justice to the movie and i am sure bunch of sissies have given that i am sure this is not 10 on 10 but trust me that this is no less than 8 horror movies fans are in for a treat  go for it without a doubt  the most honest horror movie in a long timewell done james wanblunt as a knife reviewsrobbiiee,astonish
i really wanted to go see after seeing the trailer which made it seem like a good horror movie but it wasntthe movie tells too much in the first couple of minutes and then starts off at a really slow pace nothing much happened for the first hour or so there were a lot of missed opportunities where genuinely scary things could be done unfortunately the director choose not to do that instead he tries build tension and create a mood by having mia move around really slow which started to get annoying really fastthere were plot holes strange reactions from the characters in order to make the story work and so on in the theater i was watching there actually were a couple of times the audience spontaneously burst into laughter at how stupid what was happening on the screen was for me there were two scary scenes in the movie those who saw the movie probably know the ones im talking about and unfortunately even these scenes could have been made even more scary then they werethis was a story and a movie with a lot of potential unfortunately it wasnt as good as it could have beenisnt a complete waste of time but if youre looking for a really good scary horror movie its not for you,astonish
very very scary  the 2 nd scariest movie of all time right behind the exorcist  i dont get scared easily  i had seen hundreds of horror movies but this one really scared me  the basement elevator scene is the scariest movie scene of all time  im still shaken up by it  if you want to get scared than go see this movie  dont listen to people who havent even seen this movie  its genuinely scary and i can handle a lot  its about a doll that is possessed and wants to take the main characters child  her soul   it has some very intense scare scenes  i would say the best scare scenes ever filmed but the doll itself isnt scary at all ,astonish
seriously the young couple look like barbie and ken dolls hes handsome and boring and shes pretty and boring and so is this so called horror movieapart from the movie itself being boring and predictable the couple act moronically throughout the movie1 why would anybody want a creepy doll like annabell in the first place 2 after they move to an apartment after the first hauntings the doll is in a movingbox even though ken threw it away and barbie is not freaked out by this at all and decides to keep the doll 3 after barbie and ken and the clichpriest finds out that the doll is possessed by a demon they dont destroy the doll which would probably destroy the demon as well no barbie throws it around and yells at it and the priest takes the doll with him to his church where he is almost killed by the demon4 as for the exercising couple that is not even in the movie theyre boring as well and a franchise about that couple seems like a really bad idea5 the exercising couple keep the doll in a glass box to keep the demon trapped again destroy the doll and destroy the demon6 why did this movie get an rrating there is no blood in it no nudity no swearingapart from a few creepy scenes and only one good scare this movie isnt worth watching if you like horror movies with dolls and those movies certainly can be creepy i recommend dead silence directed by james wan that produced this garbage,astonish
quickie reviewmia wallis and john ward horton are a happy couple who survive a home invasion by two satanic cultists attempting to perform a ritualistic murder following the horrific events they start experiencing supernatural occurrences involving a doll owned by the couple let the horror begin or not is the clichd example of bad horror movies it is cheap in all respects cheap acting cheap story and most of all cheap scares avoid this movie unless you want to fall asleep like a baby which is obviously contradictory to this movies objectivefull reviewfor those who dont know is a prequelspinoff from the movie the conjuring directed by james wan the conjuring was a great horror movie that kept me up at night at least for a little while so i was more than looking forward to for a good scare this halloween season instead i was hugely disappointed and felt i wasted my timeusually with my reviews i start with the positives so here they are haunting creatures design is interesting and oh there is this one other freaky scene thats it thats all i gotthis movie was so bad that i felt like i was watching a parody of horror films this movie could have been called scary movie 29 and it wouldve made more sense but no we have so lets talk about the acting shall we now for horror movies i dont need oscar level acting of course not but they at least have to be functional enough to convey some kind of concern or fear instead the actors are more wooden than the doll we are supposed to be scared of this brings me to the scariness of the film or lack thereof there are literally two scenes that were genuinely creepy and unique but both of those combined comes to about a 1min in the total run time of the movie the rest of the scares are all horror clichs like staring long at the doll with creepy music or woman walks past a doorway or now its a little girl walking a past a doorway even the way they place the shots of the scenes are so obvious that you already looking at the spot you know the scare is supposed to come fromall in all this is just lazy filmmaking its as if they took a bucket filled it every basic horror trick and dumped it on the big screen i have litmus test for the effectiveness of these movies do i leave the lights on longer than i should before going to bed andor do i need to watch some comedy show episodes fails on both thats also considering i walked home alone in the dark because my bike was broken so if you looking for a good scary movie or even good movie in general avoid this at all costscheck out more on my movie review blog the stub collector httpthestubcollectorwordpresscom,astonish
its a prequel to the conjuring but i cant really comment on that cause i didnt see it if your hoping for a female version of chucky then youll be disappointed it does deliver a good ghost story perfectlythe two main leads perform there parts well i also like the 1970s look this film will make you jump youll be grabbing on the edge of your seat having the feeling like something creeping up on you is quite creepy here just looking at it will give you the shakes if you not in to that kind of movie then youll probably wont like this not a great but an entertaining film,astonish
i really loved because i loved the conjuring and i like the way horror movies have been coming up with wonderful ways to scare us lol i gave this movie a 8 out of 10 because i think that they couldve gotten some bigger screen actors or actresses to play in the movie i did jump like once which is extremely hard to get me to do so im happy a scary movie could do that for me the story line was great i will say i didnt really see anything bad about this movie i guess i just hoped to see some of the actors from the conjuring lol i know its a different movie and all plus i found out that was a raggedy ann doll not a porcline doll which is even creepier lol,astonish
i loved this movie i dragged my best friend with me who is terrified by scary movies and i jumped more than she didbut thats probably because she kept her head hidden most of the movie is the perfect creepy doll she doesnt even say anything yet shes still creepy as hell it was a slow moving scary movie  which makes this movie all the more scary i dont like movies where they throw blood and gore in your face thats too predictable this movie had all the pieces of the puzzle to connect both movies the conjuring and together i thought the part where the mother saw a little girl in the nursery and just as the door was closing the girl came running and flipped to a crazy girl in a bloody nightgown,astonish
look i mean how many horror sequelprequels have ever been good lets count dawn of the dead was good evil dead 2 was good and aliens was good three by my count but honestly these films are all over 25 years old and hollywood cant even get original horror movies right these days at least not often how on earth is a quick cash like going to be any way decentwell miraculously even if it doesnt compare to the films i already mentioned is a very smart clever horror film that manages to create a lot of suspense only bringing out the big scares after enough of it has been generated if youve seen the conjuring its comparable the films feels similar in style but somehow a lot tighter its been pared down quite a bit what that means is that a lot of the opulent almost overwhelming atmosphere of that film is gone and its missed if im honest but is instead replaced by shorter sharper shocks with a lot more focus on the main story and the characters who are unusually well defined and acted for a horror movie especially the two female leads for once these people dont act stupid and dont feel like stock horror movie victims  hurrayspeaking of the story its actually pretty decent im not going to ruin it but its engaging if not exactly amazing it does its job just well enough so that it feels like more than just an excuse to scare the audience or get a bit more mileage out of the titular doll from hell the scares are very well crafted one or two are a bit hammy but for the most part a lot of horror films could learn from this one one particularly masterful sequence involves an elevator and had the whole cinema holding their breath youll know it when you see it another part  totally unmentionable without spoiling but spectacularly creepy  pretty much raised the rooffilms like this arent ever made to be highart theyre made to get a specific reaction from an audience so when a film like this does come around and turns out to be well crafted and fun its a rare treat its not perfect but then i didnt need it to be to enjoy it if youre planning to go see it ignore the negative reviews its a treat,astonish
certainly doesnt reinvent the horror genre but its still an atmospheric diversified and gripping movie that quickly grabs your attention and will haunt you until the very end this movie has a better pace and no dull moments compared to the conjuring but its not as intense and scary as insidious for examplei like the fact that the movie includes a little bit more than the usual supernatural elements when the satanic cult members assassinate an old couple and attack the two main actors the movie quickly starts to be really gripping when a fire breaks out and menaces the pregnant main actress most viewers were also on the edges of their seats the haunting scene leading to and involving a stroller smashed by a truck is also very intense its a good thing that the entire movie doesnt only play at one location and only involves supernatural phenomenonsconvinces with its steadily growing sinister atmosphere a credible acting performance a solid camera work without any unnecessary shaking fitting sound effects and an atmospheric soundtrack this movie includes almost no blood and gore effects and no obvious special effects these elements make the scenario feel closer to some classic pioneer movies of the seventies the realistic tone of the film also makes the movie more intense and easier to get into for most peopleeven though the movie avoided a few stereotypes such as an exorcism some parts were still highly predictable the scared housewife nobody believes in the wicked demon trying to take possession of a childs innocent soul and the heroic actions of an old pastor attempting to save a young family and community members are elements that horror movie fans have seen numerous times before thats why the movie lacked some originality and ultimately tension towards the end as the ending was also quite predictablefans of traditional horror movies or more recent outputs by james wan and his colleagues should watch this movie at the cinema as they are likely to enjoy this film this movie isnt the best of the year but still a professionally executed and highly above average horror flick i still hope that the next movies made by the makers of the last few horror blockbusters are going to write a more courageous script for their next project,astonish
a demon possessed doll scares the bejesus out of everyone unfortunately it takes about an hour at first i thought i was watching a soap opera sappy acting nothing really going on we get a shot of the creepy doll from time to time the blank evil stare hell the damn doll doesnt even move it just sits there like its on valium it would be nice if the eyes would move or if the head would spin around show some razor teeth maybe flip off the camera come on and do something already the doll searches for a soul suspense ensues and the devil himself makes an appearance in a nutshell this is a female version of the chucky series however this doll is silent and for the most part doesnt move except in one scene opinions are like assholes everyone has one including me so take this with a grain of salt,astonish
i really love this movie its so creepy the doll is horrible sometimes i need closed my eyes the devil of this movie is the most creepy your eyes is so big and dark your face is sinister i jump many times of my chair the soundtrack is wonderful i wasnt expect which the movie was so demonic and terrible i recommend for the all fans of the horror movies the actress wallis act so good ive never see her in a horror movie and she makes a great work when i saw the doll i think how much she is ugly god have mercy of your soul is the slogan of the movie the priest tony amendola act better than the legend of zorro and the others movies who act in the conjuring the haunt is a horrible witch something more human in the the things are more scary and creepy with a mysterious demon with a black and creepy face,astonish
yeah so first of all i had high expectations for this movie but i tried to lower my expectations because reviews were bad so i liked it but nah it still disappointed me whyi hated how all the characters lacked common sense the female protagonists wallis acting was just plain awful i cannot withstand her bad acting because it made some scenes feel so lame there were many useless scenes to extend the running time of the movie that made it even worse ie the kids sitting on the stairs it really made me thought that there was something wrong with them but no after that scene they justvanished and i was like seriously no explanation for the subplot it was like a good subplot that had a lot of potential to get a backstory added into the movie but was just used to consume the running time because the only scene that made it worth watching was the elevator scene 510 im guess pretty generous for giving a 5 but it really deserves a 410 because of its mediocrity,astonish
just came back from the cinema and this is so far the worst horror movie iv seen i mean it started all good a nice story developed but as it was going on it was getting worse and worse it was getting such amateur low budget movie the story got all ruined and all the sound effects were trying to scare us but nothing special happenedvery disappointed such a good story just done wrongit is a perfect horror story but it was just so bad that i just wanted to leave the cinema early i am not recommending this movieall of you horror junkies will be disappointed after watching this one its a new 2014 movie but done very very bad,astonish
when you see films advertised from the producers of or from the makers of it means virtually nothing from the director or writer of is a different story all the other taglines just are discussing where the money comes from in other words james wans creative talent is absent from this attempt to make something of the story that opened the conjuring i think most everyone knows that the doll is more or less inanimate in the film which is a smart move after 3 decades of chucky walking around with knife in hand dolls have lost their ability to scare on their own so a back story of demon possession and such was brought into play wallis who plays the main character mia is an excellent actress  but in this role she is about as forgettable as they comeif you want to see wallis do some great work watch peaky blinders on netflix the third best tv show ever behind breaking bad and the wire i was not familiar with ward horton but thought he was good in the role of her husband the biggest name in the film is the talented alfre woodard who is wasted in what has to be the most illogical and poorly written character in the film she runs a bookstore that has lots of books about demons and the devil so you figure she may make the story a bit more interesting no such luck the writer manages to even waste that angle her fate is to be the centerpiece for the lousiest horror film finale in years her actions and fate are ridiculousthere is an obligatory priest that played by tony amendola that sets up a couple good scares and there are 3 or 4 times that you will probably jump but 2 or three of those scenes are in the trailer usually a reviewer will say of a weak film wait till it hits dvd but my recommendation for is if you want to waste you time on it pay to see it in the theater where the loud sounds and the big screen will deliver a couple good jolts if i had rented this film on dvd i would never have finished it there will be a conjuring 2 next year and like its predecessor it will probably be a great film but any similarity between this and the conjuring begins and ends with an inanimate doll,astonish
in santa monica california mia wallis and john gordon ward horton are happily married and mia is pregnant john is concluding the medical school and does not have much time to give attention to his beloved wife so he buys an ancient and rare doll named for her collection but soon their next door neighbors are attacked by two members of a satanic cult that break in their house and attack them after killing the neighbors mia and john are saved by the police officers and mia needs to rest until the delivery but there is a fire in their house and mia early delivers a baby girl leah the family moves to an apartment in pasadena but first mia throws the doll away in the garbage however she finds the doll in a box while unpacking things in her new home weird things happen to mia and she befriends evelyn alfre woodard who works in a bookstore and she learns about an evil cult that wants leahs soul when john and mia summons father perez tony amendola to help them with evil is stronger than the priest and he is sent injured to the hospital who may save leahs soul now is an unoriginal horror movie with an evil doll that is a sort of chucky with skirt the plot is creepy in few moments only and never engaging the story is weak but the performances and the cinematography are decent i had great expectations with this movie and the deception was also great but if the viewer sees this movie with less expectation he or she may enjoy some fright moments my vote is sixtitle brazil ,astonish
the conjuring was a fantastic and scary horror flick that pulled mainstream horror movies back up to scratch along with insidious there was genuine scares that stuck in your mind and had everyone talkingwith first introduced in the conjuring we are given more of a slow burning drama shot very much like its predecessor but not quite as scarythat said my husband refused to look at the screen more than enough because of the wonderful use of sounds and the site of the doll itself which i have since used to great effect at home when scaring himbut as a horror film maker and fan i want something that will scare the crap out of me and have me boasting about it long aftercarries a few of those moments but literally a few i dont want to go in to them for sake of giving anything away but one particular scene left me cold and was wonderfully executed alsoothers almost had the same effect but while i am hard to scare the husband had his head buried in my shoulder constantlywasnt bad but it wasnt great it works though and is worth the watch for some great jump moments and as a well made film a day later though and i have found that most of it is pretty forgettable,astonish
one of the least interesting horror movies ive watched im not even comparing this to the conjuringweak story line pathetic acting combined with inexperience of the filmmaker make this a complete timewaste where do you even find such actors  its a shame to call the actors  the female lead is horrible when it comes to performance she is just a good looking model  nothing more  im surprised how did she even land up with this role maybe through a godfather in industry such an important and impressive theme and she makes a mockery of all of it they have better actors and and a better story in porn movies ,astonish
it doesnt have james wans name on the directors chair but its every inch a james wan film there seems to be a rut that has emerged where this new brand of horror film makers cant see that recycling the same ideas is well kinda dullinsidious dead silence and the conjuring have their critics not me i like them all very much but the timing was right for them to hit the mark of many a horror film lover tapping into the fear of the doll and the demon hadnt been done for some time certainly not with any conviction so all good there for the fansspins off from the conjuring and dead silence to a degree but just comes off as a lazy cashcow the doll is a spooky monstrosity most unlike the real ragdollyanna version but its all a bit of a con the makers resorting to another demonic being only red darth maul has now been replaced by blue lagoon the looncharacters actions are often preposterous stretching credulity to breaking point i know you are being menaced by the unknown but i got a conference to go to sleep tight babe elsewhere while everyone acknowledges that what scares you is subjective but the scares here are very thin on the ground not helped by a dull script and bland lead actorsits tidy enough a production granted but familiarity breeds contempt and its hoped that wans return to the directors chair for the conjuring 2 where we revisit the realm of poltergeist activity signals a return to form for his horror stable 510,astonish
saw it on golden theater east java indonesia 10102014who exactly at least thats what the author wants to know when watching the movie it could have missed it but it did not fit the overall expectations story is nothing more frightening than the main movie the conjuring dolls recounted able to write a message or threatening the owner is not significantly visible in the film if i may guess figure dolls which quickly attracted public attention it feels it will not appear again in the conjuring 2 were prepared for broadcast next yearin this spinoff series this film brings the story of a couple john ward horton and mia wallis who is expecting her first child they live in a house with friendly neighborsin preparation for the birth of his son john gave a doll to mia which he had sought all along true it is the doll when it was new had already looks terrible surprisingly mia like the dolls and put it together with the other doll collectionthe situation changed when the neighbor who is also a husband and wife killed their children higgins told the missing and apparently chose to worship the devil with his boyfriend higgins and his boyfriend then attacked john and mia i like your dolls the words were spoken after injuring mia  however police immediately shot dead s boyfriend die while suicide and dripping blood into these dolls  i like this scene then i decide to write it pros   scary jumpscare  storyline is simple and easy to understand  basement scene and when there are small children ghost suddenly turned into an adult i swear i was surprised really  sound effect is pretty damn horrorcons   the films is too short i think  only 98 min  ending is horrible  the ghost in not even scary  except the black devil with horn ,astonish
this movie is very under rated and no it isnt perfect but this is a great prequel to the conjuring people went into this movie expecting james wans genius only to realize by the end that this isnt directed by james wan however the directer still did a great job the movie takes its time with getting you attached to the characters and you want them to survive the scares in this movie were much better than i expected but unfortunately the trailer spoiled a few of them returning to my summary the overall ratings and critics reviews are severely under rated i believe this happened because people saw and thought oooh the conjuring 2 the movie is not perfect but it was entertaining which is more than i can say for many another horrors i have seen and it was epic to find out the origins of ,astonish
im not even lying i genially was terrified in the pictures watching this i mean my heart must have physically come out my chest at least nine times apart from how jumpy the film is it just really gave me the chills in some scenes i was really hoping in my lifetime i never come across a doll like this apart from that i am now permanently paranoid that someone from the cult is out there im sleeping with the lights on anyway if i even get any sleep maybe im over reacting but this film was very jumpy and scary it was also enjoyable and is a good film with an ok plot the baby is also extremely adorable and the two parents are charming and you cant help but want them to over come this,astonish
i am going to keep this short and sweet if possible the movie has some goodscares first thing i noticed though is it takes a good 30min before anything really happens at all the director has no problem building his characters lol it has a conjuringinsidious feel to it but definitely not as scary go into the mind set that this movie will be good but nothing more i did not lose sleep over this like i did with insidious overall good scary moments and a decent plot line with some good acting go see it if your into scary movies if not definitely hold out for dvd my overall score is a 710 i would have liked it to have more scares and to not be as slow as it was,astonish
i have given much of my valuable time to the horror genre and i have viewed so many disappointments add to the list was facing two very stiff obstacles 1 it was following the very successful the conjuring2 scary doll movies had already been done see childs play and dead silence to name a couple not to mention other movies in which a creepy doll came into play such as poltergeist or countless other movies in which a doll turns its head or movesjust didnt deliver a husband buys his wife this doll as a gift to complete her set after a tragic event the doll becomes a conduit for evil this evil demon i guess marked that family and once marked it wouldnt leave them alonethe premise was real simple it just wasnt a good movie it wasnt horrible ive seen a lot worse it just wasnt good,astonish
yes the doll is just creepy as hell yes the performances are fine and its always a joy to see alfre woodard and yes there is some outstanding wanlike directorial technique as in the early attack scene framed through a background window and precisely the right number of seconds of the camera fixed on what goes wrong is basic logic sorry but it just kills me when this is sacrificed cmon now  the husband merely accepts that the doll he threw into the outdoor trashcan is now in a box sent over with the others the wifes remark that there was confusion because of the fireno the house didnt burn down and its a stretch to believe that a neighbor or fireman found the doll somehow in the garbage and made those efforts i realize its a minor point but these are the lapses that greatly weaken a horror film then one has to chuckle at a priest who believing in a as a demonic instrument blithely chucks her in the back seat worse though is the chase scene aspect to the final thrust its not that it doesnt work its that the road is just too too familiar i also had a problem with woodards sacrifice that is i dont quite get that her reason to live as revealed by her daughters loving spirit is to present her soul to the devil too bad a creepy doll flick deserves better,astonish
2014  wasllis ward horton tony amendola alfre woodard kerry omalley brian howe eric ladin very disappointing prequel to the conjuring giving the origin story of the titular possessed doll which depicts vanilla bland couple wallis and horton beginning their lives together with a baby on the way leading to echoes of rosemarys baby and an overactive sound track woodard actually looks beyond bored in a quick paycheck as the owner of a bookstore that specializes in the supernatural and has a personal risk at stakewhile cinematographerturneddirector john r leonetti takes the reins for the first time as helmsman from producer james wan the rote storyline by gary dauberman fails to keep a decent scare ratio nor a sizable body count as anticipated better off watching childs play or a true creep fest like the dummy from the twilight zone one genuine jolt does not make a sufficient thriller by any means,astonish
if you have seen the conjuring and enjoyed it then you will most likely enjoy in fact i preferred to the conjuring because it wasnt overrated which i felt the conjuring was most of the reviews for this film were negative so i went into it expecting it to be another clichd occasionaljumpscare type film that seems to be just like most modern horror films at the moment luckily it turns out these reviews were wrong and it turned out to be quite a good horror flick with some effective scare scenes there arent any well known actors in it but they actually do a decent job wallis was the best actor for me playing the lead role of miathere are some really cool original ideas to build the tension in this film my favourite being the elevator scene which really made you feel on edge ok there are some moments in the film that are a bit slow and sometimes they resort to a cheap jump scare if something hasnt happened in a while but overall delivers exactly what youd want from a prehalloween horror film dont watch this film expecting to see a perfect story line and amazing acting but do expect to see some pretty cool tense scenes and a decent scare now and then,astonish
is a very simple horror film that follows the doll from the film the conjuring while the conjuring was a powerhouse of a film seems like a quick cash grab from the producers and studio this film doesnt have the same feeling that directing icon james wan brings to his horror films while the film is not a total wash out it might not be for everyone the following is my review of the film was written by gary dauberman who is only known for his much smaller direct to home video horror films in you can clearly tell dauberman wasnt playing with a full deck of cards the story follows miawallis and johnward horton this young married couple is about to welcome their first child into the world when john brings mia a gift the gift is of course the doll from this point onward things start to go haywire for mia and her family the priest comes in and you have heard it all before nothing new or exciting at all the film holds pretty well together for the most part and moves by very quickly meaning it doesnt really drag on it spots while it clearly doesnt have the energy of a james wan horror film the pacing and characters work well overall of course characters as always in a horror film have to make questionable decisions but that is to be expected overall gary dauberman gets a barely passable grade for this filmthe film was directed by john r leonetti who was the cinematographer from the conjuring this is also the first major film he has directed in seventeen years this film relies mostly on jump scares to get the audience into this a seasoned horror fan like myself doesnt fall for that kind of gag other than the jump scares there is nothing that will make you scared of this film for a film that takes place in the late 1960s and early 1970s the film fits perfectly with nothing out of place fine detail that adds a great element to the film the conjuring takes the cake in that regard if you want to compare the two outings the acting just over average wallis and ward horton work very well together and the secondary actors fill other voids nicely for a genre that mostly offers up awful acting this film should be proud of delivering something that is not poor at the end of the day this film is simply filler until the next conjuring movie and leonetti took the paycheck as he knew it was going to be a giant success leonetti does a passable job with annnabelle but he is nowhere near the legend that is james wanthe film was scored by joseph bishara who not only scored the conjuring but also worked on the james wan film insidious and insidious 2 the score in this film is not as good overall as the conjuring but bishara still delivers some creepy music throughout the film to keep up the tension so overall bishara completes this spin off film with flying colorsin closing at the end of the day is a horror film that is meant to fill time before the conjuring 2 is released next year taking a character from that film and spinning into its own film was smart by the producers but it leaves an overall average feeling in my opinion fans of the genre will rush out to see this film on opening weekend much like i did others who may not be that into this genre or maybe didnt enjoy the conjuring should sit this one out a home video rental or stream is the best bet overall in my opinion5410,astonish
released in 2014 and directed by john r leonetti stars wallis  ward horton as a young couple in southern cal suburbia in the aftermath of the manson murders 19691970 the focus is on the former whos pregnant and gives birth in the first half meanwhile their house and later apartment is cursed and its somehow linked to their creepylooking vintage doll and a couple of mansonish occultists who invade their home in the first act tony amendola plays their priest while alfre woodard is on hand as a concerned book store owner this movie surprised me i thought it was going to be a silly killer doll flick like the childs play franchise but thats not the case while there are elements of a ghost story this is more a demon tale and the details to this effect are commendable the movies austere with a couple of genuinely scary episodes particularly the basementstairwell sequence the cgi monster is effectively realized and wisely not overdoneshows how the manson murders were the death knell of the peace  love counterculture movement hippies would never be viewed the same after the horrific tate murders of august 8 1969 the drugaddled woodstock took place just days later and it was indeed three days of peace  music but the altamont speedway free festival in early december less than four months later put the kibosh on the hippies idealism forever its a shame too as they had a hold of something real underneath their drugobsessed fog not that all hippies were druggies but it was certainly the norm if i may put forth a slice of personal philosophy this movie illustrates how demons are viewed as the epitome of what is scary in modern culture yet the bible shows them shrieking in horror at the mere sight of the mighty christ more than that they beg him not to torture them and throw their filthy backsides into the abyss read it for yourself in luke 82631 the movie runs 99 minutes and was shot in los angeles writer gary daubermangrade b,astonish
this film was tired and boring over the top over protective male lead nauseatingly over analysing his partners every move emotion tantrum etc as shes knocked up so hes in full on ott doctor mode in the first half all the time his whiny over protective wimp of a partner is just as annoying in my opinion i feel nothing for them which creates my first big dilemma as in a horror you kind of need to give some what of a dam what happens to your protagonists to feel unnerved and scared for them right the doll is kinda creepybut that is literally all this movie is droll and predictable i could pre guess every minute of it i know its based on experiences relating to the warrens but as i dont care for them i really was left feeling nothing at the end of this onei went into it expecting very little luckily so wasnt under any false illusions,astonish
i think that due to the sheer exhilaration that the conjuring brought forward it was going to be hard to make a sequelspinoff but was surprisingly okay the action started pretty quickly which is always good to keep a horror going the plot line was also very fluid and flowed nicely with the horror which made it feel more realistic as we get to see the characters wallis plays very well as the distressed mother as she can easily show her emotions from terror to surprised she gives it her all ward horton also portrays his character very well as i truly hate him for dismissing everything his wife says which im sure was very precalculated i also think that the film becomes more of a thriller near the end as the victim is the baby leah it truly makes my skin crawl to hear the screams of the baby and the scared shouts of the mother as a demon tries desperately to separate them the best scene in the whole film has to be when mia believes that she is attacking and hurting but it is actually another doll but for that split second we are lead to believe that it was leah she was throwing about on the whole it wasnt as disappointing as i thought it would be,astonish
is a surprisingly dull and boring horror movie its does nothing new relies entirely on jump scares which arent scary and has weak performances from everyone except tony amendola the worst in the conjuring franchise so far,astonish
lazy and heavy handed cashin that is admittedly a lot more dignified than the conjuring but it makes little sense and has no sense of finesse yes i did just use that worddoesnt really have much of a presence in it,astonish
is a spinoff of the 2013 hit the conjuring that film was so successful and critically acclaimed that you honestly cannot blame the producers for wanting to squeeze the formula like a lemon and exploit every possible side story or creepfactor that can be exploited as far as i remember the porcelain doll was simply a piece of eerie scenery in the original but barely one year later it thus received its very own and hyped fulllength feature film its certainly not a bad idea but they overlooked one small but important little detail the conjuring was directed by james wan and he just happens to be one of the most gifted young directors of the new millennium wan has an incredible eye for sinister atmosphere and all his horror films saw dead silence insidious the conjuring are intense  horrifying john r leonetti on the other hand is a decent cinematographer but a very mediocre director under his leadership is hardly more than a standard ghostmovie with predictable jumpmoments and lukewarm scares in 1970 in california john and mia live in a peaceful church community and are anxiously awaiting the birth of their first child the loving husband he is john managed to purchase a large porcelain doll for mias collection and it promptly receives an honoree place in the baby room shortly after members of a deranged satanic cult invade their home and one of them is shot dead by the police whilst holding the doll in her arms i reckon you can easily guess what happens next right although linked to the conjuring feels more reminiscent to the original childs play and one of the numerous movies about the crimes committed by the followers of charles manson in childs play prior to dying serial killer charles lee ray brad dourif transfers his soul into a toy doll via occult spells but here this seemingly happens automatically with the porcelain doll the crazed satanists are more than obviously modeled after the manson family members that murdered actress sharon tate and her friends there are a handful of noteworthy sequences but leonetti focuses too much on the spooky dolls face rather than on plot development even the best sequences are derivative like the little girls foreboding drawings and the climax is extremely unsatisfying who is this evelyn woman anyways,astonish
the avarage rating and the metacritic score for this movie is an example of how much horror is still the most underestimated genre in cinema and beyond this movie is an averegly good horror that rely a bit too much on cliches and ghost movements to build the mood but that is enough well shot well acted and well written to be enjoyable and fun in ten years we wont look back at this movie as a game changer but i will remember it like a fun movie isnt it enough to reach at least a 60 average or a 50 in metacritic score i think yes specially after i see on this website that horror masterpiece hardly reach 60 and that being part of marvel cinematic universe give a movie the right to at least a 70do me a favor before you give a vote to an horror movie stopfor a second thuink to your previous votes and ask yourself if you are being fair to the movie or just misjudging a genteto comment the movie i think is a nice add to the conjuring universeif this is the lowest entry as a lot of people say is the signal of how much quality despite the clear commercial intentions this movies are bringing on screen the movie look good and the plot even if not really original is a good mix of influences and is not boring or cringy some scenes are really creepy and some jump scares are really good yes jumpscares are not necessary a sin but the general atmosphere of the movie is not too much haunting so you will walk out of the cinema without paranoia and nigthmares if you dont sleep with dools in the room,astonish
is a clich formula horror film that they used to churn out every week in the 70s creepy in some parts intense in others  but the film falls apart because the center does not hold was based on the dolls cameo in the conjuring a much superior movie here they take the doll and ignore the true story the true story is much more scarier then the supposed back story the film makers here tried to present the case file of as written by the warrens sends shivers down your spine and gives you nightmares this movie not so much the acting is decent and the story is weak and actually as a whole really does not stand up to close scrutiny the conjuring does and thats why its a much better film here the director just does not know how to set up a decent fright and the writers did not know how to write a decent horror movie still if its halloween and the lights are low and you need to watch a horror film and this one is close at hand itll do thats not saying much i guess for a film that had all the makings for a much scarier film then what it gives us the only saving grace is that the acting is suitable and saves the film in some waysmy advice watch the conjuring instead,astonish
figured this would be just like the conjuring another tv14 movie put on the big screen with a slap of rated r on it the conjuring was so boring until last 5 minutes and still was nothing much at the end now this one considered sequel prequel which is not any better at all boring doll that doesnt move until the end wow do the directors know what scary is and the rating committee it seems like they hired a teenager to give should of been pg13 movies a rated r rating and say it is the scariest movie of the year awardi think they need to rehire the mpaa they have no clue what a rated r movie is anymore whats next nc17 as a rated r movie like rated r movies are starting to be like pg13 ones seriously this is getting pathetic i thought james wans movies were getting bad but this is bad as james wans well if you enjoy boring and not scary movies or think pg13 movies are scary then this one is for youi cant stand falsified ratings any more saying something is unrated and its actually like rated r and r like its pg13 is sad and pathetic and needs fixing badly were losing the good gore that is better than this boring no swearing no nudity no scares horror movies like thesei am not watching the conjuring 2 because the first one was so bad i could of fell asleep but i just sat there the whole movie saying when is it going to start never did until last 5 minutes and same with this moviei just cant say enough of how bad this and the conjuring was bad if they showed these on television like the other horror movies that get things cut out to not be shown these two would not have anything cut out it would be the whole thing shown because there is nothing to cut out that is bad enough to even bother anyonelike i said its like watching tv14 movie on the big screen,astonish
im a fan and i saw almost all types of horrors which were released until nowits a pity that i got fulled by the trailer in which it was referenced the conjuring movie in which was said that before conjuring was no way there is no way that this movie can be compared with the conjuring the actors are bad  the special effects are also bad  the action takes place in an old period  which is not even specified by the scenaristi can say that i saw also a lot of bad movies until now but this is on top i wouldnt recommend it to horror movie fans this is a waste of time i was not able to watch it until end this is how great it is ,astonish
i dont think horror is the actual genre for this movie it should be dramaromancemystery conjuring was far more better than total waste of time demons searching for soul and all aint horror all the horror part was used in the trailer nothing was left for moviefirst half was full of dramanothing interesting also people say this is the prequel of the conjuring i didnt get a connection to that because the doll was shown at the house of the couple at the end of the movie and had no link whatsoever with haunted house had high expectations was disappointed should have opted foe a sequel that would have been interesting something dealing with haunted house or possessed person ,astonish
a young couple in 1969 santa monica come into possession of a rather unpleasant doll just as their next door neighbours daughter and her boyfriend get involved in satanic slaughter a la charles manson said slaughtering involving our young protagonists the doll and the young mums pregnancythis load of old tosh is a prequel to last years the conjuring and purports to tell the story of the possessed doll which resides in a cabinet belonging to the paranormal investigators of the first film and which is actually a raggedy anne doll not the horrible thing they have hereif you are a fan of this sort of film you will either thoroughly enjoy it  it is atmospheric has its share of madeyoujump moments has adequate period detail and features a tense and believable central performance from wallis as beleaguered young mum mia  or you will be disappointed at the tramlines it runs along and the absence of any significant amounts of blood dismemberings satanic manifestations and gore generally while some of these are present they are understated this is more a movie concerned with impending dreadit passed the time adequately  in fact possible slightly more than adequately,astonish
when a movie like this is rated lower than the carrie remake you can be reassured that the people rating horror movies can no longer be taken as a credible source undoubtedly this movie possesses some fundamental issues with an average script and mediocre acting is by no means the best horror flick technically speaking does not measure up to the likes of the conjuring nonetheless the cinematography and direction are brilliant very much a wanesque style since the director of was the cinematographer for james wan additionally this has an elevator scene that is among the scariest of any of its contemporaries in the genre the film is truly terrifying at points if i could give it a 75 out of 10 i would it continues the recent upward trend in the 2010s revival of the horror genre definitely worth the watch directing 45 script 35 acting 25 cinematographyediting 55 scare factor 45overall 710,astonish
this is the supposed story behind the creepy doll within the glass case featured in last halloweens superior haunted house thriller the conjuring demonology experts ed and lorraine warren collect the cursed objects that inhabit or potentially exert demonic forces on their owners creating everything from hauntings to demonic possession this film is its worthy prequel but lacks the overall intensity and coherency of its predecessor as well as any appearances from ed or lorraine warren themselves the stage is well set for a horror film as this takes place in the 1970s during the infamous tatelabianca cult killings by the charles manson family which prompted homeowners to begin locking their doors at night due to the horrific crimes committed by satanic hippie cults in that time likable couple mia and john gordon are expecting their newborn baby any day when a frightening experience stirs their happy home cult members attack them in their house but are eventually brought down by police and one of the cult members holds mias new doll in her arms as time goes on the normal haunted house movie clichs and disturbances ensue and sympathetic mother mia must battle the demonic forces at hand this is ultimately a horror film depicting a poor new mother who seems to deal with a terrifying entity all on her own picture perfect husband is so positive that he is oblivious to the problem that plagues his wife and newborn baby obviously the doll is a conduit for the evil presence that is after mommys soul and uses her love for her child to get it its a solid premise that is muddled and overachieved by inconsistencies and strange decisionmaking mia decides to get rid of the doll for its sheer creepiness and after the doll mysteriously returns she decides out of the blue that she wants to keep it actions like these are never fully explained and a likable bookstore owner alfre woodard although an excellent character she provides the final answer that makes the ending seem rushed and pretentious overall after forgiving this film for its obvious flaws on a good note the doll is extremely creepy the movie is packed to the brim with startling moments a scary black demon creature and good performances that create genuine tension and paranoia make this an average halloween flick for 2014 you be the judge,astonish
if you havent already seen the movie please do not go i knew better than to open my mind to such a movie but for the thrill of a scare i went last night this movie is extremely sacrilegious it saddens me to know that millions of people who may not realize it are being deceived god warns us of false prophets be careful the media has a lot of subliminal messages out there for instance in the movieevil triumphs over gooda priest claims he does not know what to do to help a family this insults the power of godbut the problem ends up being solved by a woman who sacrifices her soul to the devilafter doing so the movie starts quoting scripture from the bible to say that this is the ultimate sacrifice and that jesus demonstrates this by sacrificing his life on the crossim sorry but that is trickery you do not win by sacrificing your soul to devilhe wins and thats what he wants and jesus did not sacrifice his soul to the devil either duh and yes i probably just spoiled the movie for some out there but to me i could not just sit here and be quiet about this this is disturbing how scripture was twisted to make people think that losing your soul to the devil is a way to win over evilim sickened also if you have not paid attention to several movies that have released in the past couple of years the time is now to start looking into it deeper movies such as the hunger games the purge the purge 2 the conjuring and a new one about the quija board coming outthese movies are the devils way of desensitizing the population to pure evil its normal and entertaining now to see murder demonsjust evil to me hunger games yes its a fantastic movie but its a clear warning of what is to comethe chip implanted in their arms a rich wealthy controlling govt with people who have nothing made to fight and to sacrifice innocent lives of children the purge pay attentionthe flowers they put in their yards that they support the purge but do not wish to participatesound familiar the passover blood over the doorways also a higher twisted govt in behind all of the evil doings the poor people being killed off first not only that this movie subliminally plants the seed that people may not realizemost of the people in the purge 2 that suffer are african american most of the people purgingkilling are whitethis instills racism in people fighting amongst races is not what god intends for us but seeing enough of this subliminally will corrupt the mind whether you want it to or not and for that reason it is important to know what not to subject yourself to if people are too caught up on fighting amongst each other and not coming together then we become blinded and miss the bigger pictureand lets face it we cant afford to do that as far as the conjuring ouijathese movies promote exactly what they are aboutsummoning spirits demons etc it frightens me that this has become entertainment its dangerous its not fun and gamesit is real god is real the devildemons are real if you entertain it act upon it you will get what you are looking for and that just might be the lose of an eternal life that god promises us im sorry this is so long but i had to take a minute to rant a little people wake up,astonish
ok reading lots of reviews  in this site  about the movie it seems  that many dont have clue  how to review a horror genre hmmm im sorry to say that  especially if im wrong but given that everyone  critic  has a different opinion and many views just screams bias for some reason maybe there is just some superexceeding political considerations what im not seeing  could be since im from finland and we here didnt fall this liberalism trap so easily contrast to so many other countries see maybe some of these critics watch little bit too much movies  if you know what i mean d if you really want to see horror you should watch a real life or history docs say like hellstorm or winter of fireoooor i could just direct you into latest isis or mexican cartel execution videook but this movie had 3 win and 6 nominations  also sequel was one of the most anticipated sequels of  this year  so i naturally expect the first one to be a success  and im happy to tell you this is success  and worth watching  in a right mode alone and lights of ,astonish
first a story  this past summer i helped a friend empty the contents of the home he grew up in to get it ready to put on the market tucked away in an upstairs box was a porcelain doll that a friend of his mother had made neither my friend his wife or their young daughter liked it much at the time going back about thirty five years ago so it stayed where it was retrieving the doll from the trash heap i hit upon a devilish idea right after my friend described the doll as the kind of creepy looking thing that winds up coming back after its gone living several states away and knowing it would be another week or so before my friend would be back home i called his wife and arranged to have the doll stashed somewhere he would find it and make his prediction come true when he finally got home and found it the stunt now ranks as one of the all time greatsthats part one part two occurred a couple weeks later when i went to see a movie one of the trailers was for and right off the bat ward hortons character walks in the house sees the doll and says paraphrasing  i thought i got rid of that thing so now the movies out and even though this isnt my usual cinema fare i was having one of those snakes on a plane moments and decided to catch it after work yesterday the thing is it was halloween and seemed made to order for this flick i made it to a 515 pm showing and quite strangely i was the only one in the theater im not really the superstitious type but once the nitty gritty stuff started occurring on screen i have to admit i looked around every now and then to make sure nothing was creeping up on meeven with that im not going out of my way to say this was a genre defining horror flick because it wasnt in fact it seemed rather clichd for the most part though it had some scary moments that even if youre prepared for make you jump involuntarily the creepiest was when the apparition of young rushed mia wallis theres a coincidence and turned into adult satanic before disintegrating into nothingness remarkably the film restrained itself from using the most obvious of horror clichs come on i know you expected the dolls eyes to move during every one of those long close ups right once the picture zeroes in on book shop evelyn alfre woodard and her story about the car crash that killed her daughter the ending became somewhat predictable the final fade had sort of that old twilight zone quality where the spirit of would find its way to the next unlucky owner and since i bring up the twilight zone its rather interesting that the writers might have borrowed from a rod serling script from a memorable season five episode of that series for the title of this picture in the story titled living doll actor telly savalas is menaced by his daughter christies new doll who taunts the abusive husband and father with comments like im talking tina and im going to kill you savalas character believes its his wife whos behind the talking doll gimmick the name of his wife being  ,astonish
the best part of watching horror films is the chilliness that will run down your spine  the curiosity to watch whathappens next  the excitement it builds pumping up your blood level gives an adrenaline rush to your body with few scary scenes and spooky moments only i wish  it could have been moremysterious things begins to fall on a couple once they move into the apartment sooner they seek help from the father of a nearby church offers to help them resolve the happenings and ward off the evil that is scaring their daughter to death first time director john r leonetti does a fine job  the story is mediocre along with loose screenplay i felt that there were some chilling moments in the film but not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat couple of scenes will give you a jilt  the scenes where evil starts unraveling on the family  the moment father enters the house and realizes the evil spirit latching on the family and finally the climax scene has been filmed brilliantly cinematography is good art direction is enduring editing is just about okay it is wallis who is the soul of the film she is fill of expression and gives in a great performance thoroughly supported by viola davisoverall  a spooky thriller which has some scary scenes to entertain you along with decent direction and outstanding performances decent 275  5,astonish
is a much anticipated prequel to the conjuring is about a cured object a doll regrettably all the build up for the movie just fizzles out what worked the first half of the movie was intriguing set in a safe white suburbia 1960s california where a couple is hit with a radical 60s cult incident shock hits the suburbia environment and the couples home an interesting slow burn begins with noises at night etc as the terror begins there was great build up regrettably the makers of did not know how to seal the deal a mysterious new friend arrives and a worried priest add new character development the new friend becomes a one dimensional character and the priests role fades out a scary build up but the ending and near ending parts of the movie fizzles the director and script writer did not know how to tie up the ending youre kidding that was my opinion with the ending someone always has to die in the end in a sappy clich ending way six out of ten scares,astonish
sighs just when you thought they were going in a positive direction in horror movies after the conjuring this is a biiiiiiiig step backwards james wan and leigh whannels involvement in this flick was limited to only as producers rather than screenwriters and directors as they did the conjuring yeah you can see the problem can youso the story a wife and husband are living in a house and the wife is pregnant and is only days away from giving birth suddenly the wife is attacked by crazy people who are part of a cult that are influenced by an evil force an evil force that seems to be coming fromyou guessed it the doll the mother then gives birth to their baby and as the doll stays with the family more and more supernatural incidents occuroh man where do i begin with this first of all thats not even what the doll looks like in real life google it and see what how inaccurate it is and the biggest problem of all these jump scares are so clichd and so predictable it is nowhere near entertaining in the least the characters arent even that interesting or not event that intelligent i know people have to be stupid in horror flicks but they are so dimwitted you cant get behind them especially the husband oh god he is so absent minded you just want to smack the hell out of him and yell get a clue and the design of the doll is so over exaggerated it comes off as corny and thats another problem they place the doll next to the crib of the baby and seeing how unnecessarily mind you creepy enough as it looks why would they place it next to their child no normal functioning person would find this doll charming or cute that thing is nightmare fuel and on another note the writing is awful really awful theres one scene where the wife just randomly says out loud whats going on like oh no theres got to be another way i have to find another way what is she narrating a comic bookthe film falls really hard because unlike the conjuring where they heavily relied on atmosphere to build up the suspense until the scare itself in a clever way they just throw in jump scares in your face over and over and theyre so repetitive its one of those scares when its a fakeout and then five seconds later bam it happens tired of it dont worry theres like 50 others to sit throughugh so yeah this is just another horror movie with nothing to offer nothing to be entertained by and nothing to remember the characters are idiots the script is clumsily written the scares are mundane and the plot is clichd to the bone you want a good scare read the actual stories behind they are actually really eerie so if youre looking for creativity and scary fun skip it and be more afraid of barbie dolls,astonish
after watching this low budget movie i felt i had been ripped off by the dollars ive paid to watch this not only is it boring the protagonist acting is sooo wooden more wooden than the ugly hideous doll there are sooo many loopholes and i am wondering why the couple just dont burn the doll and dance around the bonfire there were too many occasions in which mia failed to look after leah as one would expect a terrified mother to do the main character has no expressions of fear and why did she decide to keep the doll after it was found at the bottom of the box in her new place overall silly and lousy show please give me my money back,astonish
i have been waiting for this film to come out for a while and i was hoping it would be a good horror it came out today in the uk so me and my boyfriend went to see it in cinemas we were so disappointed i am the type that could jump at a door slamming unexpectedly but sadly this film didnt cause me to jump in the slightest in fact i cannot see how this film can be labelled as a horror admittedly the doll was freaky and would scare me if i came across it but the film kept trying to provide cheap thrillsthey could have made this film so scary if they wanted to the storyline slightly reminded me of the film chucky the only difference is is that chucky is actually good,astonish
it is glad to know that james wan is not directing the horror tale about this doll making the conjuring remains its unique style of horror and creepiness in this franchise it uses the same tactic to lure the audience to check in the cinema  the success of previous film but once it is presented on the big screen it is just a meaningless effort from a lazy screenwriters who combine the idea in paranormal activity and other horror genre most of the eerie and scary scenes are already in the trailer and the lack of creativity in the plot prove that the studio is trying to make fast money without realising that the film has a bigger potential to follow the success of the conjuring by taking more time to think of a better story for the doll although the ending actually links to the conjuring it is just a wasting time film that anyone who gets into the cinema just to be frightened by the scores composed and soon realise that it is much better to spend time rewatching child play at home,astonish
going into this film i had heard a lot of excitement from folks simply because it was a prequel to the conjuring and james wan was producing and john leonetti directing having not yet see the conjuring i can only remark on as a generic horror film  knowing very little about the actual events on which the story is based or how it fits into this grand lineage of recent horror films i should have known i was setting myself up for disappointment when the girl at the boxoffice said the box trolls was a scarier film and sadly after watching i wholeheartily agree with her was bad not in that paranormal activity way but it was about as boring and uninteresting being a seasoned fan of the horror genre ill admit i had reasonable expectations coming into this movie going off the trailer you have a creepy porcelain doll some apparent possession angle with demonsand a well established producerdirector in james wan saw the conjuring dead silence what followed for the next 98 minutes was just a pitiful attempt to mash so many elements from other more famous horror films together with something that resembled a storythe story or lack thereof is basically that mia and john are the clichd horror characters of a late 60s possession film that have all of their hopes and dreams set out before them mia is about to have a baby and john is about to start his residency to become a full fledged doctor john then gets mia a creepy doll and the horror shenanigans ensue supposedlyspecifically mia and johns neighbors are brutally murdered by satanic cultists and mia is subsequently stabbed in her pregnant belly by one of the attackers although the baby is fine the neighbors daughter one of the attackers ritualistically kills herself and her tormented soul is somehow swept into none other than the creepy doll john gave mia as a gift im really at a loss after reading some of the other reviews that are praising this movie for things like character development a suspenseful story genuine scares and being the perfect movie to start the halloween season this movie has none of that the story is horribly clichd and just tries to reinvent movies like poltergeist rosemarys baby the exorcist and paranormal activity into one as for character development you need actually need characters that you grow to care about that arent simply a bad caricature of someone thatd likely be in a horror film ie the doubting husband the occultfriendly neighbor etc i was just hoping that someone would have a gruesome death to distract me from twiddling my thumbs also if youre looking for a scary movie youve come to the wrong place there are a handful of jump scenes that are few and far between and none of them are anything more than gradual silence followed by a jolt of unnecessarily loud audio it was quite an annoyance to a few of the folks in the theatre that had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom read this and other reviews on the driveinzeppelin website,astonish
i love a good horror movie even some of the older cheesy ones but i actually hated the beginning had potential with the cult thing but then it just turned into the same horror movie that has been released over and over again in the last 5 years the story lines are always the exact same thing now  an object or person becomes possessed by a demon that wants to take a soul then you have the random noises in the house the opening and closing of doors the wife who gets tormented and the absent husband who isnt around that muchi could go on and on just the same old movie with another name this was clearly just a money grab based on the fact that the conjuring did so well  there was very little time or effort put into making this movie scary dont waste your money,astonish
predictablewhere you think the scare will comeit does anything remotely scary you already saw it in the trailernot much else worth jumping about pace sucksif you sit there thinking if i leave thats when this movie will turn around and i will miss outwrong when that urge hits get the hell up and rolli couldve saved me 30 minutes of continued disappointment ughdoesnt even come close to the conjurings scaresim baffled at that 5m dollar budgetreally 5m to throw a doll on a shelf and a rocker and film closeups of it doing absolutely nothing and to add insult to injury the audience i sat with were awesomely rowdy and ready from the moment we entered the theatrewhat a let down,astonish
it was a very disappointing experience i went to the cinema havent gone there for a long time and i was very excited to see after seeing the conjuring the movie lacks a consistent story or script the only thing that could scare you are the sounds nothing more i like to watch a good scary movie with a nice or at least plausible or appealing story the story behind this doll and all that demons stuff does not make sense even for a terror moviefell really short of expectations i am still thinking about the time and money spent on this whole movie experience,astonish
i dont really understand some of the negative reviews its one of the best horror films that ive seen for a while some bits will terrify you and leave you frightened even after you have left the cinema from the moment you see the doll you can tell it is evil and to be feared however the story and story development are not as good as the conjuring but it contains much more jump scares and scary moments unfortunately though you are left with a few unanswered questions after watching definitely worth a watch though even if you havent seen the conjuring yet but be warnedthere were lots of people screaming in the cinema when i watched 810 a great horror film just in time for halloween,astonish
ok going into this movie i knew that it was very likely for this movie to be a failure and guess what it was an extremely boring movie that barely made me jump and lost a lot of the creepiness from the conjuring the acting is just so plain and bland just like the scares the movie doesnt even actually explain everything that is going on in a manner that makes sense theres demons and then a grayish looking creature and a lot of it isnt explained its like the director just said put this in there and this and this the ending isnt satisfying either there is no reason to go pay for this movie seriously dont waste your money wait until it comes out on bluray or something the writing was also very odd at times with anabelle youre left with a bad taste in your mouth,astonish
i love conjuring movie so went to see screening stayed 1 hour in line to get in and was super exited but this was horrible movie almost nothing happen in a movie beside showing how much they love each other then in the next half stupid  stupid scare and the end cant tell u how stupid it was just pure awful i hated how they ruined the conjuring sequel this is stupid why it wont let me finish my review here and want me to type 10 lines i got nothing else to say about this movie beside its horrible wow still wont let me post comeon so i am gonna copy paste the last three lines i got nothing else to say about this movie beside its horrible wow still wont let me post comeon so i am gonna copy paste the last three lines,astonish
just a bad copy of horror movie the script and everything is this movie is not new at all just didnt understand the reason why the company should spend so much money for such repetitive subjects the actor are supposed to be more scared and realistic in the same timebut they look just blocked and no emotional at all there are also some other points of script that are not easy to understand and i perceived the further scene because of the same subject i have seen in other horror movies did the fantasy die in the script the additional role of the library woman is not necessary however she enters in acting so immediately without any strong reason of communication it looks she knows and sometimes she doesnt know what is happening with mia strange and confused acting,astonish
having the doll do absolutely nothing must have saved them a lot of money there are so many close ups and camera panning towards the doll and all that to see her do a big nothing after the third time panning towards her face there should be a running bet maybe she will blink or sneer or maybe do the macarena really i would like that because the macarena scares the beep out of me old people swinging their hips thats like inviting death to dance with youthen they throw a generic looking demon with a very familiar face and horns i could have sworn ive seen that demonic face somewhere whats that movie starring harry potter but with horns and guess what hes moving the doll all over that is a spoiler that shows how the doll is able to levitate the movie just gave us a spoiler can we sue them so if there is a sequel and the doll starts floating around and doing the backstroke there must be a stage guy there doing the work just dress him up as a demon so he will look like part of the movie rightand the actors were not able to save the movie even if they wanted to wooden acting blank facial expressions we have cookie cutter ken and barbie in a perfect life and whats more perfect when they meet the first stranger in the movie who became a friend and this new friend is willing to sacrifice her life for the white barbie because she feels guilty about her own daughters death oh yeah the strangerturned friendturned willing sacrificeturned soul now belonged to the devil is black so check that list and there aint gonna be any mother daughter reunion there you know its a totally different zip code im sure wherever the daughter is shes shaking her head thinking thats not what i meant you are supposed to do mom you could pray more for my soul that would actually help and do some charity work or something not give your bloody soul to the devilback to ken and barbie could you act a little bit more distraught when you thought your baby is lying dead on the floor instead of smothering him in your chest possibly killing him in the process shouldnt the first thing you do is check his pulse give cpr and then maybe at the same time realize that you are french kissing a freaking doll and ken you have perfect hair the perfect job and i love a doctor who spent his time sleeping beside a patients bed and who didnt think that ken and barbie had the worst reaction time in history did you count how many seconds it took for any of them to react when they hear something how many seconds did it take for ken to stop and think and think again when he hears his wife scream can someone take his soul please oh wait he would take too long at the window to jump probably couldnt figure out if he should land on the front or back which would be prettier barbie didnt disappoint at the window scene she took long enough for black stranger to form a crazy idea in her head barbie is probably hoping for that let the strangerturned friendturned willing sacrifice do the jump maybe barbie is smarter than we realizeoverall not worth to be included in any horror list best buried and forgotten or in hollywood terms rebootedps they started the movie interviewing the 2 girls who had the doll shouldnt the movie be about them,astonish
thoroughly enjoyed the film it entertained and kept me watching the late sixties setting and manson occult throwback is a breath of fresh air and helps show the different faces of horror as not all neatly fitting into the haters box of gore porn the suspenseful build ups and scares are often nothing new but the film successfully keeps its atmosphere throughout though not being blown away it is a very well made movie and a fine prequel to the conjuring too much of the conjuring was given away in the trailers the trailers for i ignored intentionally and because of this a few of the scares jolted me here and there the film also isnt what many expected or wanted it to be for other reasons hi im chucky wanna play,astonish
theres a young couple a new house a spooky doll who on earth would want to collect that anyway mysterious black lady from a dusty bookstore and the priest weve seen all that before however it is nicely done so one cant complain too much about the picture this movie will scare you if you watch it in a cinema the sound huge screen and lots of girly shrieks create tension and dark mood all that aside and the movie lacks i didnt quite catch the connection of the satanists to annabell why the scene of a crazy attack at the pregnant woman why the bookstore lady condemns her soul surely knowing that will keep her away from her deceased daughter why wouldnt the woman and her baby move out of the spooky apartment maybe into a church or somewhere safer this and many other plot mishaps make this movie less enjoyable it has some good ideas dialogues and believable acting but all in all it could have been better as said before if you go and see it in a cinema on a night out with a bunch of friends you wont be disappointed but when you start analysing this filmno just dont analyse it curious if theyre making a sequel though,astonish
this terror film is not spectacular but is very effective the filmmakers certainly know how to play well all the audience buttons john and mia are a young white couple living in the los angeles area in the late 1960s john ward horton is an upcoming doctor her blonde wife mia is a homemaker and is expecting her first child well played by wallis who is in fact english everything seems to going well for them one day after they settle in their new suburban home john gives mia as a present an over sized doll very soon creepy sinister things will start happening to themthis is a sort of prequel of a well regarded horror movie i havent seen called the conjuring but there are also references to many previous horror movies like chucky only instead of a he doll we have a she doll the exorcist the family soon gets the help of a priest that is an expert in fighting demons and rosemarys baby mia whose name almost certainly wasnt chosen by chance is heavily pregnant in fact rosemarys baby is not the only reference to its director roman polanski soon the couple will become victims of a mansonstyle family and in one part of the movie she is seen watching a tv news item about the real charles manson john leonetti directed also with alfre woodward playing the noble black character,astonish
it seemed inevitable with the success of the conjuring that a sequel would be in the works it also seemed inevitable after they focused on the incredibly creepy doll in the showcase that they would explore that more did it need to be probably not but they saw dollar signs and potential and now we have the film isnt a total loss but its also far different than the conjuring james wan is currently a horror film leader and he goes straight from getting under your skin he doesnt need terrifying gore or jump tactics to tell a genuinely creepy story goes in a different direction it does try to set that tone of being disturbing and creepy but also features some really nasty gory scenes that made me cringe and for the most part it works for this film i certainly recommend caution from any soontobe parents as the film mixes elements of the exorcist and the omen with a lot of horrible things happening to a very pregnant mother and then a new mother after the child is born the conjuring for me wasnt amazing but it was very good and it established some good groundwork builds on the world but at the same time does nothing to truly impress the dolls background is lacklustre the kills are done mostly in the shadows and you never really see in action this isnt a chucky movie thats for sure and if the two ever went up against each otherchucky would destroy herthe cast much like the conjuring is quite good and definitely makes an okay script just a little better wallis who i thought the entire time i was watching the film was dianne agron was very good as the expectant mother she was a solid scream queen and definitely brought a realism and intensity to her role ward horton who plays her beloved husband is also decent he is sort of hit and miss in the role because sometimes he is playing it almost campy and then in the next moment he is much better so he isnt as strong as wallis but they are good together and he plays the role well tony amendola is very good as their local priest who plays a bigger part in the story towards the end his character is painfully predictable and stereotypical but necessary for this type of film and he does well at it alfre woodard is decent as a concerned neighbour who befriends our heroine her character is left a little underdeveloped and her presence is not entirely understood and feels a little forced but she is still good in the roles entire problem is that while it scares and makes your cringe it could have been fantastic instead its just okay its all things weve seen before so that makes it just a little bit stale but on top of that it isnt a very well polished script it feels like they had a lot of ideas and they crammed too many of them in at once fortunately for them those ideas work pretty well the setting of the apartment complex fits perfectly and there are certain camera angles and scenes that are shot very well and definitely make your skin crawl the scene of mia our heroine in the basement with the demon was particularly well done once again i wonder why they put a high profile film in the hands of someone who doesnt have a lot of directorial experience john leonettis experience behind the camera is mostly with low budget straight to video and yet here he is taking this on still he shows some definitive style though i think its mostly lifted from previous james wan films is good and fun but they really drop the ball on creating a worthy horror icon despite a few good scenes it ends up being average and mostly forgettable i have high hopes for the conjuring 2 710,astonish
i enjoyed maybe because i was keeping my expectations really low after the disappointment the conjuring was to me a basic possessionexorcism flick completely unoriginalis a slow paced movie that builds up tension only to let you sigh in relief when the actual scare doesnt get to happen this may not appeal to everyone but it worked wonders for me there are many scenes in which youre grasping your chair thinking this is totally going to happen and then it doesnt there are only 3 or 4 real jump scares in the movie some of which shown in trailers which is bad the end result a nonpredictable plot loaded with tension and creepiness the only flaw in for me was the lack of a truly horrifying image that would burn itself into our minds and give us nightmares for me that is an essential element to create an excellent horror movieall in all is an entertaining scary movie it doesnt make you jump every 5 minutes but lets you get familiar with the characters before starting to put them through hell and thats what i look for in horror characters i can empathize with and not wish they die alreadyspoilers from here onyes the demon was creepy but didnt have enough time or visibility on screen which may be good because he could look silly and ruin everything apart from it there were two main disturbing moments for me the elevatorstairs sequence that impotence feeling of having no way out was great and the babyhitting sequence that made me sick the doll never actually moves on her own that is and this was also a positive point for me i guess people were expecting chuckylike moves but the fact they chose to leave it out only added suspense to the movie i was always waiting for the doll to suddenly jerk her head or something but nope they didnt go down that easy scare inducing road now the ending was a little too fast for me though that ladys decision to jump out the window was a little light she was there and next thing you know shes out the window maybe they could have worked that scene a little better,astonish
i hated this film wallis can not act to save her life and  should retire from the film industry immediately could you of acted  any more pathetic and wooden love i guess as long as your good looks  gets you film roles youve got a good thing going havent you and the  fact youre the niece of richard harris nepotism is alive and well in  the industry  onto the filmutter garbage call an ambulance yeh dont tell her  to call the cops youve only just gone round your neighbours and the  guy has only just stabbed his wife   i cant even be bothered to fully critique this film it just doesnt  deserve it it is so utterly predictable and infuriating to watch it  doesnt deserve anyones time let alone money it is pure drivel from  start to finish  this is a cash in film made foryou guessed it stealing your money  and patience  dont believe me go right ahead and watch this sad excuse of a film  and tell me how you feel afterwards,astonish
this is only a small review about but the movie will never deserve more than that overall this film is about satanic cultists that invaded the home of a family and the upcoming problems with a cursed doll now youll maybe think that this will only be the tip of the iceberg but no you could easily sum up everything in another sentence this movie contains only two sense that fit into the horror genre all the remaining 90 min you will only sit there in the hope that there will be more than that but no there isnt anything i couldnt even say what the rest of the film is about beside boring unnecessary talks between the charactersthe acting is quiet okay specially the role of the mother was believable all the other things like the pacing or closeups on the doll are more than bad and destroying every horror aspect the movie could build upi could write more but i dont want to i just want to forget this waste of time and move on with gone girl ps sorry for my writing skill its not my native language but i will try to improve this anything beside the fact is your opinion,astonish
2014 starringwallis ward horton alfre woodard eric ladin tony amendola brian howe kerry omalley ivar brogger geoff wehner and gabriel batemen directed byjohn r leonetti review o sweet a creepy doll movie thats a prequel to the conjuring one of my favorite horror films i mean what could go wrong holy crap was this the most disappointing horror movie ive seen since the nightmare on elm street remake and seed of chucky this film revolves around a woman who is being haunted by the evil spirit of a woman named that has possessed her doll and wishes to take her newborns soul it opens with the same opening as the conjuring and you can hear ed warrens voice talking to a victim of the dolls evil deeds the film then cuts to what supposedly happened before those events occurred before but i felt like their a lot of unanswered questions like how did they end up with the doll the woman played terribly by wallis says it disappeared at the end so she could not have been the one to lock it up and leave it for her daughter the father named john who is portrayed even more terribly by ward horton doesnt serve diddly crap hes just there cant act and i dont like him the one plays the pries however i actually liked him i dont know i guess i have weakness for priests in this kinds of movies the visuals are kind of cool i mean there the best things about this movie which can me kind of suspect that the director is only good with visuals and not storytelling cause the story just left me with questions that i would suspect answered in this movie the one cool thing is when you see the doll movie cause man that is one ugly creepy looking doll the ending piste me off a bit cause it felt like the first three chucky movies but only with a baby and the doll not even almost succeeding or at least i dont think it was close to succeeding is a film that i saw no trailers or commercials for cause i had high hopes but those hopes went down the drain but had some nice visuals so im giving a two out of 10,astonish
i was never a big fan of horror films i always found them boring and hoping for a jump scare so mum and i pick this movie i thought it was going to be another boring horror film but i kinda of liked it yes it does have some terrifying scenes in it which scared me so baldy but this is what horror films are suspend to be about having jump scares i would give this movie an 810 in my book but the demmon was scary looking that i could not sleep so i diced to give this movie a 710 instead just to be honest and truthful which is what i am trying to bed its a good horror film and one of the better horror films i have seen in a while 710,astonish
this is just a painful horror movie to watch everything has been done wrong in here and i mean everything they ripoff stuff from other horror movies like with the popcorn scene scream or they just talk and talk and talk and talk and it is just so boring that i thought i will fall asleep watching thisthere is only one good scene where i god a shiver at one point is mia talking to girl anabelle through another room and as the door starts to close the girl runs towards her and enters her room as the dead adult that is the only good scene in hereothervise  very predictable really boring there is no drive or atmosphere or anythingi just hate this movie,astonish
i honestly thought was going to be a lot worse than it actually was granted its not the best horror film ive seen but it had a lot better scares than ive seen in a lot of recent films in the genrethe story and acting in is nothing to sing about the story pulls a lot of clichs from the genre but it works for what it needs to be the acting too isnt terrible and the best way to describe the cast and their performances is passable no one was terrible but no one was particularly memorable either the one thing that stood out for me with this one was the scaresseemed like it refused to rest on a single scare type and the variety made for a film that definitely made me jump at times and give me goose bumps during other times the film does a great job of using light and dark is capable of making very scary day time sequences a rarity in the world of horror is not afraid to use subtle terrors or make use of the background and has jump scares that are a world away from your typical generic jump scares that pollute up too many scary flicks while the film isnt the most terrifying thing ive seen i did realize that a lot more care was taken with the scary parts than i had predicted and it made for a decent horror filmisnt going to be one of the greats on my list of favorite horror films but the film definitely was more entertaining and much creepier than i had prepared myself for its not great but it surely wasnt terrible in my opinionhello the name is rev ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants ramblings bad jokes geek references and other movie reviews like a more indepth look at and other films that just fart out their scares you can visit my blog at revronmoviesblogspotcom if you dont want to do that because you have a pound of bacon that aint going to eat itself you dont need to visit,astonish
was fun to watch if not being particularly scary nor breaking any new ground while i have never seen rosemarys baby i instantly knew some key references in this movie the young newly weds expecting a baby a satanic cult on a rampage funny things going about etc theres very little explanation to all the super natural occurrences through out the movie except that they are pure evil but why why summon pure evil to whose benefit who wants vengeance why things happen to this particular couple little details that couldve given the movie more weight in the plot department are left to the audiences imagination although the movie avoids for the most part cheap ploys like the doll moving its eyes or going completely chucky it still leaves a feeling of deja vu the sort of seen that being there before and seen it much better realized kind of feeling the acting also feels stiff i dont know if it was intentional or what but for a loving mother like mia she feels cold and distant maybe this movie was a homage to that roman polansky classic and my feelings are that rosemarys baby will probably be a more satisfying film next,astonish
it was a gift from my mom for my birthday i dont know where she got it we are beyond terrified mia wallis and ward horton are about to have a baby and are very happy when ward bring home a doll that mia has been wanting she is excited and has the perfect place for it little by little strange things begin to happen and mia thinks that the doll is the cause when the true intentions of are revealed it changes everything as many of you know by now it takes a lot to scare me most horror movies i find either boring or comedic the last one that made me feel uncomfortable was the conjuring being that this is the prequel to that one i was looking forward to this i will admit that this one scared me more than that one this one is very psychological and doesnt have to rely on over the top jump scares or gore to get to you this is also not cartoonish like the childs play movies this one has a real story and you get invested in the characters which makes the horror aspect work that much better horror fans will love this one but if you are easily scared i would avoid this overall creepy and unsettling all the things a good horror movie should be i give this an a,astonish
right when i saw the trailer of i reminded myself of how much i enjoyed the conjuring but when i realised the film wasnt directed by james wan i had a bad feeling i mean the idea for the prequel had a lot of potential knowing where came from was pretty interesting and could of been presented much better than it actually was in the filmthe start of the film is okay the scene of murder was pretty good intense but then it just got worse and worse it was slowpaced and just a bit boring ignoring the fact that someone actually fell asleep in the cinema and started snoring there was definitely not enough of the jumpy moments finally after we see first few paranormal occurrences which still were not great the film catches a bit of tempothen the film goes on the main protagonist mia researches about the cult etc what they always do the actual demon itself looks creepy so fair play to the directors for that but overall the film finished rather abruptlyi was expecting a lot more of after seeing conjuring or insidious but for me it was just a bit too boring and too normal610,astonish
i dont why nobody pay enough money for horror movies,astonish
the only satanic rituals going on in this movie are the producers praying to satan for box office returnsthe movie follows soon to be parents mia wallis and john ward horton who live in the quiet suburbs and are regular church goers john gifts his wife mia with a collectable doll she has always wanted but after there home is invaded by violent satanic cultists which ends with one of them dieing with the doll in there hands strange things start happening around mia as she starts to see things and believes she is being haunted and the demon wants her babys soulwell shot and directed with the usual creepy music and dark atmosphere with a few jump scares thrown in but sadly most of the movie is made up of boring and uninteresting dialogue exposition and church goingsi recommend watching this movie once if you have any interest in the character but just be aware that this movie is nowhere near as good as the conjuring movies and is just a quick cash grab nothing more,astonish
enjoyable horror flick that was pretty creepy and suspenseful with some good jump scares 1 viewing,astonish
probably my least favorite of the 3 but i actually love this movie why do people hate this movie with a passion they say that it is not that scary but it has one of the most terrifying jump scares i have ever seen when the demon jumps down from the ceiling also the sequence down in the storage facility at the apartments is so scary,astonish
the last 10 mins are the only minutes worth watching,astonish
woooowgood horror moviei like iti feel worriedsuspense,astonish
boring and predictable played the everyone thinks the protagonist is crazy until its too late card to death the acting wasnt horrible as everyone did a swell job but oh my goodness this film was just horrendously predictable which absolutely destroyed any possible chance of entertaining anyone in the room,astonish
oh god after watching the conjuring i was going into this movie not expecting what the magic that movie pulled off but i sure as hell was expecting at least a movie with something to bring to the table this film is very boring dull and uninteresting the beginning is ehh once things go crazy in the beginning it was pretty thrilling but after that its just a huge mixed bag with overall bad qualities literally so many of the horror this film tries so hard to rely on is closeup shots of with the music then it cuts its annoying and overtime it gets tiring and very repetitive this film has one of the most dumbest third acts ive seen in a horror movie third acts can make or break the film this film was already broken from the start but it fell even harder dialogue was bad so many things were bad theres a scene in the basement that i found pretty thrilling but other than that this movie is dog crapacting 710script 310dialogue 210screenplay 310cinematography 710music 710effects 610plot 210overall this was a huge let down i dont expect anything special coming out of this conjuring universe after this i knew it was too good to be true this film is lacking in everything in the horror movie department and the things it does bring to the table dont even mean anything very huge let down terrible,astonish
but doing it all badthe acting is quite awful she protagonist wallis is ok being nice while he coprotagonist ward horton is awful and she evelyn  alfre woodard is just pathetic while he father perez tony amendola has a small role and is finethe story is a mix rosemarys baby with the conjuringinsidious style and sparkles of the exorcist plus chuky or something like thatbut thats not the problem the problem is that nothing works terrible dialogue uninteresting characters few and bad jumpscares poor spooky atmosphere inconsistent diabolical powers bad symbolismi dont know i really didnt like any of itthey do have a couple of great sequences though thats something i guess,astonish
to put it simply if you are affected by jump scares freaked out by the paranormal and cant suspense in horror movies then this film will probably scare you but if not then you might think less of it ive noticed a lot of negative reviews on this film but if im honest with you i actually find this film quite frightening and if you have a phobia of dolls like i do then you will most likely be frightened by it too either way its definitely worth watching so get it on dvd its only a few quid and enjoy yourself,astonish
you learn quick a spirit is attached to the doll and its not the ugly doll itself lol i disagree with any negative critique of this film it had a great plot scary as hell and i enjoyed the actors a lot part 2 really explained so much and 3 really brings it home must see,astonish
as a prequel and spinoff of the conjuring  2013s highly effective horror film  does what it promises even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time but thats all you get jumpy scenes done to perfection with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusionone of the most important aspects of the conjuring and older sibling insidious both films directed by james wan is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewers peripheral vision by this i am referring to events occurring offcenter or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to onscreen characters but very obvious to the viewer consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby the scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house without shifting focus from the mother and child we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind something that shouldnt be there in the first place while this tactic is nothing new to horrorthrillers it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread thick and slow before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later the scariest scenes in are made up of these moments and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners and is probably why cinematographer john r leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film while wan himself is bumped up to producer leonetti plays it safe by treading down wans beaten path but without any surprises of his ownplaying the aforementioned mother is wallis freaky coincidence as mia gordon mia has a doll collection one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband john ward horton after surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult the gordons have new guests that wont leave at first mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while john begins to doubt her sanity its a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies it takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through iton one hand the look and feel in this film is a copypaste version of insidious but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright weve seen it before in classic horror films  young parents who must literally go through hell to save their childs soul its the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film like a stern disciple leonetti is on par with wans technical approach cinematography hair raising sound design including deliberate moments without sound and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience but thats about it on the downside there isnt much of a story for a script based on real events and dont even expect anything along the lines of an animated hucky doll its not about what the doll can do but about whats in the doll if only they had built on that frame of thought after some welltimed jump scares in the first half all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap,astonish
id heard that this film was bad but with the new film approaching i decided to watch it anyway and catch up on the one film in the conjuring franchise that i hadnt seenthe production quality as is the case with the whole franchise is great isnt a poorly made film its downfall comes from the slow plot that being said though i understand what the writers were trying to do they are trying to root this film in reality the climatic scare moment when levitates isnt scary on screen but if you take a step back and think about what it would be like in real life it would be terrifyingunfortunately thats not enough to elevate this film to the level of others in the franchise but its certainly not as bad as i was lead to believe,astonish
after the conjuring movies i was really looking forward to this one but wow this was so bad not even a little scary i should have expected it to be bad though theres nothing scary or believable about a killerhaunted doll even with all the scary makeup for the evil doll look how this got two sequels is beyond me people must have poor taste in horror these days,astonish
a welcomed spinoff to the conjuring considering its subplot involving the titular wretched doll certainly terrified many if only it was handed to a more experienced director leonetti who helmed such masterpieces like mortal kombat annihilation and the butterfly effect 2 falls trap to the many pitfalls that plague lowbudget horrors gone are the stylish suspense driven camera techniques that wan confidently possessed now replaced by lacklustre direction with two featureless leads and a secondrate script no wonder looks worse for wear bless her a husband grants his wife a collectible doll which is soon possessed by a demonic presence summoned by devil worshippers who raid their home and attempt to attack thema few terrifying scares that prove to be somewhat effective notably the storage floor sequence and the introductory home invasion scene which illicit one or two satisfactory jump scares a demons face barging its way to the front of the camera did nearly force me to change my underwear yet despite the promising horror aspects no matter how infrequent they were the story with its repetitious slow pacing and mundane dialogue was enough to make anyone fall asleep cuddling the titular doll tightly dreaming the words please just end it end it now wallis was insufferably boring with her constant whining and screaming succumbing to the outdated distressed damsel trope that i can only assume she was hired just for her forename horton was just as bad portraying the most useless husband possible but its fine because he just kept smilingthe plot itself lacked any mystery or suspense mostly due to the way it was structured it revealed all the details within the first act only to then conclude with an impeccably dumb soul trade thing that really made no sense but by then i didnt care the quality rapidly degraded as the runtime continued on almost resembling a cheap dollhouse for to reside in to date it is the worst conjuring universe film,astonish
having been a huge skeptic of this genre it took a lot of nagging to get me to watch the conjuring 12 to my surprise i found these to be highly interesting good suspense a few decent scares and some characters to actually care aboutthat of course let me to which unfortunately is a return to form for the genre relying on bad attempts at jump scares a weak uninteresting back story for some very annoying characters youre hoping the demonghost will dispatch of quicklyfilled with dialog my 6 year old could spice up acting the same 6 year old probably wouldnt buy and we have a cash grab spin off from the conjuring series that completely departs from what made those films successfulskip at all costs,astonish
this is not a good movie i wanted to like it but it was terrible let me get some positives out of the way the lead mother actor did a decent job the attack scene at the beginning was cool and there were some segments in the film that were genuinely creepyhere are the negatives this has to be some of the worst editing i have ever seen it does rapid cuts which make no sense story wise and makes some scenes linger way too long the rest of the casts acting ranges from mediocre to terrible the father actor is either not trying or trying too hard the character evelyn is established halfway through the movie but she has no character and you cant get behind her when she sacrifices herself at the end of the film you dont feel for her because she has no character the tone is really inconsistent and the cinematography is bland and boring the camera work is also terrible the type of camera they use changes every couple of scenes and it looks terrible overall the plot does not workprovides a handful of creepy scenes with a good lead actress but fails in every other aspect of a good film and fails to do what the conjuring did right,astonish
no suspense no interesting story okay acting and not scary at all,astonish
my 14 year old wanted to watch a horror film and asked for this one i pre watched it before he did and i have to say it is hands down the most boring horror film ive ever seenfirstly the couple are not believable at all very bland vanilla and boringthe doll is used just for close up camera shots of her face coupled with creepy music i actually got bored while watching and wrote this reviewcreations was much more creepy and horror genre than this give this one a miss and just watch that insteadits a paint by numbers doll movie which hits all the wrong notes,astonish
after watching entries to conjuringuniverse as well as related spinoffs i was thrilled when i found this from netflix after ten minutes i realized that this had very little common with earlier movies related to you could have switched with chucky barbie teddybear or any other childs toy and this movie wouldnt have suffered a bit there was zero tension and horror,astonish
leonettis investment to this infamous series weighs it down like an anchor as the thrills comes in cheap and tears negatively aplenty the elements that usually such genre dwells upon are spooky enough to lure you in but the execution is daft with pretentious artsy camera work that rots the somewhat established base of the film the last act on which the entire film hangs upon the ultimate culmination of all characters and their tragedies they bring along with is not only poorly conceived on screen but also amateurishly written on paper what aches you above all is their effort of delivering a mature climax to its audience that arms itself intellectually rather than some bourgeois intense chase scene unfortunately it isnt polished enough to smoothly go by unnoticedthe chills and scares is left up to imagination which is always been the signature of the series as it doesnt undermine the threat or antagonist by animating it too much on screen and probably this is the least animated among all the performance comes in short in here with wallis the major disappointment as she fails miserably to act even scared let along pour some emotion into itsame goes for all the supporting cast the performance is so unbearably lazy and inexpressive that the doll itself had to factor in and she is brilliant by the way those dead eyes at the end of the circle the film is a big moot point on all levels it is questionable and pretentious with no heart to enlighten it up even the mythological background tale that they have brought in isnt explored enough to satisfy the viewers is basically a chess game pawn for pawn with time slipping out of its hand this cliched installment in this franchise is not the way to conjure us,astonish
i watched creation first so i saw the part at the end of that movie that is shown in the first part of this film i didnt get it when i watched creation but now i dothis wasnt too bad there were some genuinely creepy parts wallis is beautiful but shes kind of a dud and shes boring the lead guy looked more like a high schooler than a father and husband aw looked like his older sister he was kind of howdy doodyish they had no chemistry he lacks something  his looks and his acting just dont seem big screen appropriate that baby was so dang cutea few questions observations and thoughtswhy would she put the doll up on the shelf in the new apartment in the babys room after making such a big deal about not wanting anything to do with it earlierthe doll is so dirty and tore up and its face is creepy yet the lady at the end is just gonna buy it with no hesitation who wants a crappy looking doll even if it is rarewho were those little kids on the stepsthat drew the creepy pictures were they possessed when they did that were they even real or were they ghosts they were being super secretive so im still trying to figure that outa cop wouldnt just let a rando look at a case file and keep photos like thatfinally i dont think its very respectful to make movies that reference the manson murders or use them as a type of model for behavior if they arent documentaries or movies that are based on those events if handled respectfully and with the goal in mind to bring to life the victims then thats admirable if the film is meant to humanize these people and show how truly awful charles manson and his followers were so that maybe it could be used as a cautionary tale i get it but in the case of this particular film it wasnt mostly teens watch these horror films so they arent as familiar with the manson murders as those of past generations those were real people with family members  friends many of whom are still alive today i just think its in bad taste to use something like that as fodder for a dumb horror flick its insensitive and these writers and directors need to be more respectful when coming up with ideas they couldve made this movie referencing a random cult not specifically charles manson and it could have been just as effective its kind of shameful that the writer and director couldnt come up with any other ideas for a fictional film so they resort to using mansonon a film like thisthese types of movies that have no substance and are churned out on a regular basis they are generally conceived strictly as cash grabs for entertaining teens who want films with jump scares and demonic overtones there is plenty of other material to mine from to write a story,astonish
with halloween almost upon us this is traditionally a time when lowbudget horror movies loom ever larger in the cinemas one of the biggest hits of last year in terms of return for budget was the conjuring and acts as effectively a prequel to and spinoff from that movieagain based on the case files of reallife supernatural detectives ed and lorraine warren is in essence an evil doll movie which explains how said titular doll wound up in a sealed cabinet in the warrens museum where the credits inform us its blessed twice a month by a priest just to be on the safe side right soanyway were back in 1969 and the manson family are on the prowl as are various satanic cults one of which disciples of the ram murders john and mia gordons ward horton and wallis neighbours and attacks themjust as the police arrive one of the cult kills herself and her blood drains into the eye of the doll which it has to be said is one of the scariest yokes youll ever seesubsequently the heavily pregnant mia begins to have visions that some presence or other is after her baby and seeks the help of a local priest tony amendola and a woman who runs an occult bookshopworks reasonably well in the first half building up a nice sense of impending dread it borrows heavily fromrosemarys baby before turning to a bythenumbers litany of standard shock tactics,astonish
like on teen movies there isnt parents around so the dumb plot can happen here seems to repeat that predictible formula two people with no relatives no parents brothers sisters friends cousins nothing so the characters cant ask for help or anything just lazy writing,astonish
is a horror movie in which we watch a couple being attacked at their own house by some members of a satanic cult after this attack by the members of a satanic cult who violently attack the couple the blood and terror which spilled all over the house are not the only thing they leave behind the couple starts to observe some terrifying supernatural occurrences that involve a vintage dolli expected more from this movie and had high expectations because i had previously watched the movie the conjuring and since there was a connection between these movies i had some expectations from it i did not notice the budget of this film before i watched it which is only 65 million something thats obvious in the whole duration of the movie there are not so many scary scenes and the few they are in this film they are old school they do scare you but i expected more because i compared it with the conjuring i liked the plot which was simple and gave us some information regarding the connection of this movie with the conjuring i liked the interpretation of wallis who played as mia and she was very good in this role to sum up i have to say that is an interesting movie for anyone to watch its a good average  medium horror movie which introduces us to this satanic vintage doll and makes us expect even more in the future i recommend it to everyone to watch it because you will have an interesting but not so much terrifying time watching it,astonish
as a spinoff from the conjuring i think there was a two sided mind set on this movie before the writers had even typed the end some likely waiting to compare it to the conjuring others followed the fact that a spinoff cant make a good movie for me both were wrongthis movie isnt the conjuring at all and in my opinion does brilliantly as a stand alone movie i though the story line was near perfect for what the film had to achieve in its ending the story was quiet overall but very sharp when it had its moments and this is something that personal preference takes the reins with i think the story would have got overcooked with much more than what was there in terms of horror actionwallis did very well in this movie too i think a very well cast character light and serene always makes for a better main character in these types of movies for mei see this movie as a movie all of it own that just happens to explain a small part in the conjuring rather than a spin off its well worth the time to watch it,astonish
this 2014 horror film stars wallis ward horton and alfre woodard this is a prequel to the conjuring where we meet mia wallis and john form horton a young couple who are about to have a baby girl soon theyre attacked in their home by satanic cultist higgins tree otoole and her boyfriend after kills herself and her boyfriend is shot by police mia becomes haunted by an evil force inhabiting her new doll that passed her spirit onto woodard scrooged plays evelyn a bookstore owner who befriends and helps mia this is ok its got sort of a childs play vibe the cast is decent and wallis also reminds me a bit of tina fey if youre into horror you may want to give this a try at least once,astonish
is a movie that does exactly what it is supposed horrify you but its downfall is that it has a poor story line the story revolves around a family that is expecting a child john the husband gets a vintage doll for his wife mia as he believes it is the perfect gift for her but strange things start to happen to them for is haunted the movies success is in how it creates suspense and fear for instance the scene that leads up to their house burning creates suspense in two ways as turns on the stove to burn the house down mia is in her room sewing the camera slowly zooms in on mias finger that she is using to sew which alludes to her soon cutting her finger to add on to the suspense nondiagetic suspenseful music that slowly gets louder is used to create a build up to her cutting her finger on the sewing machine and the house burning the movies downfall though is the fact that it mainly focuses on horror not the story line mia leaving her baby unattended several times throughout the movie does not add up to the plot because she knew strange things were happening and eventually finds out wants her daughters innocent soul to conclude could be better if it was made to be a bit more realistic by simply changing some of the characters actions,astonish
as a horror fan i was expecting a little more from this title  i mean it was a bit my mistake  the plot seems to be nice because no one really used this kind of stuff since childs play  plus the poster of the title is extra crippy anyway  i had pretty high expectations as i started to watch the movie  the tense atmosphere is kept through all of the title but its not enough to save it from the boredom holes that it provides almost every 10 minutes the cast is doing the job and the atmosphere is helping as i said  still i couldnt hold on until the end of the movie  i can recommend this title only to huge horror fans because i believe its just too boring for anybody else to watch,astonish
is a 2014 american supernatural psychological horror film directed by john r leonetti produced by james wan and written by gary dauberman it is both a prequel to and spinoff of the conjuring and was inspired by a story of a doll named told by ed and lorraine warrenthe film stars wallis ward horton and alfre woodardjohn form ward horton thinks hes found the perfect gift for his expectant wife mia wallis  a vintage doll in a beautiful white dress however the couples delight doesnt last long one terrible night devil worshippers invade their home and launch a violent attack against the couple when the cultists try to summon a demon they smear a bloody rune on the nursery wall and drip blood on mias doll thereby turning the former object of beauty into a conduit for ultimate evil,astonish
for a movie that aims to scare you i left the theatre very much unperturbed while this is john leonettis most competent film it pails in comparison to its much better prequel the conjuring the scares and story save for elements of the ending  a somewhat creepy basement scene left me wanting the acting is serviceable but most of us never really go into horror movies for anything other than the scares while this is the directors best film it is in no way a great film i do however have hopes for leonettis future films coming from a career as a cinematographer his films will be visually pleasing unfortunately as of now thats where most of the pros tend to end but it seems that he may be on the right track although it may be a long journey,astonish
greetings from lithuania2014 is a prequel or a spin off call how you like it to a great horror film the conjuring sadly in terms of quality and chills this movie is far from the conjuring story is very simple and generic even for a horror movies  trust me you saw this kind of plot hundreds of time before the acting was very wooden in my opinion especially by both leads directing was ok but just ok because at the running time 1 h 35 min this movie dragged a bit there and there and if horror movie drags this is never a good sign there were some chilly moments but far and in between and all of the were created not by a mood but by simple silence and then gotcha moments  dull overall is not the worst horror movie its not but its a very poor prequel to a very good horror flick and poor movie itself its not particularly scary its badly acted and overall you can skip this flick,astonish
conjuring was really good so i do understand that quite a few people see this as a bad movie it doesnt live up to what conjuring promised or what we thought might be coming but still its not a bad movie its just a horror by the numbers where you can see and guess where this is going or when the scary bits will pop upit takes itself seriously and it does play during the manson family time which gives this an edge in realism if you want to call it that so there is real horror involved to heighten things but it might not be enough to satisfy most horror fans especially because of the mentioned expectations a shame though that still means chucky remains the number one under the most scary dolls low budget puppet movie efforts excluded,astonish
   using the united states postal service is about a family that just cannot seem able to rid themselves of a spooky plaything that nobody in their right mind would consider owning in the first place but say you got really smashed and the next thing you knew you had woken up next to this demonic monstrosity what to do the last notion popping into a normal persons mind would be to simply chuck it into an ordinary garbage can as the subhuman characters in do anyone who has ever seen a horror flick of any kind roughly 97 of the adult american population would know that at the very least you needed to pick up a doll as evil looking as with one of those scrapyard cranes and drop it into a vat of molten metal as in terminator 16 or frankenstein 3 however even that might fall short with what is a surefire way to destroy something hmmmmm then it hit me when i emptied my post office box today some government bozo had crammed my highend journal into it in such a fashion that the cover was pretty much ripped in half given the countless pieces of critical communications that have been disappeared without a trace by this same organization i suppose i should be thanking my lucky stars that any scrap of my journal actually reached me at all the bottom line is had the plagued familyat the first hint of troublesimply put her in a selfaddressed box and mailed her via the usps everyone would still be alive today except of course,astonish
the movie actually is entertaining and worth watching how ever the lead female actor playing mia almost ruins it her acting is not convincing she shows very little emotion and is not convincing she seems to mellow like shes on xanax in every scene to me everyone else seems like they are more convincing as an actorcharacter except for her she isnt bad but she wasnt good enough in most scenesas a director i would have said cut and retook just about every scene asking for more emotion out of herits still worth a watch i believe from the plot setting decor technology its supposed to take place in the late 80s she also feels way to modern as a character and doesnt have the look from that period in my opinion,astonish
a doll possessed by a dead woman and demon threatens a young couple with a newborn babywhere as the conjuring borrowed from many other horrors but stood on its own the spin off annable falls shy that said director john r leonetti offers a slick period filmed chiller and the special effects are first class it borrows much from the likes of magic childs play the omen the exorcist and the entity to name a few for a b film concept the acting is above par wallis mia form is convincing and the introduction of the demonic harassment aspect plays out well with tony amendola as father perez giving the proceedings weight written by gary dauberman theres the obligatory woman who knows about spirits and the all knowing detectiveleonetti effectively builds up some tension yes its creepy mostly thanks to some heavy sound design jump scares and eerie figures theres a notable lift and stairwell set up but none of which really involve annable in a nutshell theres scarier doll films out there its not as encompassing as its parent film but this is a good way to spend your time until the conjuring 2,astonish
i didnt absolutely hate this film nor did i love it and probably in a couple of days ill have completely forgotten i watched it the acting was solid i liked the period the film was set in and there were a couple of good suspense moments involving a sewing machinenow that was the good news the rest of my review will be less than positive im afraid as with many horrors these days it seems to have been written using a standard horror film app i can actually imagine them ticking boxessatanic cult checkcreepy doll that noone in their right mind would ever buy checkwise priest who instantly believes aforementioned doll is possessed without question checkhandy neighbour with knowledge of the occult and who is willing to sacrifice themselves for someone theyve known for two minutes checkthat is basically my whole issue with this film there was nothing to make it stand out with alfre woodards character evelyn it felt as though she was shoehorned in so the heroine had a way out of dying the doll when purchased was like chucky after the third or fourth film if you are going to have a doll in a film at least at the beginning it has to look normal i dont even want to start on the endingoverall if you are seeing it for free itll pass the time but i personally wouldnt even rent it,astonish
a couple begin to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll shortly after their home is invaded by satanic cultists is produced by james wang and directed by his preferred cinematographer of choice rr leonetti this movie is kind of a sequel to the conjuring and i absolutely loved the conjuring actually leonetti was director of the photography on insidious 1 insidious 2 and the conjuring which all three movies happen to be one of my favorites horror movies of all time is the creepiest looking doll ive ever seen in my life who ever thought to bring it into their house really who on earth would put that thing in their babys room no one sain for sure this movie is based on jump scare after jump scare the horror is obvious you know something is going to happen there were not that much of suspense building over the film though and the construction of the scary scenes in fact the film making doesnt properly fit the tones of sound effects that are supposed to make you feel something very scary is happening my favorite scene is the elevatorstaircase sequence which is really cool for the first hour of the movie nothing really scary happen its just some pretty creepy close up of the doll and then thats when all the real scary things properly start to happen we can actually see the demon thats cool finally in this film mostly all the characters were not that great they are all flat and lifeless narrating the story of a perfect couple with a cute baby on the way and money which comes from god knows where unsurprising overall is a bit disappointing as it was so predictable its not as close to be as good as the conjuring,astonish
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it provided ample amount of scares causing me to jump out of my skin several times which is very hard for a horror film to bring out of me the fact that i had watched a documentary about the real doll before watching the movie helped make it that much scarier if you didnt like this movie its probably because it scared you a little too much if you found it slow perhaps you have a form of adhd no offense intended i also loved the fact that they stepped away from the normal format of most movies about demons keeping them invisible and for short brief moments letting us see the terrifying creature,astonish
its a really good movie why 57  it should be at least 68  its not as good and scary as the conjuring it not as original as the conjuring but it still a good prequel it has its moments of scare  it shows that a simple doll still can scare you without having to walk around with a knife and killing everybody like childs play and the curse of chucky  am sure the fans of james wans the conjuring well like this  horror lovers should check it out its really good for halloween  i gave it 8 out of 10 because i though it deserves it  so it depends on you after all if you like horror movies  if you liked the conjuring  you can watch this you wont be disappointed ,astonish
john r leonetti directed this movie and if you dont know what other movies he did well he did such movies as mortal kombat annihilation and the butterfly effect 2 yeah this is going to be painful talk aboutis about a husband tracks down a vintage doll in a white dress but after a satanic cult breaks in and terrifies the couple they leave behind something else  and is unleashedi have seen so many film with a dreadful script and stupid movie characters that are as thick as a brink and make stupid moves and is nothing different actually this might be the worst horror movie that ive seen so far this yearthe acting is pure god awful the writing is full of bad clichs that even a good horror film would avoid this movie is filled with loud lazy jump scares that are so predictable the movie became a joke now i bet your asking yourselfs well if the movie isnt that good is they anything good in the movie no i cant find anything good about this movie the movie failed to scare me and it failed as a horror movie itself and thats why this movie is freaking terrible,astonish
i have to forced 2 of my friends who arent horror movie fan to accompany me to watch this movie since i thought it would be scary as hell and perfect to open the halloween month but it was the biggest waste of 98 minutes of our life there is no a single scene that surprises usthe plot is made for a kindergarden kid its like reading an open book no suspense no mysteryyou can easily predict what is about to happen in the next scene such a disappointment the only thing that good about this movie is the marketing teamso if you are looking for a horror movie that will scare you off this is not your option dont waste your money on this,astonish
well the biggest pile of poo since an elephant dropped its load in my street not a single scare throughout the film other than being charged 8 by the cinema to sit through the biggest pile of dross ive ever had the misfortune to waste my life on dont pay to see this just dont youll thank me for saving you the money trulyin fact the best bit of the cinema experience of this film were the trailers for other scarier films  its not good when the 1 minute trailer for another film contains more frights than the whole of the featurei can only assume that the people who have written 10 star reviews for this are either the cast or other people who work for the distribution company because they must have been either paid to review it or watched a different film,astonish
this movie is absolutely atrocious i say this from the bottom of my heart this movie will make a true horror movie fan feel nauseous there are empty and ineffective jumpscares all about the plot is hollow and pointless the horror factor isnt there whats so scary about an ugly doll this abomination of a film is nothing like the chucky moviesdont waste your time the acting makes me want to cry same for the script the plot is unconvincing and boring why was this made were the actors involved low on money it seems like it i was waiting and waiting for it to get interesting and every few minutes i keep getting more and more annoyed again i say avoid this movie it might give you health problems thats how bad it is,astonish
i am an imdb junkie whos never written a review despite having strong opinions about many movies i am compelled to put in my two cents on as the numerical rating seems surprisingly low my guess is that the critics are the reason for this its rare to find a scary movie these days that is actually scary the movie isnt ground breaking but it is extremely creepy and had everyone in the theater jumping out of their chairs it was also effective in building suspense and there were a couple of scenes that were so creepy that you could actually feel the terror that the character was feeling i left the theater feeling like had just live through the experience myself the cinematography and a surprisingly good performance from the female lead really draws you into the terrifying situation personally i dont care how the movie provided the numerous jolting scenes the fact is that the entire audience was jumping and screaming the whole time we were all laughing at ourselves as you know that its coming yet you cant help but be jolted i recommend seeing it in the theater so that you can enjoy the ride with others its similar to riding a daunting roller coaster multiple times you know what to expect but you still scream every time  its not the conjuring but it still works made my heart race in anticipation consistently throughout the movie which is highly unusual in todays horror genre its a solid absorbing 90 minutes of entertainment that doesnt rely on gore tactics i highly recommend it,astonish
im shocked this movie has received such low ratings ive seen a lot of horror films as one can assume from my user name so im more critical than most of horror films but this one was honestly very well done the actors did a fantastic job the baby was adorable and that elevator scene and the stair scene following it were absolutely phenomenal i dont jump scare or become startled easily at movies whether in a theater or at home but this one managed to freak me out and make me jump a few times the elevator scene just kept me on edge waiting for the demon to reappear and grab her or drag her or something then when she was running up the stairs and stopped to look back and all you can see is this vague dark outline and your thought process goes wait is that the demon i think it is oh god it is truly classic horror movie techniques i get so tired of slasher films that only want sex rape nudity and blood im sorry but a man running around just cutting off naked girls limbs isnt really terrifying also the part with the priest running into the church with the doll i expected the girl to be standing in the church all like haha holy ground my ass and then slaughter him but instead he went flying back towards the street where she stood which caught me off guard and made me jump a littlethe only part im still a little unsure of whether it was beneficial or negative is when mia the mother is in their dining room and the doll is sitting on the ground then floats up and you see the demoncreature thing standing behind holding it and it shows its face its definitely a decently creepy demon i just sometimes prefer only a somewhat reveal of it like when it was on the stairs i feel like showing its face completely can take away the horror of the unknownreally people should give this film a chance i thought it was even better than conjuring and i thought conjuring was great as well,astonish
spoiler alertish ill start by stateing im a huge fan of supernaturalparanormal genre it was so slow boring really it had me yawning and i wasnt the only one u could hear others in different parts of theater yawning lol this is a made up hollywood film the people whom own the doll in movie dont exist in any way the real owners were 2 young women also the people who investigated the warrens werent even mentioned in movie whatsmore the movie doll is completely wrong from the doll the real one is a raggedyann stuffed dollin 1970 a mother purchased a antique raggedy ann doll from a hobby store the doll was a present for her daughter donna on her birthdayfor the real story try the warrens website wwwwarrensnet,astonish
i honestly dont know where to begin i went into this movie with low expectations that were met now i figured this movie was likely going to be dodgy in terms of plot and i was correct the first thing to consider if you plan on seeing this movie is have you seen the conjuring if not watch it first because there a couple of significant references that you probably wont completely understand without the back knowledge personally i think for a scary movie to be considered scary it has to make me think or at the very least stick to my mind after i leave the cinema and did neither one of the many issues i had with this movie was the beginning and end of the movie as there was room for a nice link and the directorwriter failed to create an in depth connection between the two i believe if they had would have boosted the story significantly im not sure if they are planning on making another movie to explain all of the stuff they missed in that substory but even if they do this movie was proof enough that it probably wouldnt be worth mine or anyone elses money my problem with this movie may just be because im a stickler for detail like i love it and that could be why i am so frustrated and annoyed i mean there was so much potential i have so many questions that have been left unanswered like please give me more information i wont say what kind of information because no spoilers side note before i forget  its 2014 why does the scariest part of the movie look like they have had paint dumped on them youll understand me if you watch this film now to reference the summary of this review i need to point out the jump scares the jump scares were the best part of this movie even though most of them only appeared when the movie hit its half way point as they gave me a good laugh as the people around me in the cinema squealed or jumped in fear personally there was one in particular that the director did a very good job with and it was one of the highlights of the movie for me maybe its because little kids are creepy as hellhint hint one thing i really enjoyed in this movie was a scene that is within an elevator this was a great part of the film as it had most of the people within the cinema laughing me included so if you decide to watch this movie that is the scene to look out for in this movie there are multiple scenes that seem significant but really arent the was two characters in particular that i thought were for sure going to play a bigger role than what they did but they were shown only once and were never really referenced again there characters were pair of children that had potential much like this movie that was never met now if you are just looking for cheap scares then i recommend you watch this but for people who want to be really scared or enjoy their horrorthriller movies to be summed up nicely with little to no holes in the plot then i would not recommend,astonish
if youre looking to be scared youll be disappointed yes there are a couple jump scares but the beginning of the movie is as good as it gets and only gets worse and worse this film steals elements from paranormal insidious and has zero originality and what it steals is the best part of it it spends no time establishing what is terrifying these people the way paranormal does  which generates the psychological thrill as the audience pieces it together with the characters the acting is mediocre at best basically you saw almost all the scary parts in the previews and the actual plots are disjointed and make no sense both the villains in the movie and its connection with the conjuring are nonexistent and clearly they are hoping to suck in some ticket sales in by name dropping the conjuring could i do better yep you better believe it my advice save your  rent it if you must see it,astonish
have an appreciation for horror and there are a fair share of good to classic ones in the genre as well as a fair share of not so good and even downright bad ones really liked both the conjuring films so watched which has garnered a lot of comparisons to especially the first film having been released before the second though saw after seeing the conjuring films hoping it would be in similar vein purposefully not reading too many reviews those read disappointingly indicating otherwiseunfortunately turned out to be a disappointment have definitely seen far worse films horror and overall its not even one of the worst of 2014 is not irredeemable it sadly has a lot of faults that makes it a very lacklustre film and if briefly comparing it to the conjuring it is nowhere near being in the same ball park it is a shame because it does start off very well it is creepy to start with and the mansonesque attack is unsettling and staged very well it looks good too nicely shot and the set design and late 60s setting are both beautiful and atmospheric to look at similarly well done is the score which does have many haunting moments the titular character has moments of creepiness unfortunately there are times where she could have done with more expression s biggest problems though is that when it goes downhill which it does do rapidly far too early it is not scary nor is it particularly interesting tension and suspense is nowhere near enough and the too infrequent scares are obvious and goingthroughthemotions like didnt feel much palmsweating or heartstopping here much of it is basically formulaic storytelling that is also on the dull side and a constant ticking off of predictable shocks and familiar genre tropes the type of scares the film is overreliant on having no build up or suspense furthermore has a banal script that has no flow or substance and direction that suggests their heart was not in it or at ease with the material the pacing on the most part is perfunctory and the acting has little distinction not amateurish but nobody stands out the characters are not easy to engage with with so little development or much personality while the ending is one big rushed anticlimax and things do get ridiculous and silly as the film progresses to an increasingly intensifying degreeconcluding lacklustre 410 bethany cox,astonish
seriously the young couple look like barbie and ken dolls hes handsome and boring and shes pretty and boring and so is this so called horror movieapart from the movie itself being boring and predictable the couple act moronically throughout the movie1 why would anybody want a creepy doll like annabell in the first place aside from adding it to a creepy doll collection 2 why would a young attractive woman in her twenties own a creepy doll collection thats something an old lady who has lived alone would own that or 20 cats 3 after they move to an apartment after the first hauntings the doll is in a movingbox even though ken threw it away and barbie is not freaked out by this at all and decides to keep the doll 4 after barbie and ken and the clichpriest finds out that the doll is possessed by a demon they dont destroy the doll which would probably destroy the demon as well no barbie throws it around and yells at it and the priest takes the doll with him to his church where he is almost killed by the demon5 as for the exercising couple that is not even in the movie theyre boring as wellthe conjuring movies suckand a franchise about that couple just dont work6 the exercising couple keep the doll in a glass box to keep the demon trapped again destroy the doll and destroy the demon7 why did this movie get an rrating there is no blood in it no nudity no swearing and its not even scary it feels like a low budget made for tv horror movie apart from a few creepy scenes and only one good scare this movie isnt worth watching if you like horror movies with dolls and those movies certainly can be creepy i recommend dead silence directed by james wan that produced and uncredited codirected this garbage,astonish
that said after that point it went in a laughably dumb direction so filled with clichs and and stupid lines it was about as memorable as being chloroformedi saw the conjuring which did a pretty good job staying true to the source material a little hollywood glamorizing but my biggest beef with the movie was that ed did the exorcism and the new look of for whatever reason the movie became about a baby and a mother and other stuff i mean yeah they had to do that cause movies about bad things happening to teenage friends would never work as a horror movie the movie effectively is so boring recounting any line is next to impossible the most memorable scenes involve jumpscare porn i mean record players turning on shadowy figures running around and jiffy pop catching fire 40 years of horror and we still resort to jiffy pop catching fire in horrorit amazes me how little the writer put into learning the real story or just how little they felt was worth adapting as the true story actually wasnt so bloody boring dont waste your money or the time if its on cable,astonish
yes thats right this movie is just one big com to get all the teens who wouldnt know a decent horror film if the power of christ compelled them and until we turn our backs on these sort of atrocities decent horror movie like the babadook will be overlooked in favour of cattle prod scaresso the story goes like this bloke buys pregnant woman the doll with no special features and they go to bed next door some people who love charles manson kill their neighbours and then they come for them when the satanists are killed a little tiny bit of blood goes into s eye and like 28 days later permanently turns herthe first ten minutes of this are admittedly very creepy indeed but as soon as the baby is born this film just goes for the cheap jump scares that have graced our cinema screens since paranormal activity was introduced to us back 2009 and let me tell you they are getting poorer and poorer as the years go bybut they always look good i the trailer but thats because they show all the best stuff in the trailers to entice people to spend money on this toshbut the worst thing about it is is that the writers just dont know how to end a movie the conjuring had something going for it but just went over the top at the end same as insidious 1 and 2 all great scenarios but poor execution of a third actbut these will continue to be made because people go tossed them but mark my wordsthese wont be as fondly remembered like the slasher movies of the eighties or the horror resurgence of the nineties following screampoor,astonish
in my personal opinion i didnt find the movie nearly as atrocious as many others have i think perhaps it was more disappointing than anything since the conjuring managed such an effective opening with our star doll it also set what i consider a high bar for modern horror i think a story centered on the actual would have been more interesting and in tune with conjurings true story presentationi didnt find the dialogue so unbearable as some consider and while it wasnt a scary film to me i found it creepy and i found the inhuman antagonist far more unsettling in design than the one in insidiousultimately as opposed to tension or fright what i thought an eerie atmosphere is what kept me following of particular note i enjoyed the sequence in the middle of the film most when spoiler books threaten the child and is lifted by the demonend spoilerim sure many will disagree but i found this movie perfectly average either way i enjoy it everyone has guilty pleasures but i dont feel entirely guilty with this one heres eager waiting for the conjuring 2,astonish
i went into the cinemas expecting to see an average horror film since the conjuring surpassed my expectations and included genuine scares wow was i disappointed this films first hour lacks any content  almost absolutely nothing happens when things do get amped up it only happens in one scene and for a couple of minutes the relationship between john and mia doesnt exist  theyre a couple yet the scenes between them are awkward the acting is atrocious in this film the so called horror scenes are generic cheesy and shortlived toppled with repetitive music weve heard time from time legitimately half this film no joke is wasted on slow zoom ups on s face and of course this film just had to have an irrelevant scene of a girl in a white dress with long black hair  have western movies not gotten past the whole concept of the ring stop obsessing over that idea and make your own this film lacked content acting a story line characters i gave a crap for and genuine scares waste of money,astonish
i am a big horror movies fan and i really had high hopes for this movie because i really loved the conjuring  butthis movie was rubbish  not scary  bad  and it only had some jump scares that didnt even workthe music was higher than actions most of the times  the acting was horrible that sometimes i felt they were actually acting looks like this movie could have been better because the idea isnt bad after all maybe james wan could have done a better joball in all its just a waste of time and i really found it boring avoid this,astonish
is the type of horror film youd expect to come out around halloween its cheap somewhat creepy but especially its forgettable coming off of the genuinely creepy and disturbing the conjuring tries to cash in on scares weve seen before plot points that are filled with holes and acting that is wooden and melodramatic despite these lackluster qualities can certainly turn up the notch on creepy atmosphere but cant exactly capitalize on it the way james wan did in the conjuring as a stand alone film can certainly wet your appetite for horror but stands so much in the shadow of its predecessor that its hard to really enjoy the potential of it all the story tells the horror behind the now legendary doll that had us all gripping our theater seats last summer turning what was originally a 10 minute story arc in the conjuring into a feature length film as one could assume it becomes tired and exhausted after the first thirty minutes of the film the story then tries to rehash the conjuring pitting a family against supernatural forces and blah blah blah quite honestly i would have enjoyed this film much more if director john leonetti took some risk and changed up the storyline up from the original but no they must stick with what worked before something that worked for one film doesnt necessarily warrant a complete rehash of it just substituting a demon for a doll my problems with this film are seemingly endless as i write this review pulling more and more negative out of it all than i can the positive at times shows glimpses of promise but they are all crushed with familiar scares shoddy acting and hollow writing john leonetti is no james wan thats for damn sure overall results in more of a sequel to a haunting in connecticut or james wans dead silence than to the superior and masterfully made the conjuring while youll most likely get a couple jump scares out of it is a mere after thought and a nail in the coffin to whatever hopes the studio had in turning the conjuring into a franchise,astonish
if you saw the trailer then you have seen it almost all sadly the only scary parts of the film is the zoom shot to the face of which my friend actually counted a total of 12 zoom shots for the whole film and the rest well they have shown it all in the trailer so its pretty predictable of whats going to come next the movie is also pretty clich and falls into a typical cheap haunted house trick with nothing surprising or genuinely scary here however the music here is impressively done and really adds the suspense feel to the scene quite effectively the gore here is kept at minimum and it could have just been rated pg13 instead since it doesnt really used its rrating that effectively enough overall this is an overall disappointing prequel thanks to the trailer to the conjuring thats clich lack of any effective scares with mediocre acting and decent story c,astonish
the story follows a man and his pregnant wife  the man dont remember either of their names and i saw it 15 hours ago gets the girl a hideous looking doll as a gift i guess later on they are attacked by two lunatics in a satanic cult one of the lunatics stabs the pregnant woman in an attempt we guess to kill the baby keep this in mind the couple survives but the doll is now cursed and is determined to haunt the family and take the soul of the baby the couple moves and all of the typical ghostmovie things happens after the first 30 minutes it takes literally an hour before something else noteworthy happens which seems like longer in a theater enter random old black lady she adds nothing to the story and her story is completely irrelevant to the main story in fact we arent even told how she got involved with the paranormal or why she would involve herself in the troubles of this familyanother 30 minutes goes by at this point im just ready to get home and watch sportscenter the movie ends with the black woman sacrificing herself in order to save the baby and the woman so thats that i guess the only purpose the black woman served was to save a white family being haunted by satanic spirits im not offended really im not but her character wasnt even warranted in the first place and why would the demonic spirits want her when its invested so much energy taking the souls of the baby or the woman and since when does soul taking involve dying isnt the point of possessing a soul possession why then was the man in the beginning of the movie trying to kill the baby lol just stupidi tried to like this movie and there are parts that are redeemable it is not scary however assuming you are over the age of 6 and there are plot holes littered all throughout the film the ending was god awful and i wouldnt doubt if they came up with it on the fly i swear everything about this movie got worse as it went on which was far too long dont spend 10 dollars and 2 hours of your life on this movie go watch denzels new movie or space jam reruns both are more compelling and scary,astonish
it took 49 minutes into the movie to see something really happen that only lasted a second there is only 99 minutes in the movie 10 of that will be closing credits so really your getting 40 minutes of mediocre movie 49 minutes of needing tooth picks to keep you eyes open and 10 minutes regretting every minute you wasted watching it im being forced to write 10 lines which will be more entertaining than the actual movie if its not a innocent baby in danger its the virgin i really dont like clichs they havent even tied together the story who what when where and how we learned that in elementary ps the whole time the doll wasnt doing anything in this movie other than being a doll stop the madness,astonish
it is everything wrong with some of the worst modern horror clichs it fails in every important area there are a lot of modern horror films and even a number of older ones that rely on fake music scares this movie is the pinnacle of the worst of that i jumped once when the music abruptly changed the reason i jumped was not because the film was scary or even atmospheric it was just the cheapest trick i can remember seeing in a long time it also felt like an action sequence in a stale film that builds nothing out of nothing the only reason this movie will be noteworthy in the future is when people say this was alfre woodards worst film to those who think she has none what in the world was she thinking the only true mystery of this movie for me is why anyone does like it it is a rushed sequel that insults the previous film,astonish
it isnt as exciting and scary as i expected its predictable and there are common special effects i can rate 710 because it has interesting plot there are playing great actors too i think the most interesting is older woman from book store in my opinion the most boring character is the priest there is one thing which i dont understand why the beginning is so long and boring looks very scary and angry if i had it i would burn it or something like this instead of throwing it away its classical movie clich behavior there are a few scary scenes like this one with a kid who transform into woman i hope there will be a sequel because the ending was like to be continued i hope the sequel will be more scary and there will be more great special effects characters and better soundtrack and audio effects i have one more question where the warrens are why didnt they help this poor family why does the priest look clever but he isnt,astonish
whereas the conjuring rode on a wave of overwhelmingly positive test screenings to secure a prime release date in summer last year seems to have taken the opposite route screened late or in some territories never for critics and audiences alike it almost seems as if the producers want to keep the movie locked up  like the reallife raggedy ann doll of the same name from which this was inspired  in a glass cabinet and yet the reason for their reluctance to unveil in the same way that they did for the conjuring is plainly simple once youve seen the formerfirst things first the conjurings james wan doesnt return to direct the malaysianborn director serves only as a producer here and instead has relinquished the reins to his director of photography on the former john r leonetti neither is scripted by the writers of the conjuring who  if its any relief to fans of the original  are returning for the direct sequel the conjuring 2 the enfield poltergeist due next year instead that credit falls here to gary dauberman whose filmography before this consists of dubious directtovideo titles like in the spiders web and swamp monkey the point were trying to make dont expect the same pedigree as the conjuring because there just isntits unfortunate that gets immediately compared with the farsuperior the conjuring on its own is a pretty average genre exercise that should satisfy those looking for a horror fix but when you lay it next to the conjuring then this inname prequel just is utterly inferior and probably no more than an attempt to cash in on its predecessors success to get more people into the cinema heck they couldnt even get patrick wilson and vera farmiga to cameo in the scene where their characters ed and lorraine warren frm the conjuring are clearly referencedsince the conjuring is set in the mid1970s sets itself about a decade before when medical school student john ward horton and his wife mia wallis are a young couple living in a quiet suburban neighbourhood and expecting a baby mia is a doll collector and is johns surprise present to her to complete her antique doll collection  though why one naturally wonders just why anyone would want a creepy looking thing like in their home anyhow on the night they learn of the manson family murders google that if youre keen for more information their home is invaded by the daughter of their next door neighboura satanic hippie best described as a crazed demon worshipper she and her boyfriend have just murdered her parents before proceeding to try to do the same with john and mia but the police arrive and in the melee that follows her boyfriend is shot dead while she slits her throat such that her blood gets into the titular creepy doll none of this is a spoiler since you already can see most of it from the trailer after some weird and dangerous things happen in that house from the usual moving of furniture to slamming of doors and leading up to the kitchen catching fire john and mia move into a new apartment in a new town where john is to complete his residencyneedless to say follows them to the new place and while john is away proceeds to terrorise mia as well as their newborn baby daughter who do the couple turn to well as clichs go john looks to a local elderly priest tony amendola while mia confides in the eccentric black woman alfre woodard who runs a bookstore down the street with a convenient occult section the entity responsible for the paranormal activities its a demon and before you can say exorcism father perez conveniently turns into the eager exorcist who tries to rid the demon from the doll  and if you need any clue as to how that turns out well just rewatch the opening sequence from the conjuringnone of what happens is particularly scary in and of itself because instead of the nice slowburn type of atmospheric dread that the conjuring traded in leonetti insists on hitting his audience over their heads with repeated boo scares which are akin to the genres junk food yes if youre well versed in the genre this is more about things jumping out at you at various moments  accompanied by appropriately sudden sound effects  than any genuine tension or fear it is cheap to say the least and lazy if you compare it against the wellcrafted sequences which made the conjuring such a success in the first placeit doesnt help that daubermans script plagiarises elements from all the horror classics weve known  from the helpless mother to her logical companion to the local priest who doesnt need a permit from the vatican to decide he wants to take on the demon to the peculiar black lady who actually knows a thing or two about the demonic stuff she keeps ranting about there is nothing here that transcends genre mediocrity and leonettis reliance on the frights of the lowest denominator doesnt help one bitlike we said though the producers of would gladly like for their film to be related with the conjuring that association is a doubleedged sword it will get fans in no doubt but whether it leaves them satiated in the same scared stiff way the conjuring did is clear  it wont what that means in terms of goodwill for the conjuring franchise in general is still suspect but heres something we do know  is no conjuring and at its best is a thoroughly mediocre genre exercise that is good for halloween but little else,astonish
than again the movie feels more like a reboot of rosemarys baby with the filmmakers constant homage to the polanski picture all the way down to the main charter being named after mia farrow as a spinoffprequels to the conjuring it was really cool seeing the subtle connections between both films when i saw the conjuring like everyone else i found that doll really creepy so i could not wait to see when i herd about it overall it was a decent addition to the ghost story genre im loving this new trend of seeing the monster which is proving to be ass scary as not seeing it help that their were some cool camera movements going on to increase the fright but honestly the hype over this movie out weighs itits definitely a fun scare i had points when i was jumping out my seat but the hype was not worth the outing catch on dvd,astonish
the hype of the doll started up when it showed up in the conjuring for a couple of seconds long a way for the director to say were gonna make a movie about the doll and in just a year time more or less we got the movie acting as a prequel to the conjuringso maybe people would put their hopes up because the conjuring was actually a success and besides were talking about a possessed and really creepy doll it should be good too just like the conjuring right well as much as i wanted to say that is good the truth is its just a mediocre horror movie delivered to drive the curiosity in all horror moviegoers up which for me is not that successfulit all started with a collection set creepy doll later on named was possessed with a supernatural power that was disturbing from there everything went awry just like your typical horrorgenre movieits true theres quite a lot of fear factor that can make you jump out of your seat at the time or even some scene that made you started to cover up your eyes in case something scary might jump at you i have to say perhaps thats because people have watched the conjuring and they expected the same thing to happen in for me its only that factor that actually makes me onalert with my handsother than that nothing its just your usual daytoday scary movie that will just go by and be forgotten only to be remembered when you watch the conjuring again and maybe just another speculation of mine thats the reason why was designed like that the real doll was just a raggedy ann to make us remember as shown in the movie just too bad the director couldnt effectively make the best out of the creepy dollas for the script and actors  actresses they are neither good nor bad just another soso part from that makes me rate the movie 510 could be better,astonish
anabelle is a really creepy doll she keeps writing letters in red crayon they throw her away only for anabelle to come back the girl kills her parents and the slits her throat and her blood goes in the anabelle doll and then she starts messing with this family and then she wants to posses the baby this movie is creepy and then that one girl jumps out the window and kills herself oh my gosh i love anabelle it is scary,astonish
it is a prequelspinoff of conjuring and i found it better and scarier than that i recommend it but not strongly because it is familiar to those who have seen the insidious movies sinister or conjuring because they all deals with supernatural forces following families in houses which seems to be a new subgenre in haunted house pictures its especially appropriate for pregnant women or those with newborns because it deals with evil forces begging to be human again by possessing a baby,astonish
released back in 2014 is a movie that got a lot of attention in the horror genre based off the story of the original doll locked away in a museum for the occult director john r leonetti brings to life one of the most iconic haunted doll stories known in history i am utterly terrified of dolls and i think that might have been why i found this film as scary as i did i was surprise to find it had quite a low rating on imdb especially with the sequel just coming out before i watched the film i fully believe this deserves a slightly higher rating than what it gotfirst of all wallis was an absolutely amazing actress and stole the show completely she did a spectacular job and she was easy to relate to it was easy to feel the fear she was going through throughout the film  especially the basement scene following i am more than eager to go through her filmography and find more of her acting skills she was just wonderfully talentedunfortunately this film does rely on a lot of old tricks of the paranormal genre the seeing things the writing on the wall the demon chase up the stairs and although terrifying i would have loved to see more from this that wasnt the same as everything else in the genre i feel like the directors and script writers could have done a lot more development with this i am aware they were following the original real life story of but they could have enhanced it made it a little more scary and not just another tropethere were cons and pros about this and unfortunately there were quite a few more cons than there were pros however this was still quite a good horror film for the current age and id definitely recommend this to those who enjoy being spooked,astonish
i did watch this film several years ago but i had to rewatch it to make some pieces together after creationactually i like this part better though i can not say that creation is worse i just think that this one was more entertaining and had some really scary scenes unlike creationi also felt like some parts of this film were missing the murder scene of their neighbors done by their daughter which is also used in creation is kinda unexpected and when you think about it  kinda improbable especially what they were to do next i guess there are many small details in this one and later in creation that does not really fit but overall when you watch the films you dont think about themthe librarian was an interesting character i can not stop thinking of her role in desperate housewivesall in all not bad rating 66,astonish
a demon that has possessed a porcelain doll terrorizes a pregnant wife an her husband in sunny santa monica californiaanyone who saw peaky blinders will know that wallace a fresh face in the industry has talent she brings much of the same mellow composure and grace that make her as beautiful inside as out the kind of pure soul that is perfect for the haunting there are times however when her refinement is so great that she seems not very impressionable its not like the movie needs a scream queen but she fails to summon much fear or motivation from itis only an hour and a half long but it feels substantially longer the first half of the movie is often so light in tone that it feels like a 60s soap opera that just happens to have horror devices director john leonetti lets the movie drag along without a clear sense of direction if nothing else at least he has a good eye for framing the photography which has a wide lens feel is a blessing to a movie that is full of cursing the best shots in the movie are the static framings that squeeze two or three rooms into the picture these moments work by daring the viewer to search for what is not there absence is always more intimidating than presence for the most part this is not a scary movie there is too much chaos and the images hinging on boo moments are all gimmicks that we have seen before the self moving doors phonographs ghosts in white sleepers the black biblical demon the all thats missing is the cat jumping out of the shadows the catalyst for all this unnatural mumbo jumbo the doll who looks like an ancestor of chucky leonetti likes to linger on her face just long enough to make you suspect that her eyes are gonna spring out of her skull those who dont get goosebumps will probably find these shots somewhat amusing the film gives you enough down time to contemplate how anything with a face like that could ever end up on the market,astonish
nothing more to say really thats it its a creepy ass doleits not a great movie its not scary or shocking but that dole its a creepy ass dole i really want to go to the museum that they charge you for entering a room in a house just to see it and this movie build on the back of the conjuring and basically some kids were scared of a doll so a couple came along and took it away from them and because it looks so freaking creepy but it in their basement and charged people to see itas far as the movie goes disappointing but anyone that wants to watch a movie with a creepy ass doll cant go too wrong here,astonish
the true review anabellewow the conjuring was a fantastic movietypical modern horror film but with a touch of original swagger and then there was anabelle do not get me wrongthe way the film is suspected to be is exactly how it is a creepy raggedy doll a half possessed paranoid wife and a loving husband barbie and ken go horror a woman who befriends the wife and does not find her demonic beliefs too farfetched a priest who actually believes the evil is presentand knows the source like it is in a priest handbook scenes where the camera is focused on a window and the curtain blows in the windand you jump up screaming of course i do not underestimate the writers and directorsthere is a lot of good horror in this film my verbal rating the conjuring was much better but it was still not badtrue genre modern day horrorif youre looking for seat jumping popcorn dropping soda spitting screaming horror this is the film for youif youre not looking for clich modern horror film dolls weak plot this is not the film for youa mix of the conjuring obv paranormal activity exorcist the beginning chuckydirector rating 610 acting rating 710 horror rating 510 overall rating 5510,astonish
a young couple in santa monica find their lives turned upside down when the husband john ward horton buys her a rare vintage doll in order to complete his wife mias wallis doll collection however john unwittingly purchases a doll that has had a satanic curse put on it by a satanic cult and both the satanic cult and the doll reek havoc on the couple and their new born childafter watching this film i was surprised to discover that there was quite a big difference between the rating of this film and the conjuring at the time of writing this review has a user rating of 54 and the conjuring has a user rating of 75 whilst im prepared to accept that the conjuring is perhaps slightly better overall i really dont feel that is much weaker in comparisonthe directional style of this film is excellent and very much reminded me of wans style in the conjuring i didnt realise it wasnt wan till i saw the end credits some may argue that leonetti is aping wan here but i personally dont care as long as the film moves along a reasonable pace and in the case of a horror film provides me with some good atmosphere and a generally creepy feel about it leonetti achieves this objective by providing long suspenseful sequences  although a lot of what you see here isnt original very little of it feels cheap or gimmicky the only parts that did were the demons randomly appearing out of nowherethe main failings with this film lie with the characters and the story the couple in particular are rather bland and lack any sort of chemistry this aspect is less important in horror films but its still better that its there than not being there whilst wallis showed on occasions that she could be good horton was just dull and wooden the story isnt quite as strong as it is in the conjuring and sometimes the creepiness of the doll and the frantic setpieces are needed to make up for its shortcomingsdespite seeing it all before this film did enough to work for me and the tight running time of 85 minutes means that it never outstays its welcome and never really became boring its far from perfect but i think that a lot of people are being unnecessarily harsh on this prequel,astonish
where to start with this cheap generic rip off of other recently released horror movies pulls out the normal clichd stops closing doors rocking chair sound effect child laughter an oblivious husband and of course an all knowing priest while adding nothing new to the genre nothing here felt surprising at all it didnt even feel like it was well done either unlike the conjuring which was extremely clichd as well but so very well put together that it was good as for the story it just seems to make no sense why the family would continue to own that doll after it was found in the hands of a murderer and then suddenly reappears after being thrown out perhaps the biggest issue with the movie is that the doll itself just isnt effective enough or that we dont see enough of the demon using it as a conduit movies like childs play where the doll had a personality and was unpredictable seem to be more intense because the dolls are more of an actual character rather than a portal for the supernatural i will leave you with this final thought the 15 minutes or so that is featured in the conjuring are far more harrowing and chilling than the whole 90 minutes of ,astonish
the story is just what i stated on the title an application of horrors boring old recipe of having a central object as the main source of the haunting complete with the initial lack of knowledge by the characters and the eventual loss of a life i was quite interested in seeing this movie due to it being a prequel to the conjuring 2013 but honestly besides those meager and small mentioning and cameo appearances theres really nothing to tie this prequel to the original movie its still a scary movie especially if youre someone who enjoy being terrified by those jumpscares but for me this marks a decline in the series quality the acting overall is below standards for me wallis and ward norton both didnt give enough expressions that their characters feel just like cardboard cutouts,astonish
i liked the conjuring more but this wasnt halfbad there are a few good scares and overall its a nice one to watch with your significant other that isnt to say its particularly original because it isnt it does borrow from other movies and peddles some clichs alfre woodards character for one one part i loved was when the woman didnt want to go back to the house after some freaky stuff went down thats very refreshing usually in these movies people return to the house over and over no matter how scared they are of course that was somewhat undone by her being cool with keeping the creepy doll that pops up after being thrown away,astonish
i enjoyed the conjuring i found it to being one of the best haunted house movies in a long while so when i heard they were doing a movie on my first thought was they were gonna do the original story with the two girls but instead i got a film with two characters im not even sure existedfirst of all the film does have a creepy vibe to it which is always a good thing in a horror film something a lot of them lack the doll itself even though it looks nothing like the actual doll is creepy if not a little too clich the atmosphere of fear the doll pours out makes the scares all the more jumpy i jumped several times in factwhat i wasnt too keen on was the insidious demon like creature you see throughout the film i thought it took away from the creepiness and gave it less mystery and more showyother than a few flaws it is a pretty decent film but nothing as good the conjuring by any means,astonish
i must admit this movie did have my heart racing a couple of times it had some pretty genuine scares that were well implemented in my opinion every scene with that dark demon crept me out mostly because i watched it with headphones on in a dark room even to the point were i accidentally knocked my phone to the ground it was quite refreshing to watch because of its effectiveness in some of its scares yes even the most cheesy oneshowever it was still one of the most clich modern horror films i have seen the random door shuts the loud noises the house wife and her hard working husband who at some point will work latecase in point insidious and the conjuring it did also have a slow start which made me think it wasnt going to be a good film despite all its cheesiness and lack of character development i still enjoyed watching it its a good film not great but good and quite scary ,astonish
as a horror movie annebelle is pretty average it doesnt build up very much atmosphere and about 90 of the scares are jump scaresas a movie about a struggling family in the mid20th century id give it a 8 or 9 out of ten they could have taken the horror elements out of the movie and made it about a young aspiring doctor trying to navigate his way successfully through the world while taking care of his pregnant wife and soon to be young child while the world is changing into a new a frightening place around themin other words as a story about its decent but as a saga about john it could have been one of the greatest stories ever told he is a young man fresh out of medical school struggling to find a residency in 60s70s california a time and place of radical transformation for america not only does he have this pressure bearing down upon him of trying to find a secure career while the world around him is changing but he also has to be mindful of his soon to be baby and wife who from the outside probably appears to be going insanehe is a great man always putting others first and always committed to his relationships his wife has a hobby of collecting dolls and wants a super rare one fine he blows the money hes scrapped together for rent for the next few months on it less than a week later she wants it thrown out fine into the trash it goes she sets the house on fire who cares there has been a baby born and we never need to go back to that place again wife is being attacked by two drugged out cultists armed with knives time to go in unarmed and beat them into submission wife is generally freaking out the baby is in danger everything is going to heck time to get angry yell say this is too much im out no lets go to our church for marriage counseling because whatever is wrong can be set right with proper communication and compromisejohn is a great kind loving man the kind that i would like to one day emulate i wish him the best in life he deserves itso if youre looking for a movie because you have a couple hours to kill id take it or leave it as a horror movie if youd like to admire one of the best men whos ever lived then i definitely recommend seeing the saga of john,astonish
ok first things first i have to mention that this short review might have one or another spoilers bellow so stay warned and take care about what you readjust went to a movie theater with my girlfriend and though we both enjoyed the movie its all about the same of course if youre light on the horror genre like my girlfriend youll get a couple of jumps off the seat and will experience some tension here and there but dont expect more than that some parts of the movie are a bit scary and disturbing like the moment the main character realizes that theres something else besides her and her baby in the room lurking in the darkness watching her every step put yourself in such a dark scenery you would st your paints off i bethowever i can say that is a mix between the exorcist rosemarys baby and childs play get the best elements in those great movies put them in mixer and presto youll have i wont even mention the actingat some point of the movie i almost fell asleepthe acting is extremely dullall in all is cool movie for a night of fun with your girlfriend if you really want to stay cozy with her if youre a true horror movie fan like me will notice all the flaws and lack of originality it has that said ill wait for something better to spend my money on,astonish
heavily marketed as a spinoff of the conjuring aims a bit too high for its own good nevertheless it still proves to be a perfectly competent modern horror flick with more than a few effective scares focusing on a young family in 1970s america depicts their struggles initially against a murderous cult then the titular doll who has been possessed by an otherworldly entity it was good that the creative team at least attempted to flesh out the main characters trying to give them substance and warmth as opposed to making them the usual onedimensional sexcrazed teenagers however a lot of the dialoguedriven scenes that strive to do this are poorlywritten and awkward that being said these do still help the audience empathize with their situation the films structure and buildup in terms of suspense could have been more refined particularly in comparison to the conjuring whereas preferably i thought the film should have begun with smaller quieter fright sequences that proceeded to build up to something larger across the course of the narrative instead pounds the audience again and again only to die down for another five minutes this does kill a bit of the films potential momentum but ultimately this structure is redeemed by the sheer effectiveness of some scenes being directed by a previous cinematographer many of s sequences are highly inventive and frankly terrifying shadows and obscure camera angles all assist in this cinematic creativity making sure that youll never look at bedroom doors or stairwells the same way again though it does sometimes falter in terms of its dialogue or its narrative structure gets by on the brilliance of some its fright scenes though by no means as good as the conjuring or any of the horror genres classics is still a worthwhile experience for those who want a decent scare or several,astonish
i was a big fan of the conjuring so when i seen the trailer for i was already hooked it felt like a long wait but it was worth it the film starts the same as the conjuring with some scared nurses saying the doll had been terrorising them and the story goes back and tells the story of how the doll came to be possessed basically a young married couple get there home ransacked by two crazy murdering cult members  who attack and nearly kill them the police save the day but the crazy cult woman dies holding and a drop of her evil blood drips into the dolls eye strange and unlucky things start to happen and the build up is really slow theres not many special effects and the film feels retro my only criticism is theres almost to much background to the story theres quite a big character build up setting the husband and wife scene waiting for the baby but when the frights come they really do deliver the mum mia really is a great actress she is believable but not over the top wish the same could be said for her on screen husband who seems wooden and just limp at first i found him off putting but luckily hes not in it a lotwhen the young couple move to a new home things really pick up pace mia wants to protect her young baby so she reads more into what could be causing the presence and gets help from a priest and makes friends with evelyn from the book store there was a really tense scene where mia goes to the basement and the door gets stuck four or five times it just keeps opening in the basement where theres a devil goat demon awaiting in the dark shadows this bit had me on the edge of my seat the horned demon is very scary a bit like the one in insidious the last twenty minutes of the film is brilliant the story comes together in a great climax with the demon wanting satisfied with a sole and it looks like mia will kill herself to save the baby however the priest and book lady wont let that happen everything appears to end well but of course nobody knows where is but the viewer knows she moves on and ends up terrorising the nurses i love horror films and this was not a disappointment had a feel of drag me to hell mixed with insidious i would recommend this film and i really enjoyed watching it,astonish
i personally thought this film was amazing it was a nonstop thrill ride with a coherent plot and stellar directing this is the peak of film it doesnt get much better than this acting perfection screenplay perfection direction perfect jump scares wowzers i thought silent hill revelations was the best but wow i was proved wrong this movie was fg balls dont watch it this really shows where the horror film industry is going down the fg hilli beg you not to give money to the brain dead slaves who make this s every year just so they can continue to make the crap at the bottom of the bowl,astonish
do not ever watch it  the worst movie i have ever seen a waste of time and money and a total bore for anyone of any age people of the world do not even go close to a cinema while anabelle is on and dont wait for a torrent to downloaded because it is not worth itexcruciatingly slow moving and predictable with bad acting there is no plot worst story you can imagine for a movie did not sympathise with the protagonist i can not understand who vote for this movie more than one stareven if you paid me a million bucks i wouldnt watch that movie again i hope that my comment will save some people from wasting their time and their money for this trash,astonish
terrible acting boring storyline not even remotely scaryi went with a group of friends to watch and was pessimistic before it even started as most horror films are terrible anyway and i wasnt wrong this film is sooo bad that its funny at times every time they build up suspense you know whats coming  its so predictablethe lack of a decent story line could have been forgiven had the film been scary but it wasnt in the slightest even the bits that are supposed to make you jump dont because you can see it coming i was bored to tears and wasted 2 hours of my life that ill never get backdont waste your time folks,astonish
is a spinoffprequel to the hit 2013 horror film the conjuring it tells the story of the creepy doll that eventually fell into the hands of ed and lorraine warrenthe film begins with the scene in the conjuring in which a young woman and her friends came across the doll and have it examined by the warrens it then goes back in time to mia wallis and her husband john ward horton who are expecting their first child john surprises mia with an antique doll that she had her eye on all seems well until a brutal murder happens to the next door neighbors and mia is then attacked by one of the intruders the female intruder then has her blood drip into the dolls eye soon after sinister things begin to happen and mia is convinced that they need to move out of the house however despite their move the presence follows them and the events continue the couple then enlists the help of father perez tony amendola and one of their neighbors evelyn alfre woodward to help solve what is going on is the doll suddenly coming to life or is there something far more darker happening that puts not only the lives of the couple in danger as well as their childit wasnt too long after the success of the conjuring that word of a spinoff would be happening and it certainly didnt take them long to film and release and definitely shows here though the film does feature some fine performances by its cast and we definitely develop an attachment to these characters it also features some fairly welldone chiller moments particularly the invasion scene in the beginning and a certain moment involving the storage unit in the couples apartment however it does feature some major predictable and cheap jump scares that eventually become repetitive not only this but the plot is very much lackluster and provides nothing new as a film overallwhile does feature fine performances likable characters and a couple of chilling scenes it doesnt make up for the fact that there is nothing new to it it is purely an origin film that is completely unnecessary and quite frankly makes the does less freakier than it was in the conjuring it was clearly made just to bank of the conjurings success and the work involved definitely shows thismy rating 510,astonish
this movie was absolutely terrifying not there were literally 4 jump scares the entire movie and most of them were in the trailer the whole movie i felt like someone was literally standing behind a door or wall and simply dropping the doll was a waste of time and money and did no justice to the conjuring i mean some people are comparing it to chuckie when it was not even close overall i give this movie a 410 and wouldnt recommend it to anyone if you do see it do not bring children under 14 to it rating 410 age 14 regardless of all those awful fake footages of how they show the people in the theater freaking out in reality when i saw this movie there were 2 people that had fallen asleep,astonish
while still possessing the same style of conjuring this is obviously a less exciting endeavor the direction is a bit simple and rigid borrowing much from old horror movies and surprisingly not enough sharp tension from the franchise theres a merit on making it elementary creating atmosphere of novel enmity for example but the movie feels lackluster and mediocre instead it still has some few good moments although they timid or a given considering the blaring sound effect or repetitive close up on the doll are eerie by themselvesstory revolves around a married couple who struggles with unfortunate events all the while on the verge of delivering their newborn its a good setback to draw sympathy albeit its rather similar to insidious and admittedly executed not as well wallis as mia gordon and ward horton as john gordon are serviceable and convincing enough as young parents but they appear monotonous at times theres not really much leeway as the plot progresses those who have seen this kind of movie will probably foresee what the next scenes will be conjuring followed this formula too yet it had much more impact and unless theres more intensity in future flicks this recipe grows old quicklythe style and placement of camera are pretty unique it allows audience to guess what lies in the corner this kind of cinematography persists mainly because the director also works on conjuring the problem is lacks the disturbing gripping moments of the same style there is no increasing terror or swooping fright the scares themselves are quite mild in comparison harrowing soundtracks help immensely as well as the screeching noise or screaming infant these are things that ooze fear even outside context so having less horror even with their aid is a little underwhelmingwhat frightening about this style is the fear of unknown after it manifests it loses steam no one wants to see tugofwar with demon doesnt bring any tense buildup nor does she explode in big climax there can only be some much they can squeeze from the doll close up and screeching voices if it wasnt for the conjuring marketing this will be remembered as another average horror film or perhaps it wouldve been better that way,astonish
riding on the coattails of the conjuring and cashing in on that horror movie succeeds when it comes to making money but falls on its face as a horror movie but im getting ahead of myselflets start with the story a man buys a super creepy doll for his pregnant wife  she collects dolls even ugly creepy ones that would give charles manson nightmares  and then they get attacked by cultists a female cultist named is killed by the police and her body is found cradling the creepy doll does the couple move out nope do they get rid of the doll that was cradled by the serial killer woman during her final moments nope do creepy evil things start to happen soon after that yup the clueless couple eventually accept that they are being haunted and after befriending a woman played by alfre woodard who has some experience with the supernatural they figure out what is haunting them and why how to stop the powerful malevolent forcewell thats not so easymy most memorable movie moment of is the scene when levitates and the evil force that is making her rise is shownis told with a leisurely pace  many would call it boring and slow but i didnt mind it too much because it revealed much of the mindset of the female half of the couple and that mindset is crucial to the finale what i did have a problem with is that the scares were too few and far between and the woodard character did something at the end which i found to be out of character although there was a scene in the second act that was supposed to set up what woodard did at the end it still made no sense after i analyzed woodards words and actions it just completely took me out of the movie and my mind was screaming shenanigans mannysmemorablemoviemoments,astonish
honestly i dont know why this film wasnt given to wan the conjuring to film i dont even know where to begin how about with the most obvious fact that the movie strayed so far from the original story if you have to use an overly creepy doll to up the scare factor then right off the bat youre a subpar horror movie director secondly the original story takes place in the 70s not modern daythe movie was a massive clich they took a legitimately scary premise in the wake of the high success of the conjuring and released thisi really feel this should have been the conjuring 2 or at the very least it should have been directed by james wan and starred patrick wilson and vera farmiga ed and lorraine warren in the conjuringhonestly such a massive disappointment something that was supposed to be so great ending up so extremely bad,astonish
i dont understand why people dont like this movie well maybe i do the same happened whit the thai shutter and its called sequence alone the last movie is very good but it has no direct connections with the first one and it is frustrating because of the expectations the same happens with its a good movie with a very simple production storys ok its not a chucky like story i should say that the movie is so simple that i could have made it myself one of the costumes was terrible thats the only reason why im giving 8 because they had funds to do it better but the storys ok and theres something else actually exists search the warrens museum before you watch the movie its a very nice add to the conjuring story but not a sequence neither a prequel so dont expect any links,astonish
i watched this movie with my friends we thought watching a scary movie together would be nice but this movie wasnt scary what so ever after 45 minutes there were only about 3 scary parts that were completely predictableonly the end was interesting but i am talking about the last ten minutes of the movie it was really boring and we didnt see most of the movieif you want to see a real horror movie that is interesting you should watch the conjuring it is nothing like this moviebar,astonish
damnpeople are hard on this film it may not have the budget that the conjuring had but to me thats why i liked it more this movie seemed to give me the same amount of fear factor or even more with less resources and the reason i liked it more is it didnt bank on a women possessed tweaking out and becoming ugly at the end for its payoff like many horror films do instead this movie gave me what other horror movies dontthe actual demon finally a movie went balls out and showed us what was lurking and stalking the characters the design and costume of the demon was good too sometimes you see its arm and other parts but you also get to look it straight in the eyes face to face and no its not just a creepy nun or some weird human its actually a demonic entity well done esp since i thought the movie would just be a different version of chuck ha ha i was pleasantly surprised bad thing is the story esp the ending is mediocre at best but its worth the watch for sure,astonish
the possessed doll genre is such a horror movie clich that anyone attempting it these days needs a damn good excuse however is one of the laziest examples i think ive ever seenintro plot boringly straightlaced couple move into house they get attacked by some manson family style cult but they recover blah blah blah blah blahsomething about a dolli would have a serious job on my hands trying to spoil any further plot development because i didnt notice any let me tryok a few doors slam of their own accord shudder some curtains start mysteriously blowing about in a way that seems excessive considering the apparent weather conditions outside yikesthere is some screaming aaaiiiieeeee the endthe main crime this movie is guilty of  apart from the lead actress being as ineffectual as a lettuce leaf when trying to act scared  is that its no fun i want to be entertained when i watch a horror everything here is done in such a methodical and lacklustre way that its impossible to remotely engage with whats going on or get excited about anything complete waste of time and a chore to sit through,astonish
i really loved the conjuring the long slow build up the intelligent dialogue and also the believability of the characters actions unfortunately  just didnt deliver i had the biggest problem with the script and acting the mother really the major character of the movie was an unlikeable whiny icy blonde who somehow came across as both passive and spoiled with a pinch of arrogance and entitlement thrown in her face was a blank mask no matter what emotion she was supposed to be portraying i just didnt care what happened to her at all not to single her out though the acting was atrocious across the board especially the priest who gets called by the couple the only exception was alfre woodard who played a book shop owner and who also very wisely chose not to be listed in the cast credits i really love slowly building  intelligent horror like the conjuring or the others if you do too this move will disappoint,astonish
okthis movie was so god damn hyped its ridiculous everyone was so hyped because its a dollkiller movie they also stole a lot from other movies to make this one which is pathetic the doll exists in other movies just so people know i wont spoil because its some scenes in this movie that shows itwell if you want to watch a crappy movie about some doll that kills then watch it i guess there are way better dollkiller movies out there like childs play and all those classicsthis was hyped for nothing and i was extremely disappointing i hope the people that made this movie watches this review and realize how bad it was im sorry ive seen pretty much every horror movie out there and this is just beyond baddont waste your time im serious,astonish
after watching the conjuring and being terrified to insomnia by this brilliant movie could not be ignored however it a huge letdown the first time i watched it i guess that like so many others i expected a possessed doll the real version of childs plays chucky sort or lessbut after reading the demonologist which contains a complete chapter about the real story of i realised that the doll was never possessed by a demon according to the warrens demons do not possess dolls or other lifeless objects they only possess people the doll was merely an instrument used by the demon it manipulated the dollso i decided to give the movie another chance and it was actually way better than the first time i watched it i was more able to understand the story that the movie makers were trying to tellof course other than the conjuring less and less in this movie was truly base don the real life story concerning the annabell doll the real doll was a raggedy ann doll not a porcelain dollthe characters in the movie are merely fictional and not base don real people many events were made up for the movie they did not really took placebut i really enjoyed the movie this second time,astonish
i see so many movies at the theaters or on blue ray that i often dont do reviews on most of them i try to the review the ones that stick out in my head for some reason mostly because they were either really good or really bad this is one of the ones that stick out for the latter reason i saw a documentary on the real which this movie is loosely based on watch that instead its more educational factual interesting and actually creepier its also shorter a full length film should not have been made about this its loosely connected to the conjuring as a prequel i guess i dont know i got lost somewhere either because the story was convoluted order i didnt care so much that i zoned out i guess there was a real supposedly haunted doll named and the legend is actually pretty creepy i remember i saw this and ouija together what a disappointing night and i really like horror movies so i usually go easier on them i am tired of pg13 horror movies the sinister movies and green inferno werent great but at least they were a little disturbing enough to keep me from falling asleep also check out the visit m night shyamalan is able to at least create some atmosphere to keep you interested,astonish
i know a lot of people will just slam me for saying this but this is a great classic horror movie it references to 70ies horror moviesexorcist omen  even before that rosemarys baby i thinks theres some good solid acting a lot of nice scares the only negative i can say about it is that it might not be too original but ive been seeing a lot of horrror and this one really pops out for me so i really dont understand why people keep trashing this movie look at it as a tribute to those directors that made fantastic horrors close your curtains put the volume on high and appreciate this one like i did glad i didnt listen to all my friends who said it was trash,astonish
surprisingly good haunting flick satanists breaking and entering murder demonic possession clichs recycled from sensationalistic 1960s tabloid news but it all comes together well in this followup to the pointlessly titled the conjuring smaller cast helps keep this more focused than the conjuring and great set designs add to the films atmospheremy problem with this was its pacing as the first thirty minutes with the vicious manson familyesque attack the most frightening to me while the films second act has its fair share of scares the entire ordeal falls apart in a ridiculous and predictable finale,astonish
yeah the doll is creepy looking and there is one slightly nightmarish elevator scene but besides that there is nothing worth seeing in this movie everything has been done before in other horror genre many times except it has been done better there is no real tension or suspense in this one and everything just seemed forced most of the time and when i mean forced i mean it seems like the director and writers was just making stuff up as they go it might have worked for a few minutes in the conjuring but for a full 1 hour and 30 minute spinoff it really really really drags the only thing topnotch about this movie is how predictable it is overall this is a waste of time especially if you are a horror fan2310,astonish
arent horror films suppose to be scary if not always then how about creative writing the only thing scary about was her poor application of makeup s antics consists of two events one being moved from one location to another by studio prop person two being very briefly suspended by wire to make it appear as if she was floating but looked cheesy cheap just hanging there by wire might not have been so bad if it wasnt the same old retread of doll being possessed and out to make human life miserable cant satan just choose some other animal be easier usual priest participation and tragic depends on pointofview ending could have saved himself a lot of grief if hed just hung a crucifix blessed and holy watered around annas neck did i forget the usual cute babychild as tugaheart hook i wonder if thats ever been done usual occult female usually black for that haiti voodoo hook bookstore adviser,astonish
i had heard this movie was not as good as the conjuring but i thought id give it a try big mistakethis movie is a lazy badly written horror movie irrational behavior throughout the movie  a mother thinks her house is haunted but leaves her child alone every chance she gets she even goes shopping and looking for books and have chats outside with her child nowhere to be seen people seem to wonder inside the house and first thing she does is leave the room and her child alone makes senseshe even gets to the trouble of buying a satanic book a horror movie clich but never ever occurs to get rid of the doll oh wait she did in the first 20 minutes of the movie but then decides to have it back againthe actress is very good looking but fails to deliver  her screams are blatantly faked poor editingmovie is predictable and not scary at all you will waste your time if you watch this one,astonish
thats it thats my review this film is drawn out and boring at the 45 minute mark i thought it was nearly over time slowed down that much and its not boring because of bad cgi or bad acting or bad scares  because there is none of that in it theres nothing in it the demon guy pops up in a cool shot or two but meh the whole film is like watching porridge cook in a microwave for an hour and a half210 from me and most of that is for the production valuesok so apparently i need to write more to pass the imdb submission test so um theres a piece of paper on my desk its a bit warped because i spilt water on it some more paper under my keyboard with some notes on and some paper in the bin if you think this review is now getting boring youre going to hate ,astonish
a prequel of the conjuring starts off with a couple who bring home a mysterious looking doll in advance for the baby they are expecting soon but along with it start to happen weird things including an attempt of a cult couple to try to kill them and paranormal phenomena wherever they go its upto them now to find out who or what is behind all this and how the doll is related to iti got really scared in theater  more than conjuring the film couldve definitely been made scarier but was quite scary even otherwise all actors have plated their parts well the music score fits with the film effects are remarkable for a horror flick but all in all ultimately its almost the same old stereotypical ghost film  a ghost woman ghost girl ghost doll paranormal phenomena and exorcismonly in a different formno harm watching,astonish
alright ill make this one short and sweet i went to see this movie because i wanted a silly little spooky doll flick about a spooky doll doing spooky doll stuff what i got was a lifesappingly boring marriage drama featuring special guest appearances by generic ghost girl 43894337 and beelzebub directed by a man with a fetishistic obsession with utterly pointless zoomins what made this whole thing plummet down to a 2starrating for me despite its rather high production values were the completely vacuous characters and their neverending conversations filled with nothing but tired platitudes and forced melodrama after 40 minutes of scenes alternating between stale babble and the female lead gawking concernedly at random things while the camera takes twelve years to zoom in on nothing i just wanted it all to be over,astonish
the doll appeared for the first time in the conjuring during a prologue which didnt have much to do with the rest of the film however it seems that it had enough resonance with many spectators in order to bring it its own film and now in the film we know the origin of the doll and its curse the result is competent even though it can be noticed the fact that the screenplay was written hurriedly with the intention of making some additional dollars until the official sequel of the conjuring comes in screenwriter gary dauberman employed all the available clichs from the modern supernatural cinema baby in danger electrical disturbances skeptic husband benevolent priest who underrates the danger expert in occultism who has the exact book to explain the situation well the list is endless i think that the only absent clich was the swarms of insects on the positive side has some good moments of tension accentuated by a sober atmosphere which brings credibility and a based on a true story sensation the film doesnt presume itself to be so but its probably inspired on the legend of robert the haunted dummy in conclusion i can give a moderate recommendation to despite not being something very original or highly memorable because i found it a decent horror film which managed to keep me entertained,astonish
i am a fan of the horror movie genre i often go into new horror films at the cinema never expecting too much but for some reason even though i have seen countless crap horror films i still go whenever a new one is out i wasnt expecting too much from i hadnt seen any trailers read any reviews and had seen very minimal advertising for this movie all i knew when i entered the cinema was that it is a spin off to the conjuring i was a very big fan of the conjuring and it is one of my favourite horrors in recent yearsthe film is set before the conjuring and tells the story of how the doll becomes possessed and how it effects its first owners lives it starts with the doll moving around on its own popping up in different places and slowly moves on to much more less subtle and more haunting thingshas a similar feel to the conjuring and even the insidious films it has similar styles with similar music and builds its tension in a way that you sit there watching it thinking have i seen this before now dont get me wrong wont win any oscars it is far far from perfect but it does offer some good jumps good scares and an average storyline which is decent enough for a 90 minute horror flickthe problem with these films which is a problem with most modern horrors is that they are so clichd that it becomes tedious and dj vu like the tension builds the nervy music begins the camera pans around and you are simply waiting and expecting something to happen nothing ever seems to be out of the box or unexpected there are some ways that i believe this movie could have ended and the director could of took a few risks and took a different approach but once again the director opts for the easy way out and follows the clichsthe acting also leaves a lot to be desired the main leads are not very convincing especially the character of john gordon the character evelyn is trying too hard to be mysterious and it carries on for so long that you lose interest and dont really care about this woman and her story the script is not great and some of the dialogue is very questionableoverall offers some good jumps and does its job well enough to warrant viewing it i wouldnt say you should rush to the cinema for this one buy is certainly worth a watch when it comes out on dvdsky movies710,astonish
this movie attracts 15 year old kids who just want to be jumpscared and talk through the whole movie and it succeeds with that i would agree that it is a scary movie at some times but it is far too predictable and sometimes cheesy as a prequel to the conjuring i had great expectations and was highly disappointed and now to spoilers the ram guy was unnecessary and far too similar to the demon in insidious a great scary movie btw it would have been enough with the couples daughter holding and controlling the doll i understand that they wanted to have the ram there because he is a scary creature and makes for some scary moments and jumpscares in the movie but sometimes less is more overall the movie was well made but does not compare to the conjuring in any aspect,astonish
a large vintage doll possessed by a demon bent on reaping a fresh new soul brings death and disorder to a young married couple in the early 1970s the scares and jolts seen in its predecessor the conjuring arent nearly as prevalent this time around to the point where one begins to relax or even doze offis about the events leading up to the events that lead up to those in the conjuring mia and john gordon wallis and ward horton are about to be parents john is harried by his stressful life as a med student and to make up for aloof attitude he locates and purchases an old large doll for his wife whos been searching for the doll for years but this fairly tale story is quickly shattered when in the middle of the night the gordons are attacked by a crazed duo who injure the pregnant mia before themselves dying by bullet or knife one of the attackers is the estranged daughter of the gordons neighbors the higgins who have also been slaughtered the gordons move to a new place as would we allconfined to bed rest for the final month of her pregnancy mia experiences some strange happenings she hears whispers she sees things she nearly dies in a kitchen fire its the doll i tell you  its always something material how else would a demon house itself while waiting for a soul to take its just logic in any event john and mia enlist the help of their local priest father perez tony amendola who is himself badly injured when he attempts to take the doll into his church for safekeeping yes its clear to all that demons are at work herewhile watching this i waited and wondered for the good stuff to come the genuine scares the first hour or so contains little of what might be considered a scare its not that the frights are inexpertly presented its that there arent any to speak of a lot of exposition appears instead i began to hope that this would all be a setup for a cathartic finalemia becomes friends with a local bookstore owner evelyn alfre woodward who also lives in the gordons apartment complex coincidentally evelyn had lost a child following an auto accident for which evelyn feels plenty of guilt this becomes important during the finale which is over almost before you know its beguntheres some nifty sleight of hand in but since everyone in the movie as well as the audience agrees wholeheartedly that the demon does exist and that mia isnt imagining things theres no real suspense to be found even husband john goes along with things eventually such an understanding husband because everyone knows in their heart that these weird things are actually happening theres no ambiguity about whether mia is losing her mind shes notshort on horror and long on talk is a mediumlow heat setting on a gas grill your food will get cooked eventually but you may fall asleep waiting for it to come to its inevitable conclusion,astonish
i have to say that i was scarred few times and and i yawned few times and some period i was tense other periods i was boredi mean they made so many of these types of films in last few years that they all started to look alikeplot was similar to same types of plots for these kind of films and i did not find it very originalvisual effects were good and scary moments were scary in few instances but over all it was all similar to the films made in the few years back and i have to say the were fairacting was ok but again nothing spectacular i have to say it was acting was fairall in all if you like these types of films this one is for you otherwise do not loose any sleep over missing this one,astonish
i had been anxiously awaiting this movie for nearly three months being a james wan junkie i could barely sit on my hands until hit theaters i mean come on demonic doll tries to slaughter beautiful young family where could it go wrong and yet somehow it managed to go wrong in every possible way i hadnt thought and even created a few more ways to go wrong along the wayif i could describe the movie  it would be indecisive demon terrorizes family for sacrifice only to turn out to be perfectly comfortable accepting just about anybody the movies core meat and potatoes nearly had to take a backseat to the unnecessarily extended amount of footage allotted to absolutely nothing literally nothing family washing dishes family changing baby family goes shopping husband and wife talking about how much they love each otherdont get me wrong the most effective horror movies invite the audience into a sense of normality before striking hard and heavy  but the scares in could have happened regardless of those scenes or at least with less than half of the ones that there wereyou should leave a horror movie feeling the resonating chills still tickling your neck just left me frustrated and more focused on my leftover popcorn then what i had just watchedall that being said there were some clever scenes that were pleasing cinematographically and were really the only reasons i didnt rate it even lower the chase up the staircase midmovie for instance or the basement storage roomelevator scene i had thought was japanese horror movie goodultimately what scared me the most about the movie was that it had amazing potential and wasted the vast majority of itand that pies me off,astonish
story how a raggedy ann doll turns into something more than just raggedy and the trouble it creates in the lives of a couple pretty sums up the plot line of horror elements let me begin by saying that i am one of the millions who went in expecting a conjuringpar movie but what i found was a horror movie which became a victim of its own success the hype created around its making was not completely satisfied as the best scenes were revealed in the teasers and trailers and some of other horror elements turned out to be for the lack of better word predictable like injury from a sewing machine baby being the centre plot and some morebut i am not going to deny yes the movie did have some of its own horror elements the carpetmoment noisesontop moment but they were just not enough to satisfy the thirst lack of too many characters lack of an indepth into the cult mentioned lack of in depth about the said demon presence of demon in very few frames all let to an ending which felt more like abrupt than like an end if anything the popcorns jerked inside the tub but none of it overflew while for the conjuring almost all of it spilled with some of them flying to the back seatsthe absence of the stewardship of james wan was felt on the whole with a few more gripping elements in the early half the movie would have become more likable but still far from the conjuringeffectin short conjuring2 victim of its own success,astonish
i saw starring wallisxmenfirst class the tudorstv and yes she has the same first name as the doll ward horton the wolf of wall street one life to livetv alfre woodard12 years a slave star trekfirst contact and tony amendolaonce upon a timetv the mask of zorrothis is a prequel to the 2013 movie the conjuring this movie gives you more background story on the mysterious doll that if you remember was kept in a glass case and people were told to not open the case or disturb the doll in any way because it was dangerous now you can find out why the actressand ward are a married couple that are expecting a baby in 1969 ward gives her a dollto fit into her doll collection and at this point it is just a plain nonpossessed doll although it does look a little creepy then their next door neighbors have a problem with a couple of satanic cultist who go on a murderous rampage and end up at ward  s house during the excitement the doll is infected by one of the cultist and things are set into motion alfre plays a book store owner that befriends the actressand of course has books on just the right subjects tony plays the local priest there has to be a priest in this type of movie that has knowledge about how to get rid of demons and evil spirits it does have a few descent scares but its not quite as good as the conjuring was although she moves from one place to another place the dollis not actually shown moving around on her ownlike a chucky doll i guess they did not have the budget to animate her its rated r for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour  39 minutes its not one that i would buy on dvd but it would be alright as a rental,astonish
i went to see on the good faith i felt towards the movie it was spun off from the conjuring to put things in perspective i enjoyed the conjuring but didnt find it particularly frightening once they revealed it was another exorcism movie however the cinematography and the repeated tendency to make legitimately scary scenes without relying on jump scares earned some serious respect from me and i went into this expecting a similar experience it was not to befirst off the clichs in this movie are overwhelming from the disbelieving husband to the wise old black woman who dispenses sage advise when exposition is needed this film hits on all the tropes we got used to seeing in horror movies back in the 80s it also relies heavily on jump scares to trick the audience into thinking its scary when you use wind to make the audience jump then you are probably doing it wrong they heavily foreshadow certain elements and devices in several places only to have it either turn out to be completely irrelevant or a total letdown early on they keep showing her at a sewing machine with her fingers right next to the needle while she distractedly watches tv whats going to happen you wonder will the machine whir violently out of control will the ghost startle her so much that her fingers get stabbed and sewn up the answer is none of those things she accidentally cuts herself watching tv but then washes it off like nothing happened and goes back to work then the house catches fire not because of the sewing machine thoughthere are also certain plot points introduced only to never be explained such as a symbol thats left upon her arm that she finds in an occult book of course theres an occult book lying around why wouldnt there be they point out that its from a cult but never explain what the mark itself means my friend had to tell me it was some mark of a rams head but i thought it looked like a really shoddy attempt at writing the letter a in cursive its also a little strange that the demon left the mark on her arm just by grabbing her only to have it disappear a short time lateroh yeah i forgot to mention that theres a demon in this movie apparently even the director realized that a possessed doll wasnt very scary and decided to have a demon appear halfway through to scare the woman this made no sense since up until this point it seemed pretty clear that it was a cultist lady who was possessing the doll so it turns out that a demon was moving it around the entire time why well supposedly its a link to our world for the demon to come through even though he has no problems leaving it far behind can seemingly teleport it at will and whose very presence seems to change the entire tone of the story it makes it even more nonsensical in that there is no reason for the doll to be moving around if the demon is just picking it up and moving it when nobody looks then why what does that gain him is he just messing with everybody when you realize that this entire movie is basically about a demon playing with dolls it becomes a lot less scarywhats sad about the demon is that his main appearance in which he confronts the girl in the basement is actually really damn scary however since its more or less his only real scene i couldnt help but feel it was extremely pointless im not even sure right now if the movie was about the doll or the demon since it was that exact moment that the entire movie derailed itself into an unfocused mess that left me with more questions than i was likely supposed to have about the filmthis is a movie i really wanted to like because of the conjuring but since the audience kept laughing throughout the film except for some highschool girls sitting in front of me who kept whispering how they were about to cry only to turn around after the movie and assure each other that they totally werent scared you guysi feel like im not alone in the assessment that it was actually a comedy in disguise a comedy with some scary bits to be sure but a comedy none the less,astonish
its hard to think of many horror movies as boring and pointless as this onei dont think i ever really understood what the central premise was about is it a haunted doll or is the area around the doll haunted are we supposed to be scared of the doll is the doll dangerousit also made me reflect that so many of the jump scares would be so much more effective if they werent always accompanied by abrupt notes on the soundtrack its like a laughtrack on a lame sitcom if its scary we dont need the movie to tell us sothe conjuring is no masterpiece but this makes it look good,astonish
they try so hard to creep you out with the dolls face personally i dont find it scary at all that you just get used to it i mean you already know the doll from the posters trailers previous installments etc but still they insist on relying on the creepy doll to engage and try to scare their audience the problem with so much emphasis on that prop a forsaken story whose linearity fails to build tension and also makes the plot easily predictableacting was bad specially that of mia additionally we have plot holes for instance there were no solid basis on why anabelle decided to possess that specific doll and haunt that specific family would have she attacked the forms had not john enterd her parents house that night if the demons ultimate goal was to devour  a soul why waste so much time haunting a mother and not just take away the baby as soon as possible also why on earth would evelyn get so deeply involved with that family to the point of taking her own life to save the babymaybe there are more unanswered questions but my point has been made,astonish
is one of the most incredible movies i have ever watched i went to go watch it in theaters with my friends and my family the only part that made me scream was when the devilish finger popped out at us i screamed and flung popcorn every where and throw my feet um on my seat my brother started to cry so he berried his face in the bucket of popcorn that was the best night ever i have never watched a movie with so much going on and all had to do with a doll with rosy pink cheeks after that i had dreams about having a doll like her and it was amazing but frighting at the same time after i watched the movie i wanted a doll like for the longest time ever my mother told me i was crazy,astonish
well those are 99 minutes im never getting back i was warned about this movie but i didnt listen the acting was so horrible it was laughable the plot was clich and predictable and the jump scares were really stupid the movie is called who is a haunted doll that taunted and tortured people therefore the doll should have more screen time but she hardly shows up or does anything chucky from childs play was way scarier is nothing compared to him this movie was so unoriginal i had to force myself to keep looking at the screen it literally made me want to pull an evelyn and jump out of a building i have never been more disappointed by a movie ever everyday i keep losing faith in hollywood and the movie industry i think next time ill listen when someone tells me about a crappy movie total waste of time and money,astonish
the film is badly acted by a cold unemotional wife who never really expresses any real fear or happiness an example was when she first got the doll took about 2 minutes to acknowledge it or when she is attached before entering into the elevator or when it chases her up the stairs disjointed film where sewing machine gets more attention i mean whats with the constant sewing theirs also the fact that she never seems to get thats its evil rather she calls the police i mean seriouslyfilm had such potential but only really gets good towards the end could have been done sooo much better,astonish
i hate scary movies they do their job and scare me that i cant sleep for days but the trailers for annebelle made me want to watch the movie waited til the movie was on dvd and got it from netflix i was expecting at least a 2 hour movie when i read it was only 99 minutes i thought it was strange but still was expecting a very scary movie the movie was slow boring and not scary at all reading about the real doll is scarier then this movie the only people this movie might scare are children not even worth watching on halloween not even in a dark room all alone you wont be scared one bit best to watch a scary movie made a long time ago when scary movies were actually scary i watched this with my mother and brother both said this movie was not scary and they watch scary movies a lot,astonish
got this movie out just to see if it lived up to the hype with the creepy looking doll strange noises satanic cults and the idea of demons hunting for souls  nope i think the idea has some premise but a plot that moved at a snails pace and the lack of truly jump out of your skin scares made it a total bomb if the characters had realised that their doll was the reason for the bizarre happenings earlier then the film may have been rescued by a supernatural v human battle with flying objects invisible pulling hands a la paranormal activity and scary voices that sounded like they were pulled from the depths of hell while it might be a frightfest for tweens and teens sadly this adult found herself twiddling her thumbs with boredom,astonish
if youre like me and you enjoyed insidious 1  2 and the conjuring then you were probably thrilled at the thought of a movie about that evil doll alluded to in the conjuring and part of the warrens legendary case files having read up on the famous demonologists and knowing the true story of i was excited to see the idea continued from that brief tease of them interviewing the hapless nurses at the beginning of the conjuring well i was wrong instead i got yet another even briefer tease that launched into one of the lamest most boring horror films since the apparition if the writers had just stuck with the warrens story they would have had ample material for a good horror flick instead they cooked up some prequel crap following a boring couple in the 1960s in many scenes its as if they forgot the doll was a key component of the movie and would cut the camera over to her face as if to say oh yeah the dollshes evil and stuffright the actors seemed like cardboard cutouts with no dimension or points of interest its not all there fault as the script seemed like a first draft from a middle school creative writing class even the great alfre woodard was wasted given a clich role the spiritualist occult bookstore owner with a past that knows more than meets the eye and no good dialogue there was very little conflict save the female protagonists supposed decent into madness which came off like she was just a little agitated and would benefit from a valium and a nap more than being bogged down by the forces of evil there was literally nothing scary about this filmnothing i recall only one uncomfortable moment toward the end involving the couples baby which was more disturbing and turned out to be a red herring anyway the rest is pretty tame the entity which appears for a split second in the film  la captain howdy isnt a fraction as terrifying as the lipstick demon in insidious frankly ned flanders playing the devil in one of the simpsons tree house of horror segments was scarier as a viewer i could tell the filmmakers were going for a rosemarys baby meets the exorcist vibe but they failed miserably dont waste your time with this just read the account of the warrens and at night alone and use your imagination whatever you come up with will be 100 times better than this steaming turd of a movie,astonish
very bad film lacked in storyline and only consisted of occasional jump scares with loud high pitched sounds the doll was basically irrelevant as it didnt move or show any potential of life with just camera close up shots of the doll in different positions to state its moved on its own this film tried to follow the film chucky but failed miserably as the chucky doll is more threatening and the audience know that the doll is a true killer who will have an impact to the storyline this film should have brought the doll to life as it was only scary only down to its personal appearance which lost its impact,astonish
it is well known by studios that horror movies make the most profit per dollar invested is a product of this way of thinking the film has nothing setting it apart from other horror films its not scary because it completely lacks a creepy atmosphere and the only way they get you to jump out of your seat is with loud noises thats why they are called jump scares this movie is so mellow and relaxed it made me fall asleep after about 45 mins in short its a money grab an artistically failed fabrication devoid of any inspiration its doesnt add anything to the genre or the realm of movies in general so you can happily skip this one and spend your time watching a good film instead,astonish
i actually went to watch with a very open mind since i didnt actually know anything about it needless to say that i was actually thoroughly deceived in terms of horror this would be typically the kind of film that i would advise to introduce somebody who is not originally a fan of horror movies into them so much this thing is actually considerably far from being a horror moviethe thing that actually annoyed me the most in this film is the complete lack of action whatsoever  the whole thing is just a complete snoozefest and the way that you feel that the suspense is completely forced and pushed to the limit as a way to scare people which overall resulted in failures i actually paid 12 or something to watch it back then in october and boy that was a waste,astonish
every body went into theaters to see another conjuring or at least expecting that level or may be betterbut i am sorry to say that had the worst assembled cast specially the lead girl with fake expressions no goose bumps or chills guys just a scene or tooi am disappointed they have mislead the audience and were feeding only on the conjuringas a horror genre fan is a disgrace to the genre itself no story connection lowbudget  awfully long filled with boredom script was definitely poor no fault of the director he did a good job but the actors should have applied for a better institution for trainingfyi conjuring was one of my favourite horror film of all time disappointed dont watch itwaste of time nbi,astonish
watched it with 51 surround sound at 2am  yet this didnt scare me a sh the bgm which is supposed to be a lethal weapon for a horror movie fails miserably but visual effects were bit convincing thoughmoreover this movie had a senseless plot despite mia knew that her previous house was haunted  it was very much because of the doll yet she takes it to pasadena so that movie could be dragged on to test our nerves also there were no convincing characters to do some justice for this moviescares you only if youre compelled to get scared ,astonish
prequel to the prologue from the conjuring tells the origin of the evil that haunts a sinister childs doll named as an expectant young coupleplayed by wallis and ward horton are beset by demonic evil after both they and their neighbors are attacked by a satanic couple who conjure up a demon that is hell bent on securing an offered soul before it will go away and a friendly bookshop ownerplayed by alfre woodard does what she can to help no matter the cost surprisingly good film finds the right balance between suspense and character development keeping clichs to a minimum while offering several effective scares and nicely filling in the back story to the doll which leads right back to the conjuring,astonish
i just watched this movie today and i still cant get over the whole elevator staircase demon scene it was so unique and that alone made this movie so much more enjoyablethere were also some other amazing jump scares that were unfortunately ruined by the trailer the actors performances however were mixed but i think that was just the scripts fault which was the worst part of this film since it was pretty cheesy but everything else was surprisingly decent overall its a very fun movie that you can enjoy especially this month coughhalloween but its not really a masterpiece like the conjuring,astonish
this is one of the scariest movies i have seen it has a great story line it also has great acting it also has great special effects it is very scary the conjuring movie are a little better but still this a great movie it got a 54 which is a good ratting but still 54 is to low for this movie i give it 10 out of 10 it is very scary if you want to see a really scary movie then see this movie it is very scary it will scary you if it does not scary you no movie will it is very scary it is scary then the exorcist and that is not easy to do it is true the the conjuring is scarier so is the conjuring 2 but that is about the only two movie that are scarier,astonish
i read the user reviews and i just cant understand how people rate this movie so high it contains nothing new to the horror genre and it uses almost every clich there is like a chair that starts moving or a lp player that starts playing music even though it was tuned off im aware that using clichs can sometimes be a fun and smart way to homage the genre or even other movies but when they do it in this movie it just feels old and unimaginative we have seen that in soooo many movies before sure i can take that some of these clichs are being used to set a scary tone but when they stack them in every other scene i just get disappointed and annoyed instead of getting thrills the characters has also been seen in a lot of movies before paranormal things happens to a woman husband dont believe her paranormal things happens again husband believe her it gets so annoying seeing this all the time a lot of the jump scares were to predictable all though i have to admit that there was a few scenes that got me scared like when childran towards mia and then turned into adult ill give this movie 410 and that is still being nice,astonish
should have used better effects the demon could have been a lot better not just a man with costume who looked like the cousin of insiduouss demon which was pretty lameme and my girlfriend were expecting a lot more of this moviediscovery channels a haunting is much scarier than thisit was disappointingit also evolved too slow and took too long for the conclusionalso missed the next owners and the intervention of the warrensthis could be a second part i guess most of us expect that it could be much betterthanks for the attentiongreetings from colombia nicholas,astonish
is the prequel of sorts to the 2013 horror hit the conjuring it revolves around john and mia a young married couple who are expecting their first child john purchases the disturbing doll which apparently was missing from mias extensive doll collection things start to go awry and terrifying events start to happen at the purchase of this doll mia and john seek the help of a friendly bookstore owner and a priest two horror clichs in one movie and the twists and turns ensue this movie had one great thing going for it its premise many fans of the conjuring myself included have been looking forward to this since hearing of its announcement and release date unfortunately it did not deliver the scares that its predecessor did the scares in were few and predictable as they were shown in the overplayed preview the characters were not developed enough for me to care that much for them and the overall plot was generic and forgettable going in i though this movie was going to be good or maybe very good but certainly not great i left thinking it was subpar to average i wouldnt say dont see because the curiosity is definitely there especially for fans of the conjuring i will say dont expect much,astonish
the doll is cursed and ends up in the hands of the expectant mother this movie reminds me of the childs play movie from the 1980s and an episode from the original twilight zone 19591964 which is called i believe living doll from 1963 at the beginning of the movie i could see the year was not 2014 by looking at the cars on the street yet i was not sure what year it was suppose to be when i saw the newspaper and the year was 1970 i remember that year because i was 21 years old yet i do not remember dialing 911 to call the police or an ambulance i do remember dialing 0 to call the operator to get the police or an ambulance nevertheless the movie did have some scares and i would recommend anyone who wants to be scared or to use a figure of speech  get on the roller coaster ride for a while if you like that sort of thing to go see that movie,astonish
where do i even begin with this one i just came back from seeing this and i am near angry from what i saw it is best to read this if you have not seen this if you do then you have been warned okay so the movie has nothing to do with the real legend and the doll itself is so ugly who would even want it the real doll is a simple raggedy anne doll this thing looks like a monstrosity the acting was pretty decent from mia and her character is not as stupid as most in this genre but a lot of this movie insults your intelligence the husband is a generic loving husband but he has a soso screen presence the rest of the people seem just around in order to be killed off andor attacked by the doll is all hollywooded up creepy eyes looks like a boy doll creepy realistic eyes they should have kept the doll as a simple looking doll especially if it was authentic looking to the real doll that would obviously be desirable no they had to make it look all creepy this alone may actually hurt sales of the movie which i feel is deservedthe story again just as an excuse for things to happen a couple are about to have a baby he buys her a doll because he feels guilty said doll happens to be possessed by a demon weird things start to happen building in intensity until the final confrontation of evil yepmust be a typical generic hollywood horror movie plot a lot of boredom hits you as the story is just like watching a typical newborn baby toting couple trying to make it in this world radios go off on their own sewing machines devil worshipers kill neighbors and try to attack the main characters that is when you know stuff is getting real the real doll was a raggedy anne doll that was owned by two nursing students the doll would be found moved from where last left impossibly standing on its own and weird things would happen james wan should have kept the story as the legend as the real story was a lot scarier than this generic talethere is some pretty scary looking scenes the ones who had the demon in them were well done even if he looked like a black version of the demon from insidious the doll itself never moves it just sits or lays there looking menacing it also gets more and more ugly as the movie progresses james wan claims that he would have had issues with the raggedy anne right holders but he could have made the doll alive instead it just seemed like a demon around the doll not contained within iti am so sick of hollywood messing up my favorite ghost stories an american haunting and now what i went to see was the legends unfold on film instead an american haunting had little to do with the actually bell witch legend and blamed the haunting on john bell molesting his daughter how would you like your ancestors to be be chastised by hollywood if i was a descendant of the bell family i would be outraged by that is very poorly executed often boring and all about convenience instead of a thing called plot horrible and disappointed,astonish
whilst the storyline premise itself was unusual it was shot exceptionally well and the cinematography was great but the whole movie was predictable with shots set up to scare people and is just plain lazyfor example for some oddball reason the husband gifts his pregnant wife the most ugliest and freakishly creepy looking of dolls  annabella yeah thats right  the husband brings evil into his loving family home and the wife places the doll front and centre in their childs nurserywhysadly it has too many jump scares in this movie in the end i just said to hell with it and watched it with captions and on mute the characters were making stupid choices where i just couldnt give a rats about themis a better movie than the conjuring the answer is no the conjuring is a far more superior movie still if you want to watch all the movies in the conjuring universe is a must watch movie,astonish
i cant take seriously a movie were the main antagonist looks like a doll version of a granny m1dget pr0stitute of the 20s i wouldnt have a problem if the movie didnt take itself seriously but this is a james wan related film so you know thats not the case this movie is a bad acted bac writed boring and nonsensical piece of crap avoid this for your life,astonish
this movie is so boring and not scary at all the plot is slow and the characters are plain spare yourself the bore,astonish
the actors are really talented and so terrific such as wallis ward horton and eric ladin it is very scary and terrifying as for the sound effects they are matching with the action scenes i thought the movie was literally incrediblemovie is interesting to follow the quality and visual effect of movie are amazing and mindblowing it reminds me of the movie chukie the plot is captivating original and gave me chills  i was really stressed when i saw this movie i was terrified the movie is vastly entertaining and unpredictable its just a masterpiece i was amazed in front of the movie its the best ive ever seen its impossible that you dont like this film it was an unforgettable experience i think its worthseeinggo go go,astonish
as a horror fan i never quite understand what you guys love so much about the conjuring but anabelle is way superior than the conjuring the references with rosemarys baby drive me crazy,astonish
there is nothing like a story about a haunted doll without much doll the film centers around mia wallis who is trying to save her newborn child from being demonically possessed from a demon currently in the doll like vampires souls must be offered to the demon before they can come in our couple dont know how to destroy the doll no matter how hard they dont try the local priest helps them out with advice as it seems demons inside of dolls is common placeelectrical devices turn on by themselvesooh scary and mia runs around frantically in the dark for about half the film they could have easily cut about 30 minutes out of the middle and no one would noticethe production could have shown us some cult activity maybe see the doll do something horrific nope too low budget it was just a bad script with actors who couldnt pull it off overhypedchucky really spoiled meparental guide no fbombs sex or nudity,astonish

right after watching the conjuring i really wanted to see what i got was a boring movie with only a couple of good scares it doesnt add anything new instead of actually showing the doll do scary things they show demons and ghosts i wanna see the exposition is interesting but it takes to long things started happening 1 hour into the movie even then theres like a 10 minute boring scene after each 3 minute scary scene the ending scene is the worst though it doesnt even make any sense,astonish
wow disgrace to james wan the acting and directing is bad in a very bad way in the conjuring she was terrifying af but in this film its just laughablei expected more from this film 110 at best,astonish
have you went to see this movie because you found the doll creepy and interesting you will be very disappointed because she does not move or speak at all in the movie unlike chucky,astonish
too many absurdly loud moments i have to turn volume all the way up just to hear the people talking then bam ahhhhbh extremely loud sounds and music i shouldnt have to adjust the volume 100 times through a 90 minute movie and why is so big the real doll doesnt look as interesting but why is like a midget seriously stop making movies with inconsistent volume,astonish
this is horror movie seriously guys i am very disappointed very much ,astonish
catching up on the franchise before we watch the nun i actually forgot that i had already seen this truly i thought wow howd i miss that started watching it and it all came back i found myself making jokes outloud instead of being scared like when the boring wife hears the sewing machine and comes around the corner i said watch is making something how about i cant live in that house anymore so instantly move into an apt that is 3 times the size of the house before yeah id be happy too oh you threw away that creepy doll and now its somehow in the moving box in our new place i know its perfect overlooking the crib you see the scary cult lady that killed herself in your tiny house while holding that creepy doll its not a bad idea to leave the baby alone while you go down to the buildings basement to recycle a box the scariest part in the movie was watching that poor adorable baby have books falling all around her honestly it was pretty bad like someone else said the movie is the demon playing with a doll instead of the possessed doll we all came to see,astonish
very average i expected more from this watch creation much better movie and addition,astonish
this is by far the weakest movie ive seen from the conjuring franchise which i almost expected seeing as most of marketing seemed to be riding on the creepiness of the doll they have createdthe plot of this movie left a lot to be desired but the whole story seemed like exactly what it was a spinoff i felt no real connection to any of the characters and to be honest i couldnt have cared less if they lived or died the rest of the franchise has put a lot of emphasis on character development but i didnt feel any of that in this moviei dont have much to say about the acting which i suppose is a good thing great screamqueen material from wallis which could have saved this movie if they had given me even the slightest reason to care about her character as with the rest of the series the look and sound of this movie is top quality and you can tell there is a lot of expertise that goes into the cinematography and sound design of this movie i thought the scares were one of this films best qualities with a few moments that really made my jaw drop but unfortunately there were too many lulls between these moments to keep my full attention throughoutwith all that being said this is a perfectly competent horror movie that is more than worthwhile if you are a horror fan and absolutely not one to miss if you are a fan of the wanflanagan brand of horror,astonish
when medical student john ward horton buys a rare vintage doll for his pregnant wife mia wallis the last thing he expects is for his gift to become a source of unimaginable evil but thats precisely what happens after mansonlike satanic cultists violently attack the couple in their home and somehow turn the doll into a conduit for a demontheres a nailbiting moment in where mia is absentmindedly using a sewing machine her fingertips getting nearer and nearer to the rapidly moving needle it promises to be very nasty indeed but winds up being frustratingly tame thats the main problem with it never really delivers take the films demon for example it provides a handful of lame jump scares but it never actually does any serious harm a freaky scene that sees mia in an elevator that repeatedly arrives on the same floor had potential director john r leonetti skillfully cranking up the tension his evil creature lurking in the dark poised to strike but in the end mia easily escapes via some stairs to her apartment i wanted to be terrified but i wasntthe other issue i have with is this who the hell would make such a freakin ugly doll in the first place in reality noone would buy something that repulsive theyd be hard pushed to give the damned thing away yet john pays a small fortune for the doll and his wife is only too pleased when she sees it at least chucky was reasonably cute before his face got all messed up that is,astonish
if you mixed rosemarys baby childs play and watching paint dry you would get ,astonish
the best horror movie there is awesome i like it better love it,astonish
best horror movie i like it a lot must watch i love it,astonish
just 54it deserves 1010just 54it deserves 1010just 54it deserves 1010just 54it deserves 1010just 54it deserves 1010,astonish
i thought the conjuring was terrible this isoktheres not much to say its a generic horror movie of a kind weve seen a thousand times very on the nose and the mystical black lady doesnt helpits not easy to really root for mr and mrs wholesome usaand another thing the original is way scarier admittedly this is the more creepy looking in her own right and i would not like to go to sleep in a room with her in but when contextualized into a horror movie scary looking things are not scary you need to use harmless looking things so the used raggedy ann concept would have been much better,astonish
is not as great as everyone says in my perspective it was because most of the horrifying parts of the movie were basically in the trailer but this movie is not terrible to watch just not a great horror film to watch if you want to be scared,astonish
just doesnt scare me yes the doll is creepy looking but not enough and it doesnt go beyond just the somewhat creepy looking doll i dont have much to say other than this really isnt a scary movie there are somewhat scary moments theres one moment in particular that scared me but that was about 5 seconds out of the whole film this movie relies heavily on cheap jump scares so if thats not your thing keep that in mind,astonish
it is certainly not the best horror movie not special not great but certainly not a bad one yes it is full with the cringy dialog the mediocre acting and a shallow story but hey 80  of the horror genre its like that today since it is a horror movie for me it is important that it was scary in many ways and it kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole time knowing something evil is going to happen in the next 10 seconds 5610 to be honest is a fair score but if you watch it i dont think you will regret it,astonish
a spinoff of the conjuring that also serves as a prequel to the events that unfolded in that 2013 feature is an absolutely bland banal  boring example of its genre that doesnt pack an ounce of oldschool thrills that james wans film revelled in and only exists to cash in on the originals success,astonish
2014 is a load of selfimportant monotonous trite throughout representative of the worst that modern horror has to offer and a far cry from the stellar series it is so awkwardly spun off from its a hamfisted and canon crunching offshoot made for the sole purpose to milk money from a financially successful franchise the plodding plot might as well be on a treadmill the characters are as dull as safety scissors the story makes little to no sense and the scares are so aggressively puerile that youll struggle to even pay attention to most of them especially considering that the feature itself is one of the most painfully boring i have seen in a long while youd have thought they couldve conjured up something better than a doll that cant seem to move when its on camera 310,astonish
starts off ok some memorable effects the initial creeps are creepy and the murder scenes are effective the demon is interestingly done the weaving in of socal 60s and manson murders and cults could have been more thoroughly explored it was not made into major enough scenery its kind of tedious to have every one of these movies have to prove over and over that if you move out of the first house the demon will follow you to the next house can we do something else how about stay in the first house see where that goesthe ending is just inexplicably rushed or anticlimactic like they were running out of film and had to cut it short not entirely convincing or scary my haunted friend,astonish
this movie goes in line with such horror classics as barbaras baby the exorcist the omen etc it takes the time it needs to fully develop characters to make you feel for them if that is in your capability and fear for their sake its classic sometimes subtle horror with really well placed jump scares and ive watched a lot of horror movies its definitely not a splatter nor a thriller nor a teenyscreamy so dont expect one this is a movie of a young family that is haunted by evil the characters a believable goodhearted and intelligent and a hard crack for the evil forces that haunt them its ending doesnt come as such a surprise  thus only 9 stars  but it will keep watchers on the edges of their seats anyway id recommend it for mature viewers that love classic horror,astonish
the movie may have gotten harsh reviews because it doesnt meet the conjuring standardhowever it is not awful at all the movie starts slow sure the second half of the movie picks up and did scare me the ending is also intriguing and horrifying and i liked it i didnt like how they say the doll became to be possessed and there could have been a better story there with that said its still worth your time,astonish
ive been on a conjuring series binge recently i enjoyed conjuring 1  2 and rated them both 1010 this spin off however unfortunately this one was kinda weak not in the same class as the other two now im just hoping the sequel creation will be an improvementsomething about this one just didnt work that well i guess one problem would be that the scares seemed overreliant on some of the same repeated tricks flickering lights or some machine turning on when no ones around or sounds of a baby crying or something appearing in the room behind a character the movie repeated these tricks so often that throughout the movie i actually found myself constantly correctly guessing what kind of trick is going to be coming nextand everything felt a little too static in other words motionless if you know what i mean the premise does revolve around a doll of course but for too much of the time in this movie the scares are supposed to be coming from nothing thats visibly moving on screen and that just ends up kind of unexcitingthere was also a problem with some underdeveloped characters and potential plot lines that go nowhere the kids on the stairs the noisy upstairs neighbors the bookstore owner whose occult connections were barely explained etci should end with some positive though wallis is pretty good at acting scared and has no hint of her reallife english accent when she speaks so lets all applaud her acting talentsand the best moment in the movie involved a child running towards a closing door i wont say anymore except that it was a great scene and im really astonished that they managed to achieve that shot however they did it,astonish
this movie is the prequel to the conjuring the story of the doll how did it become the famous we all know nowit started good those scary scenes were hitting the right notes then i felt they tried to make it extremely scary but turned out to be funny there were some scenes which made me realize that this movie is being rushed just to make up something for the viewers this movie made the conjuring doll a joke i felt the leading actress did a really bad job as she literally had no fear on her face the ending was so dumb they tried to make it unpredictable but utter rubbish if you have watched the trailer of this movie then u have watched the whole movie cause those are the scary elements you have to see in the whole movie they did a pretty good job in making a really good trailer and forcing us into the theaters to send us back home disappointedno i would not recommend this movie to anyonenotable actingnobodymy rating 510,astonish
after watching conjuring i felt really excited when i knew that will have a movie im a horror fan thats why even if i really dont know much about making a movie but still i trust my own point of view if the horror movie that im watching is good or awful well let me talk about the movie first the effects was really great and very much appreciated the scene where the main character was looking at the little girl in the next room then suddenly run to her and show that creepy woman it was really great but the main character the mother i dont know but her acting wasnt good at all maybe acting skill like vera farmiga and the one who acts as mother in the insidious 1 and 2 sorry i forgot the name would really give justice to the movie just imagine there are times in the movie where i really dont see or feel any frightening emotions on the mothers face  i just dont like her acting that truly ruins the movie in my own point of view because in all scenes she has the scene were supposedly take the movie into a more scary one but she always fails to do sohowever the movie was good but i will never want to see that actress again in a horror movie because if she does i will never have a chance even glimpse at it,astonish
as someone who loved the original conjuring movie and 2016s sequel for that matter was a mustsee for me after reading some scathing reviews beforehand i wasnt expecting much from this film whilst i didnt think it was as bad as some have suggested certainly doesnt come close to reaching the same heights as the conjuring did which was a seriously scary filmthe scares in are few and far between and quite predictable but there are a few scenes that do make you jump unfortunately one of main flaws is its failure to build up any sort of tension which is partly down to its thin plot most of the film felt quite tame even the ending which was something of an anticlimax maybe this film has been judged too harshly by comparing it to the conjuring its not a bad horror film but i expected more,astonish
the creepy doll gets its own horror movie and somewhat of an origin story mia wallis is an expectant mother and doll collector who is given the porcelain figure as a present from her husband john ward horton he doesnt believe her when she says she hears a scream from the neighbors but investigates to find the neighbors bleeding mia is attacked by followers of a satanic cult and the woman cultist higgins kills herself when the cops arrive bleeding into the dolls eye mia recovers from a stab wound to her stomach though her child is still alive inside her strange noises start to sound in the night and weird occurrences like the sewing machine coming on as the doll shiftsjohn throws the doll in the garbage when mia is disgusted by it being held by the murderous woman when all the stoves mysteriously turn on starting a fire and something grabs her leg mia is taken to the hospital and has the baby they move to a new apartment and attend a church service with a congregation led by father perez tony amendola somehow the doll shows up again much to johns concern but mia wants to keep it she meets her neighbor evelyn alfre woodard but is also haunted by a strange woman walking around her house while she sleeps she sees strange things and tries to convince her husband who turns to the churchcheck out more of this review and others at swillikycom,astonish
i just couldnt figure out why this movie got only 54 in imdb ratingtrust me this is a great horror movie to enjoy i think this is surprisingly underrated the story line is good enough though there is some questionable moments but overall i just enjoyed it at least this is far better than many other horror films like it follows,astonish
ive been a big fan of the conjuring and the conjuring 2 and somehow only discovered this movie just now in my opinion this movie is scary now what is scary is obviously different from person to person but one thing i think everyone should be able to agree on with this film is that being scary is at least the goal of the writers and producers a lot of films under the category of horror dont necessarily have fear as their primary goals for example movies like cabin in the woods which are comedies with a horror themein contrast with the rest of the conjuring series this film starts a bit slower and gets stronger towards the end also the intensity of the story line isnt on the same level in my opinion this gives a slight advantage over the conjuring since i become desensitized to threats on screen if they become too intense,astonish
we didnt really enjoyed this movie we were like hell yeah this is gonna be good as the conjuring but it wasnt we expected more jumpscares more creepyeerie more like scary at all what we got few jumpscares and thats all so predictable movie we didnt even got scared maybe once or twice just one of us was scared at all time he liked it but it was just him it wasnt that good as we expected so we do not recommend this movie but if you want try it,astonish
is a prequel to the conjuring as well as a spin off the film tells the story of a couple and the wife loves dolls after realizing shes pregnanther husband buys her a doll and one nightthe doll becomes possessed by a demon when a cult break in cursing the doll putting the family in evil danger this film i had low expectations going in and after seeing iti kinda liked it althoughthe film got literally awful reviews with people commenting it down as the worst horror film of 2014i can kind of get thati meani had some flaws with itlike the amount of scenes that just left you hangin there like ehis something gonna happen or eh and the predictable charactersbut overallpassing thatthis film was pretty cool and goodbut it wasobviouslyno where near as good as the conjuring 1 or 2 is a pretty good horror film with some effective scares and scenesbut overall in waysis just another one of those horrors teens see for a good scare to get videos of your friends scared crapless and post it on snapchat,astonish
this film wasnt anything exciting or radical but i was enjoying up until the point where the black woman committed suicide to save the white family to me that felt incredibly gross and it totally dampened the whole movie for me it was crappy unoriginal storytelling at best and blatantly racist at worst im not going to be hanging out for 2 given how disappointing the first one was,astonish
is a horror film maybe it has 1 billion who have seen this film  it is about a family who buy a home in this home has got a scared doll her name is she has a soul inside her when they know that they talk with ed and lorraine to take the soul out of the house,astonish
john ward horton presents his expectant wife mia wallis with a vintage doll named that she has wished for to complete a collection the couples life is harshly interrupted by a home invasion by a couple of followers of a satanic cult strange things begin to happen that makes mia want to move to a different home when they do they are not exactly alone the creepy doll has somehow attracted an evil entity from the home invasion something very sinister is using the doll as a conduit to terrorthis is a prequel to the conjuring no doubt will attract her own fans one ugly doll for sure very few special effects to rave about beware there will be cause to jump to the edge of your seatrounding out the cast alfrie woodard tony amendola brian howe kerry omalley and keira daniels,astonish
is a wellmade prequel to the conjuring that i really enjoyed although the movie isnt the best i have seen i still managed to thoroughly enjoy the movie and i would strongly recommend you watch it id definitely say it deserves better ratingsreviews than it has been receiving it does a decent job of balancing the plot advancement and frightening scenes unlike the conjuring this movie isnt based directly on real events although there are some aspects taken from the case that was investigated by ed  lorraine warren the plot of the movie is intriguing and pretty easy to follow if you pay close attention i was immediately interested upon the first paranormal event as for this movie being scary id say the concept of a doll being a demons conduit is very scary the movie does have quite a few jump scares that would catch any offguard viewers and some very prolonged suspenseful parts the climax of the movie is very intense the doll is very welldesigned for its evil role in this movie its definitely creepy enough and i like how it slowly begins to appear more sinister throughout the movie i also really like how we never see the doll move yet its still extremely obvious that it is responsible for the demonic activity occurring in the house having seen the conjuring the conjuring 2 and id rate this movie 810 i am also really excited for the sequel to this movie 2 i hope its equally frightening and enjoyable,astonish
is another derivative horror film very similar in look and tone to the conjuring of which it is a spin off the predictable story sees your usual happily married couple come into possession of a creepy doll and who subsequently find themselves menaced by ghostly events at their homeneedless to say this is a very traditional haunted house movie with nothing in the way of originality or freshness to recommend it mainly the film follows the wife as shes spooked by various apparitions and creepy stuff going on the cast is made up of the usual priests doctors and disbelievers and the scares are inevitably of the cgienhanced variety when did modern horror become so passe welltelegraphed scares and endless supposedly creepy dread does not a good film make wallis who was quite dreadful in peaky blinders is equally unsympathetic here and as a whole is a chore to watch,astonish
im a big fan of horror movies especially those that cater to the paranormal genre which generally means i cater to haunted houses movies than anything else in the genre the conjuring was a pretty good movie up until three quarters through so the idea of a film based entirely on the doll and avoiding the sudden turn to an annoying possession plot line seemed to have some merits fits in very well with the new twisted horror transition that created insidious and sinister it doesnt try to scare you with something it just scares you it doesnt waste time with the chucky point of view of something running around at floor level either the movie is completely revealed in the fears and experiences of joan and maria who own who seemingly runs through the apartment from the top shelf somehow returning when she is dispatched and even at times warping reality to cast doubts in the minds of the main characters some of the scares are reminiscent of scenes from the amityville horror and other films but the acting and direction almost makes up for the fact where the movie really succeeds is creating a true paranormal horror character out of in what has been lately a string of serial killers and undead maniacs since the 1980s bottom line is a return to the real horror movies of the 30s 40s and 50s before the field was inundated by blood and gore flicks and for that i greatly approve,astonish
now some people may remember my review of the conjuring of which i consider one of the bast horror films of all time well in 2014 the doll in the filmwould get a spin off which has revived negative reception from pretty much every one as it is the film that got me into the genre i will try to provide a nonbias reviewthe film opens with the opening of the conjuring that being of the case and it does its job it sets the tone of the movie going in after it we are introduced to our main characters mia played by wallis and john played by ward horton after a cult breaks into there home they start to experience strange happeningsnow i wont spoil the plot anymore but i will say one thing more about this film it has some actually really terrifying moments one moment takes place in the basement in which mia is trapped and must get out to save the baby,astonish
the horror movies tend to focus on the way of showing the ghost and how to shock us but in which case the story line of the movie tend to be bad and the story doesnt make sense and the horror movie in which the dolls are the ghost side is so difficult to make because the child play sires get in the way but this movie success it completely at first you may think that this is the common horror film but it will change after a while because the ghost doesnt show up entirely so what is the fear in this film in horror movie the lead character often fight with the ghost or resist it for surviving however in this movie the lead character dont do anything because the ghost cant attack the human then the ghost takes a baby of a mother lead character to kill her what this film focus on is the death the people in this film only suffer from the fear of death and the ghost shows up a few times the scene is the most terrible in the horror which i saw then please be careful to watch it and please dont look if you have dolls,astonish
i heard about this film during the time of its release i knew it was about an evil doll but i had no idea until i read into it that it as a spinoff to the conjuring so i watched the original and followed it with this basically set in 1969 in santa monica california mia wallis and john gordon ward horton are happily married and expecting their first child john gives mia a doll she has been looking for as a gift at night mia hears a murder occurring next door at the higgins when mia calls the police she is attacked by higgins tree otoole holding the doll the police arrive and kill her male accomplice while the woman kills herself slitting her own throat a drop of blood falls on the face of the doll it is revealed that higgins was part of the disciples of the ram a satanic cultsince she was holding the doll while dying mia wants john to throw it away later a fire is caused mia escapes it but goes into labour mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl named leah the family move to a new apartment mia is confused to find the discarded doll in amongst their possessions to unpack and as time goes by strange activities are plaguing mia and the baby mia finds more about the cult higgins was part of they sought to summon a demon by claiming a soul with the help of bookstore owner evelyn star trek first contacts alfre woodard haunted by the memory of a car accident that killed her daughter they determine that a haunting is occurring and it wants leahs soul they contact father perez tony amendola who agrees to take the doll and look into it but the demonic spirit of the doll attacks the priest the doll disappears perez in hospital warns john that his injuries were caused by the evil of the doll mia is confronted by the demon itself holding doll mia realises that the demon will only be satisfied if a soul is sacrificed john and evelyn find mia before she is about to jump out the window with john saves her while evelyn takes and kills herself also to atone for the death of her daughter the annaabelle disappears following evelyns sacrifice six months later the forms have moved on and have not seen the doll since it is seen being purchased by a woman in a store as a gift for her daughters the ending tells that the doll is kept by ed and lorraine warren in a case and blessed twice a month to keep people safe also starring kerry omalley as sharon higgins brian howe as pete higgins eric ladin as detective clarkin ivar brogger as dr burgher and keira daniels as young higgins this has none of the style you would expect from a chucky doll movie is certainly a disturbing looking puppet possessed by a nasty spirit but the story is rather predictable and some of the scares fall flat so it is a slightly silly supernatural horror okay,astonish
the movie started out well not outstanding but it caught our attention further in the movie it kind of lacked creativity the scenes were somewhat clich we missed personality even though the story has a history to it the characters were behaving predictable and there is not much space left over for your imagination a few shocking moments doesnt make a good film overall a good story if new to the genre but an almost amateuristic production the casting is one of the few things we liked about it the actors are giving their characters a personality but sadly those personalities are a bit like any other paranormal horrorstory,astonish
first of all i am not against the conjuring and the insidious i liked both movies when i watched them first time but that is the problem that those movies didnt attract me to watch for second time though the conjuring is a lot better than the insidious but still not as creepy and scary than like any normal imdb user i had very low expectations from because of such low rating as my ratings always matched with overall ratings but this was one of exceptional case when i surprisingly liked the movie against low ratingsi couldnt find any problem in this movie genre wise it was hell scary and did everything to me which a best horror movie does to its viewer gave me nightmare as i finished it at 200 am increased my heart rate to almost 100 bpm and even next day i was in zonesome scenes were really terrifying including sewing machine scene climax scene church fathers car scene and my favorite elevator sceneanother positive note of this movie is that it is a believable and loving story of a family the cast did perfect job to their characters especially the leading actress coincidentallynamed wallis as mia she did an excellent job and got a loyal fan in me also would like to mention ward horton who played a role of mias husband john did a superb jobdirection wise movie was fabulous despite the fact that director of this movie was new he did an incredible job and i want him to direct 2 as wellat the end i would like to say that i had no intentions to write review for it and i found my thoughts in some reviews too but its just to add a number to supporters of this movie and i will recommend it to everyone who are a fan of arguably believable horror movies,astonish
was as pointless and ridiculous as it was devoid of scares and that was awfully lot and a lot of people had hyped this movie up to being so much which really made it seem like a must watch movie and when i finally got around to seeing it i ended up being disappointed on so many levelsthe story is a shameless cash in on a part of the popular the conjuring movie in a vague attempt to bring life to the semicreepy doll displayed in the conjuring it was weak soup boiled on a stripped down bonethroughout the course of the entire movie i was waiting for something scary to happen on the screen but nothing happened nothing at best the movie could muster a semicreepy part with the basement  elevator  stairwell segmentsure the doll itself is a bit creepy but not to a point where it becomes scary or disturbing and having a devil demon or satan himself crawl around on the ceiling was just slapping the audience in the facewas a massive disappointment in so many ways i love horror movies but belongs in the lower scale of scares and enjoyment value if you enjoy a good horror movie with a properly though through storyline and containing scares then your money is most definitely better spent elsewhere,astonish
2014 dir john r leonetti  cast wallis ward horton alfre woodard tony amendola eric ladin wretched prequel to the conjuring where we get to see where this possessed doll originated and the couple that it was scaring the living crap out of set in 1967 although it never feels it wallis and ward horton play a young couple she is pregnant and he is a doctor the doll is given to her as a gift and immediately a couple next door is murdered and a couple occult freaks enter and attack them police gun them down but the female manages to transport her soul into this doll the couple are freaked out and decide to move but despite going in the trash she manages to tag along directed by cinematographer john r leonetti who also helmed the equally stupid mortal kombat 2 annihilation the structure is one lame jump scare after another from a static tv to a sewing machine that operates on will their newborn baby is the target and wallis spends much of the film trying to convince people that she is not nuts horton is the absent husband who shows up when convenient alfre woodard plays a wacko working at a bookstore who befriends wallis tony amendola plays the standard priest who attempts to transport the doll to his church and ends up getting his ass handed to him eric ladin plays a detective who fills everyone in on the wack job cultists who attacked them in the films opening while the special effects are creepy and effective the conjuring was far more entertaining viewers will likely conjure up a fitting burial for this prequel score 3  10,astonish
the credits from the movie are still rolling as i type this so the film is still fresh in my mind as it should be coming in i saw the somewhat negative reviews and had low expectations as a result in that respect at least did well in its mission for starters the movie is shot very well cinematographer james kniest and director john leonetti deserve props for some really quality shots especially in some of the opening sequences there are some really good long shots in this movie as well where the shot will be on something scary or intimidating and instead of cutting as any other film might do it stays on said shot creating tension and good scares on occasion secondly the movie does contain some moments that made me shudder or almost cover my eyes which i give the movie a ton of credit for the main villain of the film is designed well and really gave me the creeps especially during one sequence close to the climax youll know the one when you get to ithowever aside from those positives the film does have many faults the acting is mediocre or even just plain bad at times during the climax when the actors are supposed to really show their best stuff i was very underwhelmed to say the least the climax was lame too with a weak resolution that doesnt make any sense and scares that couldnt live up to some of the quality scares of earlier in the filmthe movie falls into a lot of tired clichs as well which is unfortunately something that is to be expected now in horror films overall the film really didnt do anything new in terms of scares plot or even characters youve seen it all beforein conclusion despite its many faults i would recommend it it certainly can scare you and sometimes the movie can really get you drawn into the action id say check it out but dont expect it to blow your mind,astonish
after their home is invaded by deadly cultists an expectant couple finds that a strange doll involved in the events has taken on a far more sinister life than they imagined and try to stop the deadly events from continuingwhile theres a lot to like here overall this one was decidedly disappointing what really does tend to work here is the early scenes at the house where the growing buildup of the events here makes for quite a rather dark storyline here the concept of targeting a pregnant mother in her home and enacting a bloodrite on her stillunborn baby that bonds her soul with a ravenous demon is unbelievably chilling and creepy which makes it so much of a disappointment that it never really capitalizes on this idea by instead resorting to the second half with a series of ghostly flash images and quickcut attacks that are so setup and predictable that nearly every gag here from the quick glimpse of the hands on the stairwell and the armgrab in the darkened laundry room lowers this one slightly however the first half doesnt worry about this with the rather enjoyable setup here as it goes through the early scenes of her pregnancy and the effect that has on the buildup by offering the chilling home invasion with the really enjoyable setup here that makes for quite a fun scene ending in the brutal bloodbath that finally ends this the eventual supernatural hauntings that occur arent that bad following the incident while the scenes in the apartment after the move are even better here with the hallway ambush the flash images of the ghost always walking around the apartment in the shadows and the big setup here with the drawings done by the child eventually coming to fruition makes for a truly fun time here that makes for a great ploy to unleash the chilling action in the later half when the attempts to stop the progression of possession makes for some dark chilling action within this with the church attack and the eventual battle in the apartment to save their baby really ratchets up the tension and suspense here along with the fun action throughout the final half that though again brings up the main fundamental flaw here with the film as not only does this make the film filled with routine and predictable scenes but the film does such a great job at showcasing something is wrong that their reasoning for not doing something earlier is seriously questioned staying in the house as long as they did after the initial attack is questionable considering what happened and all that follows while the popcorn gag itself is so questionable that alone is quite unrealistic still once in the apartment this one features so many fine attack scenes on both her and the baby that waiting so long to question whats going on that its entirely unbelievable that takes as much time as it does to bring someone else in on the action its pretty big and does hold this down somewhat though theres still a lot to like hererated r graphic violence and continuous scenes of implied and actual threats to infants and children,astonish
this is my first review and im writing this because i cant believe that people liked this movie its awful and im not saying this because they were like only 2 moments in the movie when i feel some kind of fear  one of the moments was in the trailer so  its just that the characters were boring and everything was so forced spoiler below i just remember the scene when a demon  ghost appeared behind the doll hahaha i laughed at this point in the cinema so do it yourself a favor and dont watch this movie,astonish
in comparison to the oversaturated supernatural horror genre sure this is alrightim not sure what the budget was or where it actually went but i hope the snacks onset where phenomenal because aint nobody getting paid anything extra for thisone credit due is the barclay building i felt like a total nerd for pickingup on that but like a queen for finding an ounce of respect in a total flop of a filmbad acting poor character development thin plot and no juice id rather ride a trolley in the dark with a monotone tour guide than watch this again,astonish
i feel this movie represents all those recent horror movies were getting thrown at nowadays it is basically a repetition of what has been made for approximately the past 10 years or so a happy family starts experiencing supernatural things but not the husband since he is a man and he is not that sensitive and he wouldnt believe because he dont understand all the evil things has to do with an evil spirit or the devil you get lots of tension and jump scares but never really develop any atmosphere hell the movie gave me quite some shocks and my heart skipped a beat a few times but did it in any way scare fill me with dread or horrify me no although it succeeded in building up tension and shock it never really got that horrifying the ending was basically the same as the movies in its genre made for the past ten years ago or so which i feel lead to a disappointing ending i mean the cause of all the evil happening was because of the devil or an evil spirit which is the same as dozens upon dozens of horror movies nowadays are producing so this movie isnt getting any points for creativityspeaking of tension i would prefer watching the birds or psycho since those movies are packed full of tension they both still even manage to petrify its audience even today they also petrified me which quite honestly didnt manage to do it didnt even fill me with any dread all it did for me was give me jump scares and i get enough of that fun from my cousin so i have no need to watch this movie again if i want to watch a horror movie about a family being terrorized by the beyond and they manage to pull through then ill pick poltergeist without any question or any of dario argentos movies or carpenters or cronenbergs or hitchcocks or murnaus or de palmas or romeros any of the aforementioned directors movies because they were creative and has been very influential to a lot of horror movies i am especially fond of argento hitchcock and cronenberg i would also go with stanley kubricks the shining or the original version of the ring any groundbreaking influential or creative movie because i really found to be boring now ive made my point in why i think is boring but at least it has an audience which is fine by me ps i didnt sympathize with any of the characters they were that thin,astonish
im aware that horror movies have gotten worse since the last ten years or more and its from such perspective that im writing about first off i would like to state that its one of the best horror pictures ive seen since 2010 this film is filled with a terrifying storyline which is able to scare every kind of public acting is very plausible and professional allowing the characters to express reality to the spectator also its good to see that this project didnt copy the elements utilized in 2007s dead silence which was something i was quite afraid of in fact what really thrilled me the most was the serious and heavy directing from john r leonetti which is what made everything else work out all in all i dont mean to look exaggerated or anything but from now on im inclined to personally consider as the contemporaneous version of the exorcist albeit it doesnt precisely talk about exorcism at all please dont hate me for that,astonish
seems like precisely the sort of horror film that shouldnt work thinly drawn characters wind their way through a series of overly familiar tropes including of course the titular possessed doll these characters make the same baffling decisions that only people in horror movies are stupid enough to make and cavalierly remain in dangerous situations long after you and i would have gotten the hell out of there the film is so reminiscent of rosemarys baby 1968 that for a while i actually wondered if it was a remake and the script is pretty clunky  especially the coda at the churchyet  still works this is a frikkin scary movie id give it a 9 out of 10there are a couple of reasons for the movies success i think first its beautifully shot and directed throughout an especially creepy apartment building our supernatural antagonists are at first wisely seen down long corridors and stairwells there are some static shots of the doll but none of the silly cutandcutback tricks to explain that it is moving on its ownsecond there is no hamhanded cgi to make the action cartoonish there are only sparsely placed practical effects and they work quite well this felt like an effective oldfashioned 1970s horror movie about the devilthird wallis does well in her role as the young married couple targeted by satan she underplays it quite a bit but shes still a good actress the beautiful wallis is none other than the college student that young charles xavier tried to pick up in 2011s xmen first class and yes she does have the same first name as the demonic doll weird worldi was confused at first about the awkward and confusing bookends to the film theyre distracting and unnecessary wikipedia informs me that these are intended to remind viewers that this movie is a spin off of the conjuring 2013 which is regarded by horror fans as superior to this film i guess ill need to watch that soon,astonish
a dichotomous spurring subplot from its conjured sister the devilish dolly from the the conjuring manifests its feature length solidity with similarly fathomable truth bolstered by its historically accurate credo the reallife accounts of psychic investigators ed and lorraine warren the accursed bisque in actuality a raggedy ann becomes demonic conduit for  yet again  an occultly idolised grim hellbent on  you guessed it  sapping the souls of the innocent if ive made the film sound rudimental and routine thats because it isthough anachronistically sturdy in recreating a 1970s vibe tv sets like chunky microwaves the ideologically pruned nuclear family archetypal catholicism societys infatuation with the occult and druidism women represented as maternal machines with a knack for sewing  and mention of mansons racially apocalyptic helterskelter  what lacks is some proliferant panache in its antique format the shortlived killer toy subgenre has elapsed be it or not that the doll has long been considered an evil harbouring entity in folklore blame the cabbage patch kids in the 80s a craze in adopting toys as kin and provoking emotional attachments to prepare adolescents into parenthood from the earliest of ages chucky winces in his good guy dolls box for trips up drastically short  perhaps the tagline based on a true story really hindered the films intensity perhaps its just not fashionable to lever fear from toys  unless its an enchanted xbox or psychopathic ps4ive got no strings so the doll  it looks creepy but all the way through the film the viewer sees nothing no creepy headturning eyerolling  just implied movements and a semiserious prudish levitation scene static camera shots extreme closeups creepzooms and abstractions but no gimmicks the final act of toy story with woody on the barbecue grill warning sid to be nicer to his toys imbues a greater dread ive got stringsa concerto of violinists stab their instruments juxtapose the recorded sounds onto any suspenseful moment amplify the sound to a million hertz voila a simulated scare tactic so effective it requires no visual connection humdrum being the optimum syntagm aside from one particular scene involving an elevator the film struggles to breakaway from generic traits in an almost desperate attempt to scare taking the bisqeuit its a surrogate spinoff too placid for outright franchising loots upon accolades of its mongrel parentthe real shame is that its just not scary the narrative just too conventional the suspense just too hammy highlighting its few violinsawing jump scares is a commodified marketing campaign to whet the appetite for the second conjuring,astonish
not long after the charles manson massacres a young california couple are victims of a satanic home invasion and a vintage doll in the wifes collection becomes a conduit for a demon the cult was conjuring a prequel to the previous years the conjuring featuring the creepy looking doll from its precredit sequence was also very loosely based on a true story from the files of paranormal investigators ed  lorraine warren only in real life it was a raggedy ann i was expecting something along the lines of chucky but fortunately the doll isnt possessed its just a gateway for a malevolent demon in search of a soul someone elses of course theres a few good jump scares and the entity is sufficiently menacing but like its predecessor the kind of chills the filmmakers are aiming for doesnt come from gore or cgi mores the pity for me at any rate it was produced by james wan the conjurings director and directed by its cinematographer in the obvious hope lightning would strike twice but one film of this type was probably enough that said isnt bad especially for a seasonal film but a third entry and i hear its coming would hold no interest for me without a higher body count dispatched in explicit fashion gimme gore dammit even if its just a little and my imagination will take it from there that said not everyone feels the same way so milage may vary,astonish
its 1969 and the manson family is in the news dr john gordon ward horton and his pregnant wife mia wallis move into a santa monica house he buys a vintage doll for her collection they are attacked by a higgins cult couple the police arrives just in time strange things happen and the kitchen burns they decide to throw out the doll and move to an apartment in pasadena with their daughter leah somehow the doll is in one of the boxes and mia decides to keep it strange things continue to happen father perez tony amendola and evelyn alfre woodard try to help the young familythe last half of the movie is a struggle at least the first half has the sewing machine theyre able to squeeze some tension from that prop the gimmick is that needs someone to voluntarily give up their soul it makes the victim a pretty weak character essentially it preys on the weak and vulnerable its not scary its kinda pathetic the movie relies too much on things moving in the background and other less than effective scare tactics it adds nothing original,astonish
repetition springs to mind from rocking chairs to creaking doors is full of horror traits done a thousand times over the doll is creepy and the idea of satanic cultists murdering innocent people and attacking the main couple in the night is frightening thats as far as the scares go the conjuring was a success amplifying terror tenfold is the prequel following the dolls dark beginnings to ending up in the hands of the warren family s been rushed in to scoring no originality and a story anticipated from a mile off proving that truly terrifying horror movies are a thing of the recent past its very similar to deliver us from evil the woman in black sinister and insidious with glimpses of paranormal activity watch the latter two for greater scares,astonish
upon watching this film for the first time i thought that this film was going to be a female version of childs play1988although the storyline and plot is very much different i find that there are similarities to childs play such as defeating the doll in an apartment flatputting those aside it is an entertaining film to sit and watch there is always something just around the corner to make you sit up and take notice and that is important in a horror film of this type as i have come across other films in this genre that i felt didnt live up to their name and expectations after a man gives a doll to his wife as a gift to add to her collection the neighbours get killed by a manson cult the doll ends up becoming possessed by one of the members of the cult strange unexplainable things then begin to happen but when the couple moves the entities follow them to their new home some of the film appears to parody rosemarys baby1968 once the film settles into the flat but thats my opinion the last overall scenes were very good and well written but the open ending was a bit disappointing,astonish
my kids are of the age that they want to see something besides superheroes and kid flicks they wanted to see something scary so we rented this big disappointment as this movie wasnt really scary nor suspenseful spoilers it starts off pretty good with the creepy doll and the freaky hippie cult killers manson famiyish but beyond the opening there is nothing that was really that scary or disturbing most of the violence happens off camera and there is a lot of build up with no pay off theres a really cool looking demon that receives too little screen time to make it interesting i found myself hoping there would be more of a connection to the satanic hippie cult as i like the late 60searly 70s and satan worship they just seem to go together i recommend watching the devil rides out rosemarys baby or race with the devil over i still cant really see why this movie was rated r ive seen more violence in a roadrunner cartoon that being said the acting and directing was actually good and kept me interested and waiting for something to happen that never did,astonish
this was a solid horror flick with all of the elements you like scares suspense and great score the acting was ok but felt could have been a little more dramatic in certain scenes not to say it was bad one bit i liked the production value and the camera work most often with some inspired scenes the doll was super creepy and the elevator scene was great why this got bad reviews is beyond me i guess they want more blood and guts whateverthis was better than the conjuring by far in my opinion you could do way worse with the crap out therei like the period price horror movies this worked wella good scary movie with all of the boxes ticked,astonish
im a guy who has been watching horror movies since i was 12 i have a lot of experience with knowing what to look for and what makes a great horror movie though the conjuring was an amazing movie to begin with the prequel is another jump of horror to go along with the original tale of the conjuring was introduced as a mild character in the conjuring that seemed not to have much meaning behind it but as the story led on is the reason why the conjuring happened in the first place using the use of as a demonic character was an additional attribute to the horror story leading on from the conjuring was an amazing horror flick with great scares that are unexpected and unpredictable i was on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen the entire time as a finale i loved this movie and it was a great prequel for the conjuring highly recommended definitely a must see if you like being scared to the point where you cant sleep,astonish
slightly underrated prequel to the conjuring 2013 a movie based on a reallife event this isnt as well crafted but is a competent horror movie that is more than jump scares but does have quite a few of thosethe opening home invasion is a creepy disturbing connection to the sharon tate murders that are coincidentally in the movies time frame of about 1970 and are shown on the tv news and is a frightening foreshadowingthe devil imagery is lurking everywhere and there are enough eerie setpieces to haunt the screen and the viewer with dread and despair apart from the manson family tiein there are also similarities to rosemarys baby 1968 from relatively the same time period so all of the references are an ominous link to this story and its milieutepid reviews and fans of the original seem disappointed but there are some scares here and is recommended for horror fans and especially those that are attracted to the occult and supernatural stories with references to religion notealthough the doll is the conduit to the conjuring of the devil doings it is just that and not a chucky type of animation and isnt quite a killer doll more of a gateway,astonish
at first i thought would not be that scary of a movie haunted scary doll completely over done but boy was i wrong this movie definitely made me lose sleep for nights there were moments in this movie that definitely left me wide eyed one part in particular was spoiler alert when the main character could not find her baby and when she went to look in the babies crib all she saw was then she proceeded to slam the doll multiple times on the crib and throw it across the room and then it made her believe it was actually her baby and not the doll this movie definitely left me scared ive seen a lot of scary movies in my life but this one was definitely one of the best,astonish
is actually another pretty decent trek into the whole demonicpossession genre of film that doesnt really fail to entertain and is an enjoyable prequel to the conjuringi must admit i was actually a bit wary that this movie was just another chucky type of film but thankfully it didnt go down that route there are plenty of scenes where you do start to expect that but like i said thankfully it doesntthe film starts off decently enough but it does tend to drag on a wee bit for about the first 5055 minutes with plenty of buildup scenes that have no real end results i know a story cant really dive straight into the heart of the matter within the first 5 minutes and it needs time to develop plus it would be hard to sustain any kind of tension for the rest of the film but you still feel a bit disappointed when nothing much happens the good news is though that this changes and the film starts to pick up very nicely after the mentioned 5055 minute mark for which im thankful because what happens from here on in rescues the moviethe way that some of the latter scenes are filmed when the demon has become more prevalent is impressive especially the doll levitation and the basement scenes also with some very nice sound effects accompanying these scenes you have a good few uneasy creepy moments would these scenes have been creepier if you just heard the demon instead of seeing it at all ie the blair witch possibly but the way you see the demon in is similar to the way we see the demon in insidiousnever long lingering views of it but just enough to freak you outis a nicely shot well acted and decently written creepy horror and if you enjoy movies similar to those like the conjuring insidious and sinister then there will be a very good chance that you will enjoy thisoverall its nothing groundbreaking but it most definitely isnt anywhere near as bad as some people are making it out to be,astonish
i really loved the conjuring it was one of the most scariest films ive seen the director of the conjuring then brings us which was an utter disappointment it was very unoriginal tedious and had very little scares the film goes a long time without delivering any scares when something scary does happen its usually cheesy like a girl in a dark silhouette appearing in a doorway something everyone has seen before thousands of times aside from a few jump scares that come up every once in awhile there were many scenes that build up suspense only to lead up to nothing happening suspenseful music would start soaring for several seconds the music would suddenly stop and then the scene would end it was very disappointing to me because i was expecting something serious to occur in these scenes only to get nothing only the scene i found truly scary was when the mother reaches in the babys cradle and gets grabbed by a creepy hand other than that the film was not very scary,astonish
i dont like horror movies at all they are to predictable unfortunately this movie was no exceptionthe only reason i watched this film was because my uncle forced me too if im going to be honest it surprised it was okaytho this movie was predictable the cast was good thats not the case with the script the husband of the girl was to flexible it thats the right word for a horror movie this one had minimum jump scares it was more of a thriller than a horror movie and not a good thriller just to be clearthe characters didnt have enough build up so i didnt get any connections to the them and i couldnt care less if anyone of them diedsummary its just your typical spirit horror garbagei wouldnt recommend anyone to watch this movie cause there are better movies out there,astonish
i didnt really care for this film it wasnt the horror fest what i thought it was going to be being that this film is a prequel to the conjuring i thought it was going to leave a lasting impression on my brain like how real good horror movies do it just didnt have that grip like the conjuring or the first paranormal activity or the others another reason why i didnt care for this film was because although it is a prequel to the conjuring it wasnt on the same scale as the conjuring what i mean is the conjuring was more well put together and more serious not saying this film wasnt its just that it wasnt as well done as the the conjuring if youre a real die hard horror movie fan like me this film isnt going to do much for you i mean its all right if you want to rent it just to watch something in your spare time but it really wont leave any kind of impression,astonish
living off the back of james wans effective and wellconstructed horror creeper the conjuring which took the box office by storm in 2013 john r leonettis film centred around one of that films creepiest plot points of haunted doll is an atrocious horror effort that looks to tick of every clich in the horror book while portraying a wholly uninteresting storyby now it is somewhat expected that most horror films play out to some sort of seen before plan but does so little to distinguish itself from any other such title that after half an hour or so youre wondering if anything or anyone will do something to save this film from the doldrums in saying this one of the most shockingly scary elements to the film is just how effective its first 15 or so minutes are and for a while youd be right in expecting the unexpected and enjoying s success from this effective and terror laden opening act however things slide rapidly downhill into a shoddily edited and staged story that forgets to provide either the chills thrills or scares to even stand in the same room as its fine parent filmcalling this film seems like a marketing ploy in false advertisement as after this promising beginning takes a back seat to haunted prams evil bookshelves alfre woodard looking for a pay check possessed popcorn societies of the ram and various other insidious strands that all fail to scare or resonate the filmmakers here clearly didnt know how to make a 90 minute movie about a haunted doll and their subsequent ideas cant really stand on their own from walliss troubled housewife and enthusiastic seamstress mia and her doting husband john played by the frighteningly bland ward horton through to any of the side characters this is a film that needed some more interesting distractions if herself was going to be such a halfbaked and underutilised deviceif youre looking for some scares why not just watch the conjuring again as im positive even a rewatch of james wan horror would provide more intrigue and chills than could even dream of a shoddy excuse of a cash in lets hope the second conjuring journey is a whole league better than this nasty piece of trash but then again what really did we expect from the director that bought us mortal combat annihilation 1 evil bag of popcorn out of 5 for more movie reviews and opinions check into  wwwjordanandeddiewordpresscom,astonish
what separates a good horror movie from a bad one is that the latter creates sudden shocks and surprises during the playtime while the former creates a constant fear not just during the playtime but also has reminiscence after the movie a prequel to the conjuring falls under the latter category and fails to impress unlike its 2013 hit sequel the movie has a very predictable sequence unimpressive storyline and not so frightening background score the conjuring had created large expectation for with its own brilliantly researched surprise elements good cast and relatable fear however even fails to come across as an ordinary horror flick if not being a prequel to the conjuring probably james wan should have directed the prequel himself,astonish
basically all you need to know is that this movie is a way worse version of the conjuring i honestly would not waste your time with this one the scares are unrealistic and the movie has hardly anything to do with annebelle it actually sort of ruins herself who was actually cool in the conjuring the story makes just about no sense at all and is just plain stupid there are much better movies out there try the babadook sinister the conjuring insidious ouija houseboundhell just about anythingit seems like they were just trying to ride the train of the conjuring and had no original ideas of their own,astonish

my friend and i considered watching on the big screen but we put off our visit to the cinema and decided to wait for the dvd instead it turned out to be a good decision while the conjuring did nothing new to the horror genre it was still a solid movie that hit all the right notes when a spinoff about the creepy doll was announced i was suitably expectant though fully aware that the movie might fail to impress as most spinoffs generally tend to as horror movies go the plot is straightforward happy family  quiet life  bad purchase decisions  trouble comes knocking the actors are serviceable at best ward horton simply exists to play the supportive husband whose duty is to innocently wonder if his wife is losing her mind alfre woodard is the sympathetic neighbor who seems to have the right answers but it is the leading lady herself who stumbles wallis who plays the role of mia form is hard to empathize with throughout the movie with deranged satanic cultists ghosts and demons running around she remains largely composed a horror movies biggest draw is its ability to depict the abject terror of its protagonists and for someone whose life is threatened by supernatural forces beyond comprehension our leading lady manages to retain an air of aristocratic primness as though the things happening to her are as bothersome as milk gone sour the movie could have made good use of the fear of the unknown instead it puts a face on everything and offers simple explanations for every occurrence the doll itself manages to lose its scare factor by the end this in my opinion is the movies biggest drawback rent it if youd like something that doesnt tax your mind,astonish
the conjuring was nice suspenseful horror by james wan which worked well at different levels now we have a prequel to it giving us the origin story of the possessed doll which was more of the side story in the conjuring so those who liked the first film will be excited about this one too unfortunately it falls short i had very low expectations after seeing low ratings but it was pleasant surprise that it wasnt as bad as i thought it would bethe movie is a slow burner so if the impatient ones might easily get bored with this we have a standard couple mia and john mia played by wallis felt like intentionally cast for coincidence and ward horton as john not so much great acting skills can be expected here anyways they do a decent job for a horror film mia is pregnant and one day john gifts her a doll to add to her collection no guesses which doll and we are all like no what are you doing dont keep that lol well actually the doll isnt possessed yet it was just another cute doll until one day a terrible incident occurs followed by more horrific encounters well thats where i will stop it has short run time of about 100 minutes and there not much of story it is actually great that they didnt drag it muchdirected by john leonetti who was cinematographer with james wan for the conjuring there are many nice shots and couple of jump scares for those enjoy it i also kind of liked they kept the pacing slow which built up tension and suspense steadily and gradually well most of it is what we already scene in many horror flicks but original horror films are so rare these years even with recycled material the film worked for me as it looked technically sound for such a low budget film it was good old school horror with not much cgi gore and stuff the scene where mia gets stuck in elevator in the basement was really scary and my favorite from the film there are many more scares which i did not see coming and were quite unpredictable the background score almost similar to the conjuring again generates the scary tone required thus works effectivelyoverall i had a good time even if it was just an average movie at best the weak point was the script which i wish was better written also director doesnt try anything new and innovative for which there definitely potential still works just fine for horror genre as it does have enough amount tension getting built up plus scary moments making it worth a shotrating 255,astonish
had great looks to it i enjoyed the colors attractive  handsome characters and the general atmosphere of the movie however like most modern horror movies i didnt find it all that scary in fact half of the time i was yawning and couldnt care less about what happened to any of the characters ive seen way too many horror movies to be scared by something like this i was startled twice but none of the scenes that were supposed to send chills down my spine worked for me i liked this movie more than the conjuring because of the bright colors used in the conjuring although very wellacted is one of the most clichd and boring movies i have ever stumbled upon i know most people will disagree but it had nothing new to offer other than the same old stuff we had seen in dozens of other exorcism movies now i dont want to bash the conjuring in this review but i cant help it because has tried to follow the same pattern as the conjuring and as such it seemed like a rip off although the conjuring was really nothing but a rip off of dozens of similar exorcism movies from the past in my opinion is a good way of killing time but if like me youve seen too many horror movies dont expect to be frightened by it,astonish
this movie is just as scary as a barbie movie and just as interesting as teletubbies if youre looking for a movie to fall asleep with this is the perfect choice but if youre looking for a scary movie choose anything else than this the 60ies setting doesnt interest me at all the ugly doll is only begging the question who in their right mind would ever want to own such ugly doll let alone put in own display the movie is also extremely predictable here i was watching the movie half asleep maybe 30 minutes into the movie pretty sure i actually did fall asleep a few times when my wife asked me what i think will happen unfortunately my predictions were correct,astonish
its 4am ive wanted to go to sleep for the entire duration of this movie but i rarely turn movies off and now instead of sleeping i just felt i pay it forward and warn you to pick a better moviethe premise is creepy and i will admit the director does a good job and creating a decently frightening atmospherebut the movie as a whole is a flaming pile of insert whatever poo reference you want hereit really feels like its just these filmmakers cashing on the on the genreseries pass on it if you dont youll forget you ever saw it in less than a day,astonish
what a let down is a prequel to 2013s the conjuring the most original and well made horror film in years so i had high hopes for it unfortunately being a prequel was about the only connection this film would have with an entirely new writing and directing team coming on board the masterful director of the conjuring james wans also of the saw series presence was sorely lacking in this mediocre horror film that gets little reaction out of its audiencethe main problem for me was a complete lack of menace from the doll the movie is named after her so surely she has to do something other than just sit there and look menacing for 90 minutes apparently not the opening murder scene was actually quite well done and one of the few good moments the movie has but after that things slow down and never really speed up again put it this way  if youve seen the trailer youve seen the film thats never a good thing,astonish
after seeing the reviews score of around five at the time i watched i was not expecting much and i had not previously heard anything about this movie i see the babadook getting top reviews a movie i did not enjoy so i thought i would give it a go and i am pleased i didthis kind of movie has been done before with haunted toys etc but i found the main character acting in this to be very good and believable the start was like watching some kind of soap opera but in a good way letting the audience build a connection with the characters especially mia played by wallis strange name coincidence therewho played a strong part i thoughtthe doll was very spooky looking but the best part for me without spoiling anything was the scene with the doll next to the window with bright sunlight streaming in and the doll raised into the air look in the background  very scary and well done on the whole a good movie and in my opinion leagues ahead the babadook which is getting loads of praise from movie critics i turned the babadook off three quarters of the way through but this movie had me until the end,astonish
i read many reviews here some of them were talking about a movie with advanced visual effects but without a real story i believe those people never actually watched enough horror movies this movie is a true master piece a well developed story with some excellent events for those who loved movies such as the exorcist and the conjuring  guys i assure you that you gonna love this onethe main actress wallis is simply terrible she was so lucky to play the main role in such a movie but she has no talent at all she is so cold so fake i believe she never lived the events while acting i am so disappointed that somebody decided to grant this role to herthe audio in this movie is also terrible the audio engineer made every conversation a whisper and every horror scene a set of screaming sound effects  the thing that made me switch the tv volume up and down all along the movie please think about a better way to make people jump out of their chairs next timeoverall i would have given this movie 10 out of 10 it is a master piece and we dont usually see many horror movies with such interesting story nowadays but i will take 1 point for the terrible actress and 1 point for the horrible audio engineer,astonish
ah i see what reviewers were getting atthis is a well produced but conventional horror with all the usual tricks young couple drawn in by grisly murders the demon enters and follows them to their new life the priest enters and the conflict is onup to that point its ok with a few fairly decent jump scares 1970 california seems convincing the husband is dull but the wife is well playedbut what were they thinking in the final act half hearted underwritten i wasnt expecting anything fresh but they really didnt work to earn anything from the audiencenothing more to say oh  avoid the sequel,astonish
is a spinoff of the 2013 horror hit the conjuring after an attack on their house by satanic cultists miawallis  johnward horton decide to move to a house in a safer neighborhood mia soon discovers that there are strange things happening in the house and that a victorian doll that john gifted her might be involved somehow is a horror movie however its not horrifying in any sense of the word there are just two scenes that are really scary in the movie the rest of the movie is not terrifying at all the movie is extremely predictable except for one scene the jump scares in the movie are very obvious so the viewer does not jump out of hisher skin a note on the performances wallis is very mediocre as mia wallis expressions do not show genuine fear of whatever is happening around her maybe i would have gotten more scared if she would emote with her eyes instead of just screaming hysterically ward horton is effective as john tony amendola is impressive as father perez alfre woodard is good as evelyn eric laden is great as detective clarkin is not a must watch however if youre a fan of the conjuring watch it i must warn you though you will be left somewhat disappointed,astonish
this was not terrible not good not remarkable isnt really much of anything in my opinion during and after viewing i was left with the feeling of clich cheap scares and no real entertainment the films plot is that of an unexceptional horror flick its scares far too few almost all of them are showcased in the trailers feel predictable like many others in the same genre lately i got the impression of the whole picture building suspense on which it does not deliver some more positive reviews talk of reveling in its cheesiness but i would disagree it rather uses it as its very foundation which just wont do for a horror so to summarize this is a mediocre experience overhyped and not worth paying any money for,astonish
2014 out of 4stop me if this sounds familiar hollywood produces a lowbudget horror movie that turns into a massive hit at the box office instead of taking their time and delivering something original they rush the film into production in order to get it into theaters as quick as they can the film turns out to be a major dud on most accounts yes this is the typical horror formula and it continues with the highly disappointing the story itself is pretty simple as a husband and wife are expecting their first child and as a gift he buys her a creepy looking doll after an event that i wont spoil the doll appears to have a life of its own and its up to the wife to convince those around her that theyre in danger i wasnt a major fan of the conjuring i certainly thought it was a good horror film but at the same time i was rather confused why it was getting all the attention that it was seems to be making a lot of money but its being bashed pretty harshly by critics and fans and its easy to see why theres no question that this spinoff was rushed into production and it borrows heavily from other films and in the end there just arent any good scares to be hadagain theres only so much you can do with a rushed picture but this thing really does come across as being cheap there are so many things in this picture that could have been improved on but im guessing due to timing issues they werent one such thing is adding more psychological horror to the picture perhaps after what the mother suffered having the viewer not know if shes really crazy or really being haunted by this doll that aspect is never covered and instead we just get doors constantly slamming or mysterious figures appearing these things are items that weve seen countless times before and theyre not handling with any originality here the film also borrows from rosemarys baby and theres even an obvious nod or rip to mario bavas shockthe performances are pretty average throughout but again theres not too much you can expect out of a film like this with that said ive certainly seen much worse horror movies but the biggest problem here is that its just lazy and lacks any real imagination might be turned into a longrunning series but lets hope a little more thought is put into the sequels,astonish
a couple expecting the birth of their first child are violently attacked just minutes after the culprits murdered their next door neighbours when the police burst in and shoot the culprits dead the blood from the bullet wound of one of the murderers is transfered into a doll sometime after the attack the doll returns to take the soul of their new born babythis film starred wallis ward horton  tony amendolawas released in 2014 and is a spinoff to the conjuring in my opinion this is a poor film i didnt find it scary and in fact quite boring there was a couple of chilling scenes like the basement elevator scene but nothing to rival the scary scenes in the conjuring i dont recommend this film because chances are you will be left disappointed by this film  poor,astonish
if youre even the least bit familiar with my reviews and genre preferences you know about my love for horror i watch too many goreinfused horror flicks dripping with cheesiness for my own good and even the worst of those have outdone the disaster that is presented before us is a film that exists as a sidestory to the highly acclaimed horror favorite of 2013 the conjuring if you have yet to see it do it already youve had a yearso goes the tale of a doll presented in the introduction of the conjuring determined to terrify and revolt with its roots in satanism and demonic entities we begin identically to the conjuring thats right folks the first few minutes are just carbon copies from the conjuring eventually we are presented with the necessary one year earlier frame outlining the muchanticipated roots of the doll this is when we meet mia and john gordon a happily married couple with a baby on the waywithout giving too much of the plot away heres an introduction to mia and john experience a home invasion by two members of a satanic cult a female cult member stabs mia in the stomach just as the cops arrive and is shot bleeding onto the doll as she dies mia john and the baby survive the attack and their baby lea is eventually born however there is a deep uneasiness lurking underneath the surface and the couple moves homes after mia begins to experience paranormal events she believes are linked to the attackfrom here you expect to kick it into full gear as it delves deeper into the satanic and supernatural abilities the doll now possesses for the most part it presents them but in the most mundane possible way is a film that builds in intensity but eventually fails to lead anywhere we expect big thrills to come and we are left emptyhanded almost every single time the scares are cheap and the films opportunity to explore the mythological aspects of and the cult responsible for its demonic possession are left untold instead we get 98 minutes of suspense leading to nowhere but a terribly executed finale it feels like a drama film desperately attempting to be considered horrorthe scares in i will admit are spinetingling at times there are several minutes in the film that are fulfilling for horror fans like myself but the fact that it is only several minutes of the film proves that is an awfully executed piece of cinema the pacing of the film is highly uneven the acting is subpar at times and the script leaves much to be desired for an october release we deserve better than a poorly written badly directed horror film like i will admit there is a possibility i am being more critical of this film due to my love of the conjuring and yet in the scope of existing outside of the conjuring universe still feels like a lousy film few will enjoy it as a new favorite cult classic but only if absolutely none of it is taken seriously believe me with this film its not very difficult to accomplishfor more of my film rants follow me on twitter calciumwaste,astonish
okay first the people who reviewed this movie and gave it high scores must either be production on the film or actors possibly even kids creepy it is not entertaining it is not i loved the conjuring and heard this was being released i thought great i find dolls creepy this will scare me how wrong could i of been the doll is lifeless and about as wooden as the acting i thought at least we would of got eye movement but no it stayed slumped on a chair as for the people saying its creepy and on a par to childs plays chucky lies its nothing alike i would say avoid it and go see ouija instead far more creepier i just hope the conjuring part 2 will be better than this rubbish i was subjected to a waste of my hard earned cash,astonish
this is really embarrassing of a horror the storyline is a bloody joke half of the movie makes kinda sense but when the other half kicks inooh the poo is about to beginthe movie is pretending that the audience does not know whats going but is so god damn obviouswe could had a cool origin of the doll but noooo we have to see how the couple is dealing with this doll it make me really sad that they had so much to work with but didnt deliver at allenvironment of the movie is always sunny and bright besides the ending and the basement,astonish
conjuring was one movie in the horror genre that stood out for its narrative and treatment in horrifying the audience to the maximum with its visual and sound effects though story wise it was the same thing of possession that we have seen numerous times in films but it served the ultimate purpose of frightening the audiences now we have a prequel following up the conjuring as begins before the incidents unfold in conjuring about the film is watchable and scare the viewers but somewhere the zing or the x factor is missing here to make it a memorable well crafted and an effective horror flick so this an average film when compared with some classic horrorsjohn and mia are a happily married young couple expecting their first child when john gift mia a big doll but they are in for a nightmare as strange things happen in their life once this doll enter their life yes you guessed it right this doll is possessed creating havoc in john and mias life that continues after leah their baby is born rest every thing is a predictable drama with familiar climax and series of events that we have seen and is quite common in horror flicksthe film has few moments that will scare you but those are very limited to make a highly engaging film no comparisons can be made between and conjuring as the latter is far ahead of the former in many aspects but as a separate movie is passable with least of expectations the actors who portrayed john and mia were good in their respective roles a lady character enter john and mias life at the fag end of the movie and it was a nice performance from her though the role was small last but not the least the doll deserves a special mention with that smiling but haunting looks on the technical side visual effects were ok along with good sound design overall without a comparison with any of the classic horror movies and conjuring is passable and qualify to be an average film,astonish
halloween night and after returning from a very unfrightening costume party dressed as an even less frightening santa claus i decided i wanted to be scared so i hopped on the internet and found the popular 2013 horror flick the conjuring two hours later the movie finished and i was well into november first flinching at every little sound i heard and trying to fall asleep as my feet tingled in fear of being pulled from my bed for anyone who has seen the conjuring you know the exact feeling now im not a particular fan of horror films they are extremely overdone and rarely well but this one got to me from my limited experience the conjuring is certainly the best horror movie ive seen then they went and made a prequelis the prequel to the ever so successful and ever so creepy the conjuring the premise of is that one shot in the conjuring where the same doll turns her head and you wet your pants the plot however is found in an average everyday couple and their newborn child as a gift to celebrate the new babys birth the husband im saying husband and wife because as soon as the movie finished i forgot their names surprises the wife with a doll after a traumatic incident where the neighbors are murdered by members of a satanic cult and the husband and wife are attacked one of the attackers commits suicide with the doll in her hands some evil spirit then enters the doll and the average happy family soon begin to experience the horrors of a demonic presencethe happy couple mia and john gordon i just looked up their names on imdb were played by wallis and ward horton respectively i was not impressed by either performance as they were both very single noted ward horton in particular had zero depth to his character making him entirely forgettable at the times even when he was not on screen in the conjuring one of the strongest things about the film was the performances patrick wilson was fairly dull as well but vera farminga and lili taylor gave the film a depth that really brought it to another level this was nowhere to be found in alfre woodard provided some interesting development and did save a couple scenes but she was simply not allowed enough screen time to have any sort of effect on the final result of the filmjohn leonetti took the directors chair for after being the head cinematographer for james wan during filming of the conjuring this is not the first time leonetti has directed a sequel or prequel to a film he was head of photography there is one consistency throughout his work though the originals were fairly well received but when leonetti was placed as director the sequels were widely disliked this is leonettis third film to direct the first two were mortal combat annihilation and the butterfly effect 2 it is a wonder to me that the prequel to the conjuring was placed in such unreliable hands however it was and was the resultas the previews finished and began i adjusted in my seat bracing myself to be scared leonetti used a clever tool in beginning this film by using the same shots that began the conjuring unfortunately after using up all these shots and displaying the title with a climactic musical swell it went black i was sure something was about to jump out and scare me instead i looked up and i was in church and a nice church too very well lit church finishes and after a very lovely conversation with some friends our average couple returned to their suburban california home with palm trees in the yard and the sun shining as bright as ever at this point i almost began to wonder if i had sat down in the wrong theater this continued for the rest of the film there were different scenes where circumstances would climax and it would be fairly frightening but seconds later it was morning again and the birds were chirpingthe thing that made the conjuring work so well was the constant feeling that something awry was about to happen it was the polar opposite here where i found myself feeling like i was watching a pleasant drama rather than a horror film it could be that was leonettis intent to make you feel comfortable before he scares you but it simply didnt work in the end the only credit for scares that got me go to the films musical composer joseph bishara save some weak dialogue and performances was a decent film overall it just wasnt scary so as i walked out of theater the doll never bothered me anyway i give a 5010,astonish
another flick about a possessed doll and being linked to the conjuring 2013 the expectations were high but it wasnt my thing at all iyts just another example how modern horrors are these days a bit lame and a lot of talking now that extreme gore is over in flicks like the torture porn era and has moved to series we are mostly left with horrors that doesnt deliver a thingit has a rather good start but once the helter skelter reference is done we do move over to the possessed doll just sitting there and nothing really happens i was waiting for some scary parts but even that didnt came at all maybe the cellar scene was the most frightening one but no goosebumps for me and the little child standing in the room running towards its victim and changing into a grown up girls while running not scary at all againskip this doll an d go watch the conjuring in steadgore 05 nudity 05 effects 25 story 25 comedy 05,astonish
so i ended up going to watch this even though i dont like horror filmsi have never got over chucky and so dolls will always freak me out so will children with dark long hair in their faces dressed in white sleeping gowns and an expressionless face stay away from me please lol dont blame me blame the ring thanks leonetti for reigniting my fear for dolls and statues not lolif you dont share the same fear of dollsstatues andor like to be scared go watch it for the thrill of being scaredbut when you leave that cinema and drive home in the dark cold foggy night dont let it play on your mind that is sitting in the back of your car staring at you from the rearview mirror will ya lol 1,astonish
as a character and of course by appearance is very scary and the cast was satisfying the sound of the cinema made it scarier and i wouldnt expect to feel so terrified if i had to watch it at home during the movie i was really scared only three or four times and that was all classical story of a thriller in addition the trailer revealed many things about the movie so i knew what was going to happen in some crucial parts of the movie just by having watched the trailer this fact was very disappointing generally i expected much more fear from this movie and i was not as satisfied as i thought i would be,astonish
was a nice plot device to establish the kind of work the paranormal investigators the warrens did in the before the main plot of the conjuring started and it probably should have stayed that way is one of those films that are so okay that its a problem the film is a prequelspinoff to 2013s the conjuring and serves to tell the back story of the possessed doll that is showing in the beginning of that film in this film we see that it began as a doll eventually possessed by the spirit of a criminal and that instantly brings childs play comparisons to mind but at least doesnt use unexplained magical words to make it happen throughout the film we see the spirit possessing the doll doesnt do anything physically but manipulates objects in the environment and causes mental delusions the film decides that it needs more clichs and adds in the fact that everything that has happened is part of some mysterious demon worshiping cult shadowy monsters to attack in the dark basement a priest being shown that the light of god is easily overpowered by any demon and a character to make a seemingly random heroic sacrifice that in the end serves to accomplish little to nothing the film isnt anything special and is made up of elements weve seen a thousand times overall i dont feel like there is any real incentive to go see this movie it doesnt add anything to the genre as a whole and doesnt really feel like we are learning anything worth our attention about past the first ten minutes the film is a little less than okay because it just uses tired film ideas and feels like it is playing it too safe because of it,astonish
every once in awhile a horror film uses a doll and it comes in all different ways the classics like poltergeist or the 2013 the conjuring used it as as an element and not as a main plot device the first type of doll movie that used a doll as a main character was magic a ventriloquist with a young anthony hopkins as the magician it was in the 80s with the first childs play that changed the doll concept somewhat yes he was another killer but the doll named chucky was so revolutionary because he was a character and was actually given something to do due to the fact he was a childrens doll this made him even more creepy following after chucky there were similar dolls films like the puppet master series or dolly dearest which were clear inspirations for those to follow horror director james wan is famous for following the trend of dolls in the 2000s with the torture film saw dead silence and of course the conjuring the doll concept is one that is hit or miss in films ultimately  based off the the conjuring doll is a prequel to the conjuring and showcases the doll before the events of the conjuring set in 1967 the couple of mia form wallis and john form ward horton are expecting their first child together john gives mia a doll she has been looking for as a prebaby present and for the nursery that has been set up for her you could definitely say that mia is fan of dolls as the room is essentially a nursery filled with close to a dozen dolls after a vicious attack at the house by people from a cult the doll eventually becomes possessed from the cult member annabel higgins the possessed doll is then ready to killbeing that the conjuring was set in the 70s it makes total sense as to why this film was set in the 60s from the style including cars houses hospital and even showing an interesting clip of maryland manson a infamous killer during this time all of these are all examples of the 60s timeline being used at the same time the 60s aspect makes this film seem so silly when is the last time you ever heard of woman during pregnancy on bed rest by a doctor it is also so cheesy watching a couple trying to get reception on an old television the baby is in an old baby carriage makes which me really question if this is stealing from the classic rosemarys baby ultimately along the way is a horror film where we should care about the characters the couple surely is likable and going through the exact opposite of what they should be going through when trying to have a baby the couple are too simple in substance though and really i didnt feel much sympathy for them unfortunately the local book store owner evelyn alfre woodard plays an original character which by the last act turns into a very predictable character and meets a very cheesy ending if we boil it down to just one thing the biggest problem with the film just might be the doll itself the doll does have an interesting look and feel with its design and color that said we are never given an explanation of what makes this doll so special and why the mother thinks it is so for the most part this doll is sitting around in the background of scenes and really if we didnt know this doll could be looked at as just a random doll in background shots not in any shape or form does this doll provide any types of scares not even small jump scenesin the end is a big disappointment the conjuring was a film that was just asking for us to have this prequel because that movie made the doll so intriguing we werent asking for this type of prequel though as this movie is very boring choppy and lacks ideas is a film that will go down as one of the biggest misses in horror in quite some time in the end is a big disappointment the conjuring was a film that was just asking for us to have this prequel because that movie made the doll so intriguing we werent asking for this type of prequel though as this movie is very boring choppy and lacks ideas is a film that will go down as one of the biggest misses in horror in quite some time,astonish
there are things happening that i cant explainthe conjuring was one of my favorite horror films of the past decade and it even managed to make it into my list of the best films of 2013 which is a huge achievement considering im not a fan of the genre despite how much i enjoyed the conjuring i still had very little expectations for its prequel because from the get go it seemed like the producers were simply trying to bank on the success of the first film that is perhaps the reason why they rushed this film to theaters only an year after the conjuring the budget is surprisingly smaller and james wans direction is missed here i want to begin my criticism with the technical aspects of the film because the conjuring was one of the better looking horror films i had seen but from the opening scene in the contrast is huge the lighting and the eerie setting that was so effectively used in the original is lacking in this prequel its strange considering that director john leonetti was the cinematographer in the conjuring but here he fails to give the film a similar look instead of those amazing shots wan delivered we get several close ups of the dolls face which never actually does anything this film looks as ugly as the vintage doll does and it lacked the eerie atmosphere that worked so well in the conjuringif at least the story or characters would have been half as interesting as the conjuring i would give a chance but nothing about it really worked for me the story is predictable the characters are uninteresting and boring and there are very few scary moments leone should stick to his work as a cinematographer which is an area where he has proved to be talented but as a director this is his third flop if it werent for the conjurings success this film would have been sent directly to dvd because even the performances were wooden wallis and ward horton fail to deliver compelling and interesting characters we would care for that lack of sympathy for them hurts the films chances to scare us the conjuring had set up such an interesting premise that there were a lot of interesting things that couldve been done with this prequel unfortunately here we discover that the doll that was the scariest thing in the paranormal investigators closet enclosed in a glass shelf actually isnt all that eerie as it seemed thanks to gary daubermans uninspiring scriptdespite how much disappointed me i still have to admit there were two or three shocking moments that sort of worked for me the film does become predictable and familiar at times relying on the sounds of rocking chairs and appliances going off on their own at night after so many closeups of the dolls face it lost its eeriness the three moments i will rescue from this film involve the opening scene where we see the neighbors get attacked by a cult from the window then the scene we see from the trailer where the small girl runs towards the door turning into the adult and finally the elevator scene which was perhaps the scariest moment of the film other than those three moments i wasnt really shocked by the characters and the story were so boring that at times i felt like snoozing for a few minutes it was a huge disappointment,astonish
when i heard that the conjuring was getting a sequel based on the unbelievably disturbing real story of the doll i was so pumped not only am i a huge lover of the horror genre i am also a pretty keen follower of the real paranormal not to say i am a believer just a very keen enthusiast of the subject the doll still sits today in the museum started by the warrens how messed up is that a museum dedicated to the most sinister paranormal objects in the world id love to visit it one dayopening up with the same scene in which the conjuring did two young women and a young man are telling ed and lorraine warren about their experiences with what they believe to be a haunted doll they call cut back a year and we are now with john horton and mia wallis who are expecting their first child john gives his wife a doll that she has been searching for for a long timeas mia closes in on her dude date something unbelievably horrific happens a couplepair of satanic cultists break into their home attacking mia and stabbing her in the stomach both cultists end up dying in the house the female cultist named higgins dies with the aforementioned doll in her hands he blood lands on doll starting what will be the worst experience of the young couples lives a short time passes and mia is now seeing shadows shadowy figures hearing noises resulting in her horrible realisation that something evil is after her new born babyoverall the film was a complete and utter let down if any horror writersdirectors see this read this line carefully loud noises are not how jump scares work lazy film making at its best making watchers wince through using loud noises is not how horror works it never has been anybody could make a film in that way an call it horror the scenes do make you jump not through fear of the film just shock in the boom as you do when you wake a sleeping person with a bangthe main problem is james wan when creating the film that spawned this sequel the conjuring review coming in the next couple of days created a beautifully made horror that felt like it took place in the 70s unfortunately john leonetti fell on his face in this aspect he just robbed tropes and elements from 60s  70s horror he fell into the trap that lots of modern horror directors do just paying homage to the greats does not add to your film if anything it takes away from your film leaving the fans with a sense of let down there is an over use of panning reveals if you are not familiar is panning through a room an passing a doorwindow to reveal something in the background it happens so many times that you feel no suspense watching themall truly offers is the chance to wince four or five times through sheer ear pain none of the scenes will built any tension for the viewer they try to build up but fall flat on their face unlike the conjuring which builds scene to the point in which you feel the tension this film is a misguided idea of how to rob a genre by using jump scares to bring in a youngerinexperienced audience who know no better due to the massive decline in modern horror most fans of the genre will be sitting there twiddling their thumbs waiting for the film to actually end and may i add i did not they needed to redesign the look of i personally find the doll much creepier i get why they did it though the fear of porcelain dolls is a mass fear the film itself is really not the only problem wallis and horton are boring throughout wallis mumbles most of her lines and you struggle to truly grasp what she is feeling while horton is the opposite his overly emotion acting feels forced there is one scene that was done pretty well which is the only reason the film didnt get a zero or a one star rating that is the basementstorage unit scene i can highly recommend you check that scene out on maybe youtube or something other than that i highly recommend you get your evil doll horror fix from childs play 1988 dead silence 2007 which was director by producer of this film james wan or dolls 1987,astonish
well this definitely got the tone right in that this entry can be treated as being consistent with the tone adopted by the conjuring and thats something i guess as for the rest what couldve perhaps been an exciting as well as horrifying tale in this series turns out to be a tame bythenumbers affair that mainstream audiences might ending up buying their tickets for but this aint something that will not stand the test of time even in terms of becoming a cult classic no pun intended considering the cult storyline even the ring movies oozed more menace what the movie did have going for it were the technical aspects especially the overall look and of course as mentioned the tone especially the build up to a scare and the abundance of jump scares doesnt help that weve seen it all doesnt help that the doll ends up in the warren household and we already know that the sound design is as it should be but other than the look none of the departments break new ground and that is disappointing since this exists because at the time the conjuringbroke new ground conclusively id recommend a theatrical watch in spite of it being mehsince it looks good and is not atrocious and its got alfre woodward wasted  yes but present,astonish
watching horror movies a long time ago used to be something i really enjoyed i liked getting that tense feeling in my stomach the tension building than just when you think its all quiet bam they get you with some surprise you werent ready for now i watch a horror movie and i all i end up doing is seeing how many times an can guess whats about to happen based on the scene that is basically what this movie was to me a very big and very long guessing game the whole time i was watching i just kept trying to figure out what would jump out its not a bad movie but it was nothing new i do like the premise of it as its a prequel to the conjuring it was very good but as a horror movie it was not while i enjoy a little back story now and than i prefer it to be interesting i found myself quickly bored of it and ready for it to be over if you are really interested in it i would go see it otherwise pass it up,astonish
takes the name of the conjuring down not at all comparable to any horror movie horror element in is tending to zero and the first half of the movie is like a family movie just a time pass if you have nothing to do seriously if you have nothing to do story contains no strength work of actors can be appreciated but the script fails the whole plot just a waste of money it is a boring movie and no one knows why in many countries it has been given adult ratingi personally felt very dissatisfied after seeing this movie i was expecting more the ghosts are not scary this movie is a very strange sort of movieit has been stretched to this lengthactually the story is only of ten minutes,astonish
first im glad i didnt watch the trailer because its not a trailer its a spoiler they put the best scares on the trailer so it might have ruined my viewing experience had i watched the trailer first luckily i didnti got mixed feeling about this movie the good points first then the atmosphere is creepy the acting is nice especially the ladymom shes excellent they build suspense from trivial things like the sewing machine and the simple unknown factor the elevator scene is geniusthe bad points in my opinion is the overused of blasting sound effect that denotes horror shock its cheap and unfair and it happens all the time some things cant be explained at all its just seem like made up things to add to the creepiness but once you think about it it doesnt make any sense im talking about the drawings here come on now the doll spent some time to draw those prophetic drawings wheres the logic to that and im not talking about normal logic im talking within the movie logic also it has really bad moral message in the end that makes something seems to be a good thing where such thing never is a good thing there are other ways to get rid of that doll one of the possible solutions was to call a swat team or whatever and escort that doll to another country for example the ending is the worst part in my opinion,astonish
 spoiler is very small is second to last paragraph going into this i expected a bit of a quality falloff with james wans insidous the conjuring usual cinematographer john r leonetti taking over directing duties what i found isnt a horror movie  its a boring oneto me one of the things that makes a horror movie great is its connection with its characters and how they react to their given circumstances in we really dont get much of either still subpar wallis does the best job of making us feel what shes going through the rest of the characters are inserted in the movie as typical horror clichs  a priest and a book store owner who believes in the occult the husband is inexplicably devoid of common sense and really does not come off as caring very much about what is happeningthe doll itself is another large problem with this movie its just not scary im not sure what they could have done to make it better but there were a few times i caught myself gigglingwhen the movie reached its climactic scene i wasnt surprised it was flat and even threw in an antagonist from a prior movie or at least looked like one that could have been used much betterthe only reason id advise watching this movie is an example of what not to do i can only hope that leigh whannell insidious 3 does a better job in the directors chair than was displayed here,astonish
we all know by now that when you do a prequel the number 1 rule is to make sure it ties in perfectly this film the prequel to the conjuring is 98minutes of pure awful yes it kinda ties in with the conjuring but thats where it ends with the word kinda as how you can call this a horror is beyond me for shocks and scares this film lacks in both and the parts that try to be scary are just loud violin scary music and i would say this should really be a b movie something you watch on syfi channel not something on the big screen granted the last 10mins are probably the best part of the film but skip through the first 88 minutes overall it is a very disappointing film thats a prequel to a successful film,astonish
i do remember a scene from the ninth gate of roman polanski where a man unlocked his elevator as well as library by pressing 6 button 3 timeswhich means 666or devils numberthe camera did follow him quietlyhoweverin if i am not wrongmia did the same thing on elevatori thinkthe scene requires a little attention to notice aboutespeciallyit would have better to give a brief idea about sigil of lucifer or lucifers cursewhich we have noticed on left hand of miadone by devilalthoughthe works of camerasounds  make up was quite goodi watched the movie i am not disappointed,astonish
well i expected to be a lot more of this movie i dont mind slows movies i loved oculus which came out early in the yeari was really disappointed with this the trailer makes it look a lot creepy then it actually iti just could not get into the movie at all by the 40 minutes mark   then it moves i was kind of bored then the the movies story moves forward a little and there one decent creepy moment in the movie in the whole movie i didnt even find the doll all that creepy i just like the whole movie just average horror movie 510 for me,astonish
this movie was one of the most awaited movies of 2014 but i was just a huge disappointment i had always problem with the critics but on this one i can say critics are 1000 right so many horror fans waited for this movie just because of one line that was in the trailer befone conjuring there was but everything is missing in this movie you can say that only one scene in the movie is worth to remember which one is copied from insidious where a child jump out of the window every lock in the house is locked whenever strikes but it can be unlocked by the key is it a joke and expressions were too bad for a scary movie i am no one who can say but it should not be made,astonish
i was so looking forward to this movie i enjoyed the conjuring immensely what a disappointment slow moving predictable corny when did horror movies get so bad there is nothing scary about them these days all the best bitsof this film are shown in the trailers obviously this was just amoney spinner thrown together to make a quick dollar dont be duped into seeing this on the back of how much you enjoyed the conjuring it is not a patch on it save your money  get a rental copy if youre that intent on seeing it but dont waste your money on a cinema ticket the acting itself was not too bad ive seen worse hence the 2 score the directors should be ashamed at producing such rubbish,astonish
this movie would have been much better if we had some decent actors they can act they just cant act well the only cast members who could act were the shop owner evelyn played by alfre woodard and the neighbours played by kerry omalley and brian howe the neighbours dialogue was a bit off but they can still act the parents were dreadful in my opinion they were acting and it ruined everythingthe script was okay it could have been better i think there was realism there just not enough especially for the parents perhaps it was just the acting maybe if the acting was better maybe the script wouldnt seem so mediocre its better than anything i can do for sure but still nothing speciali did like a few of the scares scares do not have to be original to be scary just as long as they are scary there were startles that worked really well its hard to be truly original these days there are more movies being produced than ever beforewhat else can i say i cant remember the score so i suppose it was neutral and the cinematography was good i didnt find anything creepy about i do not find dolls scary nor did i find chucky scary actually i never saw chucky because it looked ridiculous this movie only appealed to me because it was advertised in relation to the conjuring they got me,astonish
i really wanted to watch this movie as i have gained interest n horror moviesi also thought the movie would be quaint but trust meit is a waste of time and money last years the conjuring was one of the most thrilling horror movies in ages  this ploddingly predictable prequel is one of the worst essentially rosemarys baby meets childs play for the paranormal activity generation this sees a young californian couple firstly caught up in a helter skelter spree by their next door neighbours cultified estranged daughter and then menaced by a demonic doll she may have invoked before her passing cue slamming doors possessed sewing machines and feral hobs as firsttime mum mia wallis comes under constant attack in both their santa monica starter home and pasadena apartment the actors are good but the lack of story line makes it boringaltogether the movie has only 2 terrifying scenesand yesthe dollwhich only flies once in air wellyou can skip this movie and watch others like the conjuringmamathe cabin in the woodsetc so from me a 2 out of 10,astonish
sorry seen this and i personally thought it was terrible the husband is a doctor with no brains the wife of the doctor again has no brains you will know what i mean once you have seen the film and lets be honest if you were up all night pursued by some weird creep you would leave the building by the way if lifts do have alarms the film is flawed with a poor story line why would the husband leave for a few days when his wife is close to delivering the baby and then the house catches fire and they still return to the housethe priest is really not with it and the lady from the book store decides she needs to get out sorry it really is a poor movie those of you who say its good really need to be tested or resign from the company who pay you for giving good reviews no kidding this really is a pants movie seriously dont bother dont say i didnt warn you x,astonish
as recently as the last half a century dolls have been mostly used in cinema and in popculture for their looks it is very questionable to who ever constructed such toys would think they excited kids rather than creep them out when referenced the most notable creation people remember is don mancinis childs play 1988 series starring brad dourif as the infamous chucky another one that comes to mind would be james wans jigsaw from the saw 2004 series even billy from dead silence 2007 who was also headed by james wan had their share of memorabilia then when wans the conjuring 2013 hit theaters viewers were briefly introduced to another doll with some serious attitude issues so what is the story behind this new addition and is it uniquely different from that of our other doll counterparts mmmtough to say it has its moments but more often than not it comes off as a standard affairthe doll like many others was once just a collectors item unfortunately the period of time at which it was made is the problem during the late 1960s a normal family is attacked by a group of cult members for unknown reasons and along with that the doll becomes possessed gary daubermans first theatrical screenplay isnt bad but it also isnt anything special the fact that after seeing this movie the background to why needs to be kept in a glass case at the warrens is so important is clear but other than this the writing lacks clarity  specifically on cult rules how does one possess a doll with such ease who actually possesses the doll a newly created demon or the individual who possessed it in the first place all of which these questions get relatively skimmed over with explanations like  crazy people do crazy things or cults summon demons these are very generic answers considering the pace at which it runscast wise the family played by wallis and ward horton put in believable performances but do not stand out even veteran actor tony amendola better known from antonio banderas the mask of zorro 1998 plays his typecast role  a priest its nice to see him but again nothing new the most likable character of the whole group was evelyn alfre woodard a local bookstore owner evelyn had charm and character arc that was far greater than the rest its characters like these that viewers need more of when it came to visual style the majority of it was average to slightly above james kniests cinematography is frequently flat john r leonettis direction is standard on most cases too this is unfortunate due to how many horror films hes worked with in the past as the director of photography this includes the conjuring 2013 insidious chapter 2 2013 piranha 3d 2010 dead silence 2007 and childs play 3 1991even jim carreys the mask 1994 in fact there was a scene that couldve been used as a twist ending but was then ignored that wouldve been more horrific if it had ended like thatthe violence is there but it is also very dry im not sure if leonetti was going for the less is more approach but it didnt work considering the scares arent effective either because the doll does barely anything the movement of the doll is even more restricted and rigid than chucky billy or jigsaw the only thing creepy about it was its face and never ending stare even eye movement or creaky head turning wouldve helped the doll feel more intimidating the only elements that go above and beyond their mark are some tense scenes special effects and music the best scene to the movie is located in the attic whenever a baby criesits a bit unsettling the special  practical effects look decent although what is given isnt frequent composer joseph bisharas music is alright he does include emotional and creepy tunes which involve heavy cello and piano its bit more effective than the conjuring score he made a year before even though it does borrow from it because the stories are connected is it a decently made movie assembly wise yesas an experience not if you seen movies like this beforeits connections to the conjuring 2013 does give some insight but its own origins are bit cloudy its made professionally all the way down from its acting special effects and music but it is rarely effective at being scary its execution is derivative at almost every level,astonish
i am a big fan of horror movies i went to this movie with high expectation expecting it will do justice as a prequel to one of my favorite horror movie the conjuring but i was really disappointed after seeing this movie it lacks that story line effective narration and of course the horror element except for the couple of scenes there is nothing in the movie first 30 minutes is really boring i felt this film has borrowed scenes from famous horror dont wanna mention names and just added bit of its own story line to it there is nothing in the movie which keeps you to glued to your seat or keep on your toes for a horror movie i personally feel background score plays a crucial role which is lacking in this movie over all fun to watch provided if you expect least from the moviepros couple of scenes lead actress performance she is not great but of all she is good ghost animation which i feel similar to the one in drag me to hellcons not scary no interesting story line expected narration loud background score,astonish
except the creepy doll which similar creature we have seen several times where is the stp same unbelievable scene that the husband always doesnt trust his wife then why you married her and my dear you suspected the doll or the apartment is possessed by demonat least you knew the doll was hugged by a evil woman who tried to kill you while she died and you still want to keep it how weird are you and you even want to show of your spirit of adventure  dig out the truth by yourself alone back to the movie if you are looking for a terrified movie this is not the best choice,astonish
the first half contains absolutely nothing scary other than a short 30 second scene in the first 10 minutes of the film where the main characters get attacked by the neighbours as part of an attempt to completing some demon ritualthere are a few split second shots of the devil the ghost of higginsthe spirit trapped in the doll in the last quarter of the movie thats it pathetic story presentation everything they have cleverly used the name of the conjuring movie to lure audiences into the theatre and try to kill them out of sheer boredom,astonish
the eerie antique doll featured in the conjuring gets the titular cinematic treatment to attenuating effecta spinoff from the conjuring the film tells the unnerving back story of the possessed and disturbing dolla humdrum couple whom is pregnant is readying the baby room for their imminent arrival mothertobe mia has an affinity for vintage dolls and receives rare from husband john on the night her family is viciously attacked by satanic cultistsabout the only thing that scriptwriter gary dauberman does get correct is the chilling scene where the cult members attack the gordon residence the circumstances of the event were well thought out appropriate for the time period and moderately unexpected unfortunately this is the only horrifying scene of the entire filmstraddles the line between homage to the supernatural thrillers of the 70s and uninspired ripoff of the supernatural thrillers of the 70s the scares are far more feeble and ineffective than its peers either because they are incredibly clich or just lamely repetitive any hope for truly unsettling scares are overlooked and postproduction unnecessarily adds the deafening and notorious string sound effect at every opportunitydirector john r leonetti relies on loud sewing machines loud record players and doors randomly closing for the regular frights of the film  all of which are just no longer scary anymore the direction manages to lack all ability to add mood and tone leonetti is not opinionated nor deliberate in his styling and does little to assist in the few scares that are in the filmperhaps suffers from overly high and unrealistic expectations i cant help but feel that if the production companies new line cinema and the safran company had not rushed to capitalize on the conjurings success and waited for a better script and more qualified director that overall a better film would have been producedfor full reviews of recent releases please check out our website,astonish
is a movie that creates an amazing premise in the mind of the viewer only to cowardly pull back from that and neuter the entire film into mediocrity if youve seen the film or dont mind spoilers continue on theres a premise in the film that a demon wants take the childs soul at one point the mother finds the doll in the crib and starts bashing it around we then see what appears to be her real baby laying on the ground we now believe she just murdered her own baby due to a hallucination by the demon and now out of desperation will allow the demon to take her soul or something along these lines a real mind beep to get what the demon wants but nothing of the sort happens instead its just another doll on the floor baby is fine but mother then thinks she has to kill herself to save her daughter which makes no sense because if she believes in demons and she goes to church she probably believes in god and must believe her dead daughter is now in heaven right well it doesnt go that way either instead she lives and the completely random black voodoo woman who has been helping them sacrifices herself the ending would have been better if she had beaten her baby to death and gave her soul to the demon out of guilt the whole movie has no balls and is a major disappointment i would give this movie very few tostino pizza rolls and say wait for netflixcabledvd to watch this train wreck,astonish
so recently i got a phone call from a friend whom i went to watch the conjuring with the last time we hung out was when the movie had released july 2013 so we dont really hangout much but he called after all these months just because was about to release and we were just that excited that was our first mistakethe horror in is just good as compared to the conjuring which was quite scary there will be a lot of jerk and scare time and again people in the back will be mumbling after a good scare during scenes  just normal  no problem with that the problem although is in the story its confusing at times does not make sense and you would think your nephew could write a better storyacting the conjuring  direction the conjuring  story the conjuring  horror the conjuring  why the comparison just so you dont carry high hopes to the theater it hurts enjoy the scare,astonish
i havent seen the film and i dont plan to either is it really a true story i know the trailer says before the conjuring there was now ive seen the conjuring and it wasnt fun as soon as i saw the doll i didnt want to watch im not too bothered by storys of china dolls and how devil spirits are supposedly best suited to them but surely the doll doesnt look like that in real life why would your husband buy that for you it doesnt make sense obviously like other scary films it involves a baby and has old fashioned music however the trailer to me shows how takes horror to a whole new level random people walking through their house while they sleep dressed in white robes if it is a true story my head would be messed up i rate the trailer at a 4 i think its too much just for a trailer,astonish
could have been a lot better truly it did not live up to the hype or its sequel conjuring  it was scary in a few places like when pregnant mia was dragged the little girl turning into a scary possessed lady the appearance of the black demon from the ceiling etc but for most part the movie was fairly slow and also it wasnt really scary also the lift scene and the basement scene couldve been a lot better the doll did not do anything for most part of the movie and was just lying  or was still for what it did not move places much nor do anything  but it is a good watch  just not scary enough  also most horror movies give an impression that nothing much can be done  it is not true  when right help is sought  it can be taken care of is the message that should be sent in my opinion ,astonish
who doesnt get weirded out by the slightly human looking many people who lay eyes on her are immediately unsettled and that makes for a perfect horror movie villain the movie itself was good it contained great jump scares areas where the tension was palpable and as we all know the ever present every creepy doll however the movie sadly made some key errors that took away from some of the extra potential fear if you want a decent horror movie to get the adrenaline pumping this might be your cup of tea but it wasnt as panic inducing as i had hoped warning spoilers ahead if you have not watched stop reading the biggest issue with the movie was the fact that the demons face was shown this should be a nono for all horror movie makers and here is why in this movie it is made abundantly clear that this is the cause of a demon the movie beats that fact like a dead horse yet they still insist on showing the audience the demons face not a good move as an inhuman spirit we would assume that it shouldnt look human and yet they always do this immediately takes away some of the fear factor from the entitys appearance i wont lie the movie had it going great with the chase scene where all you can see is the shadowy outline of the demon on the stairs that was perfect it kept the audience on the edge of their seats and it was just far enough into the uncanny valley to make your skin crawl but alas they showed its face illuminated in a few scenes that followed and that for me took away from the fear aspect because it looked like a human face not as scary as a supposed inhuman spirits faceoverall the movie was good but not great if you are scared by jump scares and the classic loud noises in horror movies then i would recommend that you go and see it for you steeled veterans while there are some scenes of great misdirection and excellent use of the uncanny valley it might leave you wanting a little bit moreohalloran,astonish
three stars out of fiveprequel to the 2013 hit supernatural horror flick the conjuring its said to be based on another true haunting investigated by ed and lorraine warren the paranormal investigating team that the first film revolved around this tale deals with the backstory of the doll named which was heavily featured in the original movie the film stars wallis ward horton tony amendola and alfre woodard it was directed by john r leonetti written by gary dauberman and coproduced by james wan the director of the original movie while it is frightening and creepy enough at times its still not nearly as impressive as the original the movie begins in 1968 with two young women and a young man explaining to ed and lorraine warren how they think their doll anabelle is haunted its the same opening scene as the conjuring the story then flashes back to a year earlier 1967 when a young couple named john horton and mia gordon wallis are newlyweds and expecting their first child john gives mia a vintage doll as a present that she adds to her collection in the babys room some time later the couple is attacked in their home by satanic cult members theyre rescued by the police but then strange supernatural occurrences begin happening all involving the doll anabelle which was the name of one of the cult members the movie is really slow paced but thats often to be expected with this type of film it does have that classic 60s and 70s thriller style to it and the frights and creepy imagery are done really well i dont think the two leads are nearly as charismatic or likable as patrick wilson and vera farmiga ed and lorraine warren in the first movie the story also isnt as compelling or genuinely frightening just as a standalone horror film its pretty decent but when comparing it to the original movie it definitely falls a little shortwatch our movie review show movie talk at httpyoutubeswkkttowhsi,astonish
do you know that feeling when you are watching a movie that is full of elements or pieces that are not only inspired by other films weve seen in the past but are evident rip off of concepts scenes and characters that youve seen before done in much better way this is what you will feel watching the newest horror film from director john r leonetti who was an actual director of photography on excellent insidious movies as well as the conjuring which wast bad in its own right his other directing credits were far from a list and this is what we feel watching his newest directorial attempt there is a strong feel of inspiration from roman polanski horror masterpiece the rosemarys baby in fact the main female lead is called mia wallis same as mia farrow an actress in the original rosemarys baby playing the titled rosemary woodhouse who suspects that her baby is in danger from the satanic cult that wants it to become a devil reincarnate leonetti sets up the story in 1968 just after the manson family murders of sharon tate and labianca which shock america to its core and forever change the collective feeling of innocence and safety created in post war america the lead characters are a young couple who are expecting a baby they are being witnesses to horrendous crime committed next door which eventually drags them down into conflict with satanic cult which is trying to summon the demons as the attackers move on onto the next target they are being stopped by the police and one of them commits suicide and her evil soul enters a creepy looking doll annabel which was a present form a young doctor john ward horton to his wife wallis and his unborn daughter fast forward few months ahead and this young family is living in the new home and go figure the evil followed them there attaching itself to the doll they try to get ride of the doll but is it not too late to be saved reading this you must admit that sounds like a many other movies put together and not even james wan super talented original director of insidious and saw movies as a producer was enough to make this film a cult classic all things considered at least the acting was good starting from very lovely wallis who displayed a sense of confusion and fright that was deeply felt by the audience her doctor husband played by ward horton had that 1960 old movie star look and delivered believable characterization as a husband who as a doctor does not fully believe his wife until it is too late all the other supporting cast did well i must say there are some scary moments in but the cinematography often looks digital breaking the believability factor which is a must for the full experience in horror film you can hear that s sound and music design was heavily inspired by insidious which in itself if a very good thing because for those who understand filmmaking great sound and music design is a half of the success in horror sadly the other more visual half did not deliver as well as we hoped for annabel is not as quite awful as chucky but it could have been so much betterfor more of my film reviews please go to wwwfacebookcomjanuszmadejtechnique,astonish
i blame this on the conjuring if that damn movie wasnt so entertaining i wouldnt have had to see this one i will give credit where credit is due there are some chilling moments in this film however it took an hour to get to them 1 the demon chasing the main character up the stairs got me spooked a little bitand 2 just the overall look of the demon was terrifying i think they did a great job with makeup on this one it reminded me a little bit of insidious to be honestthe only reason why this movie got 5 stars is because its a horror movie so it is going to have the best quality anyway and the demon looked great,astonish
i came to this movie very excited after the promising a plot story and amount of horror being shown in the conjuring that was just plain awesome i expected to have more or less the same amount of horror quality being showngetting straight to this movie it had a really interesting concept on the origins of how the doll was possessed not what i had expected since i thought she was going to be something like chucky from childs play instead the is more like the gateway boundary between and our world and hell itselfall the actors equally acted well for their part in my opinion but there wasnt one who stood out the most to me i expected the warren couple to make an appearance in this film but apart from a few references in the film they never showed up it could really have changed the outcome of the events it they had did arrived to helpthe aspects of the film here in terms of camera works and editing of the film were well shot and put together to help make this into a good film but nothing unique and it just help flowed the movie to go forward i expected some flashbacks in between the scenes and show us a little bit of maybe how certain things turned out to be the way they are but for this film the lighting and sound of the film was what made it really great there will definitely be moments where you feel like you want cover your eyes or look awaymy favorite scene which im sorry that i just have to tell but you guys can already see it in the trailer will have to be the transition change of the little girl running up into the room that the character mia was in and instantly turns into an adult monster like after bursts through the door while still chasing after her that shot in my opinion was done to perfectionoverall not really as scared as id hope it to be but it lived up to the potential however this movie in my opinion definitely could not match up to the conjuring id give it a 6 out of 10,astonish

i didnt like the premise is frightening the idea of being drugged kidnapped tortured and killed by people who are paying to do it is a great concept for a film its just too bad that the movie couldnt decide what it wanted to beit starts off like eurotrip or any number of cheesy teen sex comedies lots of fake boobs and characters acting idiotic in a fake atmosphere scenes in dance clubs that dont look realistic you know the types of places where people are dancing to loud music but somehow can talk to each other in a normal tone of voice and everything is brightly lit so you can see all the movie extras pretending to dance in the background just like all the clubs ive ever been to right anyway this goes on and on until the bloodshed starts giving us absolutely no reason to feel anything for the main charactersthen it turns into the horror film it should be the scenes of torture are effective and psychologically scary if you imagine yourself in the situation but in the context of the rest of this movie it just becomes ineffectivethen the end of the movie turns into an unrealistic revenge fantasy thats played out for the most part for laughs kids payed in bubble gum help the good guy get away by smashing the bad guys heads in with rocks as they chew away and blow bubbles the two girls and guy who set them up are easily killed when they luckily appear in front of the getaway car the man that killed his friends just happens to be on the train on the way home so he can kill him and somehow not get blood on himself then continue on his way so is the movie supposed to be realistic scary or funny its falls short of any of these things eli roth needs to pick one and do itthe music is terrible not in the fact that the music itself isnt good but for the fact that a it doesnt fit the movie and b theres way to much of it theres a scene where the characters are merely walking across a courtyard and the music sounds like it should be a fight scene in harry potter completely out of place and distracting further telling you this is just a movie no need to feel anything for the characters or get scaredyou can do a good compare and contrast between this movie and wolf creek which came out a couple weeks ago everything that is wrong with was done right in wolf creek both movies are about young travelers getting into horrifying situations however in wolf creek the characters actually act like normal human beings therefore you feel disgusted when they get tortured and killed its genuinely frightening and realistic and by all means not fun to watch it makes you feel horrible inside its realistic horror to make a stupid analogy if and wolf creek were movies about viet nam wolf creek would be platoon and would be rambo first blood part two note how neither would be full metal jacket cause its to good to be used in this analogyi gave a 3 out of 10 for a frightening concept and the puke was a nice touch   if youre about to get tortured and killed chances are youre gonna puke   realism eli more realism please,cruel
i just got back from an la screening of i havent seen an effective horror film like this in a long time my stomach was still knotted up after we left the screening the last time i felt like that was when i saw aliens for the first time about 19 years ago since then no other horror film has ever made me feel like that i certainly didnt expect it from this one as much as i loved cabin fever im not blind to the shortcomings of its script as suchi was expecting more of the same from  dark humor gore and a sense of dread im happy to see that director eli roth has taken a big step forward in becoming a better storyteller and filmmakeradmittedly my heart sank when the film began the scenes introducing the main characters were blandly shot and edited all i could think was oh no roth succumbed to some unseen studio pressure to make a normallooking horror flick the style was typical of the what youd see in crap like i know what you did last summer but in very subtle ways the blandness gets washed away and as our heroes enter the threshold of hell the style of the film changes as well this i learned during the qa afterwards with roth was intentionalif youve read some of the other reviews posted here from people who saw it at the toronto film festival you get the general idea of the story contrary to what you mightve heard this is not a 90 minute film on torture the torture scenes are brief and to the point roth doesnt wallow in pointless gore and this is where i think it shows how hes improved as a filmmaker hes more interested in scenes and ideas that move the story forward yes there is plenty of gore but its relevant to the story and doesnt exist just for its own sakeone of the aspects of this film that made it so powerful was how roth created a sense of helpless and inevitability he provides the dark setup throws in a sympathetic character and begins twisting the screws and ratcheting up the suspense this isnt a movie where you turn off your brain to enjoy it on the contrary the more you think about it the more horrifying it becomes you begin putting yourself into the characters situation and wondering what youd do when you realize that there is no hope for the character no way to escape no buddy whos gonna turn up at the last minute to save the hero and not a shred of humanity or compassion to the antagonists real fear begins to set inanother great element in the script is how the survivor makes moral choices that define their character instead of being merely reactive like the characters in cabin fever the survivor makes several decisions which change the course of the story its a sign of well thoughtout script and a filmmaker who cares about the fate of his charactersfor horror fans this is an absolute mustsee its so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually makes you feel uncomfortable and one in which you have no idea whats going to happen next as for the gore i was surprised by what they got away with although there were no credits at the end of the film the cut i saw was rated r by the mpaa and according to roth he didnt cut anything out,cruel
its not scary its not funny its not stylish its not suspenseful exciting thrilling or chilling in any way its not intelligent enough to even be viewed as some warped social commentary its not ambitious enough to do anything other than present gratuitous ta and gore in the dullest manner imaginable hell its not even entertaining what it really is is an exercise in being completely and utterly pointless aside from presenting violent scenarios and nude women in third world countries with unlikely silicone enhanced bodies the plot involves a trio of students two americans and a foreigner vacationing in eastern europe who eventually stumble upon a paytoslay type business that specializes in making your sickest dreams come true ie customers paying a high price to get to slaughter a real live person and i am using the world eventually because it takes around an hour for this movie to get to the real horror content first we have to sit through an excruciating hour dedicated to the juvenile frat boy antics of characters who stay wasted on booze and drugs and pay hookers for sex a whole hour of this crapour heroes are stupid irritating immature onedimensional and thoroughly unlikable by the time their lives are in danger you could care less what happens to them i know i didnt i was actually rooting for the generic anonymous bad guys to tell you the truth to make matters worse this film has a tacked on ending that tries to let the sole survivor enact his vengeance these scenes are absolutely ludicrous and riddled with coincidence certain characters just happen to be at a certain place at the right time hey theres three of them now crossing the street right in front of me just as im trying to escape the town well what do you know how bout i run em all over theres another one who happens to be on the same train as me as im leaving the country well ill follow him into the bathroom etc etc etc the endthis movie is absolute garbage from start to finish its nothing new or interesting there is some gore but its pretty much whats expected and nothing too shocking for anyone who has already sat through films like texas chainsaw massacre or dawn of the dead director eli roth may be 35 years old but his brain functions at the level of someone 20 years his junior based on his juvenile screenplay and uninspired direction roth himself later claimed he made this film to show americans ignorance of the world around them and in the process only ended up showing his own ignorance when it comes to film making absolutely the pits,cruel
was one of those films described as torture porn and with my low tolerance for gore i decided to give it a miss at the cinemas and dismiss it if anyone brought it up however as it came on tv a month or so ago i decided that maybe i was being unfair by not giving it a try it did sit on my hdd for a month though as somehow i never was in the mood until i forced myself to watch it it does what you expect it to do and there should be no surprise that it is very gory throughout what surprised me was how gripped i was by it as i squirmed in my seat and had the emotional flight response while sitting there in that sense the film works because for all but the most hardened viewer it will have you feeling ill and get your heart beating however while it did achieve this it did it by simply going direct for being as sadistic and graphic as it possibly couldin a way there is a buildup to the main gory bits but this is less of a decision so much as a necessary evil of having any sort of story the first thirty minute or so are essentially the guys getting honeytrapped into this easterneuropean world of heartless torture and then from there we have gore for varying reasons and here the makers give us nudity to prevent the male target audience getting bored you never really care about the characters or the story because the tension is not about what is happening next as it is about the act you are watching it is a cynical horror movie in this way as it has a very simple atmosphere and a very simple target or gore while you are watching it the sheer cruel horror of it might stop you thinking but ultimately it is a soulless affair that reminds me of the viral 2 girls 1 cup video you see both are the type of thing you want to watch but also dont want to see both also are entirely about seeing horrible things from the remote safety of your home and of course both generally get a hands over eyes openmouth but yet unable to look away response from viewers this is all is going for and this is why i have real reservations recommending it because as a film it is pretty poorthose that love gore will love it though because in this area it excels the effects are horrifically realistic and are delivered in clear cruel shots the actors do a great job of convincing in their pain horror and fear and this is part of the gore voyeur aspect of the film as characters though they are poor and can do nothing with the script other than be young and geekysexybeefystoned delete as appropriate hoffmans portrayal of power is the only exception because while a bit whacked out he perfectly captures the sheer indifference to live that real evil has roths direction doesnt show much in the way of subtlety but he knows what his audience want and how to give it to them the lack of anything beyond this in his delivery or script can be easily seen in the way that the film doesnt even try to do something with the fact that we are getting entertainment from watching people torturekill others for their entertainment normally in this sort of thing there would at least be some reference to this conflict but here roth is part of his audience and sees nothing wrong at all with what he is doing  which is a problem for me not that he needs to be ashamed but just that a film should not just be a load of filmed gore with no heart or reason to careis a gory horror movie that is entirely about being repulsed and thrilled by the graphic and sadistic acts portrayed with excellent special effects those looking for this will be pleased with it but the majority will be turned off for some it will simply be too gory to watch and they will get no pleasure from witnessing hell on earth  i totally understand where they are coming from however the majority of viewers will not be those that struggle with gore but just object to the cynical way that it is put on the screen without any real attempt at using it as part of the film or story  no here the gore is the all and there is nothing else to watch it for this factor alone makes me stronger in my decision to ignore this genre for what it is because being good at what you do doesnt mean that it is right for you to do it in the first place,cruel
the plot in short three backpackers two americans and one icelander does europe by train with two major goals to get high and nail as many women as possible in amsterdam they accidentally learn of a in bratislava slovakia where sexmad women thirst for men in general and american men i particular they of course decide to go there and at first it seems the rumors were true but they soon learn that the is nothing more than a front for a bizarre club where people can pay a huge fee to get to perform unspeakable actsmy 2 cents the director and writer eli roths biggest accomplishment before is cabin fever 2002  weather or not that is something good is a matter of personal judgment that he got two evil deaders scott spiegel and fxgenius gregory nicotero interested in his script is not at all surprising but how he got quentin tarantino to executive produce and thereby act as posterboy for his flick is to me a total and utter mysteryhas potential im not going to take that away from it the thought that a place exists where rich people pay money to torture and kill other people is interesting and a story about a kidnapped person who finds himself locked in that very place waiting for his assassin should make for a great film the film is wonderfully lit specifically in the torture chamberscenes and the setdressing in those scenes are marvelous it really feels like roth found these places  and just shot them as the were but the lighting setdressing and potentiallyrich story unfortunately ends the positive things i have to say about it is frustrating to see a story that could have been so exciting and horrific get so utterly fumbled up the movie is an hour and a half long and takes a whopping 50 minutes to get to the place that is supposed to be the scene of terror and creepiness the nearly hourlong intro is spent observing the backpackers while they party get high and watch naked ladies in amsterdams red lightdistrict when the story finally starts to focus on whatever is wrong with the slovakian it points everything out to such an extensive degree that it feels like roth wants to put a stupidhat on every member in the audience i sat in vain and waited for him to take the lid off go tadaa and show me something intelligent that i had missed but it never happens and when the lid towards the end slowly slides off on its own accord it turns out that the ones you suspected were bad guys were in factbad guys the ones you suspected were deadwere dead and the entire movie ends the way you suspected it would all alongjay hernandez paxton and derek richardson josh doesnt do to shabby in the two leads but roth has stayed true to hollywood formula and chosen picturesque before personality and the bigger part has unfortunately been given to hernandez  instead of richardson who i thought were more likable and more interesting to watchspanish director koldo serra made el tren de la bruja in 2003 a shortfilm about a man who agrees to partake in an experiment and suddenly finds himself strapped to a chair in a dark room he hears metal objects being handled and someone pacing back and forth in the room when the light is turned on it dawns on him that he will probably be tortured to death serras shortfilm is fifteen minutes long it was filmed in two days and is scary as hell is both longer and has as it first seems more story to build on but it still wants to base the horror in exactly the same sort of scenes as serras short  and fails miserably is probably made specifically for an american teenaudience where drugs and naked women represent half of the movies pull blood and bodyparts make up the other half if you watch this and expect anything more sophisticated than some blood and naked breasts youll be disappointed,cruel
this movie is just plain awful the violence sex and language is gratuitous the characters are flat the story banal the acting stiff the music contrived and to top this all off its one of the most shallow movie ive ever seencreative writing professor jack harrel in his essay what violence in literature must teach us defines violence as gratuitous when it is free unearned or unjustifiedaccording to harrell for violence to be warranted in a piece whether or not its in the horror genre we must care for the characters the violence must occur for a reason and the violence must come at some costmeets none of these guidelines first of all the main characters are unworthy of any of our sympathy backpacking through europe the three all male main characters main interest throughout the film is getting laid and smoking pot thats their entire motivation isnt the feeling of horror generated from the viewer worrying about a character getting hurt or killed how is this suspenseful feeling supposed to happen when the characters are constantly saying crude things like youre so gay and puy and taking pictures on their phone of their sexual exploits in a bar bathroom stall and screaming when a male character puts his hand on their leg the only thing this does for me is offend why does the violence occur apparently for a fee one can have the thrill of killing someone in whatever means they wish unfortunately this has absolutely nothing to do with the story i use this term very loosely here all of a sudden the main characters start disappearing from the story and start entering some kind of green lit killing room where they get tortured to death by some demonic person who has a short cameo earlier in the film this is not a reason when we find out later how this killing is sort of like an attraction for rich adrenalin junkies the only thing one can possibly feel is apathy apathy for the story all this just for thatwhat cost does the violence come at in none the people who get killed are worthless to us and the people who are doing the killing are worthless to us we care not when some of the people who are doing the killing get killed because we are not sure if they are the ones in charge there is absolutely no moral bone to chew on here lastly id like to talk about one thing in particular that really upset me about this film towards the end of a woman kills herself after looking at the reflection of her newly disfigured face this is probably the most gratuitous and shallow point of the movie its also supposed to be its most dramatic point first of all this character is only known to us as an asain women whos friend also goes missing and doesnt want to party thats it when the main character rescues her from the hands of the killer due to her screaming which reminds him of when he let a little boy drown a few years ago we are surprised to find her in the green killing room her eyeball is dangling out of her socket at this point our hero decides to finish the job and cut the tenticles that keep it attached as to the importance of this i can not figure but when she takes a look at her reflection and then throws herself in front of a train in very dramatic fashion i become upset think of how many people in the world are disfigured apparently life is not worth living unless your beautiful that is the only message this movie could possibly havehow horrible,cruel
im not sure if this is a spoiler so i figured i should do that to be safefirst of all i didnt see this movie voluntarily that being said it was even stupider than i expected probably the worst thing i have ever seen or could even contemplate seeing the characters were lamei couldnt bring myself to feel any sympathy for them the story line suckedmostly because the story was see porn meet creepy people see more porn watch people get their limbs hacked off by psychopaths for fun escape revenge revenge revenge the gore was overthetop and completely sickening i alternated between wanting to throw up and just wanting to cry not because it was sad or you felt extremely sorry for these poor people who were being mutilated to the tune of 25000 but because i couldnt imagine any sane semirational human being enjoying this moviei want my 750 back and the hour and a half i spent with my hands over my ears waiting for it to be over,cruel
just watched for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it again though it meanders towards the end and doesnt deliver the catharsis that the degree of vengeance could i think this is intentional though as we arent supposed to identify with the characters in a good way but recognise that their ignorance and chauvinism could be our own the feeling achieved at the end is liberating in a different sense as in we are still free to heed the main message of the film and tuck that money back in our wallet before we spend it on an immoral enterprise such as sleeping with prostitutes who were forced into it despite the carefree dogma of the age barbara nedeljakova and prague both look great as well i liked the nod to the wickerman and the more sinister reference of the big ovens the other thing i got was the feeling of getting more than you bargain for when you delve into a countrys history and dig up some nasty stuff this is particularly true when travellingone final important point is that i think although many viewers will be able to identify to a degree with the blokes in this film they arent supposed to be entirely sympathetic characters,cruel
this movie really could have been so much more the idea would have been much better off with someone who actually wanted to make a decent movie instead of a porno gorefest the first half of the movie consists almost entirely of sex talk of sex drugs and talk of drugs instead of hey maybe develop the characters a little so the audience might care about them and make their plights a little more tense the filmmakers decided to have a lot of party scenes and annoying main characters acting like idiots until uh oh we didnt plan on being tortured oops the sad thing is there are hints of something more intelligent beneath the surface but the surface is piled so high with garbage that its lost for example while at a sex club wow original one of the characters mentions something along the lines of paying to do anything you want to a person of course he means sexually but we know the basic plot of the movie involves the same concept with death and torture instead of sex one of the characters is supposed to seem like a nice guy but still never really develops enough for us to care the main character has absolutely no depth other than a childhood story and his shallow interaction with his friend the last half or so of the movie actually starts to gain momentum and the first half not been an entire waste of film i could have walked away with more than a feeling that id just watched 15 minutes of an okay movie and an hour and fifteen minutes of porn and senseless gore sadly enough the idea of this movie was put into the wrong hands a little less than halfway through my friend turned to me and said maybe i picked up the wrong movie to which i replied yeah i think you got eurotrip by accident i am baffled as to why they decided to write the first half like they did i guess i was hoping for something deeper dont watch this expecting anything special be ready for lots of nudity and lots of incredibly disturbing gore mixed randomly the two not even seeming to fit like they would in a slasher flick,cruel
what was the author thinking or perhaps drinking does he know anything about europe eastern europe slovakia bratislava i think hes a total imbecile half a million people lives here its not some kind of medieval village where bloody killers live and crime is overwhelming or maybe americans still think that eastern europe is some kind of wild land the land of poverty devastation and murder and its dangerous to be even near those places well then they are fking idiots if they think so such films create a negative image of eastern europe of the slavs and i think its a shame that such movies exist,cruel
recently i picked up at my local movie store and decided to give it a try i finished watching it and had very mixed feelings first off this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised it is although very graphic and not for the squeamish i just expected more out of it the popup scares arent effective and the first half of the movie is all softcore porn so what makes this movie a decent horror movie the physiological scares that is what got to me the overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death having no escape for that was very effective and stomach curdling the sex and nudity was all not needed but for people looking for that kind of stuff its all here the acting was pretty good no bad performances is a kind of movie where youll either love it or hate it but overall an ok horror film not my favorite but not terrible,cruel
the premise of ira roths is the european vacation of two allamerican college boys whom we meet in amsterdam where they get high but not happy paxton jay hernandez is a law school grad with no qualms about paying for whatever the market offers which in amsterdam covers a lot he tries to cheer up his friend josh derek richardson an aspiring author by telling him that life experience is grist for the writers mill josh wants badly to hook up with exotic women but his sensibilities wont permit him to patronize the worlds oldest profession unlike his coarser compadre his frustration fuels the ugly american ethos of entitlement that he brings to the party and hamstrings his chick cruising movesenter alex who gives the americans and an icelandic traveling companion one of those tips that must be urban legend by now a full of loose ladies thats not on any map in a country squirming with lonely beautiful women in love with the american accent our pleasure seekers dont care if alex is a pimp and they certainly dont suspect whom hes pimping out they leave for bratislava in a slovakia which according to alex is bereft of men because of the war just exactly which war is something our boys might well have asked before crossing a continent in search of hot babes as it is roth disembarks them at poricany a town in the middle of the czech republic near prague not bratislava where our college educated youth fall victim to their own blinkered view of the world seeking frivolity in coldblooded foreign streets they end up being exploited to an unimaginable extreme and on a level that is unbelievable even in todays real world of sex tourism pirates and child predatorsthe mentality that wrongful deeds committed in another land somehow dont count can flow from the mindset common among some americans that other countries do not deserve equal status with our own the what happens in bratislava stays in bratislava view of the world is at the heart of the horror here and to its credit the film shows this to be a weltanschauung shared by rogues from a number of nationstoday with our leaders supporting the spread of freedom and democracy throughout the world the hedonistic abuse represented by sex tourism is downright unamerican paxton doesnt care about anything except making memories to sustain him through the upcoming busy months of cramming for the bar exam perhaps the global perception that such selfish attitudes are especially emblematic of americans is why in the disturbed torturers pay more to vivisect bearers of our passport than any other group on the albeit limited menuwhen the boys finally enter the midway through the film a small tv in the lobby is showing an overdubbed version of producer tarantinos pulp fiction the claustrophobic tension in that film added excruciating horror to the anticipated violence in much of the violence is so non sequitur that you never quite believe in these silly butchers or their patient cadre of chauffeurs the upshot is much less horror more disgust and one can only hope no arousalwhen a victim does cry out why he might be speaking for the audience why make this movie and when the payasyoutorture psychos pause to bare their souls to bound and bleeding victims these scenes visit real torture upon moviegoers in the painful forms of pathetic acting and pitiful dialoghere sadists have ceded their place to wealthy psychopaths especially germanspeaking men who pay to get their medieval freak on that is if one can get medieval by definition with a chainsaw or acetylene torch during an uninspired escape attempt sequence paxton is cornered by an american businessman rick hoffman whose years of global sex tourism have left him unsatisfied and obviously insane he is now ready to graduate to torture and murder for his sexual gratificationperhaps there is an audience of americans willing to exchange their ignorance of europe for the misshapen image that risks becoming the pop culture residue of this movie a sybaris for bored backpackers where women resemble lingerie models preschoolers gang bang mercilessly and where the occasional exnazi still hobbles about his same unspeakable errands more circumspect in his depravity than fortyodd years agoto judge by there is certainly a surfeit of silicone in slovakia we are shown plenty of gratuitous female nudity but only between rounds of bloodletting tarantino carefully segregates titillation from torturedressed in the anonymous business suit and tie preferred by the weekend torturers paxton attempts to practice a bit of old testament law before returning to civilization secure in the knowledge that he can outherod herod throughout this film josh never quite appreciates the jokes while pax never finds the peace that comes from exorcising ones own demonshe just cuts his vacation short so to speakin the final credits thanks are given to among others chloe and major league baseball these entities deserve harsh censure if they

my english is not very good and im sorry for that but this movieis one of the stupidest i ever seen low budget movie with stupid simple and awful story about 3 guys going to bratislava capital of slovakia to have some fun with slovak horny girls and they get killed by unearthly brutal people of small country slovakia this movie shows slovakia like some kind of backward poor and dirty country if you know slovakia you know that this movie was filming in czech republicthere is a lot of signs with czech language on it also the language they speak is czech which is lovely country with beautiful history you can see kids robbing these guys on the street by daylightwhat is that this is not kosovo afganistan or iraq they are not in the war or something you should check some websites about this everybody who knows something about eastern europe and saw this movie know that this is degradation of this two countries and the producer eli roth is moron it is a shame that they earn money on this lame full of lies rude stupidity,cruel
well it wasnt so much a horror movie as it was a horrible moviei expect that this director will go on to make great snuff films and little else i guess if i was a 15yr old boy who enjoys endless mindless killing interspersed with plenty of tit shots i might enjoy this posno one else will enjoy this mess except maybe former nazisthese days all you need to get a movie deal is apparently the promise that youll employ the producers wannabe girlfriend and have at least 5 violent gory deaths plot storyline or talent not included or necessary apparentlythe only good thing about this movie is that i didnt have to pay for my ticket to see it p and ladies if your boyfriendhusband takes you to see this movie dump him hes clearly got something wrong with him,cruel
this movie was not only laughable but morally degrading and at some parts repulsive to watch the only reason that i went to see this movie is because i respect quentin tarantinos work in other movies and just because his name was on this one i caved some of the scenes were so stupid that i found myself laughing at the screen one scene containing bloody floor and a chainsaw to a leg was purely comical another scene where a oneeyed asian girl jumps in front of a train after viewing her deformed face had me crying the large amounts of nudity were also not needed and only added to the lack of morality in this film i would not see this movie ever again and i would encourage others to do the same,cruel
i like a riproaring horror movie as much as the next guy but this one just didnt do it for me it certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge but at the conclusion it just felt like eating cotton candy  no real nutritional value just a sense that i had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoffthe movie was slow in getting started and then the sprinted to a singularly boggling ending i walked out of the theater asking what was the point of all that and while this is described as horror it really should be classified as thriller there was no explanation or clever twist at the end just the end im sure that it will attract an enthusiastic audience of young adults but the evisceration by the critics will stem any hopes of huge box officeif your expectations are low enough and your tastes in gore sufficiently robust then you are in for a good time otherwise skip this and see a classic hitchcock film youll feel better about yourself,cruel
this movie is a clear step above most horror movies it helps raise the bar for all horror movies by simply having a nice mix of movie elements that work well togetherbasically the movie is about three american college guys who venture out of amsterdam and into a region of slovakia looking for more extreme female interaction once they arrive they begin to suspect that everything may not be as good as it seems when one by one they start disappearingalthough this seems like a typical horror plot the movie is welldone and believable the european scenery interesting characters decent dialog and fastmoving pace of the movie completely separate it from the typical waste of time horror moviesi also give the director high marks for not making this a gorefest and overfocusing on nothing but blood and guts the result is that he has created a real movie  and a good onethis is a pretty decent horror flick if youre in the mood for this kind of movie and dont want a mindless slasherfest this will do nicely,cruel
i am not a big gore fan but i love a tense horror movie in which the director creates vivid images in your mind this movie has both i was a little surprised how good the story was and how good the actors all of which were pretty much nonameswere there is a scene by one of the lead male actors which will stay in your head well after the movie i watched it at the tiff at the 1245pm show and i was at the edge of my seat the plot was welldeveloped although i thought that the director shouldnt have revealed the protagonist as early as he did in the movie and could have developed his reasons for doing what he did more fully the ending was very good but didnt hold up to the suspense and action immediately preceding it  the director said he had a few other endings but felt screened audiences didnt like the other alternatives in any event i actually found myself turning away twice in the movie i never do there is some major disturbing stuff in this movie and roth achieved his objective of making the scariest sickest movie i have seen what i did like was although the stuff was sick it was actually plausible  thats the scary part sort of like what friedkin did with the excorcist  the scary part was that it made you think this crap was possible highly recommend this for the gorehorror fans but i have a feeling that the studio distributor will demand cuts to the film if it does get cut significantly i am not sure if you will feel the same impact but i guess time will tell roth mentions it will gain wide theatrical release around november,cruel
i enjoyed the movie more than most commentators it appears and not just cause it was bloody and had lots of boobies the first 20 mins are just full of titties titties titties and yes there are plenty of homophobic remarks that make us or at least me not so supportive our alleged heroes but after the titties the real fun begins spoiler  the torture scenes are graphic but not as bad as i thought theyd be  they arent relentless and overdone but have just the right piquant tastes of grotesque and terror the scene with the kid pleading for his life in german was very effective  thought maybe i should pick up some german for situations like these as for the other commentators complaining that the characters were jerks  thats actually part of what makes this movie so good  usually its the nice earnest innocent heroheroine goes through hell but always makes it out alive  being rewarded by fate or god or whatever for being good but here the nicest fellow of the three bites it in a bad way leaving us to think weve got no one to root for left with the jackass were forced us shift our alligence to a less likable hero  that is unless youre rooting for the torturers nice twist really spoiler  what really did it for me and probably why i give this movie such a high rating are the revenge scenes in most movies our beleaguered heroheroine escapes we have the one last scare and the heroheroine kills the bad thing and then we all go home but we all kinda feel hollow like the bad things death just wasnt enough to make up for all the crap our heroheroine had to go through here in the last 10 mins outta nowhere change from horror into a revenge film and its quite satisfying like a big ole bacon cheeseburger everyone that brought our characters to their lowly states gets it and gets it good i wish i had a pack of wild orphaned gypsy children to do my bidding for bubble gum,cruel
i was one of those people that hated everything about cabin fever i wasnt anticipating eli roths next film but when i heard the internet buzz around and found it was showing at the 2005 tiff toronto international film festival i decided to check it outeli roth who was at the screening mentioned to the audience that this was the first public viewing in north america he also told us what we were about to see was a work in progress print of the film what i saw was one hell of a fierce horror flick that works on every levelall the actors do a great job in this flick i was especially impressed with jay hernandez and derek richardson two relatively unknown actors there are a lot of funny scenes and dialog in the early parts of the film its not that slapstick forced stuff that was so prevalent in cabin fever there also lots of nudity in the early parts in the film as well when things begin to turn towards horror you truly feel the sense of terror the characters are going through the build up to the climax is just done so well i loved the fact the story is very believablemake no mistake about it this is a violent sick and gory flick its not for the squeamish i havent seen this type of extreme violence in a north america mainstream cinema the takashi miike and asian cinema influences are clearly seen herethis is a film that will shock people and remain in there heads well after the film is over it will be interesting to see how the film is edited and rated in its current state i dont see how it could get anything less than the dreaded nc17 rating i just hope that its not butchered too much as the audience deserves to see the film how it was intended eli roth has completely redeemed himself for what i thought was a very poor film in cabin fever and has made one kickass horror film,cruel
if you watch a lot of movies you see mostly bad ones thats the realization i have come to at least if you give your brain a little bit of credit i would say you would be lucky to enjoy 6 out of 10 movies that come out i know that going into the experience by now a lot of movies are just bad and thats okay but some of them are bad and they insult my intelligence this is where i get angry and frustrated at hollywoodbefore this movie was made i can just picture a bunch of hollywood executives sitting around a long ovalshaped table saying hey everyone liked those saw movies so lets whip up something similar and as quickly as possible regardless of quality i mean seriously the lack of plot in this movie is uncanny the first 45 minutes or so is totally pointless and is more akin to the movie eurotrip than anything that would be considered scary theres about 1015 boob shots for every interesting part in this movie if that then when the movie gets to the subject matter that was advertised were subjected to a few gross you out just because parts when the only surviving main character predictably escapes he coincidentally bumps into everyone involved in the setup so we can all feel better now that the good guys have been somewhat redeemedits one thing for a movie to simply be bad everyone has their opinion but when a movie with no plot is injected with a few grossout scenes just to make it more like a successful movie of its kind it gets to the point of the viewer being insulted every event has to mean something to the plot but when you dont have a plot that creates a problem in this movie you have characters running around europe trying to get laid for half the movie and then the rest of it is a shameless imitation of saw but without any resemblance of a storyline do not go see this movie unless you are the type that sees a couple gory scenes and comes out of the movie saying that was so cool if you are god bless you but i like my movies to have a point,cruel
something has gone horribly wrong im not sure what eli roth and quentin tarentino were thinking when they put this crap together but its a laughable attempt at a shocking horror film it wasnt as violent as saw it wasnt as tense as the texas chainsaw massacre remake and its filled with more ridiculous horror clichs than i could list in 1000 words on imdb to have a preview that warns squeamish people with bad hearts to stay away from the theaters there were a lot of people in my theater laughing throughout the entire film that pretty much sums things up about this one a laughable attempt at being shocking just track down the original japanese film instead or watch audition or ichi the killer youll be better off the other worst movie that ive seen in a theater wes cravens they and im not sure which of the two is worse,cruel
as a rule i find horror films a little tiresome but starts with a great premise and slowly builds up to some outrageous horror the film tips its hat to some of the classics and theres even a delightful cameo of pulp fiction playing in the background its not good that the premise of the movie is revealed in the imdb listing as you dont learn the truth until near the end of the movie and it all starts to make a lot more sense one thing about horror films which has always bugged me is that the bad guys never seem real to me as if they are some kind of limitless satanic evil or whatever in by contrast we really believe that the scenario is very plausible and for that all the more frightening i wouldnt be surprised at all if this kind of thing goes on in certain parts of the world as far as maximum creep value i saw it in a packed house at a screening in beverly hills last night and many in the audience couldnt take it and ran out  one guy was retching in the bathroom and was too scared to leave the organizer had to talk him down and call one of his friends to take him home the director was there for a qa which will be on the creative screen writing magazine podcast and he said that at one test screening they had to call a ambulances for two different people it appears that the explicit sex torture and violence will not be toned down for the theatrical release and it will still have an r rating instead of nc17 which most of us thought it deserved the trick is that there is no sex during the violent scenes and no violence in the sex scenes which makes the mpaa more comfortable by the way this was shot near prague and is amazingly beautiful to look at  i was there a month ago and the place is like something out of a fairy tale unlike most historic european areas there isnt a mcdonalds every hundred feet the ending is very very satisfying yet believable and unforced the audience was screaming gasping cheering and hiding their faces at all the right moments elis interview was a hoot also so check out the podcast once they post it on itunes its worth it for no other reason than to hear his antiunion rant,cruel
after the mediocrity that was cabin fever i had little expectation for eli roths new horror flick however after watching the north american preview at the toronto film festival i was pleasantly surprised i went to the midnight showing and when the movie was finished ive got to say i was a little anxious going homethe movie dispenses with much of the clever selfcongratulatory repartee made so popular in horror films since scream and its imitators it opts instead for the old fashioned horror staples of nudity terror blood and tension it was original well filmed and well acted by a stable of eastern european unknowns since we didnt see the final cut i am anxious about how it will show in theaters i hope that keeps its edge if so it will emerge as a modernday horror classic,cruel
yes the movie is scary supposedly there is still one special effect left undone but new i am a movie buff in productionwriting who has screened horror since it began young males who are horny find beautiful females and then are punished in a horrible way this is as old as the oldest horror movie watch any simpsons episode where a character goes to a scary movie the director has said he made the movie to make us think about where society is going in terms of pornography bullshit he made it for the money the vast majority of characters killed in movies are male and in most of these the victim can somehow be blamed allowing us in the audience to say well i would never go that far so it couldnt happen to me the reality is young children are often the victims of forced prostitution torture and murder in the movie wealthy people pay to torture and kill what of those who see the movie and are not wealthy would any of us be comfortable watching small children be tortured and killed what if they reminded us of our own children or young siblings would that be a lot of fun yet we all know that evil people start out with vulnerable people and move up to young males if they ever do move up their favorite victims are children then young women then men because this is the easiest order to get control over movies like this only propagate the idea that those who suffer are guilty innocent people in the world suffer just as much as and often more than guilty people,cruel
is one of the reasons why horror is becoming a genre of shock value and losing its creative side eli roth creates a cheap show of nudity blood and bland clich humor he definitely purchased the book of typical story lines and merged them all together how many times have we seen the story of three 20somethingyearolds and the crazy things they do one should know better if they saw roths horrible slop of a filmcabin feverthe major problem with this film was the false advertisement the ads and previews showed this movie to be a promising horrorthriller with depth and originality they even flashed quentin tarantino four or five times to ensure the viewer that this was quality it wasnt it did not even come close the producers and distributors of the movie knew that with a good preview and a good name people would flock to the theaters this film is the reason why the box office continues to slump cheap and cheesy you are looking for steak and eli roth throws down a raw hamburgersure the movie has gore and sex but with what was given even those could not keep me remotely interested honestly it isnt very hard to find an waitressactress who will take her clothes off in a movie and a few prosthetic limbs the movie had potential but flaws in the writing take it places where white noise and house of wax went hey at least paris hilton did a better acting job,cruel
the american pals paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson meets with the islander oli eythor gudjonsson in paris and the three backpackers travel together to switzerland belgium and amsterdam having barcelona as final destination looking for sex drugs and booze while in amsterdam they meet alex lubomir bukovy who shows pictures of gorgeous women in gang bang and suggests the trio to visit the in bratislava slovakia a place crowded of hot promiscuous and sexy girls when they arrive they meet three delicious girls in the and they believe they have found the lost paradise of sex on earth but sooner they find that they have been sold to a sadistic group of the elite hunting and their dream becomes their worst nightmareis brutal and gore and obviously not recommended to sensitive audiences the scary and sadistic story may be unfair with people from the beautiful amsterdam and slovakia uses clichs and plays with the stereotypical of americans and europeans but it is good and original and disclosed in an adequate pace i saw in the past some movies about snuff pornography human hunting but this is the first time that i see a movie where foreigners are sold for sadistic persons showing another face of the dark side of mankind there are many posters in the rentals advising that this movie is sick disturbing gross etc and i do not understand how viewers can be surprised with what they see would they expect a 2005 remake of the wonderful the sound of music i have seen exactly what i expected a violent and bloody horror movie my vote is seventitle brazil o albergue the ,cruel
sick twisted disgusting and absolutely brilliant reads the review blurb on the back of the dvd while it may sound sensational particularly for horror flick with a budget under 5 million every word rings truebegins by introducing us to three pals paxton josh and oli jay hernandez derek richardson and eythor gudjonsson respectively on a backpacking journey through europe of sex drugs and partying horny as can be they take a newfound friends advice to check out a slovakian city that promises to fulfill all their desires for intimate nostrings attached relations but once they get settled in oli inexplicably disappears soon followed by josh that leaves paxton to unravel the brutal truth behind this mysteryis impossible to sufficiently describe to someone who hasnt seen it its not because its so good though it is pretty good but because its such a creative unusual film experience indeed nothing quite like this has ever been done before at least not this superbly the film is heavy on the blood and guts but the blood and guts are entertaining and actually contribute to the film in a thiswillgrossyouout sort of way is many things but its not guilty of gore for the sake of gorethe direction and acting represent another high point of the picture is oozing with fresh talent from most every orifice a fitting way to put it young director eli roth keeps things running at an efficient pace and gets the most out of what is a fairly basic storyline its fair to say he is unrelenting and seems intent in asking the audience how much they can take but this approach works amazingly well in the films favor as for the performers they are all nonames but they rank as one of the most talented noname horror casts in memory hernandez is worth singling out as he has the believability subtlety and charm needed to carry the filmunfortunately many have dismissed as another mindless gorefest thats really too bad because beneath the decapitated heads and leaking eye sockets lurks a truly original entertaining piece of work this one is destined for culthood,cruel
this is a film for horror fans if you dont really really like horror filmsgore included i mean really than dont see it the first half of the film before the characters arrive at their destination is all frat boyish american fantasy european road trip film which is later mirrored and satirized in the events of horror that actually take place though the film is full of extreme gore and violenceand a pretty cool ode to suicide club there was a lot more subtlety to the story than i expected though i cant imagine too many people really looking at it for anything other than the violence it was a lot better than i expected but not the scariest film ever that it is claimed to be im also sick of quentin tarintino sticking his name on everything its just a trick to confuse people who arent paying attention and as always giving him way more credit than he deservessee hero there are also subtle themes about globalization and exploitation here a critical view of the american and westerner in general who feel they can buy anything which also asks us as horror fans what price we are willing to pay to see our violent collective fantasies laid out,cruel
not to give too much away in case you havent seen the film i did feel a little sick at one point however there was a beginning a middle and an ending and there is a small chance that this could really happen to you based on actual happenings during the world wars where does anybody get their ideas from i thought that this was quite a good horror filmat one point i had to laugh my youngest son has been accepted by two universities to study medicine  he wants to become a surgeon and so i found this film quite entertaining quite frankly i wouldnt mind watching this film again at a later date,cruel
this is what horror is all aboutnot your music video hiphop editing glossy pg13 flavor of the week popcorn bs this is hardcoreif you want to see a horror movie that doesnt look away that stays in the room long after every other movie has squirmed to some other reassuring shot then you need to watch this movieeli roth shows that hes not a one off hes a true innovator the future of the genre and i hope he inspires many others in reviving horror from the kevin williamsonesquire lull which was good in the beginning back down to the depths of visceral ballstothewall hell ride it should be not a disney theme park rideyou know theres hope when tarantino is the exec producer watch this movie preneutered un cut if you can my real fear now is that the censors will cut this movie down to the opening half hour,cruel
directed by eli roth and produced and introduced by quentin tarantino is not easy too watch its a horror movie about a group of teens traveling to eastern europe whose trip for fun and sex turns in a trip of horror when they fall victims to a gang of who attract tourists into becoming victims of a sadistic tortureperpay theater the difference between other many movies of the genre is that the introduction that looks much like a americanteentriptoeurope film develops gradually in what seems to be a very realistic rendition of the postcommunist easter europe turned into a big circus of horror the setting is much more realistic and credible than in the classic american movies of the genre and the resulting violence and torture scenes exceed the usual limits the film is well made and well acted but while you admire the directors and actors skills you just with that they were spent into making some more entertaining easier to watch and meaningful movie,cruel
id thought id seen the worst after open water but wins that honor hands or stumps downi bought this turkey after browsing the blurbs and pics on the back of the case looked to me like an organ for saleblack market thrillerhorror possibility  perhaps due to the surgical garb in one photo not it will not become a part of my collection  everthere is no plot nothing believable no chance for a thriller nothing to hold you engulfed in the moment along with the characters law enforcement would shut down an operation no pun intended where kids from wealthy or not families just disappear wholesale in big bleeding batches no care is taken in the selection of the unfortunates anyone is fair game the only requirement is that you be mindlessly horny never question why the perfect 10 has to have you and extremely naive so much so that it goes beyond belief the rest is just hack and slash oh yeah and sawso it is just gore for the sake of gore pretty sick and in the end just sad i should add sorry to the list sorry that i got sucked in theres another addition to buying it based on the cover art hype and names attached to it needless to say i am more careful nownext week im going to take my minidv to the local butcher shop to see about filming a sequel cluck cluck moooodo yourself a favor and save your bucks for something better anything and shame on you folks for just going for the boring gore just for the like you dont have enough money id have given it a zero but one is the lowest 0 out of 10,cruel
eli roth has done the impossible he somehow made rampant nudity and bloody gore as boring and insipid as humanly possible the characters are all lame and no one could possibly care about them the supposed torture scenes arent even that torturous and the plot is incredibly dumb and insulting the ending makes no sense at all we never get any idea of the motivations behind the killers and the main killer is as scary as clay aiken and how can you run a business about torturing people hire seemingly dozens of henchmen and skanks to lure tourists and no one find out about it even with the one scene showing that the cops are somehow involved wasnt enough for me to believe that no one would mention at some point the fact that there were dozens of people being killed and tortured what kind of idiot would have a business like that and have this many people involved in it and the ending with the japanese girl was just a lame excuse to ripoff suicide club as it had no reason for existing other than that after seeing this eli roth guy make movies its clear its who you know in hollywood and not much elseawful just a total waste of time,cruel
yeah im sure you just read the summary of what ive just said and thought is he crazy i remember watching the trailers for this movie and was shocked in utter awe truth be told is really brutal but the time before the disturbingly scary torture sequences begin its funny along the same lines as american pie and once the humor dies off whichll be when you least expect it you better hold on for dear life because this movie gets wild eli roth is probably one of the most promising horror directors in the business right now because hes never too playful and never too serious about his movies and i have to say is one of his shining acheivements if youre a horror fan youd better check this film out if you havent already,cruel
after some friends told me that people were gasping and squirming through the torture scenes in this film i decided not to see this in the theater to avoid the distractions so i bought the unrated dvd and finally got a chance to see if it lived up to its hype no disappointments here people complain about the first half being too gratuitous and juvenile with nudity but when it picks up it is truly a terrifying experience i enjoyed the pacing there were times when i felt sick the acting was reasonably good and torture seemed genuinely realistic even though the plot was extremely farfetched anybody who sees this without clenching their fists or curling up their toes or not having their heart beat fast several times through it is not human it has to be the most violently sadistic mainstream film in the history of filmmaking i liken it to an awesome rollercoaster ride highly recommended indeed 810,cruel
eli roth enjoys his homophobia it was there in cabin fever too you can have a character bleating on about being a human who doesnt eat dead things but hes not afraid to throw out the odd faggot i swear its like the return of 80s machismo except no one really missed it and its a shame because its a distraction more than that it makes his characters pretty difficult to feel for i guess he makes up for it by implying josh one of the more likable of the 3 main protagonists could well be gay himself it adds a dimension to the homophobia that was lacking in cabin fever though roth really doesnt follow through beyond vague implicationthe film is effective in building tension and is for the most part engrossing but it really is nothing new and certainly not worthy of the hype yes its gory but the gore is for the most part cartoony in nature dismembered body parts aplenty but these dont guarantee fear or tension and perhaps for this reason i honestly didnt find it too disturbing besides lets face it weve seen it all before in sawbut if you want to spend a couple of hours enjoying a slightly americacentric bad eastern europeans will do anything for money unlike wholesome vegetarian american backpackers who just want to get laid and see the world take on the old theme of in danger and off the beaten track film its a worthy choice,cruel
i went to see this last night at a sold out show followed by another two sold out shows with lines of people waiting to see what they thought was going to be an amazing film as i was walking by them i was just thinking to myself poor people your going to be just as disappointed as mefirst off the movie was violent but not extremely violent like you have heard that is probably because so much of the intense stuff was cut out to avoid nc17 it starts slow but with plenty of sex and drugs just like any other horror movie once they get to the torture scenes which is why most people went to this movie you dont really see to much these scenes are short and disappointing i didnt even think something like oh no no dont do it like i did in everyones favorite scene of reservoir dogsspeaking of reservoir dogs what was qt thinking to put his name on this was a mistake hes gonna have to pull something off really good to redeem himself and despite most peoples thoughts he did not write or direct it its not a qt filmall in all it had sex drugs and violence yay well not really it was all jammed together and kept you in the back of your seat watch some japanese horror films if you want the punch was meant to pack,cruel
this movie is to good to be true its story is surprisingly originaland from the start brings weird atmosphere that changes from the first 20 mins to make it even scarierthe porn scenes at the beginning are not over the topi think it is very realistic everything put therefrom the language they uselike using the f word more then anythingto their hot rod attitude and obsession of having sex with a hot euro chick i meanthey are from americaok olis from icelandbut his point there was to lead them to hottiessince paxton and josh are from far awaythey came to have funand they got so excited when they heard about the gorgeous women in slovakia that they lost their heads over themsome of them really lost their heads the atmosphere is great as well as the slovakian pop music that brings the characters in a scary situation for me it kinda indicates they are far from home i give a full 10 to this moviecause it really deserves it the effects and gore are greatand the acting is unreal those guysespecially dereck richardson  josh is more natural than i expected and actor to be for this kind of movie it is to good thumbs up for eli roth,cruel
quentin tarantinoeli roth  his most creepy alfred hitchcock stand aside for this onei have yet to see a more evil  creepy movie nor am i a fan of such however it is frighteningly realistic  quite possiblethat a shadowy business baits young adventurous male college partiers into unspeakable peril as theyre setup by hot enticing european women the front drugged  wind up in a most hellish  unspeakable situation tumbling into a predictable chain of events that feed on the most evil cruel  inhumane desires of a bizarre club whereas grossly sick individuals pay great sums of money to have access  ability to cause horror pain terror torture  live surgical dissection to fellow human beings the plot opens slowly in amsterdam with the presence  allure of drugs parties  promises of hot sexual encounters although dragging on it leaves the audience in a comfortable  predictable place  thus lets the viewers guard down a train ride across europe ends in a czechoslovakian town as the first sense of fear bridles the unexpected the unspeakable of actions wields full reign with the most heinous of mans cruelty to man in a truly believable controlled situation protected by the auspices of business power money  a private paramilitary protected factory the unsuspected guest or audience falls into a malevolent  uncompromised fear  terror succumbing to an utterly powerless  hopeless abyss the realism  potential actuality of a hellhole of such in todays world is truly believable i found myself in the screen being in the party  riding the train enticed by these animated european actresses preying on the desires of these guys it is uncanny how drawing these individuals were most guys would have taken the gait which is the scary creepy part look guys are vulnerable in this world also as the plot developed i found myself perspiring as my respiratory rate became shallow  absent as i found myself gasping at times in inferring an alfred hitchcock stand aside for this one i respectfully only compare the level of anticipation anxiety tension fear terror  the viewers acquired  actual visceral somatic ism to hitchcock this is where it ends appreciatively hitchcock would never take a viewer to this level of disgust,cruel
what is it with horror movies these days that believe that simply throwing buckets of cheap gore on a body equals scary cringing doesnt necessarily mean fear if it is ridiculous enough to be unbelievable movies like saw have come close but still never really achieve true fear is the latest attempt at the gore flick and for what its worth it is the movie that saw wanted to bethe basic plot of takes quite a while to actually get into two friends paxton hernandez and josh richardson are backpacking across europe with icelandic hitchhiker oli gudjonsson in search of drugs and girls the first forty minutes or so is mainly one sex scene or nudity shot after another with some smoking pot in between they get a tip from a man in amsterdam about a basically a hotel in slovakia that has some of the best girls on the planet and the threesome head out to slovakia while they do find girls they become trapped in a sick nightmare to satisfy the bloodlust of a group called the elite hunters who torture and kill for funof course the torture scenes are meant to be the scariest however this isnt the case it is not the physical act of torture that is necessarily scary sure it is nice and gory but it really isnt anything we havent seen before what is truly scary is that the movie seems as if it could actually be real we all know there are true sickos out there who would pay for the ability to take a life in whatever way they deem fit it has a degree of reasonable disbelief that makes the scenario believable even if some events in the mandatory escape are a tad coincidentalto be perfectly honest the fact that people watch movies like this in the first place is proof that the urge to kill is present in all of us there is an inborn bloodlust that begs to be able to take life much the same as a sexual urge the sexual urge and bloodlust are even compared in the movie in a great scene where an escaping hostage idly chats with one of the butchers hoffman the movie strikes a nerve deep inside which is much more powerful than a couple of gore shots could ever benot that you have to look at the psychology behind the movie to enjoy it i dont even know if the psychology was intentional if you are the type of person who likes movies that rely on pure gore to unnerve you definitely has what you need the torture scenes are incredibly gory especially one part where an eye is cut out there is also the always painful tendon cut chainsaw accident and drill insertion doesnt necessarily break new ground in terms of gore but it does rank fairly highlywhere the most effective thrills come from is the escape sequence near the end the whole time where the survivor is trying to escape the factory is incredibly tense and bloody with the audience never really sure if the director is actually going to let this person live the ending does get bogged down a bit after the factory is behind the survivor as the movie then relies heavily on coincidence and revenge but it still remains tense which is a feeling unfortunately missing from most horror moviesthe acting in the movie isnt great but it is better than the average horror movie jay hernandez doesnt come across as anything special at first but he actually seems to pull a good performance out of his ass when it comes his turn to face the hunters richardson is decent enough as the most threedimensional of the group as is gudjonsson as the funloving oli vlasak is very creepy as one of the hunters who meets the group early on bit player rick hoffman has an excellent cameo as a hunter who basically reveals all about the organizationwhile does bog itself down with a much too long opening and a slightly unbelievable ending the meat of the movie is some of the best horror movie stuff in a while it taps a nerve that says a lot about the human bloodlust and is actually a comment on the film itself why do we see movies like we see them because we wish to satisfy our bloodlust and this is the closest we can get just the same way as someone may watch a porno when they are unable to actually have sex even if you dont appreciate the psychology there is plenty of gore and tension to make the movie a scary ride basically is what saw wanted to be it is a believable nightmare and that is something truly rare in todays horror films84,cruel

this film is about human commodification and darwinian economics the americans depicted want more than a painting or a statue from their trip to europe  they want stories of subjugating natives but their fraternal lust is outstripped by the international business community all first world players who want to experience murder firsthand sex is just foreplay for what turns into an erotically charged bloodbath this film functions at so many levels  first as an aggressive homosocial buddy picture then as a firstrate slasher and finally as a great indictment of unbridled capitalism i cant believe this film got tepid reviews from anyone at least have the courage to hate it outright strongly recommendeda number of comments seem to concern themselves with the notion that is in some way an attack on european values national socialism was about the banality of evil  everyday people doing what they thought was expected of them here we have both americans and europeans performing social stereotypes that have been culturally determined for centuries hunting and fuking and buying immunity if you cant handle that or find it ugly then maybe you dont want to watch horror movies the horror in this film is all human emanating from within  theres no supercosmos or grand inquisitor its about people who have forgotten that they are human hyperalienated and at least roth has the good grace to take this on in a loving and spirited manner i say again this film is way more subversive and technically beautiful than its being given credit for,cruel
only i would like to say to this film is that the terrible and untrue picture of our country is so disgusting for me directors and all stuff around the movie should really go to slowakia to see how it is here and not to use czechor german places names are they really think that we dont have colour tvhahaha or our railwaystation is not the one in movieit was an small station in a very small town in czech republicand to let the actors went to slowakia in cause of cheap chicks which are doing everything for money heeeeeey are you all dumb or what i cant imagine that people are thinking so about srwe dont have communism more in slowakia since 1989 crazy to see what all this us people are thinking about our country which have more history and culture as usa real i dont have words for it as movie its ok but as pisture of country its horrible and awful,cruel
i completely hated this movie the first half was all about naked females and having sex with them while the second part was just about human torture with an over abundance of blood and gore a horribly written and directed movie that i will probably never watch it again the plot wasnt that bad and if written better could have been a pretty good movie unfortunately they threw in 2 things that really get young males going naked women and blood i dont mind a bit of either in a movie if there is a point but there was absolutely no point to either in this monstrosity dont waste your money on this one not even the 1 to rent from the mcdonalds red box just wait till its on hbo,cruel
hi i am from slovakia sorry for my english first i want to say that in the film there is not anything from the slovakia it was filmed in czech bratislava is small but nice with many things to see ok there are some dirty corners but which town hasnt my opinion is this is very bad film but not because it considers slovakia as the forgotten place but i think it is bad movie at all the plot is about nothing i had feeling that first half of movie is only the beginning and nota bene i wasnt afraid a second i hope american tourists will not be afraid of the visit our country here isnt war or some cannibals or something here lives very generous people i like tarantinos film but i think this is the worst at least narnia was better so dont judge slovakia by this movie,cruel
there is absolutely no end in sight for the amount of ridicule this film can bring upon itself the fact that this film was actually given the green light to go into production says a lot about lions gate films and everybody involved in it apparently nobody saw cabin fever before they let deuchebag eli roth spend millions of dollars on this pathetic unremarkable trip into nothingness first of all the script was insanely bad i read the user review titled excellent puke and wanted to thrust my face into a toilet how stupid can you possibly be how much bad taste can one have there are truly no twists in this movie the only plot lines that can be related to each other really is the story that wonderful shouldbenominatedforbestactor jay hernandez recounts to his friend that later on more light will be shed on no more information since it may spoil the film for some risking their hours pay to go see it the acting is horrendous the script is terrible the story is nonexistent the direction is horrible enjoy,cruel
the movie poster read the scariest movie in the last decade nothing could be further from the truth yes there was a lot of gore but even it wasnt done well either at times it was almost laughable the first 45 minutes or so of sex  nudity was so drawn out it got boring it makes you wish the characters would just go ahead  get killed about the only good thing i can say is the acting was decent thank god i didnt have to pay to see it due to a free pass i actually saw a few people get up  walk out of the theater it was a waste of film its a good movie to rent at halloween but thats about it,cruel

im going to put it straight eli roth is one of my favorite horror directors today and so far love all his work after watching cabin fever i had high hopes for this movie and exceeded my expectationsthere are many aspects that make this film good but one is of the outstanding features are the characters all of them you cared about when they started killing them off i was upset and when finally at the end he killed the killer i satisfied me and made the movie more complete to conclude this is the best gore film of that year and has become a classic in my dvd collection horror fans should check it out,cruel
eli roth is a genius and is a twisted sick depraved masterpiecei was one of the few that had high expectations when i went to see cabin fever in theaters boy was i disappointed i still thought back then that eli roth was a promising guy even if his first film wasnt that accomplishedlets say that for that matter my expectations were kind of neutral when i went to see but i was anxious to see it anyway during the first 10 or 15 minutes i was thinking hey i guess roth sold himself after all more wrong couldnt i bewhat i found was one of the sickest darkest and above all most intense films ive seen in my life i found out that roth didnt want mtvish flashy editing cuts and after seeing this film a total number of 7 times 5 times at theaters and 2 times at my home theater and still going up i see that is true and works perfectly for the story roth wanted the film to have a classic and classy for that matter feeling to it and he succeed in every single aspect of it the editing is just invisible and discreet the photography is stunningly gorgeous and the music score is one of the finest and most memorable ive listened to in a long time there is no need for filling up the soundtrack with your onehitwonder of choicekudos to roth for making one of the best screenplays in recent years the dialogues feel so natural and real with every situation grounded in some logic his directing skills are brilliant too there is no a single frame or scene that is a waste every single shot every single frame is as beautiful as it can be and in a horror film that makes the whole thing more disturbingwhat i found more remarkable about this film it is the amount of intelligent ideas that float around like subtexts consciously or unconsciously one of the most clever ideas is why we like to see horror films because we like to see people being tortured chopped or beaten to death and that is true as the dutch businessman would say that is part of human nature we horror films fans pay for watching someone going through gruesome suffering and we dont pay once we do it twice thrice or more just to feel that adrenaline rush the american client talks ofsome spoilersit is amazing how we come to rationalize the deaths to suit our beliefs attitudes and fears we feel bad for josh kana oli and yuki but the audience was clapping and cheering when natalya svetlana and alex get rolled over by two cars when the chasers get beaten to death by the bubble gum gang and when pax finally gets his revenge at the dutch businessman in the gentlemen restroomend of some spoilersi guess it is just part of human nature revenge is in our genes see the trashy state of the world for that matter12 and 02 of my top ten of 2006 just behind love me if you darenote though im certain that roth and hernandez wont get any oscars nods even if they deserved them for their marvelous work behind best director and in front of camera best actor in a leading role there are other things that need to be taken for your consideration editing by george folsey jr the beautiful score composed by nathan barr and the gorgeous cinematography by milan chadime are such a fine work that deserved some nominations but they wont get them roths attitude towards american film unions that could be resume in a big screw you wont let them get the recognition they truly deserve810,cruel
i did not enjoy watching this movie at all but im not gonna say it wasnt excellent because it was as far as gore films go this went above and beyond not in the bloody aspect coz it feels like youve seen it all before but in the way this film gets under your skin and forces you to experience the victims fear to the point it becomes uncomfortable and the screams of the tortured men and womenthere will be no horror movie to come that doesnt take a listen to the sounds of like a nightmare the pleas for mercy quickly transform into hysterical shrieks of agony realistic sounds of pain and desperation that will upset or at the very least unsettle any person this movie is about human suffering and the director wants you to know it for what he and tarantino set out to do they did it extremely well they created a good splatter film a lot of people have mentioned the morals surrounding this movie who thinks up this stuff who would want to watch these horrible things but it seems the answer to that is most of the world i just hope everyone who goes to see this film enjoys where their morbid curiosity leads them d,cruel
ive never posted on a movie before ive never felt the need but i feel like this time something needs to be said this movie is absolutely awful boring and pointless storyline severe lack of the suspense and gore the commercials gave the illusion of i love cheesy movies army of darkness is my favorite ever but this movie isnt even good enough to be called cheesy its basically eurotrip plus some blood i know this is clich but people shouldnt go see this movie because if we keep giving hollywood money for not even trying and thinking filling a movie with boobs and occasional blood they wont have to try they can make money off crap like this everyones welcome to their opinion but seriously with this movie they didnt even try,cruel
ill skip to normal intro and jump right into this one its been awhile since i was this disappointed in a film eli roth had an opportunity to make a classic with but as far as im concerned he failed miserably before i get to where roth went wrong ill start with what he got right the scenes of torture at the factory are as grueling and intense as ive seen these scenes have an incredibly dark tone and feel to them many of these moments are difficult to watch i was squirming in my seat on more than one occasion these 30 or so minutes are top notch stuffunfortunately theres another hour of this movie that is so poorly written with so many moments that i can only describe as dumb that i did not enjoy as a whole lets start with the three main characters traveling around europe looking for sex theyre about as shallow a group as youll find theres nothing presented about any of the three that led me to care in the least whether they lived or died there was no emotional attachment it was like watching a sophomoric spring break movie set in europe and when our hero goes out of his way to describe the young girl he watched die it was so out of character as if he had any character that i just knew roth was beating me in the head to set me up for something yet to comeor take the whole getaway at the end of the movie are we supposed to believe that our hero just happens to pick the one car with the keys in the ignition and a bag of gum and candy on the floor sorry im not buying it and how convenient that the three people who were responsible for luring our hero and his friend into the factory should step out in front of his getaway car again roth might be selling but im not buying finally our hero trades the convenient bag of candy to the gang of pintsize street thugs in exchange for their help in stopping the bad guys oh boy its one of the dumbest moments ive seen in a movie in a long time a lot of people will look at a moment like this and see roths attempt to inject humor into im sorry but you cant have it both ways either your movie is a gruesome gutwrenching affair or its a teenybopper film on the same level as scream a change from something like the guinea pig series to national lampoon is startling forced and poorly handledyou dont have to look very hard to find other problems with s script for example how does our hero manage to kill several people and drag around a girl missing part of her face without getting a noticeable and suspicious amount of blood on the perfectly fitting suit he so conveniently found and wasnt it a great coincidence that our hero should happen to wind up on the same train with the main killer who so conveniently goes into a deserted bathroom there are other examples but you get the idea its insulting and as ive said repeatedly dumbfinally i say finally because i could ramble on forever ive got to agree with the critics of who are upset with roths portrayal of the slovakian people yes bad things can happen anywhere im not saying that slovakia is exempt from barbarous murder but roth would have us believe that most everyone in the town was complicit with what was going on apparently were supposed to believe that a few dollars is all it takes to get a whole town to accept murder as their primary source of income wasnt there one decent person in town to speak up about what appears to have been going on for what appears to have been a considerable period of time and dont you think the travel agents and guidebooks would steer travelers away from this town after the first couple of people went missing as dumb as this movie is i wonder how dumb roth thinks his audience is,cruel
i want my 650 and 2 hours of my life back thank you i expected much more from eli roth after cabin fever but he delivers this piece of crap that was supposedly one of the most graphic and disturbing movies i have had craps that are angrier than this movie there were only a couple of scenes that had any bad violence and i can name a few movies that are way worse dont waste your time or your money on this one folks go see cabin fever and enjoy eli roths talents there i dont know why tarantino would want his name on this one boggles me i know im not the only one who disliked the movie this much please share your opinion on the subject as i have never seen a movie in the theatres that left me angry at having sat through such a wonderful addition to the cinema library,cruel
why isnt the a banish the piece of cr to hell rating on the vote bar this movie is horrible and has no really interesting points in the movie unless your a stoner or snm fan that is most of the parts were cheaply and badly imitated from other movies and even the original parts still sucked now quentin youve never let me down before what happened why couldnt you just stand up actually read what wrote and killed eli roth and taken his directers role then maybe u could of put something in there thats worth the 6 ticket 3 popcorn and 250 drinknow i know what all you are saying this is all real as horror can getwell if by real horror you mean 1 uselesspointless nudity 2 immature nonserious main characters 3 uselesspointless drug use 4 extremely bad special effects and by special i mean special olympics special 5 and finally a crappy ending with gore that doesnt really belongso if you wanna see a b movie that thinks its an a movie go aheadnow if you wanna see a good movie heres a few1 king kong 2 narnia 3 broke back mountain,cruel
to think that taratino would associate his name to this amazingly horrible horror movie is incomprehensibleif you are the type of movie goer who enjoys naked women with no plot than this is the perfect movie for you it was not scary at all actually it was quite gruesome and disturbing and in a way could be reality you never know with those foreign countries this was basically comparable to the land of the dead and we all know what a flop that was from the previews it looked like a true horror movie and i was truly disappointed the plot is severely undeveloped and did not explain how this killing club of crazed maniacs startedit did not show the leader or give any information about this club all you saw was them killing people wow i give this movie two thumbs down,cruel
one of the best horror films ive ever seen the clever script is the backbone and eythor gudjonsson is a wonderful representative of iceland his presence and light spirited humor is a great asset to the film and makes a good and poetic contrast to the latter part now we all know what sneepur is im still feeling a little sick after seeing the film and am unable to go to sleep both because im afraid ill get one of those nightmares and the adrenalin level is too high there are many very good twists and turns in this film and it is never foreseeable many solutions in the script are brilliant to say the least eli roth is doing a perfect job i cant even remember when i saw a decent horror film this film is like a long awaited rain of blood in the desert to set the story in the murky eastern europe is a good move because who knows whats going on out there for all i know there might be such a thing going on right now i mean count dracula was alive and kicking once or still is in his native romania where there is smoke there must be a firei would recommend this film to anyone except my grandmother,cruel
you can say what you like about eli roth but you cant say he doesnt have vision roth has said on numerous occasions that he wants to bring the oldschool grindhouse style back to cinema and while is no masterpiece  its safe to say that roth has achieved his aim is one of the grisliest films to come out of america in years and what it lacks in originality is made up for with in your face gratuity im actually one of the few that rates cabin fever as both a good film and a promising debut and its safe to say that roths prowess has a director has grew in the three years since the release of his first film its also safe to say that hes targeted his audience well and is sure to appeal to fans of grisly gory horror that leaves nothing to the imagination the simple plot follows two americans and their icelandic friend on a backpacking trip through europe we first meet them in amsterdam where they are directed to a slovakian on the promise of beautiful and easy girls by a stoned dutch man everything is going well for the triountil they start getting killedroth shoots on location in europe and this brings a great style to the film we start off in sleazy amsterdam where drugs and naked girls are the order of the day from there we move onto a beautiful village in slovakia upon which roth creates a great sense of wonder the central location is an abandoned hospital and this setting provides the scene for all the ghastly action once the movie turns into a horror film is a film of two halves we start off with a scenario that reminded me a lot of an american werewolf in paris in that wideeyed american tourists are seen taking in the sights of europe theres no horror early on but theres lots of comedy and this allows roth to build his characters and show the audience a good time once it becomes a horror film the shocks come thick and fast and the second half of the film is very different from first but also very good the characters and acting are both surprisingly well done although theyre not exactly deep roths teens are easy to like and it actually is a shame once they enter the chamber of horrors the horror scenes are more along the lines of cringeworthy torture than any real scares but roth makes good of it as mystery is created early on and then the film breaks into a thrilling climax towards the end the ending itself is really good and provides the perfect finale to a grotesque monster of a film well worth ninety minutes of your time,cruel
let me first qualify that subject line  in order to understand the social commentary one needs to be capable and mature enough in their critical thinking skills to see outside of their horizons of expectation if one goes into this film expecting a friday the 13th jason freddy experience he or she will be disappointed if they are expecting a kafkaesquire cinematographic wonder they will be disappointed however this film stands above the ordinary movie droll for the following reasons1 it doesnt rely on clichs no fumbling for keys no long discussions with the villain no idiotic explorations of dark basements or rooms without lights no endlessly resurrected slashers2 it is believable crass americans in europe testosterone driven youths and the commodification of human life3 the torture scenes are not shot gratuitously other threads have noted that the film didnt show much and this is precisely why that makes this film great it leaves the terror up to the audiences imagination the director focuses his lens on the faces and the reactions of the victim we experience fear vicariously films of this genre usually spoon feed violence to viewers and are consequently forced to escalate and intensify the methods of death in order to evoke a reaction succeeds because it does not rely purely on blood guts and goretoo many threads on this message board post the opinions of this spoon fed generation watch this film ask yourself what the director doesnt show ask yourself how the director defies your expectations and ask yourself if this couldnt be real in our survivor american idol fear factor world,cruel
ive read nothing but how bad everybody thought this movie was but come on what was it that you really disliked about it the excessive blood and violence disturbing content the sex or was it the fact that tarantino had very little to do with it 90 of what ive read seems to be the last option just because quentin isnt directing it its a bad movie bulls the acting was brilliant any performing artist would have to agree jay hernandez put on a very real performance and stellar at that the rest of the cast was quite good as well especially since for almost all of them was their first real break in the business and olis very first moviethat a boy king of swingi think most of you are just being critical for the sake of being critical but seriously open your eyesso i can burn em with a blowtorch hahaha ps this is a brilliant example  how many movies do you see something like that anyways although the story pretty well revolves around a bunch of guys trying to get laid in europe you gotta respect eli roths ability to provide us viewers with a crazy little thing called shock value i look forward to the sequelit better not suck,cruel
this film shows the stupidity of hollywood and america as a whole it tries to project the american consumers thirst for blood onto europe by inventing a subculture of psychopathic capitalist murderers in a country with a greater tradition of peace and culture than the states could ever hope forwhy is the most violent and hateful nation in the world reducing europe to this in a movie could this film not have been set in the statesthe stupidity of the plot finds two american travellers in the wonderful city of amsterdam party central i got the impression this film was made in europe just as an excuse to show some breasts and so the cast and crew can get stoned for a month or twothen very tenuously the central characters leave the sexiest city on earth because a stranger tells them they might get laid in a in bratislava1 eh if you cant get jiggy in the dam then theres no hope for youthe second half of the film is even more dire and is just jerkfodder for sick little yank kids ooooooooooh blood dismembered heads etc tedium nothing original whatsoever in this movie i give it one point because it starts in amsterdam,cruel
stay away from this film its not art its not entertainment its not even a decent b movie or slasher flick its not scary suspenseful or even thrilling its just sick and full of purely gratuitous gore nudity torture and bongresincoated sex the actors are without merit not one of them is convincing in the slightest but then again who can really blame them the characters they are asked to portray are at best hollow and amount to little more than props to be ogled or skewered whenever the script calls for it i would say that the story is awful too but since there is no story or plot then all one can say of the story is that it is curiously absenttechnically however this film deserves some mention the blood and guts effects are some of the worst of any feature film ive seen ever truly abysmal but they are the films strongest featuredeserves every bit of an nc17 rating the mpaa really dropped the ball on this one this film which is basically a porn film for the first 20 minutes or so is pointless and devoid of any redeeming qualities it has nothing to say about anything except hey look at these people doing it and hey look at these idiots get stoned while having sex or hey watch this idiot follow some strange european girl whom hes only been sleeping with for a day into a dark abandoned warehouse then of course the film makers expect us to be surprised when all hell breaks loose on this dullard of a characterutterly worthless if i could give it a zero i would,cruel
considering the marketing of as one of the most shocking horror films my girlfriend and i were eager to watch the just out uncut dvd actually i watched most of it alone as she fell asleep within 45 minuteswe watch a lot of horror films yet this one fell well short of any frights dreamweavers or even suspense im being generous in giving it a 5 of 10and do not expect it to be a quentin tarantino film either he neither wrote nor directed it and i can only imagine how much more interesting it would be if he had there was no evidence of tarantino in it whatsoever now im not hating on eli roth i liked cabin fever with its mix of angst blood and black humor but he took a fine concept for a film and turned it into a shmozzle of a roadtrip movie without any laughs a softporn movie that wouldnt even excite a teenager a gore movie which just seemed wholly unrealistic and hokey and a thriller into a predictable outcome without any tensionyes there were some scenes that were disturbing perhaps to the squeamish but i wouldnt let my mother watch it anyway i found rob zombies devils rejects much more disturbing unexpected tense and storydriven than this yawn i mean yarni was expecting much more with tarantino prominently featured as executive producer i mean true romance reservoir dogs pulp fiction jackie brown dusk till dawn even these are all either noteworthy or excellent movies hes written but sadly he penned nothing here i would really be interested in what hed do with a horror screenplay himselfto summarize im glad i didnt pay to see it in the theater and also glad i work in a video store so that i could see it for free its barely worth a dvd rental very scant special features btw if only to inspire others to strive to do more and better in writing and directing than this tame mighthavebeen,cruel
as the summary states this movie is pure trash i cannot possibly fathom why tarantino would want to associate himself with this this movie is a cross between softcore porn and a horrible 70s horror movie its like eurotrip gone bad this has to be the worst movie ive seen since frailty i love cheesytribute slasherhorror films when done correctly but this movie was painful to watch it tauts itself as gory w torture throughout the film but that was mild at best most scenes were cut a fraction of a second before the acts were actually committed the gore itself when shown looked extremely fake in several cases and lets just say from a logical standpoint without giving away any spoilers some people shouldve gone into shock during certain points of the movie if you believe this movie is realistic and terribly gory then you need to go watch the audition fast forward to the end and i guarantee the strongest of stomachs will at least feel a little squeamish this movie was awful and the money is better spent on alcohol a cheap hooker or the homeless i highly recommend not seeing this movie it will make you want to kill people,cruel
what a load of rubbish you see posters and the trailer as the trailer is a blatant conmisdirection of the films plot for this film and you think wow that looks amazing this is what i did but then i saw the film and well it is full of sex for the first hour then there is supposed to be gore and it is supposed to be scary ha i have coughed up more scarier and goreier than this the so called torture scenes are yet to be seen a climax isnt even reached the film is based on torture but yet the so called torture scenes which are boring and pointless are simply skipped over as it didnt link in with the movies overall soft core porn theme if you have seen un chien andalou and you thought that the eye cutting was really good then this will make you simply laugh as even the girls acting was terrible finally with regards to eli roth if you loved cabin fever youll adore  on the other hand if not learn from your miserable cabin fever mistake and give this sorry excuse for a horror flick a miss also a personal message for quentin tarantino stick with your fantasy of wanting to be good at directing samuri movies,cruel
this film was just awfulsave yourselves save yourselves from it really has nothing going for it its not scary its not suspenseful its not shocking its not funny its not even gross the plot is predictable the characters are twodimensional quentin tarantinos name on a film usually means its somewhat good but i can honestly say that i will never trust him again the film has quite a bit of nudity for pretty much no reason im not the type of person to be offended by nudity but this was just pointlessi cannot stress this enough do not see this movie,cruel
reviewed by sam osbornrating 3 out of 4i cant attest to honestly enjoying in fact i often had to resist the reflexive temptation to leave the film is simply disgusting i worried that my fellow audience members would be drenched in a fresh steaming coat of my own vomit to be absolutely truthful someone asked writerdirector eli roth after the screening how he managed to convince the mpaa into an rrating roth laughed at this mentioning offhandedly that rob zombie was to thank after zombie returned an astonishing nine times to earn his rrating for the devils rejects roth believed the mpaa just didnt care enough to fight a new director he even wrote zombie a thankyou note the film surrounds three young men josh derek richardson paxton jay hernandez and oli eythor gudjonsson and their horrific backpacking trip through europe we meet them as they enter amsterdam eager to exploit the nations liberal laws concerning marijuana but when the night is through the trio arrive back at their past curfew only to find themselves locked out luckily amsterdam native alex lubomir bukovy comes to their rescue offering them a spot at his pad for the night alex informs the boys that slovakia is the untapped gem of europe for backpackers that beautiful women simply await strapping young americans like themselves to steal them away and of course our heroes buy the lie and the next day trek out towards slovakia once they arrive they find there are already reservations in olis name at a luxury and when they walk into their room the boys find natalya and svetlana barbara nedeljakova and jana kaderabkova casually nude sveltely inviting them to the spa by the end of the evening the group gets itself into bed together but wakes up the next morning to find oli missing no matter they think its just crazy oli but things get even stranger when josh wakes up in a dungeon only to be drilled through the kneecaps and sliced with a scalpel through his achilles tendons by a businessmanturnedsurgeon jan vlasak what you might ask is this dungeon well its a lucrative business that allows insatiable adrenalineaddicted citizens of the worlds upper tier to pay 550000 to chain an innocent human to a chair and torture them how heshe pleases roth read of such a business explaining the inspired by true events curtail on a website later explaining the idea to tarantino who encouraged him to put the twisted idea to paper whether or not the web site speaks truth is immaterial explains roth its just the fact that somebody thought of it anyway josh meets his destiny quite quickly in a nod to psychos elimination of the protagonist twist and puts the aggressive dodgy paxton front and center paxton starts digging deeper and deeper questioning the conniving girls as to joshs whereabouts and soon he finds himself in a similar situation chophouse films like these particularly those most prominent of the genre from the seventies have always been hindered by technology makeup just hasnt been good enough to make the gore convincing but clearly leaps this hurdle the film is fun and overthetop but holds enough solemnity to tug the audience straight into its torture scenes the film is so gory that when we watch as two fingers are vengefully dismembered with a scalpel in the final scene the gore seems tamely benign roth fondly recalls the most squeamish of scenes as the eyegasm scene all ill divulge is that the scene has to do with a blowtorch and only one half of a womans face im confident with my moviewatching habits to proudly brag at an adept tolerance and even affection of quality gore im not one to turn away from blood and flailing limbs but what roth does to us in could cause even a mortician to cringe in short its the goriest film ive ever seen many wonder what the quentin tarantino presents headline stapled to denotes first of all it doesnt mean is tarantinos creation as roth explains tarantino is a large advocate of the budding filmmaker he occasionally has movie nights in which a gaggle of blossoming directors are invited to tarantinos pad to check out some films there tarantino riles up the directors and gets them psyched for their upcoming projects after seeing roths first feature cabin fever tarantino invited roth to one such shindig and offered to help out with roth pumped out a first draft script tarantino helped with the edits and agreed to offer the quentin tarantino presents headline from there roth took the reigns during the shooting process and tarantino returned to help out with postproduction and mpaa rating strategies technically tarantino played producer of but in more ways than one he was the films mentor as aforementioned i cant admit to having enjoyed i certainly wouldnt watch it again but for those diehard fans of the chophouse slasher genre s the american masterpiece takashi miike films have certainly lived up to s gory watermark but is the first american film to my knowledge to grace such bloody explicitness roth even admits to have been deeply influenced by miikes work particularly audition and miike actually makes a cameo as one of the business clients but despite my physical aversion to roths film ill admit that its a grim refreshment among the lamely malignant tired duds that have passed for the horror genre so far this year,cruel
if you want to see girls gone wild buy the dvd if you want to see a good horror movie dont see this nudity doesnt bother me but thats all the movie focuses on for a good while in the beginning the movie is ok for the last 20 min or so but overall it sucked hard it wasnt scary and if you want a movie to make you sick because of the gore this one will let you down if you have a really weak stomach maybebig maybe one or two scenes will make you say eww 34 of the movie doesnt make any sense def dont want to see it w your parents or on a first date if you want a good suspensehorror movie see saw ii i expected to see a lot of gore and was let down if you want gore rent hallraiser hellseeker huge let down voted awful,cruel
after i saw this movie my sides hurt not from throwing up but from laughing so hard i didnt realize that eli roth was such a comedic genius i was skeptical of all the stories of paramedics having to be called to theaters but someone in our theater actually died laughing the only disgusting part of this movie was when my date laughed so hard that coke came out of his nose that burns if my sarcasm eludes anyone ill make it simple for you save your 10 and go watch some grass grow its much more intense i was extremely disgusted with one thing though the fact that qts name is being linked with this steaming pile of dung how sad,cruel
there is only a few sparse minutes of intense chase that make the thrill in this movie endurable otherwise it is left up to the perverse minds of hollywood to put the audience through as much pornography 2006 will allow a surprising amount and as much gory torture we can take after many csi episodes that is also quite a bit i dont get what is so great about strapping a hapless victim into a seat and slowly watching them get mutilated this passes as a story a plot a reason to watch a film its as though we appreciate this because it is perverse how many more low budget horrors do we have to endure until we come across another bona fide gem like the exorcist or carrie or even rosemarys baby spend time being creative using truth mixed with mythology to capture our imaginations and make us question the very essence of fear belief and terror and why we have that in our consciousness in the first place dont just put flesh on display as something to consume and destroy thats just plain cheap like the price tag for your film,cruel
well i was crazy about seeing this movie sure it is a gory movie when it actually starts to get gory but i cannot fathom why there is so much need to fill a movie with sex scenes ok sex happens but it really destroyed it for me the whole storyline took a long time and by then i was just sick on the stomach from having to put up with the hardcore why cant they make a movie these days without all the porn bits i thought wolf creek was more terrifying this is not something youd take a respectable girlfriend with any ounce of dignity to see i was very disappointed when the whole gist of the movie actually begins to get terrifying the blood bits are overdone and most of the time i was on the edge of my seat yes ready to get up and walk out sort of edge of the seat now im not a critic by any means but if you ask me for my opinion id say save your money and see something else better still rent out something with an actual storyline,cruel
kinda crappy weak script some of the gore was cool but i wouldnt shell out ten bucks for it as is the lions gate people tried to get people excited at toronto but it was a little disappointing ran into some of their people later who said the director threw a fit and had to be baby sat through the festival kinda funny for a horror guy to need a babysitter always amusing to hear the office gossip at these festivals i was hoping for a better film however actually i heard the director was kind of a handful on cabin fever too there was a really awful draft of the sequel to that one that lions gate refused to even consider it was so bad it was comical so they made the guy do this one not sure about this but i also heard someone at lgf wrote this one and they paid him big bucks to slap this guys name on it to keep him happy in any event i really love the genre and had high hopes for this one loved the premise but it just doesnt deliver,cruel
i was so disappointed with this movie the script was so cheesy the plot was so predictable i didnt get scared or grossed out a single time not to mention that this film was so unrealistic the gore looked so fake remember the terminator when arnold cut out his eye s gore was almost that bad and please explain how someone who has just been exposed to such a horrible side of humanity who has been tortured who has seen his friend butchered and who has had his fingers cut off with a chainsaw can instantly turn into james bond and simply put a glove on over his bloody fingers and escape not to mention the person he rescues she just had her face torched her eye pulled out of the socket and then cut off and she is just going to run around ridiculous the shock alone would probably have killed both of them this movie was terrible i was so disappointed boo to tarantino for putting his name on such a dud,cruel
i have just returned from watching the afternoon screening of at the tiff its great really great a bloody sick twisted violent bloody violent gory violent violent violent sick and what sexy damn right it is eli roth is such a cool guy and his work seems to border the absolute darkest and deepest depths of inhumanity i love it every second of the film which was not even fully complete since he really wanted to show it at the tiff so he brought a temp work in hdcam or tv or whatever the hell its called was very entertaining the film tells a story of a brutal fiendish perverse greedy and barbaric world id like to dig further into its rich atmosphere but i dont want to spoil anything the performances were excellent especially derek richardson im worried that the film may be cut horribly by the ratings board since i really want my friends to witness the truly outstanding filmmaking and storytelling in the depths of a truly evil world eli roth is one of those rare filmmakers who can mix both storytellingboth character and plot driven which in fact some filmmakers cant seem to do and directing any serious horror and thriller fan will appreciate this film i cant wait to see what eli and raw nerve come out with next,cruel
this movie really pisses me off for one thing almost all people in the movie in amsterdam speak german im from amsterdam and i can tell you we hardly have any germans over here in summer or whatever season they all go to the coastal area so its just plain stupid and i actually take it as an insult that the director didnt even have the courtesy to study our beautiful country with more interest before placing scenes here they werent even shot in amsterdam plus its not all potheads and prostitutes here only in the red light district and thats like 2 of the whole city let alone of holland in general in the eyes of this stupid typically american director europe is a dark seedy place made up of sex drugs and violence which is totally untrue realistic movie forget it im not saying that these things dont happen in europe but it for sure happens as much in the beautiful holy us of awhat an absolute waste of time money and anything involved in fimmaking it was almost as bad as hide and seek with robert deniro witch is by far the worst movie i have ever had the displeasure of laying my movieloving eyes on dont even bother watching it especially for european peoplethe gore in the movie is just soso you hardly see anything and what you get to see is so badly done you wish you hadent seen it the story line is totally nonexistent and the acting is very very poorand to quentin tarantino who willingly gave his good approval and name to this disaster on screen baby what have you been on lately,cruel
eli roth is either a satirist with an amazing poker face or 12 years old the man responsible for the execrable cabin fever is back now with another dead teenager movie while the thought of anyone enjoying any aspect of the stinky cabin fever made one weep for the species is a notch or two above that moist pile of rankness yet its still an ugly ugly moviefirst off what is it with roth and the gay epithets he populated his first film with smarmy rich kids who called each other gay with every other breath as if 1987 indeed a fine year had never ended now heres with its dopey frat types backpacking through europe dropping the casual gbomb like its gone out of style a memo to roth it has as in cabin fever roth has presented us with such loathsome characters that were almost glad to see them get what he has in store for them s young jerkoffs seem like the types to take such a clichd coming of age trip just to prove their masculinity to their brothers back home im beginning to form a picture of roth as a oncepersecuted bookworm made good who now can get back at all his childhood bullies and their gay taunts in multiplexes nationwide i really hope im onto something as the alternative implies that roth is simply as retarded as his charactersbut anyway theres a movie here our two young homophobes are finding themselves on a tour of the whorehouses of europe along with a giddy icelandic drifter who would likely be played by peter stormare in an older and much better film a guy in their in amsterdam quickly pegs them for the dumb fks they are and tells them about a joint in bratislava girls you wont believe will do anything love americans etc of course theyre on the next train and find themselves in the titular which is conveniently populated exclusively with young nubile women of the type normally found online the dke brothers are beside themselves doing everything short of shouting boobies outright and i cant even be sure that doesnt happen at some point drinks are laced and the greeks find themselves in one of those dank wet movie basements in which the only thing not covered in grime is the glistening row of saws drills scalpels and other instruments that are generally preceded with a stern call of nurse turns out one can still play the most dangerous game in slovakia except the rules have evolved so that the prey is now handcuffed to a chair i cant wish these gory punishments doled out by the unfeeling rich on anyone but roth really seems to dislike his characters and wants us to as well if thats the case he has a lot of bottled up anger to deal with if not hes simply a sadist either way is cloaked in a weighty unpleasantness that makes it hard to enjoy its few nice touchesroth occasionally flirts with statementmaking in in his paytotorture mens club taking ones aggression out on an internationallydespised american will cost considerably more than hacking up say a russian or european the idea of the socially numb elite dropping mad coin to slice people up just to feel something echoes well all of fight club roth has some pretty usable material here but is more interested in icky shock thrills than social commentary by the end our lucky survivor has gotten revenge on a character he couldnt possibly have known was involved and we wonder exactly what is the point of it can be summed up in two of the films favorite terms after gay jugs and ahhhgh,cruel
one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen it wasnt even scary nothing made me jump nothing made me gross out nothing bothered me it was advertised that this movie would be the end all to all gory movies it just sucked tarantino should feel like an idiot for tainting his name with this movie this movie was basically a porn for the first hour and misplaced badly thought up killing for the second hour the effects were good and they should have been done by one of the industry leaders in gore effects greg nictero but the acting the directing and the movie all together was just terrible dont waste your money,cruel
i watched this film with my roommate for a seattle newspaper review and was utterly disgusted and disappointed everything in the first 20 minutes or so was a dead giveaway to the rest of the movie personally i love horror films and dont usually mind seeing gore if it is a significant part to the plot unfortunately this is not true for poorly written plot no explanation entire film far too obvious audience is not left guessing with anything overly graphic i dont just mean bloody but literally the theatre had tons of people puking in the hallways  i saw it and asked and basically not scary i was far more grossed out than scared and i feel really bad for any slovakians who see this film very disappointing and a waste of timetalentmoney etc very misleading trailer and promotion,cruel
i got really excited about seeing this movie i enjoyed eli roths cabin fever and previously thought of him as a genius but after this movie ill never think that againthe first hour or so was more porno than horror movie the previews made me think that the whole movie would be gory scary and interesting i would have never bought tickets if i knew how the movie started how much was left unanswered and how bad the whole thing isi had assumed the movie would be gruesome and twisted such as saw but it ended up being a complete waste of time and money there were of course a few scenes that were pretty good and one or two that made me cringe but ive seen bettermuch better if you are planning on going to see this movie dont waste your money wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it,cruel
so i definitely wasted 700 on this movie it was a toss up between and fun with dick and jane well i picked the worst of the two this movie was absolutely dumb the first 45minutes was all nudity finally getting to the scary scenes and it was boring it almost reminded me of the saw movies because of the torcher like everyone else said the best parts were shown on the trailers and even with that there was nothing added to it in the movie what was shown was it everyone was laughing from the end of the nude scenes until it was over this movie wasnt even scaryand i am not good with scary movies but i was laughing the story line was horrible and the acting skills werent fantastic eitherif you really want to see it wait until it comes out on video dont waste your money or time while its still in theaters,cruel
not only was this film considered to be a softcore porn for the first hour but it lacked in originality and bonechilling suspense the previews led us all to believe it contained as i sat in my seat with disbelief and pure amazement that a movie could actually suck that much my friends all questioned is this the right movieim not your typical young woman who feels insecure watching a movie with female nudity i can handle mild nudity but went over the line if i really wanted to see boobs that often all i have to do is look at my own or become a lesbian this movie really shouldve only been about a bunch of horny male college students traveling to europe to hook up with a bunch of largebreasted sluts instead of desperately trying to make it about some sick torture chamber in a small european town the previews made this movie so appealing and scary i was not once scared the ending was more than predictable and very disappointing why not shock the audience and make us feel like we actually got our moneys worth on top of that every torturous part was obviously stolen from other horror films lame and much to my dismay the movie only contained about 30 minutes worth of gruesome torture what a waste,cruel
three horny male backpackers travel to slovakia and check into a that is awash with sexy european ladies what starts out as a dream comes true will quickly turn into a nightmarebrought to us by two of cinemas greatest self promoters in eli roth and quentin tarantino is wince inducing if ultimately a shallow gore wet dream for the early male teenager there is no doubting the impact of the horror on show with roth in spite of his hyperbole as the master of shock actually knowing how to push all the right genre buttons but after suffering what basically is a horny youth travelogue for what seems like forever the blood fest comes as a relief instead of a reward for nervous expectation within the story theres some meat as to how sick the world can be for example one of the titular torturers here has already shown himself to be the father of cutie young daughter and some moral posers and decisions concerning our main protagonist offer some intelligence in the script but it still feels empty too self aware of wanting to shock with schlockwas successful enough to spawn an even bloodier sequel much like that film is remembered for its gore than for any thing else of substance 510,cruel
alright let me get right down to it is not as bad as most people here want to make you believe it is i think  no i am certain that people who give this a one star rating simply went to see it expecting too much two points that i saw mentioned a lotthis is not the goriest movie ever period if its been marketed as such that might be morally dubious but hey  if youre old enough to legally watch this movie in any country and still take marketing talk as a fact you might want to consider switching your medications the gore is there it looks professional its neither overthetop nor squeamishly hidden yes the characters are not out of something shakespeare hemingway or king might have written they lack depth i give you that but the plot is clearly about three guys travelling europe to get the most sex drugs and rock n roll out of it as possible thats all they want thats all theyre ever shown to do thats the story for christs sake thats what you do when youre young if i had been there id probably acted even dumber they get stoned they get high on ecstasy  do you expect them to explain the big bang in between they did what kids do when they set out to party  they party yeah people having fun arent as likable as people suffering a childhood trauma and telling the audience every detail about it i didnt sit on the edge of my seat blinking away tears either but in the context of the story theyre believable enoughtalking about trauma yeah that little tidbit about our main characters past failings was cheaply incorporated no excuses for this otherwise though i think people tend to use the word unrealistic way too often its not like our main character suddenly finds a buried space ship in the end keys conveniently dangling from the dashboard and a manual nearbymy final verdict on this movie is as simple and humble as it gets a decent welldirected nicelywritten horror flick way better than most of the flicks cluttering the horror genre not a masterpiece either sorry eli the acting neither stands out as bad nor as terrificly good  with the exception of rick hoffmann as the american customer that was one creepy performance a lot of been there done that moments but no major plot holes either if you think this is a bad horror flick watch friday thirteenth  jason goes to hell and think again oh and if you really think that this is inferior to cabin fever i dunno just stay away from me please dont get me wrong its not like i didnt like that one but it has like a hundred more flaws than obviously still entertaining thoughan entertaining 610,cruel
i rented expectimg it to be very scary and gross it wasnt so much scary but it was very sick like i thought it would be its about two american guys and an iceland guy who check into a hotel hoping to stay their for a couple of nights however they soon find out that they wont be checking out the first half an hour of the movie or so is just them trying to have sex with several different women however that seems to be for a reason some whores sleep with them and take them to get torturedfrom the 30 minute mark on it is all suspenseful and fast paced you get to see feet get cut drill no body toes clipped fingers cut off and eyes get burned out so if you love torture youll really enjoy this movie,cruel
i was very apprehensive about seeing this movie after reading the reviews i finally gained the courage the movie was intense gory horrifying and done perfectly there seemed to be a preoccupation with porn for some reason it just didnt fit in the movie so it made it weird there are 3 scenes of torture in case you want to know from chainsaws to blow torches a few more murders in relation to the tortures i cannot give away the details but its not as bad as you expect it to be i would not see it again though the makeup effects were done perfectly whoever did it should be awarded the story line is sort of dumb but its watchable once not for children under 17,cruel
this movie is about three young lads who backpack around europe looking to have sex with beautiful and exotic women the idea is that they should get laid as much as possible in order to have experiences they can bring back home with them and perhaps even into their old age this makes them prime targets for a hellish turn of events especially given their nationality as americans the movie is trying to tell us that sex just doesnt cut it anymore for thrills women are basically the same everywhere you go and getting laid is overrated some people need something more to feel alive they need an adrenalin rush that can only be attained through an unspeakable act this movie is not for godbelievers or the faint of heart having watched several sexandviolencepacked films it didnt bother me very much but i would not recommend it to virgins,cruel
im giving this one a six why because i paid to watch a horror movie and crap  i got a horror movie emphasis on freakin horror see this one wasnt scary at all maybe thrilling by parts but not scary but god it was horrifying isnt what the word horror means i swear the mcrib sandwich i was eating almost came right back up as pulverized chunks glazed in stomach acid man was this one effectivepredictable or not i truly dont give a damn this movie made my guts feel horrible and my heart race by bits truly what one seeks when told he is supposed to watch a horror moviefrom hereon i will trust mr roth and his sick twisted mind i have not yet seen cabin fever but i trust it will fall right in the horror slot like i enjoy itsure it doesnt measure up to works of art such as the shining or exorcist but it does come awfully close to friday the thirteen and suchoh and if you dont like horror do not watch this insane flick and for the love of god if you accidentally did dont post a damn review bitching about the feature,cruel
at first i thought oh no not another teen comedy i know youve seen them how they all start out in amsterdam with cannabis etci was frightened the start of the movie was completely different from the last 13 of the moviei think the first 23 is not exceptionally good the plot was not very good and i for one could guess what was about to happened however when the movie got going there where yucky effectsi dont recommend you to eat while watching the last 13 of the filmthe movie is quite fun but its dumb entertainment however its one of those movies you can watch 2 times not only 1 timeenjoy it was well worth the 22 i paid for the movie,cruel
possible spoilers ok ok its no masterpiece that goes without saying the claims about the film being borderline pornographic in the beginningare true i even joked to myself thinking sarcastically im sure this will all have some relevance to the plot of the story well as it turned out it sorta did it helps if you view it as a satirical piece while watching it i was reminded of films like audition with a bit of humor thrown in the mix there are times when you want to laugh at certain scenes in this film there are even some people who assert that this is a comedy in a sense unfortunately the acting in this film is good perhaps too good whatever laughs are delivered in this film are quickly eviscerated by the sheer pain you can feel these victims take at least with normal people there is still an odd light feel to the movies tone however what really ended up getting to me was not the scenes that a number of people found shocking but the fact that this film was based off of true events it was quite blatant that the film was trying to make a statement particularly with the shots of the hoar house in the beginning and the museum in the second half and thats what i took the film for an unmerciful delve into human exploitation whether its sexploitation or torture perpetuated to fulfill a persons sick desires the film then ended up transforming into a feelgood revenge flick toward the end fortunately everyone loves a bit of vigilante justice this is certainly a love it or hate film is there room in your tolerance level for a pornographic torture flick,cruel
it would seem from the majority of the comments on this film that very few of the people making these comments have any real insight into film production or what some film makers are attempting to communicate to an audience with that in mind here are some things i discovered upon viewing this film 1 the story is new and unique thank goodness for any film that is not a sequel a remake or a film based on some decadesold television program 2 the director uses the xenophobia most americans have about europe and the citizens of those countries to very good effect he plays on those fears throws fuel onto that fire much like tobe hooper did with rural areas in the us in texas chainsaw massacre 3 i was impressed by the buildup of uneasiness leading up to the torture scenes the prevading sense of something off bubble if the characters had not been tenthdegree horndog party animals intent only on having a good time they might have been more suspicious of the strange events taking place around them which  in my mind  justifies the scenes of debauchery to show how oblivious these guys were 4 a great number of things often have to be done in a film to appease the studio i saw several scenes that appeared to be included seemingly at the behest of the studio for saleability and were not necessarily included for storytelling there is also a desire to oneup each other in the studio system which publicly decries sex and violence while unofficially tells producers to give us more and make it even more shocking than fill in the blank allinall while this film is not for the squeamish it does have some things to say that create discussion and dialogue about a number of things from how we view foreign cultures to how we treat each other any film that can generate that kind of thought while providing innovation deserves applause,cruel
okay  i really wanted to see this at the cinema but missed it so waited till it came onto sky box office my boyf and i had read up some of the critiques on the net and thought wed give it a go even though most of the writeups were negativeit is my belief that if you expect a lot from a film it can sometimes be a disappointment  so with that in mind we settled in on the sofathe first half hour is extremely annoying and plays into every clich in the book  the girls are all hot the americans are all loud and obnoxious the weird german man on the train wanting to take advantage of the usaers  its your average jocksgoingonholidaytohavesexandtakeloadsofdrugs movie  but i believe the writer and director were doing this intentionally a comment on what a section of the world is actually like and leading you into a misguided sense of securitywhat really makes this puppy fly is the relentless cruelty that comes out the gory scenes are actually very well done and whilst the sickest scene of all japanese eye is all i will say could have been better the payback is beautiful tongueincheek and downright nastythe main character who also gets his kit off is not that wooden an actor and does carry the film well its one of those films that if you keep an open mind and realise that yes there are better films out there that yes it is not the most incredible film youll see this year and that yes it falls into clichterritory from time to time its actually a thoroughly decent movieplus it is the only film in 17 years that gave me really bad dreams im talking about being skinned alive here veins being ripped out of my arms and any film that enters into my subconscience in that way gets more points because those are the kind of films you do remember for longerlike i said keep an open mind relax into the ride and give it a chance,cruel
i dont normally like horror movies that much but this one was goodit was quite grisly in parts and not for the faint of heart it had vivid imagery of blood and guts and people being seriously and mortally harmed the movie shows a blatant disregard for human life and human remainsthe beginning of the movie had some soft core sex scenes that may appeal to somethis bit is a spoiler days after watching it i still laugh about the scene where one of the customers cuts off joshs fingers with the chainsaw then slips in the blood cutting off his own leg it sounds sick and disturbing but just the way it happened was hilarious to me spoiler ends all in all a very good movie but not for the faint hearted,cruel
the horror genre spews out all sorts of films year in and out that arent horrendous at all they might be gruesome bloody sinister etcbut rarely do they inspire horror deserves the title i saw the movie a few hours ago and some images from the movie still play out in my mind i feel this is a good mark for a horror filmthe movie starts off on unsure footing it feels more like a bad national lampoons movie or something eventually the first backpacker goes missing and the movie begins to find its eerie groove the rest of the movie moves at a much better pace and the story unfolds with a few twistsim not going to spoil the ending but checked spoiler warning because im giving away a midpoint twist which i think deserves mention the movie leads the viewer to believe a certain character is the lead the good guy heart of gold doesnt want to mindlessly party guy is always the lead and it never makes sense as this character is typically weaker and must be forced to make decisions though outside forces the writer kills this guy off after leading us to think hes the one thatll make it out very good move in my opinion theres actually tension from this point on as you dont know who will and wont get killed offits not the end all of horror films but its a good one its brutal violent gory etc but not mindlessly so the film will leave a lasting impression,cruel
this movie is a brilliant horror movie the gore is just ott and its the kind of movie i like however i gave it a 9 rating because it takes a long time 2 get into it i dont even see the point of the whole sex part couldnt they end up in that country 4 another reason except sex and drugs but when that part is over the movie gets better and better and u kinda 4get how they ended up there looking 2 have sex with a girl the storyline is great and keeps surprising you a great horror movie not for the faint hearted if u dont like blood guts and gore this film is not 4 u its original and being based on true events makes it more scary if u watch the dvd extras you seem to understand the movie that bit more and in a way your glad that certain people get killed and others dont if u love these kind of movies get i hope my comment helped but didnt give 2 much awayx,cruel
at first i thought i was not going to like this movie maybe for the simple reason that i had not enjoyed the kill bill movies i watched it because somehow since pulp fiction i still feel a lot of respect for tarantino and feel that i should always give his movies a chance right from the start of the film i thought i was going to hate it as soon as i saw these three naive american young backpacking europe types however as the film progressed i realized how natural and realistic the idea was and how possible everything that happens could possibly be there were no clichs after all the nice guy dies first and the guy i disliked is the surviver there are a couple of really impressive scenes its so impressively sick i dont know if it was just me or if in the end what goes on is actually a twist there is revenge towards the end of the film towards the evil doers in the end and we find ourselves feeling the same pleasure they were getting in their most terrible deeds for the same reasons its a scary thought on my part and im not sure if tarantino was aware of it or not evil breeds more evil here like war does and the good dont win by repeating the same acts done to them two wrongs dont make a right bush must learn these things and a good portion of america,cruel
i just dont get itwhy are you people dissing this great piece of work by eli roth it wasnt the best horror flick but its bout entertaining fans of this genre in european beauties booty is well appreciated here the mix of sex and violence is blended just nice like a perfect shot of b52 sometimes it makes me wondered the existence of such hunting organizations at the endi enjoyed with glee the part where the main character gets his revenge reminds me a lot of the horror movies back in the 70s and 80s i wish eli would prolonged that moment even furtherovereall iam fully satisfied what eli roth had done with it will be a classic in years to come and eli roth will be remembered oli text message  i go home lol,cruel
ok let me start off by saying im from europe so this movie was not cut in any way i saw all the xrated sequences that many people in the united states for example may not see ok then on with my few lines of comment  as a horror movie this is really the best one ive ever seen i just want to recommend this to everyone with a very solid stomach you are gonna need it i consider myself as a hardcore macho guybut still on my 42 inch plasma this movie frightened me i even considered looking away for a few seconds i guess i would both recommend and warn people dont watch this is if youre just a tad fragile it aint worth it cause this movie will make an impression  at least in a dark room with big screen and quality speakersthanks sorry bout my english,cruel

is by no means an academy award winner but it is exactly what eli roth intended it to be  a good solid creepy movie a definite step up from the letdown known as cabin fever which was still pretty funny yes it is just another movie for young men all about sex and ultraviolence yes its pretty lowbudget and its definitely not for the faint of heart but if youre looking for a good grossout with plenty of unnecessary sex then this movie is perfect for youpaxton and josh are american friends traveling europe in search of a good preferably illegal time they partner up with a random icelandic man and hit clubs and brothels to have the trip of a lifetime but when they hear about the beautiful girls of slovakia they decide to change their itinerary and one by one people come up missing at their new and no one is quite who they appear to be with a pretty crazy plot twist eerie performances from some new actors and gutwrenching effects is sure to become a classic horror film,cruel
is half suspense thriller and half gorefest most people wont like the level of violence and blood and such but for those who are fond of splatterfests itll be like a renoir youd love to have in your collection of fine gross artthree youths backpacking through europe find themselves in a slovakian youth its all theyve ever wanted  even better than amsterdam the girls are gorgeous and most importantly willing especially concerning young americans even better the boys have to room with two local lovelies who like to walk around naked and party hardy with their new friendsbut strange things are afoot ole eythor gudjonsson goes missing the front desk says hes checked out and his pals paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson receive a phone message from him saying hes gone home and a japanese guest at the says her friends missing too whats up with that the first half of the movie is titillating with plenty of gothither scenes of fantastic debauchery wickedly enticing the average male viewer with promises of drinking toking and hardcore fornication i mean how dare they here i am trying to write a serious review of a nasty horror movie and they have to muck it up by showing me plenty of gratuitous nudity not that theres nothing for the rest of the audience okay theres not much the first half is aimed squarely at the heterosexual hedonist male but then we get to the second half and we get to see what happens when josh passes out in his room and wakes up in the torture chamberthis is the moment youd start covering your eyes shooing small children from the room warning people with heart conditions and so on of course they probably didnt watch the nakedness anyway and in fact arent even in the room choosing instead to lambaste you from the other side of a thick door i mean how dare you bring such filth into their home why dont you bring it into your own home you pervert for the most part the blood looks awfully real but the editing is so well  pardon the pun  executed that you hardly have time to see how authentic it all appears the point is it feels darn authentic everything from the actions of the psychopaths to the reactions of the victims feels pretty sincerescary creepy and disgusting is of the same  ahem  cut as saw a polished wellshot heh squishysick horror film,cruel
i thought this film was fantastic yes there probably was a bit of an overload of blood gore and naked women but thats what horror films are all about it was nice to see a decent horrorslasher movie that actually made you look away from the screen in horror and also had parts that made you laugh because they were so outrageously gory it reminded me a lot of old school horror films that are priceless like a film from mr raimi or mr romero but with a bigger budget and more up to date effects the acting is definitely credible enough especially during some of the more brutal scenes there is fear in their screams if you like the old school slasher movies youll love this,cruel
entertaining yes but scary no my wife and i were laughing pretty much through the whole thing this movie was more of a surreal drug induced hallucination mix in a couple of hookers hash and a case of low quality whiskey blend and a 2 cases of becks with a week long stay in an amsterdam hotel room and youve got putting miike in the movie was a nice touch you could spend all your money in there personally i think eli roth has a future writing comedy maybe he should be in charge of the next scary movie salvador dali would have been proud,cruel
indeed is a very disturbing movie not for its graphic content nor by its inherited nihilism these two elements by themselves do not necessarily vouch for a disturbing cinema going experience instead what does qualify as shocking is the complete lack of knowledge of the director as far as europe is concerned accordingly completely by passing important cultural aspects and reducing whole countries to vapid stereotypes everyone in amasterdam seems to speak fluent german slovakia is peopled with evil hearted creatures bent on exploiting foreigners and europe overall is the arena for sexual pervasion yet achieving a sad kind of balance we are introduced to a configuration of american clichs that walk about in the guise of characters the joint effect of the process of simplification becomes redundant and ultimately undermines the whole movie virtually ruining whatever impact it might have sought to achieve and that impact revolves around and is centered on violence and how it can dehumanize both those unto which it is committed and those who sustain the injuries so we are shown a parade of torture scenes that by themselves do manage to create a locus of hopelessness and despair and might even make fans of exploitation movies cringe and will certainly earn their praise yet these are the only scenes that have any interest and rammed between a slapstick beginning that is painfully bad in terms of both cinematography and content and a random escape sequence that dominates the movie almost right to the very ending when we are presented with a grand revenge overall the only redeeming aspects of are its adhesion to the exploitation mode and its somewhat watered down social comment that might be elicited from the similarity drawn between the brothel and the charnel house and i am afraid these are not enough to save a very flawed movie and give it the cult status i suppose it hopes to garnish for itselfhowever one thing ought to be said about at least it wasnt afraid to portray raw violence at its worst offering a more realistic approach to the phenomenon than we are likely to find in american movies these days,cruel
as a well thought out plot it was truly awful i have never seen so many naked women in one movie and no i dont watch porn but much more nudity wouldve made it a porn movie im sure its the kind of movie your typical stereotype of a prepubescent boy would enjoyif clich characters get your nerves you will have a really hard time sitting through the first hour of this movie we quickly realise who is what type of character and this personally was really annoying for me because it meant the script was very predictablethe film only gets really good and gives out the muchawaited horror and gore after a very long time probably about an hour into it once this starts the film becomes a lot better but not by muchto be honest this film actually made me gag in some places i like horror movies and they dont frighten me to the core as much anymore desensitisation i guess but anything that makes me jump scared tense or sick to my stomach has got to be a good movie movies are meant to provoke strong reactions if you hold this point of view also then sit through the slow beginning and watch the whole thingwhen the actual gore begins 150 gallons of blood used in this movie and it isnt surprising at all it is well worth it i cant be sure if all the scenes were actually showed in full because i covered my eyes for some of it but what i saw was totally not censored i mean you see every single cut drill saw whateveri thought that once the gory bit started it would just be meaningless gore and blood what i got was a few interesting not surprising just interesting so the boring tone is covered up by the gore plot turns plus the predictable ones when the other chinesejapaneseim sorry im not good with nationalities girl is taken into the museum which redeemed the film as a whole it wasnt just a stupid plot followed by gore it was a boring slow beginning redeemed by well thought out reasons as to why people were slaughtered so brutally and explicitlyit truly creeped me out i mean all this is somewhat realistic not farfetched at all like the way the thing in jeepers creepers wasnt a man it was a winged creature what a load of bull it made the movie so much more laughable people paying to kill humans for fun i think i may have read that the creators of this film found such a website and used it as the basis for this movie it really wouldnt surprise me if it were trueon the whole you should see it just for the gross shock factor for those who are truly blood thirsty and want to see a film that is absolutely makes you want to watch through your fingers and then be sick afterwards disgustingly gross on another level then this is for you you just have to sit through a very boring and uninspiring hour beforehandi dont think this film is revolutionary o mr tarantino your judgement has lapsed unless we are talking in terms of the explicit massacre of humans im not sure ive seen another movie that quite does it in this way bear in mind that im a fair beginner in the horror scene so more education from others will be much appreciated if you hate horror movies and blood then do not on any account watch this especially alone,cruel
i saw this movie today the day it opened around here and i really liked it what a wonderful kind of its genre horror it was bloody edgy intense fastpaced dramatic  with a nearperfect beginning and end embracing a wonderfully terrifying storyhow to compare this movie its very bloody in the spirit of slasher movies beginning with the semilegendary texas chainsaw massacre it has some of the intensely personalist flavor ugh of high tension in the tradition of american scary movies theres sexuality mixed in varying measure with the fear the sexuality is quite strong even for an rrated horror movie such can certainly be titillating in scary movies however i myself didnt find it so in this one  at least not after the first few scenes in the early part of the movie especially the general sense of somethings not quite right was so pervasive and so artfully mingled into the scenes that i doubt if anyone will get turned on by those scenes  but expect that somethings not quite right sense to coax you to the edge of your seat until the not quite right hits you and all of us in the audience in the facethe real value of the early scenes is exactly that they follow admirably a pattern that is very familiar to horror movies fans some likable folks 3 kids are invited to something that sounds too good to be true next of course the kids experience something of the good and then all hell breaks loose as they discover that it is indeed too good to be true part of the horror comes in contrasting the dreamed of good the taste of bliss with the actual nightmarish horror there are some amazing scenes full of that intense irony that you only find in a wellmade horror flick i wont spoil them by talking about them  except to say that these are the sorts of scenes that simply leave me wrinkling my brow and whispering oh no  oh sh   if you like me like this kind of scene then hey youll have plenty of opportunity to experience more than a few such in this moviethe entire movie is set near bratislava slovakia and there are some lovely views beautiful scenes mostly of what americans like me would think of as a quiet almost idyllic sometimes pastorally peaceful setting which produces all the more contrast to the horror of the filmthe pace was good the action was quick the dialog and script were both economical and very credible tight taut scary horrifying  if thats your scary movie taste hey check this movie out,cruel
i expected a horror but this im sorry but i cant say anything good about this film the way they describe slovakia is just for laugh of course the place of filming isnt bratislava or some other town in slovakia is it possible that nowadays is there someone who really dont know nothing about a geography and the countries on eartha lot of violence no horror scenes absurd plot euro trip americans going on vacations abroad of course they pick country where dollar is highly regarded currency and they buy anything  anyone for just one dollari try to catch something interesting in the movie but there is not such a thingi cant imagine someone likes this movie,cruel
what an awful boring gruesome movie no imagination and not even a plausible plot i have never walked out of a movie until now the scenery wasnt even good although it could have been how likely that they will take a train to slovakia from amsterdam just to visit a terrific thats a long trip the plot is completely unreal characters are boring and unbelievable this is the first movie i have walked out on it is too much to believe this plot even got off the cutting room floor the plot doesnt flow well and the cues to lead us to various characters are weak not enough information is given to the viewer to make the plot flow,cruel
i understand the appeal of horror movies but cant understand people who view them as quality film this isnt a movie about a story and a plot and characters with motivations this is spectacle there is nothing inherently wrong with spectacle but i sure wish it were viewed for what it is critics attack these movies because they think theyre movies so the reviews will be pretty shoddy i watched it against my will and found it to be just that while i enjoy spectacles from time to time a lot of great ones of crossed the screen i just cant sit back and enjoy a show where the only purpose is to show you how realistic we can make this gross stuff look and again i enjoy porn on occasion what the heck right but pretty much takes us through 40 minutes of soft core sex scenes for no real reason at all its filler its to make it look like theres more to the movie then dismemberment ugh im done now and yes i realize this comment is pretty useless for the mostpart but i wanted the opportunity to vent save your money and watch gross stuff on tv for free,cruel
i will make this short and sweet is the most disappointing movie i have ever seen and no that is not a hasty post viewing rant from someone who was simply just disappointed this movie honestly sucked and i will tell you why its one thing to go see a movie that you know isnt going to be that good and then see exactly what you expect but to go see a movie and expect it to suck as i did only to have it suck twice as much for twice as many reasons thats a whole new level of suck ya see i expected to be low on substance and meaning and high in gore turns out this movie couldnt even deliver the latter thats right with the exception of one scene was weak in the graphic nature department in fact was so weak if it werent for the pointless sex and nudity and the pervasive language it could have been rated pg13 and i mean that this movie was so typical and so not a departure from the norm in fact there was hardly any torture it ended up just being a get away from the evil bad guys movie typical of all other proclaimed horror films im so upset i cant even write anymore the last thing ill say is this 1 eli roth cant write a script to save his life check out the scene where the main character talks about a girl drowning that was a pathetic attempt to create emotion in the audience and 2 quentin terrentino should be ashamed to have his name on this project this movie is without a doubt an f,cruel
a collection of clichs and ethnic stereotypes one of the worst movies ever seen in my life i just arrived from the sitges film festival in spain and right now i am deeply disappointed with tarantino who produced this movie and was there as a special guest of the festival tarantino during his speech said people are weak and cant stand the blood and the violence but concerning to people are weak and cant stand such a bad movie the director abused of people tolerance with detailed murder scenes and i agree in a b movie that is probably the main idea but nothing makes me believe his script has any sort of reason to exist,cruel
gosh we are left today with only three horrors the extravagant slasher movie the wet japanese ghost haunting or the conspiratorial torture moviethis last seems to have very few degrees of freedom the setup of the conspiracy can be deep folded and reflexive like saw the tortures can be increasing gruesome horrible and explicit  well that essential and the manner of the filmmaking can be excellent meaning that the cinematic expression increases the rush and horrorthis last is what is advertised here to judge from the box office success it does actually push the state of the camera i didnt see it there was obvious attention to presenting one and a half torture scenes a lot of expert attention went into this and i even image that they were shot early as a means to attract funding the rest is merely adequate on all accountsthe formula demands that the victims ask for it by at least making bad choices and ideally participating in one end of the machine for pleasure or profit that machine turning around and biting here it is sex we are led to believe these guys are seeking deviant sex it is mentioned enough and why they travel to this dark place we never see any of course because the formal for some reason allows exposed breasts to represent all matters of sexteds evaluation  1 of 3 you can find something better to do with this part of your life,cruel
im reviewing the unrated version of now out on dvdfirst of all let me say that lions gate responsible for the films distribution has come a long way from the days when it was almost exclusively synonymous with bad bmovies it has become one of the major distributors of good horror movies that push the envelope such as the saw franchise and high tension and it could now be said that its a patron of the genredevelops an interesting premise and is better seen in ignorance of any plot summariesbackground information on the movie in the style of asian horror there is plenty of overthetop gore and in the style of campy american horror theres plenty of nudity but this doesnt detract from the ability of the director eli roth to take us to new and ever darker places as the plot thickens building suspense right up to the gratifying finaleunlike many horror movies nowadays it has an ending that provides some closure and does not leave you thinking that a sequel sometime in the near future is inevitable although imo this concept could be taken further and the movie ended too soon for me then again im somewhat jaded when it comes to horror fiction in general so maybe its just the right length to not overwhelm nontargeted audiencesbecause of the level of entertainment i have to give this movie a 10 within the genre it has everything the modern horror fan could want like good direction great makeup and special effects an atmosphere all its own and a main character that is believable because hes not making the clich inane mistakes that most horror leads are scripted to make with the inexplicable notion that this somehow adds to the scare factorif you are not easily grossed out or offended i recommend renting or better yet buying who knows you may want to revisit itps support the we want more rrated horror movies campaign go buy it or rent it now,cruel
i have just almost seen the since i come from slovakiathe movie felt completely unrealistic and i stopped watchingconsidering it more a satire than a horror movie i just want to point outthat whole environment was exaggerated and i feel sorry for those who have this picture of my country it felt more like watching a movie from somewhere beyond ural mountain range in russia some thousands of kilometers from slovakia the movie wasnt even shot in slovakia but some little town in czech republic our government sucks assbut we dont kill people so obviously  anywayim sorry to learn that such a good director as quentin tarantino made such a stupid movie with such superficial characters psnot all of our girls are whores and are not crazy about americans any more than about otherssee ya in bratislava,cruel
this movie was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen now keep in mind that i really enjoyed the directors previous effort cabin fever and i thought that his inspiration audition was a fantastic suspenseful film the first half of was essentially soft core porn with meaningless boob shots and sex scenes and again i am all for a little gratuitous nudity but this was way more than an rrated movie should have entailedfor instance at one point a character whips out a digital camera and not only has to show one picture of women engaged in various sex acts but goes on to scroll through i dunno 15 to 20 pictures did we really need to see all of these to get the idea and later in the film we see a security guard who is of course watching lesbian porn that the camera then focuses in on the gross shots just went ridiculously far things couldnt just pop out they had to be then cut off and then ooze and perhaps what was worse this movie just wasnt scary in the least i went in hoping to be scared and i wasnt at any point at all in this movie essentially it seemed that the director thought i want to make a movie that all straight high school boys will want to see but cant so if the directors intent was to make a juvenile nonscary pile of crap wellhe was successful at it if it was possible on this board i would have given it zero stars truly,cruel
i first became interested in when i saw a preview before saw ii on the first night seemed to be the type of movie that would beat out all other horrors with its disgusting tactics and clever screenplay however after actually seeing the movie my opinion was rendered worthless does not create any sympathy for the three main characters that get involved in the torture ring therefore the aspect of actually caring what happens to them is lost when walking out i realized that was in fact the worst movie ive ever seen the best part may the the gangsterlike children attempting to obtain bubblegum but other than that this movie falls far short of horror or the shock factor that was so prevalent in both saw movies i expected much more from qt and if i were him i would be ashamed to have my name listed at the beginning of this empty joke of a movie,cruel
from all of the positive reviews i was expecting a very dark relentless gory film on par with the best of asian extreme cinema instead what i saw was a dumbeddown american horror movie trying way too hard to be gory and disturbing but never actually coming anywhere close the first 45 minutes played like a crappy showtime softcore porno then the allegedly disturbing horror aspect began there was maybe one scene that pushed the envelope of american gore still tame by asian standards the rest was a hohum crap american slasher there was absolutely no build up or sustaining of atmosphere the plot was paper thin and totally anticlimaticthe premise of this film had so much more potential in skilled hands this could have been an absolutely disturbing mindf instead it was a completely ineffective exercise of mainstream hollywood clichi dont know what cut some reviewers saw at the toronto film festival many had put this on par with the likes of miike and other intelligent filmmakers perhaps the original cut lived up to what one would expect from a tarrantino produced film with this kind of hype the cut currently available comes nowhere near save your money if you are looking for a truly disturbing and thoughtprovoking film,cruel
its true this both applies to the movie and the story in the case of the movie well its no where near as nasty as the previews would lead you to believe although it is still pretty violentcrueldisgusting its not the amazing piece of horror film making that the fans would lead you to believe either its still good but its not the second coming of horrorin the case of the story it has to do with the in slavakia sp these three guys think they have found heaven when in reality its hell i wont get into the plot to much because if you dont know it already then stop reading the surprise of what happens will be great if you do then why should i have to tell it to you all over againbasically this movie can be broken into two halves the first is the teen comedy half which is the first half i am not joking when i say that during this section of the movie there is nonstop nudity barely a minute goes by before another pair of breasts pop up on the screen this is also where the characters are established you have the icelander who just seems to always be getting laid you have the sensitive guy who may possibly be questioning his sexuality more on this later and you have the jerk who is the main character pretty thin characters but they work you never really care about them in the first half thoughthe second half is where things get good this is the balls to the wall horror half the violence in this section is surprisingly restrained when it comes to the actual torture of certain characters more is implied than is actually shown and it works it makes you feel bad for these characters even if you hated them before the stuff that isnt shown is what makes this effective you can hear everything you can see glimpses of what is happening but its never hardcore in your face the real gore comes when spoiler warning the bad guys and girls get whats coming to them that is probably what i loved the most the audience isnt left just feeling terrible we are given some form of justice its during these scenes that eli roths dark humor emerges and it works i was rooting for the hero and you get to see how these people are dispatched in full detail its not as gut wrenching because these characters deserve what they get but its just as fulfillingnow the reason i mentioned the one character who might be questioning his sexuality is because of a review i read the review went off on how homophobic the film is the film itself isnt homophobic but the characters are the word fag is thrown around constantly and there are several jokes made at the above mentioned characters expense still as a gay man i wasnt really offended why because i know how guys like this act and guess what they act exactly like that the sensitive guy is shown being extremely homophobic in one scene and then in another hes returning the same flirtatious gesture with the man he had been yelling at before its interesting the way this is handled its not done to be cruel or degrading to the character its just done to give the character some dimension the review also mentioned that most of the killers are portrayed has homosexual that isnt true the sexual aspect of the killers has nothing to do with the gender of the victim but instead the violence of the act male or female what turns these men on is the violent nature of the crime so yes while the film does frequently use derogatory terms towards homosexuals i have to say its more because thats how these guys would realistically talk than anything elseso now that my little rant is over ill wrap this up is a good movie its violent its darkly funny and it has a pay off its not amazing but its good and it gives you exactly what you would expect i would recommend it but with a warning ive seen tons of violent horror movies and im a bit jaded the average movie goer would probably be very disturbed by the themes and portrayals of violence in this film so if you have a weak stomach cant stand nudity or flinch at extreme violence you should stay awayand one note to parents obviously this is not a movie for children the adds point this out perfectly its rated r for a reason still this doesnt seem to be getting through to many of you when i saw this movie a father brought three children all of which had to be around 10 or under to see it please use the rating system its there to help you protect your children from films that they are probably not ready to see yet this film contains extreme violence and some very dark sexual themes be smart and think twice before taking a child to this movie because in the end you are responsible for your children,cruel
why on earth would anyone want to see this film what could possibly come from watching it what could i or anyone else possibly gain from watching a film about flatout mindless torture and death is this how far weve come as a race ive no problem with the violence or the torture for that matter but how can those things by themselves make something worth watching id like to ask whoever created this filth what they wish to offer me if id sit and watch their film it cant be much this is not a work of artif anything this film just proves that weve degraded as a culture to the point that we no longer wish to think for ourselves but instead be spoonfed our entertainment many things that i dont like i can understand but not this whats the point of ,cruel
10 out of 10 half eurotrip style sex comedy with a seventies level of nudity and half the doctor scene from bloodsucking freaks yeah i might as well stop my review right there its a 10director eli roth cabin fever has scored a bulls eye simply by going back to what makes exploitation films great thus he produces a film that could have been lensed in the freewheeling year of 1975 rather than pg13 stuffy year of 2005the film starts with two american college students and an icelandic hanger on enjoying some debauchery in amsterdam they hear about a nirvana for sex and drugs in slovakia and they pursue it as if they were traversing the himalayas to find shangrilawhat they find is well i wont spoil it for you but they should have stuck with the marijuana brownies and overpriced dutch hookersthe movie actually makes torture scenes enjoyable again i generally have hated the whole torture motif in modern film for example rest stop roth unlike his contemporaries shows the gore without those annoying zooming camera tricks the leads are unlikable in a fun rather than irritating way not easy to do and the film has both a wonderful energy and plentiful surprisesoh and there is copious amounts of extremely well done gratuitous nudity and sadistic gore one of the best films of 2005,cruel
i would like to say that as eli roth has been annointed the new face of horror i believe he has a long way to go he has brought back exploitation movies but find myself feeling like i am watching more along the line of snuff films while watching them he may like this feeling but i would like to see what he could do with more psychological material these are the true forms of horror the movies that make you hind under your covers when you get home rather than make you sick to your stomach while you watch it wes craven looked into this with red eye going from chop and crop cinema to a thriller i think there is room for both forms i can appreciate the gratuity but it takes too long for the story to get going basically this is a fifteen minute porn fest with an hour of introduction,cruel
director eli roth returns to the horror scene with this horrifically shocking and daring film that makes roths earlier film the outrageous cabin fever 2003 look like a lightweight thriller two american students traveling across europe fall into the clutches of a sadistic madman and his colleagues who make a business out of violently torturing peoplecompletely merciless in its brutality and tension is roths most mature film thus far roths story is wellwritten with a great setup and a plot that builds suspense and spirals into madness and extreme violence to say its a film thats gripping and edgy is a real understatement the gore fx are as bloody as can be producing plenty of truly disturbing if not downright sickening images i couldnt imagine what would have been cut from this film to get an r rating this is what we horror fans have come to expect from eli roth though and he more than delivers the horrific goods in this film he pushes the envelope plenty roth also adds a strong sense of the erotic adding lots of nudity all the while roth does excellent direction with great locations atmosphere and welldone intensity kudos also go to the great soundtrack of european rock songsthe cast is perfectly good and often rather bold the best of them are jay hernandez and derek richardson as the illfated american youthsonce again eli roth has delivered excellent oldschool horror that pulls out all the stops and gives us horror fans the strong stuff that we need for the hardcore horror fans only 12 out of ,cruel
why why why what is it that makes the movie so bad no plot perhaps well unfortunately it does have a plot and actually a pretty realistic one yes i know your probably thinking what the f but sad but true example i have been to europe myself 4 times including amsterdam and when i came back and told some people where i went the most frequently asked questions were did you smoke pot and did you go to the red light district so to me that part about the guys just wanting to go over to europe to f girls and smoke pot seems pretty realistic to me yes i will agree the gore was a little much but besides that it was pretty solid with the exception of the main characters acting but olis was awesome this movie does not supersede saw in any way but for an entertaining movie its almost perfect,cruel
disgusting movie its not a horror because it doesnt make feel scared it makes me throw up i wonder what kind of audience should like it maybe some pervert sadists is anyone aware how dangerous stupid ideas are in that movie moreover it is supposed to be slovakia but it is all czech and it doesnt look like our country at all why directors had to create shots from bratislava in small czech cities how many tourists will come now to slovakia only in order to see what for a stupid freaky nation are we i think that director of this movie misses classes at famu or other movie school that actually has some credit,cruel
wow wow wow this movie truly kicked eurotrip in the nuts jesus let me say something i hate movies like eurotrip because im aware that they are cheap and stupid but theyre still making me laughback to somehow this movie comes to us like from dusk till dawn only this time tarantino is not so much involved in the beginning is nice and then boom a lot of blood and gore do not expect some typical tarantino script or cut scenes  one or two in the whole movie   this movie have other purposes like kicking in the nuts the teen movies this was a hit back this movie made me cry of happiness hell they should have call it eurotrip 2 just for fun although it does not deserve an 8 for the acting and the feeling and etc  this 810 from me  and i could have give it 10 very easy  is just becausenow lets see some connections with pulp fictionamsterdam well in pulp fiction travolta explains to jackson how free amsterdam and europe are all the legal stsand its funny cause it does not make any sense for that they have very much freedom in america too  they where gangsters remember  well im from europe i know what they where talking about but there are guys out there who got confused watch this movie this is what travolta was talking aboutand now the big connection europe is no such different from america we got our psychos they got theirs the only difference is the perspective this movie took the scene from pulp fiction  the one from the basement  to another level  it does not have to be one up just another level an european one  and another thing this movie is not an horror one it does not have the classical tension of an good horror movie  nowdays they call final destination an horror movie how low can we go  there where just so many movies about europe and how beautiful and romantic is that someone had to make a stand this is the one  its like killing 50 cent and raping shakira with no philosophical intend ,cruel

slovakia is member country of eu european union a member can you imagine how restrictive are conditions for membership in this club what the amount of hard work was done into transforming the communistruled country into a modern dynamic parliamentary democracy with stable political system with one of the worlds fastest growing gdp in the fast track within some 15 years would you think that eu membership will be ever possible for a junk country like the one depicted in this sortof movie slovakia is member of nato slovakia is the ally of usa in iraq it means our soldiers are fighting faced with the same conditions risking their lives as us soldiers do in iraq recently slovakia lifted whole iraq debt approaching us150m as one of a very few countries following us steps is the movie mr tarantino is presenting now to the world the revenge for our attitude to be part of the west because evidently tarantino and co is in war with us government while we are prous more than most of the eu countries maybe he is in a war with the whole western civilization based on christian concept of life in contrary to the concept of death so invoked in his movies and a country with deep christian roots is a good target for his aims apart of the cash he sucks from the audience which evidently cannot be aware what plot is a part of,cruel
i really wanted to like this movie and ill admit that parts of it excited me in a way that required me to shift the position of my popcorn but the film lacked the realism i was told to expect men dont scream like that when theyre subjected to pain approaching but not equivalent to organ failure their screams are much more piercing and nonhuman in nature and when a man is using a power drill to penetrate human flesh hes thinking about something very different in his mind thoughts that are physically expressed in a very noticeable manner if you know what i meanmy wife tells me that its art and that its aimed a broad audience rather than simply at experts i dont know about that it seems to me that even the layman can sense when something isnt authentic,cruel
i just watched this movie after sitting here alone in the dark for the past hour or so i can honestly say that i had to take my eyes of the screen a few times some of the scenes are directly painful to watch you will feel it hurt in every part of your bodybut this is not like a meaningless horror movie this movie has something else maybe its in the dialogs and the story or maybe in the acting and the setting i dont know really maybe its all of themthe actors do a great job the music score is really horror the story is a little weak but it keeps it going and the director is really a genius i just love the way he plays with camera angles and the cast in the movie really says it all what do a butcher look like  see the movie and you will agree that is what a butcher looks like this is also the truth in the other rolesi loved the film it is extremely horrifying but still very very entertaining they brought horror to a new level with this one and once again quentin tarrantino have involved himself in yet a genius flicki give it 7 out of 10 the story was a little weak,cruel
is pushing the limits what we are trying to achieve here is witnessing realistic torture scenes the whole point of making a horror movie do we want to believe this world is a very unsafe place to live in when we watched someones being tortured on the screen how should we feel are we on side with the killers when we were sitting there being entertained by the slaughtering process should a person be killed if one is bad is murdering in a comical way a more acceptable way of killing does the r rating only attracting more curios young minds to a dark movie is my dog pooping on the sidewalk a form of creativity do we call inappropriateness a proof of freedom of speech quentin tarantino is the greatest producer film maker in hollywood his strategy of cashing in through promoting a franchise of violent movies as hip entertainment is undeniable the best move benefiting the youth and societyi remember it was so funny after vincent shot marvin in the car vincent you probably went over a bump or somethingafter all its only an accident and life of a fictional character life is cheap capitalism rules  think about the dead bodies in the middle east quentin you are so brilliant,cruel
12 jana kaderabkova jennifer lim jay hernandez derek richardson eythor gudjonsson barbara nedeljakova directed by eli rothyet another poorly acted teenage gorehorror picture with a redundant storyline thought up and written by eli roth even the gore got old quick it was sick when showed but doesnt account for the whole 95 minute peep show with nothing but breasts and ass dwelling in for over a half hour and shockingly makeup effects artist greg nicotero proving to be an up and coming tom savini when his work is showed every ten minutes but when you get right down to it a few buckets of scarcely seen fake blood and clich lines with a predictable story line at best really doesnt make it worth wildthe story where three horny backpackers in search of girls and a good time soon get more than they bargain for yet another saw parody with less blood than anticipated all and all the movie goes nowhere drowning in a puddle of its own fake blood with the help of bad acting and oddly enough let down my quentin tarantino and shocked that he would think this was presentable my final rating 310,cruel
oh jeezzzz where to start oh its suppose to be a horror movie not softcore 1st hour and pg13 violence the other half acting is so bad that you end up laughing when the main character is getting tortured this is also assisted by how fake the torture scene is not to mention extremely short i have hard time believing that this movie caused some people to be rushed to hospital most limbs are not chopped off on scene you just see the actor going ahh ahh ahh like a friggin drunk everything is shallow story dialogues torture scenes also there is a scene where the main character paxton manages to put on a suit with tie without getting blood on anywhere when he lost 2 fingers future classic definitely not scary no worth watching hell no,cruel
i cant believe i watched the entire movie lets start with the characters they were wooden stiff almost emotionless even when trying to portray fright horror etc i guess the word that may best fit is shallow the storyline was weak but much more could have been done with it with stronger three dimensional characters and less clich the film could have been a whole lot more than just a below average slasher flick which is all i can really call this movie the main turnoff for me was that the characters were almost robotic i cant say this enough and that in itself ruined the entire film for me sure there were a few turns that may not be in an average slasher film and a tiny bit of suspense but certainly not worth paying to see in a theater or even a rental wait awhile and itll be on a upn station late at night some of the gore was decent but it was far overshadowed by the lack of a strong ensemble cast some similar films that this reminds me of in a roundabout way are the freddy moviesand maybe halloween although at least they had deep characterization and good casting again do not waste your hard earned money,cruel
so you wanna see some torture slicing and dicing and outright butchery look to actual and factual history and watch the film taken in 1945 by the british troops of what happened in auschwitz and dachau maybe then youll get your fill of what people are capable of doing to other people held captive it takes no skill at all to write something that merely shows someone doing a post mortem on still living victims art maybe if youre coming from the marquis de sade school of theatre only someone with a fairly warped psyche could conceive this trash but someone with yet more of a pathology would or could ever consider this as entertainment or art take a seat at your local hospitals er some weekend night if youre the type looking for gory thrills at least thats more honest,cruel
expected much better movie after i saw tarantinos name on it but its just boring and disgusting imho first half is long nothing about nothing seems like not even single scene was shot in slovakia so why do they take name of this country to their mouth mm but hey its made by americans so its all clear spend more and i mean much more time in library place to find that europe isnt country or australia isnt in canada or germany isnt in nevada as i was told by some us guys in one online game than in mcdonalds and btw we got no children gangs no sluts sell able for dollar and those cars there he he whats thatpeace out,cruel
i really dont see any reason for all of these complaints about plot and the subsequent expressions of disappointmentsurely you knew what you were going to see i mean its a drug movie a sex movie a thriller and a revenge movie i think that covers just about everything and how can anyone say that this movie is about nothing its about american excess and the general european disgust that responds to it the characters are even better developed than in most horror movies for the genre this is a fine effort delivering everything i hoped to see and plenty i couldnt have imagined pending the visceral murder and torture the creative motivationsi remain awestruck hours later see this if wolf creek disappointed you and youre ready for something extreme and shockingthe audience will respond en masse at the films every promptingif you enjoy horror you cant be disappointed,cruel
two american guys played by jay hernandez and derek richardson are traveling through europe their reason is to have sex with as many women as is possible they are directed to this remote european village full of beautiful womenbut their dream swiftly becomes a nightmaredirectorwriter eli roth gave us a lousy horror movie a few years ago called cabin fever i never wanted to see anything he did again but this has an interesting premise and i do like jay hernandez i should have known better like his first film we are given characters that we dont know anything at all about hernandez and richardson have nothing to work with and we really dont like seriouslywere supposed to give a damn about two horny american boys who only want to have nonstop sex richardson and hernandez are as good as they could bemeaning not very the script is terrible like i said the premise isnt bad but the dialogue is lousy and offensive i didnt like hernandez saying thats so gay after anything went wrong and the script doesnt make a lot of sense the direction is off toosome shots were framed so badly i couldnt believe it the gore is effective and extremebut i didnt know or care who it was being done to i also love how two characters have body parts chopped off but are walking around ok right afterthey should be dead of blood loss or in shockalso there is tons of pointless female nudity it got to a point where i was just getting angry i went to see a horror film not a soft core porno flick i also noticed richardson and hernandez were never shown nudeeven worse than cabin fever boring and pointless as i was leaving one woman behind me said that was the worst movie i ever saw i agree i give it a 1,cruel
or why watch itill keep it short and sweet as the actress said to the bishopthis is a thoroughly unpleasant film and anyone who gets real pleasure out of watching the torture scenes needs professional help or locking up in an asylumi dont see the point of the film or what its message is and it is frightening to think that this sort of thing is going on in the world as it probably ishaving said all that i think the film is quite reasonably well made well directed and the actors play their parts well including the baddies and it is certainly a cut if youll excuse the pun above the average mindless slasher movie,cruel
is the perfect film for fans of the horror scene in a time where a seemingly endless lineup of shoddy horror films continue to dilute the genre as a wholewhat starts off as appearing to be another generic fish out of water and road trip story premise proves itself by offering something morea feasible and intriguing plot even if it takes the entire length of the film to reach itin the former half of the film there is a questionable level of nudity even with an r rating whereas the latter half provides the same elevated level of subjective material but in a more tasteful and grotesquely satisfying mannerthe characters while providing a sufficient yet inconsistent level of solid acting lack the development that would have made the film truly stellar only one of the three protagonists is easily identifiable for the viewer yet i still question eli roths choice to turn a potentially memorable character into another bland horror film compilation of shallow human emotions what is noteworthy regarding the characters however is the apparent level of moral development which allots the viewer ample forgiveness for the initial shallow character introductionwhere this film does excel is its ability to convey emotions that are the product of wellplanned and wellpaced story progression rather than succumbing to sudden plot twists to proved a story that ultimately leaves the viewer with little to no afterthought intrinsic details carefully placed into every scene progress the film at an even pace as a result the onscreen characters emotions are implanted into the viewers minds which makes for an unprecedented feeling of insecurity and helplessness in the horror genrethe most surprising aspect of the film is the lack of any final plot twist which has become commonplace in the horror genre this surprise is strongly welcomed and really concludes the formerly lacking story well my only gripe regarding the story is that there really isnt one until just before the credits rollwhile there are aspects of this film that could use some fine tuning the lasting result is a muchneeded level of satisfaction for horror fans those with weak stomachs are advised to stay clear of this movie but even casual fans of the genre should check it out,cruel
2005 is a breathe of fresh air for the horror film genre all we tend to get nowadays is remake after remake or just general cgrade rubbish with zgrade actors so this film surprised and entertained me thats for sure 80 of horror films that come out these days just dont entertain or thrill me and i lose interest with them before even making it to the end but this was a great film from an upcoming horror director in eli roththe story is about 3 young men 2 americans and 1 european who are on their travels around europe searching for the sexiest and horniest women for lots of fun and hot sex they get told about this in slovakia where the girls are gorgeous and dirty so obviously they make their way out there to see what its all about and sure enough at the there are loads of gorgeous young women with great bodies who are up for fun everything seems to be going well until strange things start happening the americans european friend suddenly goes missing without a trace and it appears that the locals arent as nice and friendly as they initially seem as the 2 american guys try to work out whats going on they later discover a run down old building where there is a sick business going on and torture and killing is on the menucan the americans survive this slovakian evil or will they just become another victim i thought was a very entertaining horror film the actors all did a good job the girls were lovely and there was lots of nudity which is always a good thing and of course the gore yep there was quite abit of blood and gore tooalong with the hills have eyes remake i thought this was the best horror film in recent years and i highly recommend it 810,cruel
i have to applaud writerdirector eli roth for what he has created in to me this film is not as much a horror flick as a thriller told with all the gruesome brutality intact there are no scares no haunting music crescendoing and no jump in your seat moments that we expect from the genre yes we get blood and gore and uncut severing of body parts the film is definitely not for the squeamish however roth tells it in such a way that we as an audience are involved and invested in these characters we saw the torture in the previews and think this is what the movie will be in totality when instead we are shown a couple of kids backpacking through europe before grad school these kids roam free until their better judgment lead them to their destructionjay hernandez and derek richardson are perfectly cast hernandezs paxton is ready for a good time or as many as he can with as many different women possible richardsons josh on the other hand has just broken up with his girlfriend and is reluctant to join in the fun his nervousness is portrayed realistically and you can believe these two guys are old friends and have each others backs they even meet a horny icelander oli played with comic genius by eythor gudjonsson he is a kindred spirit although probably a decade older than the boys and the three are having a blast in europe when the suggestion of perfect sexcrazed girls in slovakia is dropped into their consciousness they continue their trek east and all goes to plan meeting two vixens including the gorgeous monica bellucci lookalike barbara nedeljakova who show them a good time a good time that is until oli goes missing and hell beginseli roth has woven a suspenseful yarn that totally came out of left field he shows us a more serious take on a premise like the comedy eurotrip for the first forty or so minutes of a ninetyminute film we know what is going to happen and yet he teases us by giving the exact opposite to the gore we have come to see this tactic allows us to settle in and get to know our protagonists learn their backgrounds and motives the attention to detail here makes what happens in the second and final act that much more visceral these are innocents roped into an underground game of deception and profit they dont deserve what is about to happen and we root for them that much more each small bit of exposition into their lives also pays dividends later on to help us cope with some of the things they do remember the memory shared by jay hernandez about a drowning girl from his past this story helps setup why he does what he does towards the end old horror rules dont apply here people dont act stupid and run towards the killers they have distinct reasons for what they do and the entire film is carefully orchestrated as suchother reasons to see the film include actor jan vlask as the dutch businessman our leads encounter on their journey east he has the intellectual creepiness his character needs to be a success the mannerisms and involuntary shake of the hands add substance and layers to a role that isnt explained as much as the others each action of his speaks louder than any words could also the cinematography is worth watching on its own we are treated viscerally by grimy diseaseinfested scenery shrouded in darkness roth uses abstract angles throughout the film keeping the audience offkilter and prone so that the assault has the utmost impact more than visuals though is the aural quality of many scenes on multiple occasions we are stopped on static framing while the sounds of whats about to happen fill your ears if you feel any fear during this movie its in the anticipation perfectly laid forth by the sound preceding every act seen as with thunder being followed by lightninghas everything you could want in a horrorthriller the suspense is heavy and never overplayed to cause boredom from the waiting i think this fact might actually hurt the planned sequel being written now by roth hopefully the fact that he is continuing the story at the exact point the first ended will help in getting the audience involved right away not having the same long period of setup before the payoff making it essentially the same movie with different characters either way count me in for part two any movie that includes great songs like the sneakerpimps how do and pop culture cameos like horrormaestro takashi miike is good in my book,cruel
i though this film was the best film i had ever seen in ages it scared me so much and i felt physically sick after watching it i would warn people before they watched it but they should watch it because it is really really good the beginning is a bit slow but when it gets into the action it is really good squeamish and disturbing but very very good i thought there was to much nudity that was not needed in this film it was scary but quite funny at times the scene in which the japanese girl kills herself after seeing her eyeless face is quite funny actually even though it is obviously not supposed to be it is quite predictable as well but there you go,cruel
i loved this movie i loved the intensity i was cringing the whole time because of the intense gore i think the only way to see this movie is at the cinema with the big screen and the darkness oh god it was good intense that is how i best describe this when alex is getting drilled all over his body i was cringing and wincing and the heel slit the pain but i have to say the best bits were the bubble gum gang and the asian chick getting her eye cut off the pus that came out it is sooooo unbelievably disgusting i love itif what you want is senseless violence or if youre looking for great ways to torture people then this is the movie to see,cruel
star rating  the works  just misses the mark  that little bit in between  lagging behind  the pits a couple of obnoxious young americans and a pal they met on their journey take a trip to amsterdam holland to enjoy a no holds barred holiday of casual sex and pot smoking however things take an unexpected turn when members of their number start mysteriously disappearing it turns out there is another pleasure the boys havent sampled a pleasure where theyll suffer the most extreme pain and torture theyve ever known from which they may well not leave alivetouted as one of the most gruesome films ever made proudly boasted a bloodsplattered publicity campaign with a grisly promotional poster and that master of all things violent quentin tarantino billed as the executive producer ive already seen some extremely nasty films this year in the shape of running scared and the devils rejects although is not as consistently nasty as those films there are a handful of scenes that definitely wont work wonders for the fainthearted but for the most part this just struck me as one of the most boring films ive seen in quite a whileif you still feel the need to slow down and peer in the car wreck yourself youll have to let yourself in for an unbelievably boring first half where absolutely nothing seems to happen some unlikeable central characters and of course the unpleasant bloodsplattered scenes it might help if you try to see it as an examination of the dark side that could result in amsterdams culture of indulgence but if you tune in for shock value if youre like me youll most likely just end up falling asleep ,cruel
i think that americans should realize that the whole movie shows untrue picture of slovakiabecause in reality a living standard there is much higher and you will certainly not meet there children begging for chewinggums the village shown in the movie is not bratislava but a small village from czech republic the cars in movie are not used for several years there in average you can see on roads cars like bmwmercedesskodaopel and a lot of other good european cars the girls are in average nice but they will certainly not do anything for money as it is presented in movieand in one scene there are slovak policemen batonning some civilian this is absolutely absurd something like that is not possible in slovakia because slovakia is democracy and member of european union,cruel
gives you an insane adrenaline rush must watch horror movie classic,cruel
hi first of all i want to say that i dont know english so well as i am from bangladesh anyway i want to share my opinion about dis movie with my weak english ive seen dis movie yesterday on dvd that also includes cry wolf the devils rejects and the cave as i didnt know anything about this movie  at the beginning i thought it might be that kind of so called horror movie with some adult scenebut as the movie approaching i find it rather adventurous and excitingit has some quality well i think some fantastic soundtrack though there were no well known actoractress in dis movie but they act so wellvery well indeed and about da horrors sceneoh my god what can i say they were totally creepy and so realisticand the locations are also absolutely fantasticand one thing i can tell u that u wont feel boring when u will watch this movie most of the horror movies have dis problemu will find them boring most of da timelastly dont watch dis movie with children and people with weak heartskoz there r lots of adult scene and too much violence in this moviein my view the movie is sick disgusting and absolutely brilliant u should watch it if u like thriller and horror movie ,cruel
there are three movies in my lifetime that i have watched that captured the true meanness of the killer they are play misty for me dirty harry and all three movies do not give much leeway in the killers actions they are killers they kill they may be nuts but lets not get lost in trying to figure out how to rehabilitate their sorry minds is true from beginning to end mean as hell the beginning is a little slow of a setup but still this is not supposed to be about betty crocker at the pillsbury bakeoff this is a twisted variation of the most dangerous game and nothing is left to the imagination the only difference is that this has a good ending the hero does not end up enjoying killing and become the new owner hope this is not the route of 2 but instead kills 4 of the people responsible for killing his two buddies the best scene is where the hero runs over the three killers and the black haired woman looks up from the ground after being run over just in time to be run over by the automobile chasing the hero i was like yeah as if iowa had just beat lsu on a last second toss at a football bowl gameendings are the most critical ingredient of a great movie this movie has itmaybe 2 will be how he goes back and kills the management of the  or maybe the asian friends of the two women murdered go back and slice the management up with samuri swords,cruel
i absolutely loved the acting may not have been the best but the small details were some of the things that made the movie really good for instance the cinematography the set design the music and the costumes and even though the acting was not that good i feel that the actors still portrayed what the character was like also the plot in general was a very interesting and thoughtprovoking idea there were some funny lines but the main attraction is definitely the gore the special effects were very good and realistic but the movie is definitely graphic and is not for the faint of heart i really enjoyed watching ,cruel
it seemed like this movie was overhyped until it actually hit the theatres then it became a sort of a flop i liked it personally i thought maybe it could have been done better but it was alright people on the board are complaining about how it was sick and disgusting i look at it more like a rebirth of the trashy era of cinema that started in europe mainly italy this was a trash film it exploited and objectified women showed lots of graphic violence and was filled with foul language maybe youre not familiar with the work of lucio fulci joe damato or even dario argento but this sort of thing thrived in the 80s anyway about the movie the only thing that bothered me was the abundance of inane dialogue among the americans proving that most of us between the ages of 1830 cant say a single sentence without using the f word but thats what you get when you rent a teen movie nowadays look at the girl next door for example two american college students take a trip across europe looking to party and find some girls they do just that and the audience is treated to some of the most explicit sex scenes ive seen in a while one is kidnapped and taken to a slaughterhouse to be tortured and killed why youll have to watch and find out the second half of the movie is for diehard gore lovers only its got some truly revolting makeup effects including an eyeball scene that would have made lucio fulci nauseous see this movie if youre tired of those other slick glossed over minimal violence new horror movies,cruel
is on of those rare horror movies that has it all and actually pulls it off half the movie is just a great and funny euro road trip i have recently been out to a in amsterdam and could totally understand their situation the coffee shops the girls the parties everything was so realistic which makes the ending all the more better they could have just finished making that movie and it still would have been good but the fact that then finish it off with some of the most disturbing violent and compelling horror ever put to film makes it an all around great cinematic experience defiantely a cult hit tarantino knows horror and eli roth may turn out to be our next george a romero,cruel
after hearing people say that this film was a gore fest i had to see for myself what i found was a truly brilliant example of artistic precision this film shows the true ugly side of human nature it shows that there is a repressed grotesque side in every human being that is capable of being unleashed where the idea for the film came from is a horrifying thought process a truly horrific scenario to be caught in with people that have a truly evil take on life what this film does is install just a horrifying nattergram of the feeling that the tortured people go through some people have said after this film that some of the more horrifying acts are uncalled for i would disagree and suggest that the degree of torture is only just applicable anything more explicit and this film would be truly terrifying to 90 of the people that watch it all in all this is a really good film with the first half being put displayed in a very poetic yet explicit manner i feel that some parts of the second half could have been done differently but all in all this is a very good film for the film lover not so much for the commercial film lover,cruel
before seeing this movie i did not know it was from the same director as cabin fever realising it was eli roth i have to say i have become a fan most definitely i really enjoyed cabin fever and thought was even better at first knowing it was presented by quentin tarantino and having read and seen a lot of hype about it on the internet i knew it was a movie i was going to enjoy from a cast of almost unknowns or newbies they did a good job in convincing the horror and terror of their situation although i did not like oli the guy from iceland who was just plain annoying firstly the movie features some gorgeous eastern european women nude a lot of the time which was a plus for the guys but as it goes on were soon presented with the real horror terror and gore that awaits them presented to us in graphic detail makes you kinda think does something like that really exist and could make you think twice about visiting slovakia  for the sole purpose of meeting beautiful women i think a lot of the gore could of came from ideas taken from a lot of asian horrors as being a horror fan myself i have seen plenty of japanese and korean horror movies although a lot of them havent been as good as another thing was that i found myself laughing at some scenes not in a bad way though im not sure whether the humor was intended or just me although it wasnt the scariest of horrors i have seen i really enjoyed this movie as i thought it was pretty fresh in particular for the us market i would definitely recommend any horror fan to go see this movie as i believe it is one that has resurrected the genre of horror will definitely get it out on dvd when it is released as i have read there is an alternative ending on it a final note i would like to make is that if you liked this you should definitely see takashi miikes audition probably the best horror movie ever,cruel
is that rare thing these days  an american horror movie that actually delivers whereas most current hollywood horrors are anaemic affairs that sacrifice scares for laughs and tend to have their characters sneer instead of scream goes for the jugular with some genuinely harrowing moments youll never see toenail clippings in the same way again eli roth seems to have taken a tip from the 1970s the golden age of horror by placing his protagonists in unfamiliar surroundings stripping them of all comforts and subjecting them to such horrendous ordeals that to paraphrase tobe hooper the audience really doesnt know who will survive and what will be left of thembeginning innocuously enough with two freshfaced american backpackers doing hash and whores in holland roth slowly cranks up the tension by having the hapless teens encounter a guy who tells them that if theyre looking for hot chicks then they just have to visit a in a remote town in slovakia mocking the young americans ignorance by casually referring to a nonexistent war and making out that the women of eastern europe are still living life as though they were in a soviet state of the 1980s pretty soon this silvertongued creep has convinced the teens and their icelandic buddy to take a chance one unsettling train journey later and the boys believe that all their wishes have come at once as beautiful buxom naturist girlies frolic for them at the legendary of course this is just the flypaper pretty quickly the icelander is missing and it gradually becomes apparent that the is the front for something sinistercrossing over into exploitation by featuring acres of female skin and full frontal scenes fondly recalls the political incorrectness of so many 1970s british horror movies combining this with the gutsy gore of 1980s american shockers however roth ensures that this is more than just a tribute with some neat directorial touches and motifs contrasting the light sm fetishes in the dutch brothels with the truly awful fate of the slovak ers he also keeps things interesting with a twist two thirds of the way through the movies not a perfect film  the script lacks the anger or isolation that defines the greatest genre films the greatest horror directors walker kubrick romero seem to retain an ambivalence towards the material that roth lacks  it feels like he enjoys this to much to be repelled by it but this is worth more than a hundred screams or final destinations because it does not try to humourise the horror or make light of the characters ordeals noone can come out of this smiling superior to cabin fever most certainly and pretty much on a par with recent hits such as wolf creek and the descent is the best us horror ive seen for some time see it,cruel
i have been eagerly awaiting the release of this movie as it had been a long time since id seen a good horror film so the expectation for was quite high i have to say that after a slow start it didnt disappoint once the action got goingthe beginning of the film was a bit of a damp squib i must admit the 3 main characters were just irritating stock horror movie guys once the horror really started to kick in though i was pleased that they developed to the point where i actually cared what happened to them with the exception of oli the icelandic guy who it must be said got on my nerves so much that i was thinking if he isnt killed soon im gonna jump in there and do it myself by the end of the movie i was hooked and disturbed there are some truly gory scenes and the overall premise people paying to experience the feeling of torturing and killing someone is an extremely scary one which could easily have been based on a true story in my opinionid definitely recommend this movie for horror fans but bring a cushion to hide behind its stuck in my mind relentlessly which for me is the mark of a good horror flick,cruel
yes many may think that was a terrible movie because it wasnt your normal horror film it starts off slow but without that the movie would not have the same effect evertyhing seemed nice in the beginning for the characters and for the viewers and then wham everyone is plunged into this hell in eastern europe i personally found the film horrifying and graphic and quentin torantino did an excellent job another aspect of the film that i really enjoyed was the music it was electrifying and made the environment of the film ten times more suspenseful the torture scenes were very graphic and real it wasnt just about slitting someones throat or putting a gun to their head it was psychological for the characters and viewers the whole point of the torture scenes were to mess up the minds of the victims instead of flat out killing them i thoroughly enjoyed and will watch it again and recommend it for any horror movie lovers,cruel
is one of the new generation movies that tend to bring back to life the exploitation subgenre of course in light rrated versionsi know that comparisons are not always necessary but i have to say that roth is heavily inspired by tobe hoopers texas chainsaw massacre dont get me wrong i give my respect to roth for being brave enough by creating cabin fever and it takes guts to produce these kind of movies in a world that consumes pg13 horror flicks roth seems to dont give a sh about making money but he wants the respect of fans of the genre anyways i compare it to tcm 1974 of course mainly because it has the same basic plot elements torture sadistic people symphaty for the main characters extreme violence and a creepy setting the plot is as simple as it gets two american boys along with a drunken fun guy from iceland plan their spring break style trip to europe not cancun or ibiza a series of events lead them to a in slovakia where they meet a cruel fate after partying with no limits one by one these guys are getting slaughtered and butchered by savage town people as a part of an art exposition or something like that its not like they had bad luck because these people kill any foreign tourists why and who is behind these atrocious activities whats behind the purpose of killing could it be something with economical purpose you need to witness the interesting motives isnt by any means a shocking horror flick for those who have seen exploitation flicks from the 70s or heavily violent slashers from the 80s the movie succeeds in delivering extreme violence glorious blood thanks to the fx team and raw violence we got smashed heads those children really had a bad behavior where were their parents severed bodies butchered body parts and the good old chainsaw violence what else could you ask for  the highlights of the movie in my opinion  1 when paxton witnesses brutality towards people the events he looked at really looked like scenes taken away from a snuff film 2 the now infamous eye cut scene poor kana the scene is memorable and will soon become a favorite among fans of the genrethe movie goes directly to the point after you get used and feel symphaty with the characters after the mix of sex hot women alcohol sex and more sex we are driven through a torture ride without asking for our permission now violence blood gore more violence and violence substitute sex and chicks i liked the abrupt change roth knows how to create tension and make the audience feel disturbed by the movies events this guy is going to get far in the genre he takes the right influences tcm mainly jay hernndez delivers a believable strong performance the man knows how to demonstrate pain and desperation oli was my favorite character it seems that the actor is really a party animal nice casting overall likable villains also overall is a decent horror flick which doesnt relies 100 its gore and violence on it the movie does have a plot minimal if you say and good production values i really prefer this new wave of film making than pg13 or rrated remakes,cruel
first of let me mention that ive never reviewed a movie before i make no claim of being good at it i can offer no explanation as to why anyone should listen to me but here are my thoughts ive read about 5 of the reviews on here and i feel like theyve missed the mark quite badly after the movie i found myself defending to my wife more than i even felt it deserved apparently this is a love it or hate it type of movie but i didnt do either  i just thought it was pretty badmy biggest gripe with the film through about an hour was that there was absolutely no plot a few guys go to slovakia and get tortured it wasnt till right at the end that the plot made itself apparent and finally seemed to have some value as a film without giving away any of the details id say at this point seemed to have a great premise for a film  unfortunately it didnt pull it offin no way attached me to the characters while ive debated with myself how realistically they behaved theres no getting around the fact that the characters were about as likable as any random college tough guy trying to start a fight at a bar  and these are the guys were supposed to be pulling for relating tothe plot setup took almost the entire movie my wife said itd be good for guys because there were plenty of boobs but we all have internet and can get that for free anyway once the action began it was over in about 10 minutes the movie wasnt horror  there was never a moment i even felt like my heartrate might increase and overall the whole movie seemed to have a playfull weak teenage feel to it just like cabin feveri wanted to enjoy this movie it seemed like it could be an intelligent horrorthriller but from the very beginning it just wasnt quentin tarrantino needs to stop putting his name on crap,cruel
finally i gave in and went to see because it kept being referred to in daily conversation of the young and reckless now i know why i usually do not go to see light pieces like this one it is because however intriguing the first sequels might be after a few minutes the usual problems surface and keep bugging you even until after the end loose plots factdefying situations and conversations and wrongfully chosen backdrops all boost the impression that lowbudget also resulted in not taking the time to carry out the necessary researches on the subject the location etcin amsterdam a wily youth advises three backpackers from the us and iceland to go to slovakia if they want to hook up with nice chicks the reason he says why so many easy girls can be found there is that there are no guys in that country because of the war what come on the last time there has been a war on slovakian territory was back in wwii eli roth must have mistaken slovakia for slovenia but there has not been a recent war in slovenia either only its neighbors serbia and croatia were engaged fighting one another in the early to mid 90swhen the backpackers arrive to slovakia what they find is a rundown country out of the stone age not exactly what it is like in reality i am not saying slovakia is the european dubai but people not having more than three crooked teeth in their mouthes and driving around in cars you would not see anywhere else but in an industrial museum paying tribute to the exsoviet eras technological achievements is a bit of an exaggeration slovakians also drive ford opel bmw and mercedes cars like everybody else in europe and they do have statesupported dentistry as wellno care has been taken to try to find out what the location of the film is indeed like in reality the sad truth is that the place you would find child gangs attacking backpackers in broad daylight is not slovakia but england and the disgraceful outer districts of pariseither american movie makers do not know anything about europe or they think we are stupid enough to be depicted as we are in their films actually the only character resembling a european is that of oli so why all the hassle to excuse the icelandic president and if you intend to make the central train station of bratislava look like it was in germany you could at least remove the coke ads written in slovakian from the background mr roth i mean this is what one sensible man would start with is it not,cruel
this unlike your typical slasher is truly disturbing i found this so not because of violence but for the representation of hatred towards the fellow manthis hatred is directed to westerners specifically americans it leaves you asking do foreign cultures really think this way how many people dream about torturing people from wealthier happier cultures like that of the usa uk australia japan etc the setting is perfect slokakia known to many as a gloomy poor nation in eastern europe the victims are perfect happygolucky promiscuous teenagers on vacation the perfect juxtaposition exists between villains and victims the poor angry and jealous eastern europeans against these more prosperous americans its one cultures revenge against another through jealousyin the end who are the real victims who are the real villains an ideal infusion of strong imagery violence suffering and revenge make this an entertaining film for most horror movie fansin the end this is an above average modern portrayal of the dark side of the human psyche and humanity in general,cruel
i think this movie presents a good argument against going on a hedonistic sex tour on a few different fronts 1 if you go on a hedonistic sex tour and pay money to bang babes then equally some sadist may pay money to torture and kill you the fact is when an institution is sick or evil you could also be a victim the very concept of the sex tour is that a woman is a commodity that can be purchased  but there is no limit on what can be commidified as long as there is a market for it2 second of all suppose you start getting becoming a more depraved and sick human afterwards a character that was during the torturing to an asian woman apparently went on lots of sex tours and wanted bigger highs and thrills and eventually ended up doing that its like some sort of progression starts with a hedonistic sex tour with normal women then more depravity it goes to sex with children more depravity it comes to snuff more depravity torture and killing etcas a young virgin guy i identified with the characters wanting to get laid in europe and sure thats a guy thing i really identified with them and was totally sympathetic although they wanted to get laid they never hurt or tortured anyone and could never have deserved thatthe movie has a stead progression from an american pie movie to a horror movie to a revenge movie and had a nice tone to it  but the problem with the movie is that it is just too evil  i felt like paying to watch a movie like that seems sick its a sick movie but it has raised some pointsif anyone ever thinks of going to thialand costa rica or any sextour places to explore hedonistic pleasure  then in the back of my mind there could be some evil lurkinganother aspect is that normal types of people can just be diabolical evil monsters you dont know what people would do if they had no limitations super rich people can buy themselves out of anything and the movie potentially taints rich people as potentially being sadistic monsters that pay to break the law in third world countries where anything can be bought,cruel
i have recently watched the for the second time and was amased on how good it was i am very disappointed at customers at my video shop complaining the lack of story and excitement on this movie i wouldnt categorise this movie as a horror ad put it right in the top of the list with a nice gore category its not a scary movie but i must give it 1010 for its twisted sickness the only reason i gave it a 910 was because i wanted more i personally did not think there was enough killings also the way they killed of the chinese girl with the burnt eye at the endcould of been much more creativeif you enjoy movies such as saw dawn of the dead final destinationthen most likely you will have a great time watching this movie the only thing i will warn you all not to have a meal if you get easily sick watching disturbing things before the movie enjoy and get ready for 2 2007 kalle,cruel
i still cant decide whether is a mismarketed comedy or a terrible excuse for a horror film its no surprise quentin tarantino produced it  he loved wolf creek which was also very gory  but wolf creek was scary and wellmade whereas was cheesy humorous and so unbelievably overthetop i didnt know whether to laugh or be afraidi had heard people talking about the excessive gore  but its all goofy the girl with her eyeball hanging out looks like she has a cheap 80s monster movie effect glued to her a few parts made me cringe in anticipation because i thought something gruesome was going to happen  but it always turned out being more funny than anythingsome critics said its a satire of american tourism i doubt it i dont think eli roth is that smart i think he wanted to make something fairly tongueincheek while at the same time satisfying his lust for blood he loves blood in horror movies  check out his list of favorites or his previous film cabin fever which is what attracted qt to producing this movie the first hour is a teen sex comedy with three guys jay hernandez derek richardson and eythor gudjonsson traveling to europe to experience a good time they visit seedy dutch locales and see loads of american tourists are there even any dutch people here then travel farther east and wind up going to a where they share a room with two hot constantlynaked babes who apparently are unaware of the material we would refer to as clothing this is where i began to feel my intelligence become gradually insulted was roth satirizing american stereotypes of easterneuropean countries was he satirizing the horror genres gratuitous nudity or was he just buying time to get to the blood n guts and figured hed fill up the running time by getting some really gorgeous women naked on set for the hell of it i think it was probably the last oneafter all the random nudity sex and american machismo the movie suddenly veers into horror territory by showing weird slovakian perverts slicing n dicing american tourists for their sick pleasure uh yeah i forgot to mention something this film purports to be based on a true story riiiight according to roth he saw a mysterious website once  that he strangely hasnt seen again since  advertising a similar experience for paying customers i think perhaps mr roth was smoking something at the time but well never know i guess the rest of the movie is pointless to divulge any further into suffice to say if you like really cheesy movies that rely solely on gratuitous violence to scare you this will be right up your alleypersonally i didnt find it scary at all the beginning  the sex stuff  is scarier than the actual violence later on because it has atmosphere and an air of anticipation  you know something bad is going to happen and the movie works best in this mode once it starts exploiting the torture and violence it just becomes laughable and predictable and then of course we get the stereotypical hero who is too stupid to realize that if he escapes alone he can send back help for all the people rather than risk his life to go back into the to rescue one personeh what does he know anyway dumb american tourist see  i can make fun of tourists like mr roth too,cruel
this was an excellent movie anyone who says different either has a poor imagination or lacks the capacity of fear having travelled a lot when i was younger and not for one second thought i was ever in any danger this film is the nightmare of parents everywherethe flick doesnt take itself too seriously and as far as im concerned beautiful women in any medium are always welcome though they do form part of the honeypot trap plotdont take your lass to watch this or get it out for a family viewing do get some beers lower the lights and watch it on your own after youve booked a holiday to europe its what i did,cruel
with so much hype surrounding this movie plus quentin tarantinos named tacked on i shouldnt have gotten my hopes up too high i did and was let down mind you the special effects used during the torture scenes were exceptional however if you make a movie like this and bill it as a torture film with the brutal scenes then thats what it should be i can understand the absence of character development and weightlessness of the films plot in a movie like this because typically horrorslasher films arent concerned with these aspects but if you leave these elements completely out you have to compensate with excessive gore and violence maybe this reveals a dark side of my filmgoing expectations but the torture scenes ie the horror scenes totaled maybe 1520 minutes of this 15 hour film thats about 20 of a movie that was hyped to be incredibly graphic and disgusting there were 1 or 2 moments where i actually did physically dry heave pretty sure the girl sitting in front of me thought i lost it in her hair but that was it honestly i have scene more graphic horror sequences in the modern horror staples such as friday the 13th and the nightmare on elm street and halloween series cabin fever director eli roths previous horror film is one of the most underrated horrorslasherindie style films and more graphic and gutwrenching than and im not sure why tarantino is tacking his name onto projects he normally wouldnt be affiliated but i guess he has a reason if youre a fan of horror i would wait until this comes out on dvd there are some scenes that will make the average person squirm and feel their gut rolling but the sicktoyourstomach feeling is strongest as you walk out of the theater realizing you wasted 9 dollars on a subpar film if you havent scene cabin fever go rent that and wait for to join the dvd library a few months from now,cruel
most commentators and reviewers writing about this extraordinary film cannot see the genuine message of the movie they concentrate on all the shocking and grotesque violence and gore but look elsewhere look deeper this film is about at least three things first its about the smugness shallowness and adolescent arrogance of the contemporary western youth culture second its about an absolute moral and cultural devastation of the postcoldwar eastern europe third its about the collision between the twoa bunch of western students are advised to travel to a town in provincial slovakia where they are promised to be serviced by the most beautiful local girls their interest is piqued by the fact that these local girls allegedly dream of nothing more honorable than taking care of the sexual needs of horny westerners tarantino and roth brilliantly show the vanity smugness and complete contempt thinly papered by shameless bravado with which the trio of western young men anticipate their sojourn in slovakia they have a sense of entitlement they expect to be treated like white gods in the land of postcommunist savages their little pathetic egos are stroked by the fact that they think they do not have to make any effort to even try to appeal to these girls these girls should submit to them by the virtue of one fact  the guys represent the superior victories and rich west the initial turn of events confirms all these attitudes of smug superiority but very quickly we learn that the local worship the gods of the west is nothing but illusory the defeated and ravaged societies of the postcommunist eastern europe have a few horrible tricks up their sleevesthe creators of the movie do an absolutely fantastic job at portraying the social rot and culturalmoral devastation of postcommunism the picture contradicts the new york times presentation of postcommunism as the age of social and moral revival but the local girls the human symbols of eastern europe are not at all what they are thought to be by the western horndogs they crave nothing more than to punishment those who deprive them of their human honor and dignity even before they actually see them they fight the attitude of colonizers and cultural missionaries with which so many westerners have in all kinds ways treated eastern europe their revenge is horrible and excruciatingly cruel but it comes from a deepseated sense of despair of struggling to preserve the modicum of dignity in the world where all values had collapsed where everything is for sale where whole countries and regions exist only for providing entertainment for the fancy of the foreign wealthythis movie is brilliant and politically sharp achievement bravo tarantino and roth,cruel
first off im not a fan of horror movies in general the acting is usually bad the plots are too contrived and the violence when present doesnt add very much that being said i was pleasantly surprised by this film the acting was believable and authentic and the story although still a bit far fetched was compelling enough to not have one saying oh come on every five minutes the notorious violence that the movie was supposed to showcase in all its graphic glory was actually restrained in my opinion and not nearly as bad as the commercials make it seem still this movie is definitely not for the faint hearted some of the scenes will leave you cringing and maybe even looking away for a few moments but overall it is not as gory as one might be led to believe if you can stand some intense but brief scenes you will walk away quite satisfied and certainly not wanting to visit eastern european s any time soon,cruel
this movie is a more than great one for several reasons its not also a good refreshing and original horror movie but also a great subtle social commentaryjust think about it every horror element of horror movies of the past two decades are present here hot girls lots of sex and nudity graphic horror and a murderous psychopathic villain everything is made out extra large and is prominently present here in this movie with as a result that it becomes almost a parody on these sort of other recent horrorflicks watching this movie really made me realize that eli roth understands the genre and sees what is wrong with it these days hes a horrorfan that also happens to direct movies himself especially the first halve of the movie is mostly a parody its filled with nudity and sex and really feels overthetop all its also filled with some great humoryet this movie is also so much more than just reflection on horror movies of the past 2 decades its also a great social commentary the americans are portrayed as ignorant testosterone driven persons who are willing to travel halve over the world just to have sex and they also see the world through their own ignorant narrow minded eyes for instance amsterdam is filled with willinggirls at about basically every corner and all the city has to offer are coffeeshops and everyone in slovakia is poor and does literally everything for money and the country itself is gritty cold gray boring and filled with old fashioned use objects such as cars televisions and clothing like time has stopped there during the cold war and one of the torturers is of course a german some people call it racist but i see it as a great and perhaps even brilliant subtle brought statement made by eli roth he shows how ignorant most americans are about the world around them by showing us the world through the eyes of the two main american characters everything is clich filled and stereotypical but with a purpose not sure if it was done on purpose that every dutch characters speaks german in this movie i think it had more to do with budget reasons its easier to let an actor learn to speak german than dutch still it feels pretty weird since quentin tarantino who was involved with this movie and who lived and worked in amsterdam for a couple of years and always puts some dutch elements into his movies also in this one obviously didnt pointed this out to rothits also funny to see how most people call this movie a predictable one if there is a refreshingly original horror movie of the past few years than its you dont know who is the killers and why and how things are happening until like the last 30 minutes when everything becomes fully completely clear the movie goes in several directions at times and than suddenly turns the other way around for instance the movie begins as a tripping humor filled bmovie that you can hardly take serious but after that the movie suddenly becomes darker and mysterious and in the end it also becomes gory the movie and its style go into several directions at times and the movie takes some great twist and turns it fools the audience a couple of times for instance who didnt thought that when they went into the torture museum the main characters would get stuck there and the rest of the movie would be set in there or how about it that its implied several times in the movie that one of the main characters is a homosexual nothing is really done with it in the movie but its a great daring and subtle touch to make the main character look extra vulnerable and sensible it was not necessary for roth to put it in the movie since nothing is done with it in the story but its obviously put in there to fool us and makes us think that the movie is heading into a different direction with this extra added elementthe movie gets graphic but not until the end when the movie fully turns into an horror movie the movie might not be as gory and graphic as expected but it leaves a lot up to your own imagination but still there are a couple of straightforward graphic sequences which are certainly not just for everyonethe movie is fairly cheap looking which certainly does also add to the unique feeling and atmosphere of the movie its style is certainly unique although this movie is mostly a horror one it never looses its sense of humor and is filled with humorous comical situations dialog and whatever more it makes above all an entertaining and amusing one to watch even though it certainly also gets heavy in the endquentin tarantino calls eli roth the future of horror for a very good reason if there is one person who can bring back the horrorgenre back to its roots and to what they were intended to be at the first place its eli roth simple straightforward and without a complicated or sensible plot hopefully in the next few years more people start to see this and shall this also inspire other directors and movie makersperhaps you have to be familiar with the horrorgenre and its movies of the last 2 decades and 70s and perhaps even older to fully see and understand this movie the way eli roth intended us to see it its a movie that will most definitely please the fans of the genre while most casual viewers might probably find this movie nothing more than a formulaic horror movie with a simple story and just dont get what is so special about it also hence the low rating 58

i waited an hour to see this movie i got to the theater a hour early just so that i could get the good seats in the beginning all you heard was cussing and vulgar words then in the next scene all you saw were woman and men having sex next scene all there was to see was breast breast and of course more breasts i ended up leaving the theater during the first 30 minutes of the showing because i didnt pay 7 to watch a porn flick with 50 other people it was nothing but a lot of cussing smoking of weed and sex in one part of a scene all you can hear is people having sex while one of the stars watches and comments none of these things were shown in the previews all that was in the previews was someone getting their 2nd toe cut off and thats what i paid to see a scary movie i had to get my money back from the theater i dont suggest that anyone sees this film,cruel
this movie was horrible i ended up walking out of it after 45 minutes  and all i saw was completely gratuitous sex scenes one right after the other no character development no story line and no horror this movie was made strictly for hormone driven teenage guys who just want to see tits and gore i got my money back and was still mad about wasting 45 minutes of my life that i wont be able to get back quentin tarantino has hit a new low dont take offense all you tarantino fanatics i realize all he did was produce this trash but maybe he shouldve read the screenplay before doing so please if you have any taste at all take my advice and dont waste your time,cruel
the only success this film achieves is in showing how you can rip off a tried and tested bgrade 80s horror film scenario and give it a modern dull spin i have ticked off spoiler but thats a bit rich considering how the trailers promos and advertising basically give you the entire film and thats much of the problem  of the 90 minutes of this flick 50 minutes are wasted getting you past the bits you already knowas for sharp taunt and tight blipvert filmmaking what exactly is the point of all the atmospheric shots of them walking around some eastern european village as for the depraved murders they are rather tame what happened to all the cool promise of chainsaws and power drills in the posters you end up with some hick redneck cowboy mumbling about shooting away lasting longer on screen than any horrific violence if you do not want to show horrors do not make a horror film dont be fooled by the slick promotion of this film and certainly do not let yourself get conned by the quentin tarantino presents lettering all over the posterone of the worst most disappointing and quite frankly dull horror films ever to be made,cruel
i thought i would do an informal review of the midnight screening of in canada eli roth and some of the actors were in attendance as eli spent about 15 minutes prior to screening not only introducing the film but also creating the atmosphere for all in attendance he spoke of the decline of american horror films with specific references to house of wax and exorcism of emily rose and how american horror films are not on par with the japanese and south korean horror films eli said that he wanted to change american horror films and finally put america back on the map to compete against the south koreans and japanese horror film marketsthe midnight screening of played to a sold out crowd as every single seat in the varsity 413 seat cinema was filled after the movie there was a 30 min qa session at which an audience member called eli roth a sick motherfcker to his face to which he thanked him and began to answer his question now on to the reviewis truly ground breaking in the horror american film genre this is no pg13 horrorbut this movie definitely will get an nc17 rating from the mpaa this film is on par with some of the south korean horror oldboy sympathy for mr vengeance and also some of takeshi mikes films audition ichi the killerin fact takeshi mike makes a small cameo in this movie which was treated with applause from the audiencethe first 20 minutes of is slow as it tries to establish the feel and mood of the film the film starts off in amsterdam and slowly reaches its way to bratislav  prague essentially there are lots of breasts and lots of nudityafter the first 20 minutes be prepared to be disgusted surprised and be sweating in your seats this movie is not for a young audience nor is it for teenagers the rest of the movie which comprises of 2 fairly long torture scenes that i had to close my eyes is very graphic being both gory and very violentalso the tension is just supernal i will briefly describe the tension scenes as follows spoiler there are 2 scenes in the movie just before the torture in the chairsin which the audience only sees a black screen but can hear heavy breathing heavy panting as the incumbent is tied up in the chair just waiting for his executioner the other scene consists of a person just waking up from a coma however the camera switches to the perspective of the person in the chair thereforeoffering only glimpses of the tools that are about to used in his execution excellent technique used by eli roth as both of these scene created tension within the moviespoiler finishedthe film is beautiful to look at as the scenery around bratislav is almost breathtaking the main bulk of the film happens in almost like a basement  dungeonlike setting eli presents his surroundings in a very scary way so scary that after the filmthis movie still makes the hairs on your neck stand on endtheres not much else i can say about the film without spoiling any other parts this is a major step forward for both the filmmaker eli roth and the american horror genre as most of the light hearted humor portions that were contained in cabin fever are taken out in replacement for very tense gory action  torture  horror sequencesagain this is definitely a hard r or nc17 rated film aimed at adults ranging from 2335most women would be disgusted or horrified by the amount of violence portrayed in this film after i watched this film all i could think of was the sound of music to try and get this film out of my head it was that disturbingduring the qa session one audience member asked about the mpaa rating for this film eli responded by saying he feels like the person in the torture chair at the moment as the film has already been submitted to the mpaa and hes just waiting to hear back with their answer eli also mentioned that we the audience should comment and write on websites to protect the directors cut version of the film and make sure that the version of we see in theaters will be the directors cut with either a hard r rating or an nc17 rating eli also said that harry gave him the idea to make this movie based on a website that harry provided eli i would love to know the url but i guess we will never knowall in all the movie is great and most certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat both due to atmosphere and visual gore i personally would put this movie on my favorites list of the year this certainly is one to watch with the guys dont take a first date as the chances are she will slap your face and walk out,cruel
first of all this movie made me wanna go to amsterdam all the fun seems to happen there but it seems to be kind of fun that you need money to lets get serious the setup for this film is fascinating its realistic the actorsdirecting are bad but that doesnt ruin anything as a matter of fact that fits to this kind of film also the photography seems a little pretentiously artistic or raw but thats also the usual standard in new movies the aftereffects coloring etc added to the pictures are also really ugly the pretentiousness brings to my mind steven soderberg especially traffic it seems like noone in the film crews today has any kind of artistic interests or anything they want to say or do they just do their job without thinking anything actually its an ugly film in every way also the people and the portrayals of the human relations and of course the human condition are quite cynical for example all the women in this movie are brainless prostitutes at least to me it remains unclear if the director wants to say something or not the script is already so bad that i think no director could do a good movie of it or even want to try its a mystery to me why make movies with millions and millions of dollars without the slightest idea point or inspiration or any need to do something or maybe they just have to make up some work for the thousands of people who work in the film industry the factories has to keep rolling even if noone would need their products there is no life in this movie i dont know is this movie supposed to be exciting or scary the characters are so artificial and plastic that i cannot relate to them as human beings im not interested at all what happens to thema funny idea came to me while watching this film fassbinder could have done this it has the same kind of overall feeling of total negativity and nihilism that he had in his films except angst essen seele auf maybe of course fassbinders movie wouldnt have included this many exciting or entertaining plot turns or events and it would have been visually even uglier than this this is one of the most disturbed movies ive seen it doesnt have any humor or balance which for example all the gore of horror movies ive seen do have only total darkness and pessimism im not the biggest fans of tarantino but i noticed that he has produced this film and they try to sell it with his name for no doubt i really wonder why he wants to support this kind of  he could put his money on charity or something or give them to meif you want to see a movie that takes place in a hotel or a see hotel rhuanda instead,cruel
i have never written a review before on imdb so if this sounds stupid you will have to forgive me im writing out of anger i have just returned from seeing and i cant stress enough do not waste your money on this film i was so excited to see this first of all im a huge fan of the horror genre second i think that tarentino is amazing so after reading a lot about this film online i couldnt wait to see it even though it was directed by eli roth well all i can say is cabin fever ii it was that bad now because im such a fan of horror movies ive sat through a lot of bad acting and cheesy plots however as far as im concerned thats what horror is all about i personally think that you only have to follow one basic rule with horror either make people love your characters so much that you want them to make it or make them so annoying that you cant wait to see them die the rest is free game if you have that i can sit through the worst acting in the world i was so bored with this film i didnt care either way who lived or diedthis film basically once again proved to me that american horror is dead i would say that horror films in general are dead if it wasnt for amazing films like high tension and the too many to name asian horror films out thereagain dont waste your money,cruel
okay so three backpackers two american one icelandic hear about this sexual paradise in slovakia a town full of gorgeous horny women who are desperate for male company since all the local men have been killed in the war of course they waste no time getting there where they discover of course that things are not what they seem the set up is more or less the same as the beach which is fine the european locations and the cinematography all seem promising but the movie falls flat pretty fast and stays there there are scenes of imaginative gore there are some beautiful women taking off their shirts and thats about it the film completely lacked suspense because we werent given much of a reason to care about the characters i found myself completely disengaged sure ill squirm when you show me someone getting chainsawed but is that all there is increasing gruesome effects and nice camera work does not mean youve got a story the main characters who in theory we should be hoping will survive all the bloodshed come off like shallow annoying frat boys but not so annoying that you want them to die which would at least be some way to connect to the movie horror movies should not just be horrifying but suspenseful as well offering the audience a reason to think or yell dont go in there you idiot instead i found myself wondering if they shot the whole thing in europe or did the torture chamber scenes in a us studio i was never scared  never even jolted  once during the whole screening as a postscript eli roth was at the screening and seemed like a nice enough guy,cruel
i thought the movie was pretty good i thought it was creative and enjoyable to watch the movie was pretty original in my opinion i have never seen another like it some parts were pretty gory which was good there was lots of naked women which is ok but i thought it was original and i felt the actors were pretty believable to watch in the movie the movie kept the watcher interested and i think the movie went along pretty fast and i would probably watch it again i rate the movie 810 though i have never found a 1010 so this is up there much better than i could have done kudos to everyone who went into the making of this film well done,cruel
hey people im a guy from slovakia and my english is not so good so i hope that you will understand mefirst i must say that this movie is giving an assumed picture about our country to you slovaks are not fat stinky men rich fetishist arent paying for murdering american tourists in slovakia its just a fiction slovakia is a beautiful country in the heart of europe visit this page and you will see httpwwwslovakiacom second this film is a big piece of  i wasnt afraid not even screaming from fear its uselessly brutal and bent eli roth is horrible director and this film is much more worse then cabine fever elis older movie but that was terrible tooim giving you a good advice dont watch this movie if you watched it already please dont believe elis lies about slovakia,cruel
eli roth is a filmmaker ive heard about through the cult film cabin fever and his latest film is presented by actionfilm maestro quentin tarantino and produced by him and horror filmmaker scott spiegel i wondered as the lights went up why tarantino decided to put his name on the film i can sort of understand why as it brings out some grisly violent scenes with enough gore to pack in his seeming enjoyment for it see kill bill for details but also remembered that another film he was involved in from dusk till dawn was quite similar dawn also a film where its sort of two topics converged into one exploitation flick which tarantino himself might argue or not depending on your pov of whats exploitive in the genre was a much better film with main characters one of them played by qt himself who were also violent but somehow relatable roths film here doesnt really give much to invest in the characters and then when the film focuses on its final characters survival it becomes not so much unbelievable as i know by some point i should try to suspend disbelief as it is emptyi like a horror film to be something that actually gives me suspense and if it shocks me then to back it up with something in the story or with the characters to give it some leverage the first fortyfive minutes or so of just shows our main characters paxton and josh living it up in amsterdam then taking a tip on another or practical prostitution palace in bratislava theres nothing given at all to the character really except that one is less inhibited than the other at times roth tries to add substance by giving the rundown city an almost third man feel ie theres curious dangerous beings all around particularly children and other undesirables everyone possibly in on what the main characters arent but roth as a writer isnt much concerned with spending that much time with these guys unlike tarantino did with his screenplay ten years back if there had been perhaps even more setup or more scenes showing the two err three friends together there wouldve been backup however roth is more interested in what comes in the second half of the filmto give credit where credits due roth at least doesnt commit the sins of the filmmakers of for example saw the cinematography and production design is a full notch above those far lesser laughably bad films in the sort of exploitation sense he doesnt screw around with the audience by playing too many guessing games like qt he goes for the torture scenes and there are a good many few of them by not always showing it more of showing the reactions to the violence and i suppose as a director dealing with such subversive trashy material like sex lots drugs some and unmitigated carnage he does film it without too many gimmicks or stupid flash cuts and such however his style which isnt a horrible one is lacking due to how the substance is too ambiguous for its own good i only knew what this whole torture building was for after reading a couple of reviews after the fact and didnt really keep me on the edge of my seat if he was looking to make me laugh at times as well which is good and bad depending on which scenes i might mean its sometimes at far too inappropriate moments all of the imposed atmosphere is moot when torture just happens for the sake of iti know that roth unlike someone like mel gibson who said his film would be good for the soul doesnt relish in these scenes and maybe is trying for something gruesome out of the recent slew of ultraviolent asian flicks ala fukasaku and miike but the wit of those films albeit quite dark is too absent here and after a while one wonders if all of this is more for the filmmakers benefit than the audiences who knows maybe i can recommend it for a certain quota of the public who are into the takenoprisoners films like from the 70s i spit on your grave for example but it just wasnt for me after a while even after trying to shut my brain off and enjoy the mindlessness of it all i got impatient theres some good stuff in the film but muddled over by not being able to connect the setup with the payoff c,cruel
after going to see for myself i think its clear that the majority of comments on the movie on imdb come from either people whove seen some kind of unfinished ultragory preliminary version or people who have a moral issue with claims that is a morally repulsive movie are untrue being a catholic myself i still understand that the torture scenes which while certainly clipped from the original version are disturbing and horrible make no mistake about it are effective story building techniques claims that the movie never cuts to a reassuring shot arent true you dont see everything that happens with the torture but the movie isnt tame in the least it doesnt approach the level of japanese shocker films in what it shows but again its not tamei thought the movie had a disturbing plot which was relatively well fleshed out ive heard people say there isnt even an ending which is such untrue garbage that it makes me laugh its a satisfying gory disturbing type of deal that is as far from nothing as can beif you have an interest in original violent horror go ahead and see the movie though its disturbing and violent its not as tasteless and plotless as many would like to lead you to believe,cruel
my first choice for a movie this year was and i am glad of it it has what i like most in an entertainment  sex and violence the last movie that i saw in 2005 was wolf creek it was darker and grimmer i liked wolf creek but i dont know that i could recommend it is a hoot the element of suspense is well done the plot tripped me up a few times when i thought that i had everything figured out and the fun doesnt stop till the final frame all the actors do an excellent job whether technically accurate or not again to my delight the actresses have shaved their legs and their underarms also functions in a way as a great tourist ad for holland i definitely want to go there not so much eastern europe is what a saturday matine is all about see it,cruel
i am usually quite easily scared by movies and so i expected based on its marketing to be truly gory and frightening i was thoroughly disappointed as were the people i saw it with i saw it tonight the first night it came out and i as well as the majority of the moviegoers in my soldout theater laughed through the entire movie some of the scenarios were just laughoutloud funny the acting was horrible im a jay hernandez fan and cant believe he did this movie the plot was incredibly weak and tarantinos attempts at suspense were not effective we actually walked out of the movie questioning if it was supposed to be a parody of the horror movie genre i really wouldnt waste your 925 to see this movie,cruel
i was able to attend a special sneak preview screening of last night in the los angeles area i must say i was pleasantly surprised i will be the first to admit that i was not enthralled with cabin fever eli roths first horror film but i was amazed at how well this movie was done there is something so unsettling about a place that seems to pander to the visceral basis of human nature the movie was masterfully done slowly sliding from a place of comfort and happiness to a place of sheer terror the scenes of torture that you have heard about are just as horrifying as you would expect definitely worthy of the rrating the movie received the transformation of the main character throughout the movie was captured quite well and the character development overall was very well done even though the movie only runs 95 minutes eli roth was able to effectively make us care about the characters and what happens to them there is plenty going on in this movie and the short runtime does not detract there are plenty of moments in the film where you just want to stand up and cheer for the good guys and go beat the crap out of the bad onesand i realize that i am rambling and my sentences are very disconnected must be the early morning hours the point is this is a very good horror movie and the perfect scary movie to cure the oscar season slump of artsy films come january 6th i will be seeing this movie again and if you are a horror fan you should be seeing it as well,cruel
i have a pretty morbid sense of humor so im not going to grade this movie based on how funny i thought it was but as a standalone moviethe movie had a small amount of potential but unfortunately it was buried underneath all of the shitty acting and the completely unrealistic plot i see this movie reaching out to be very old boy meets ishi the killer but it fails miserably i thought the deathtorture scenes were a bit too hyped up and i found myself laughing quite a bitheres the small spoiler towards the middleend of the movie a gorgeous russian i think vacationlover of the main character lures said main character into an old broken down factory building how does she do it she tells him that his missing friends obviously something very suspicious is going on at this point the movie are at an art show located in an old falling apart factory it took me a good 46 minutes to believe that the folks that made this movie actually expected the audience to buy into the fact that the main character didnt question the location of the art show at all this kind of shakiness throughout the entire plot destroys the movie to top it all off there are a lot of moments where you say i knew itdo yourself the favour dont bother seeing it if youre really curious save yourself the 9 or 10 and maybe rent it when it comes out on dvd,cruel
ok first of all i havent seen this movie yet not because we dont have a tv in my country but i saw trailer and have already read plenty of reviews i am very disgusted and disappointed of mr tarrantino and how they present my country i lived one year in us and i know that american people dont know much about europe not even about tiny country like slovakia i respect that nobody is perfect on the other side i know very well that americans are most naive at least teenagers people in the world and for sure according to some stupid movie they will make picture of whole country well i dont understand these 6 things 1 why the story could not be based in virtuall country like in the terminal with tom hanks for example country called krakotzia with russian accent 2 director apologize to islands minister of foreign affairs cause he pictured islanders as an alcoholics and sexual addictive assholesbut he doesnt care about slovakia he probably even wasnt there 3 why mostly of the movie was made in czech republic with czech speaking people czech headlines traffic signs etc everything was mostly in czech language btw great new for many of you czechoslovakia was separated in 1993  13 years go 4we do have tvs even colored internet electricity we have had already own astronaut in space mostly students can speak more than one language in contrast with you mostly students traveled across us and saw more than average american citizen saw from his own country 5 all of you are very welcome to slovakia so you can convince yourself how is this nation beautiful with friendly peaceful people and very progressive economy 6i understand that even negative publicity is sometimes good publicity but anyway i am disgusted,cruel
i hated this movie why would anyone want to make this film it only showed the most horrible side of humans without the slightest evidence of reflexivity why does tarantino insist on producing films which constantly link sex to horrific violence no not even sex just the explicit objectification of women where was the moral of the story uh dont go to europe because they are all crazed money grabbing half witsthe representation of men was equally worrying the only half decent male got killed off early on with some pseudo comment about a new man type made me want to go to film theory classes just so i can try to learn why such horrifically themed films are made,cruel
i am a huge fan of gory movies i even enjoyed cabin fever but this movie was a waste of time effort and money i left after an hour not all due to the movie theater had messed up the sound stopped the projector to fix it but i thought the movie was pointless first half was porn with no reason and the second half was gore and violence with no development no exposition i know the elements would prob have tied up in the last act but i had no desire to see themwhat story there is is painfully signposted dutch businessman and what story exposition there is is painful and drawn out first entry into the exhibitioni really disliked this film despite all of the correct elements the sfx make up was good the atmosphere was interesting and the premise i had figured out was good but the storytelling was clunky and was poorly executedi really would not be in a rush to see another eli roth movie,cruel
this movie was by far one of the most horrible movies ive ever seen aside from the shock value this movie had absolutely nothing to offer the only quality of the film that superseded the unnecessarily gruesome bloodshed which was more nauseating than scary is the unnecessarily mindless plot line if youre looking for a psychological thriller that leaves you awake for days obsessing over the horrific details you witnessed the night you went to the movies dont see this film if youre looking for a horror movie that leaves you ready to vomit and unsure why the once godlike quentin tarrantino ever tried a career in film go ahead and check it out but i suggest you dont waste your money,cruel
mostly my fault for not wanting to wait for to become available for renting in holland i ordered my us copy a few weeks ago a horror movie with tarantino involved sounded like a great ideaand with baited breath i waited for my dvd to arrivehow disappointed i was to be read and take note and do not bother watching this movie unless curiosity is going to get the better of you since when was german the spoken language of the netherlands last time i stepped out of my front door dutch was the language of the day since when did prostitutes have their breasts hanging out on display in the infamous windows of the red light district no pay no show i am sure the glammed up whore house where sexy silhouettes play across the glass doors exists only in the minds of those who have never been to amsterdam tightly controlled and protected prostitutes are not going to be working in a house where punters can walk around freely open doors to their will joining an already paying customer the entire amsterdam chapter is a total fantasy of high school jocks who do not own a passport being an american does not allow special priorities loud arrogant tourists from no matter where will not be treated with any more respect than deserved i am an american is not a life line during the torture scenes surely fainting due to extreme high levels of pain would have occurred grusome scenes become laughable and you have to wonder if in fact is a comedy in disguise when the hero escapes on the train and arrives somewhere in europe having a mix of german and other european languages on the sign posts creates confusion and a totally unacceptable end to what had already become a bad movie,cruel
people please dont watch this movie its better to spend your time on other things of just a good movie the first 45 minutes are really really boring all the people in amsterdam netherlands speak german s another thing is you keep seeing lots of half naked woman why the naked woman well i dont think anyone knows why they put in the woman they dont have any purpose in the movie after 45 minutes the movie isnt very very bad but just bad the things you see are pretty repulsing so thats good but the movie stays boring and there are no shockeffectsthis really was the worst horror movie i have ever seen ,cruel
my take this is simply one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life i havent actually read many of the user comments but i am sure that most reinforce my own thoughts i went to see the movie because my girlfriend told me that it had something to do with tarantino its clear that this is exactly the sort of response that the marketing execs were counting on however i was aware of his previous presentations of other films thus it was with a degree of caution that i went to this one well even with low expectations i was amazed by the horrible smut that was peddled as a film it basically combines the plot of eurotrip with the content of soft core pornography and a little of the newer texas chainsaw massacre thrown in at the end for gross out effectmy advice stay away from this one it is a true waste of your time despite the deceiving previews of course some people cabin fever fans like it which is clear from its average rating on this site in fact to my surprise there was actually some applause in the theater at the end of the film mostly from horny 15 year old guys who somehow got in if you want proof that the movie polarizes its audience look at the distribution for the ratings most either love it or hate it i hate it and according to the stats there is a 175 probability that you will too keep in mind most sane people will never see this movie so that number is quite low well youve been warned,cruel
this movie was just down right terrible even if your a horror movie lover or not this movie just sucks there is nothing you get from the actorstheir performance is just dry and fake the promotion of this movie just made it seem like it was so amazing but dont let it fool you there is very smallllllllllll amount of any kinda blood and gore at all when there is some there isnt muchthe concept was cool and the locations were great for the first few minutes that is it is mainly just nudity and a fest of how to kill time before the ending it takes almost an hour before anything happens i dont mind the nudity but when i am going to a horror movie thats what im expecting a pure murder ride major let downdont let the hype trick you to thinking it was a great and gory movie i would give it a 1 but the concept was cool and nudity helps any movie,cruel
this is a terrible film the first half is hernandez and his loser friend going all over europe trying to get laid there is also a great deal of nudity in the first part of the film which has nothing the storyof which there is little the second part of the film is the part that is supposed to be completely gross but pails in comparison to either of the saw movies the ending is possibly worst part of the movie because it really doesnt end they just stop showing the movie i went to this movie the day it was released because of all the hype it was getting and i figured it was going to be about on par with saw but its not even close dont go see this in the theater dont even rent it it sucks,cruel
eli roth has turned out a refreshingly smart horror film the trite horror plot devices found in many recent horror movies are seldom included and then only has a scratch at the surface the originality of elements coupled with bonechilling influences of movies such as takashi miikes audition makes for a truly frightening filmthe most frightening elements of the film are the most mundane the horror of it all is universalthe seemingly gratuitous nudity in the beginning pays off later in the film to become painfully and brilliantly relevant the amount of gore is borderline  never excessive but vivid all the same dont expect to jump from your seat but you may find yourself at the edge of it,cruel
this movie was such a waste of my time and money i have always loved horror movies and thrillers but this was just stupid quinton terrantino is nothing more that a perverted man he has to have nudity and drugs in just about every movie he creates people can say he had nothing to do with it but he was part of the creation of this movie the first hour was nothing but nudity sex and drugs second hour was just blood this movie was absolutely horrible the worst movie i have ever seen and i mean literally dude wheres my car ranks higher on my list than i should have chosen fun with dick and jane then i would have at least gotten my moneys worth and a laugh,cruel
well i just finished watching and i gotta say wow what a disappointment the commercials claim heart attacks and another user claimed some poor guy was retching in the theater probably from food poisoning bad popcorn perhaps anyways after drudging through the first hour of topless women prancing around well the movie does actually start to get good unfortunately by that time i was so bored i just didnt care what they should have done was make it a 45 minute movie 15 min for story and the last 12 hour as for the gore well there wasnt all that much not a movie for kids mind you but when they brag about people fleeing the theater well i wanna see blood and gore not tomato soup being washed off the floors because that is about the extent of it i cant believe terintino put his name on it if you wanna see a good gore flick rent saw 2,cruel
hi i just wanted to say that this was not a good movie the nudity is as gratuitous as any freddy or jason movie while the humour is not the cheese found in those types of horror movies its only because this movie starts out like eurotrip so no one liners just one sex joke after another followed by an ass in the face then the second half being the horror film to be relived in my nightmares or not i went into this movie thinking its going to insanely violent when i would say its probably not the most violent movie i have seen now combine that with the lack of even an attempt for a interesting storyline and you find yourself going alright hit me with your best shot eli the shot in this case being a vomit inducing tortue scene which unfortunately never really came now maybe i am being harsh but i just thought it was pure trash and i was pretty well just waiting for it to end and not because i was grossed hey who the hell am i right if you see it i hope you like it,cruel
now if my repeated viewings of event horizon have taught me correctly the above statement translated from latin means save yourself from hell by hell of course i mean the horrendous experience of watching this unbelievably bad movie and by save yourself of course i mean for gods sake dont watch it one out of ten is about ten times too highdear mr roth listen keep my 9 you prick just give me back my 95 minutes my dignity and my respect for horror movies you have stolen from mei happen to believe in the theory that whenever you see someone tied to a chair in a movie you have a screenwriter that ran out of ideas following that logic this movie never had a thought in its head from the very beginning i have to admit that in the first act i was positively beaming at the screen i was so interested in where the film was going because of the sexual element and an accompanying feeling that the movie was not going to cop out and go where every other horror movie involving sex wenthad i taken two seconds to see that this movie was directed by the same jerkoff who defecated cabin fever into theaters a couple of years ago i would have known not to watch it in the first place but sadly i just checked the movie times and went out and paid 9 to be tortured through my eyes for an hour and a halfthis movie seems to have been hugely popular at the toronto international film festival i can only theorize that the people who wrote glowing reviews on the imdb are either closet sociopaths or were simply starstruck that the director was there talking about this film pretending it wasnt the revolting sludge that it isi promise you this is one of the absolute worst films of any kind that i have ever seen some americans go to amsterdam for drugs and sex as americans are wont to do like it or not and are advised to go to a certain in slovakia where beautiful women will just pounce on them they find this to be startlingly true until the girls drug them big guys come and take them down into the dungeon and strap them to chairs in separate rooms and for 25000 rich people can come in and torture and kill them in any way they can think of could it be for revenge against those dirty americans for coming into our countries and dirtying the place updirected by an american by the way of course you cant really claim that the movie is racist against americans because you can buy access to other ethnicities as well for a substantially lower price one creative individual decides to save some money and just go for a japanese girl rather than an expensive american and he proceeds to blowtorch her face until one of her eyes bulges out of its socket and hangs down on her cheek our hero has managed to escape his own torture and shoot and kill his tormentor and goes into the room and shoots the guy torturing her then displays a massive surge of brilliant intelligence by apologetically cutting off her eyeball sending white pus running down her cheek and then tries to get her out of theredo you mean to tell me that you find this trash entertaining my godwhen the movie thankfully ended i have never in my life felt the urge so strongly to find the manager and demand my money back the film is that sick and that twisted and utterly without redeeming value i am absolutely baffled at the people who praise this movie on the imdb this thing is so disgusting and so cheap and so stupid and so sick that it blows my mind that there are people who really think there is some social value to a movie that makes you wonder how you would torture someone and to make matters worse nothing is resolved at the end we are handed this cardboard resolution that solves nothing at all the fire is dimmed by dousing a flame here and there leaving the smoldering source of the torturous blaze firmly burning i dont even want to give this staggeringly pathetic mass of congealed stupidity and perversion the pleasure of a spoiler alert so ill just give you an analogy the main character paxton is a man lost in the woods when suddenly hes attacked by a bear ultimately he is faced with the possibility of picking up a gun and shooting the bear but instead decides to stomp on the bears foot and the movie ends as he runs cowering into the woodsthis film is absolute drivel of the lowest order a pitiful attempt to do something new in the horror genre by removing all elements of story character reason creativity tension depth thought and meaning and reducing itself to nothing but a lot of people strapped to chairs and being mutilated aliveif this is entertainment to you you have some real problems this movie strikes me as the kind of thing that would be enjoyed by someone who gets a real kick out of those disgusting videos that have been coming out of iraq i feel violated just because ive seen this movie,cruel
anyone who enjoys or appreciates this movie in any way should have their heads examined and fast quintin terrantino should be ashamed of himself for having anything to do with this piece of complete garbage its obvious that this movies only purpose is to continue to chip away at the amercian publics perception of torture so maybe we can acquire a taste for torture let us not forget that the men who hold the keys to the american government are in fact protorture as public policy terrantino should be feeling real shame for aiding these psychos in achieving part of their messed up agenda public torture policies read 1984 folks you can never trust a government that tortures never,cruel
after the movie ended no one clapped the only thing that happened was chants of this sucks and i want a refund the only thing eli roth accomplished was gory imagery which couldve been scary had there been some plot line to follow instead all the viewer gets is a good hour of torture depictions guaranteed to make your stomach quell for no reason seriously your money would be better spent on paying a homeless person to punch you in the stomach for the same effect dont be attracted to the lure of quentin tarantino presents even though i thought the movie hero was good this movie definitely was not unless of course your a sado masachist then feel free to waste 9 dollars,cruel
wow that was interesting i just got back from seeing that worthless piece of rotting flesh that could have been called a movie were it not a worthless piece of rotting flesh all this movie is good for is tits and gore there is an excessive amount of both actually scratch that there were more tits than gore frankly i could have used a bit more torture than they had yeah its sick to find entertainment from mindless slaughter and torture of ones fellow man but if the plot is good enough i dont care unfortunately those are rare nowadays well there were some good points to the movie i did find some satisfaction in seeing paxton slam into those fkin bitches who drugged him hooray for gta also there were some weird parts that didnt make any sense after a sicko fker burned this asian girls face her eye is hanging out so paxton cuts it out alright whatever then while they are trying to get to the train she happens to see her reflection in a mirror and decides tojump into an oncoming trainokcan i say what the fk maybe she was trying to get out of the movie that must be it you know it was just like eurotrip i swear to god if you gave every character in eurotrip a weapon you would get this movie you know what wouldve been more of a torture for those characters strapping them to a chair and making them watch the very movie they are in this movie was so bad that i had to watch pulp fiction just to get the taste of this stty movie out of my mind so anyway fk itthere are some funny points and comeback points of this movie which are quite entertaining besides being hyped as one of the greatest horrorsuspense torture movies of all times this movie is crap i knew nobody had the balls to create a movie that could cross the threshold that could actually be deemed and actually have paramedics on hand i laughed during this movie thats my 7 dollars that i will never get back,cruel
okay this movie was my favorite horror movie of 06 and the goriesteli roth is definitely one of the best new directors out there he delivers something to horror movies that i think only one person does betterand that person is wes craven roth understands what people want to see cabin fever was amazing and so was he creates gore and scarebut anyways what is 1 sentence you can say to describe about part 1 here is minethis movie is real sick and twisted in the head roth brought real horror back to this genrei know people will agree with me on this 1,cruel
i would hardly consider myself a horror addict or expert but this was a great flick it follows three backpackers who are recommended to seek a in slovakia which is renowned for its beautiful women ill say no more than the the hostek facilitates some sinister activitya criticism of this film which is perhaps wellfounded is that is paints the nation within which the lies slovakia in a bad light of course the texas chainsaw massacre doesnt make us frightened of texas but people are always scared of environments foreign to them this adds to to the tension of the film  the fact that the three guys are unfamiliar with their surroundings the tension eerily builds and the climax is gripping suspenseful and concludes in a very satisfactory mannernot for the fainthearted obviously one torture scene in particular is horrific and in fact lessened my enjoyment of the film but overall it is a wellmade tight and gripping thriller that will have you squirming and looking away at times the film also makes us feel sympathy towards the victims adding to the intensitydefinitely worth a look,cruel
grade bnot as gory as you might expect but more psychologically disturbing than anything in recent memory the first thirty or so minutes play more like a porno than a horror movie though i suppose the two could often be confused for lack of quality as three college kids pursue sex and drugs in where else but amsterdam the very idea behind is terrifying enough to keep the viewers attention once the torture begins director eli roth doesnt stop to say he creates tension is inaccurate this isnt hitchcock still roth focuses more on the anticipation of pain than in the pain itself often he shies away from showing us the torture we dont see the drill going into the flesh we dont see the ankles being slashed but we know whats happening and that is even more terrifying is still a horror movie with bad dialogue and useless characters which is why giving it a b is a little generous it gets the grade because i left the theater thinking about the images and the situation people being kidnapped on vacation to be torture subjects for those who can pay for it thats enough to keep me from backpacking europe anytime soon,cruel
this film is a must see for horror slasher movie fans but a big no no for the squeamish i have just finished watching it although the beginning was extremely slow into the story all of a sudden you get smacked in the face with action full of shock fear sickness and anxiety when i watched it i am not a squeamish person my stomach was churning for hours on end but i still wanted to watch it over and over again it puts fab reputation on the slasher board and there is humour in it too sounds sick that you laugh at a slasher horror but trust me watch it and youll see to watch this film you will need a stomach popcorn a pillowcouch friend etc to hide behind your eyes of coursefinally remember that this film has no limits whatsoever enjoy,cruel
wow a lot of people seem to either really dig this film or hate it with a passion i as a true horror fan can relate quite a tad more with the latter i could easily see and emphasize with the major problems that horror aficionados have with this film it is unoriginal and rips off so many better films it is an exercise of mtv style over substance and it is pretty unrealistic and hokey however that being said i still cant bring myself to out and out loathe this picture as it does have bits and pieces to redeem it somewhat even if said pieces were smaller than the great takashi miikes two lines in the film and trust me if you were among the people that recognized his cameo at first sight than you know this movie wasnt nearly as graphic or disturbing as way too many people seem to tout it as being also as an aside the children were a major downfall of the film as much as to be laughable but i did enjoy the movie somewhat if only because of the enjoyment of the people i watched it with one of which brought the movie over so i didnt have to pay a dime to see it plus the nudity was qualitymy grade c right on the border of a d though,cruel
ive seen this movie and expected  after cabin fever  at least some excitement however unless you are in the middle of puberty and a fan of male friendship connected with stupid dialogues and the wish to be fooled by unreal scenarios with naked beauties around you youll be terribly terribly disappointed what a waste of time three young americans are on a trip through europe and follow some strangers advice to go to slowakia because in some obscure they love americans  which means youll get laid by awesome girls rubbish bloody rubbish then people start disappearing good and clever idea to take unknown pills that unknown and of course stunningly beautiful chicks pop into your mouth and it all turns into some even more unrealistic plot whereby tourists pay money to torturekill other tourists those who disappear what a surprise have i already mentioned the ridiculous dialogues jeezus i wasted nearly 2 hours of my life with this rubbish movie however youve been warned now but if you still consider watching it ill be a good person and spoil it by telling the end only one of them survives the least likable one the asian girl jumps in front of a train after seeing her reflection with one eye missing and one of the bad men i always wanted to be a surgeon gets the proper punishment  the best and probably only ok scene in this whole fiasco that dares to call itself movie again what a pile of bloody rubbish,cruel
if you want to be moved by a compelling story line and see a movie with a real premise dont watch this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life if you want to see boobs watch softcore porn and if you want that much blood and guts go to war movies that are this bad make me loose hope in humanity this was such a waste of  i would have rather watched tibo it has a better story line there was a chase seen where people get hit by a car dont for get about the time that you watched a black and decker power drill go through some ones chest which was not senseless it pushed the story line along very well1 half of star out of 5,cruel
this movie starts out with an obscene amount of ta that it should almost receive an x rating scene after scene of nude european females for the first 30 minutes the movie then become sick grotesque twisted demented and revolting awesome this movie is a blast from the past with new heights achieved unique storyline great cinematography gore beyond belief the way you feel in the beginning of the movie gets completely twisted around im one of those people that say i dont get scared by horrors this was a movie that at times made me squint and fight from turning my head to give you an idea two people who watched this movie at torontos film festival had been called ambulances from sickness from watching this film  okay okay so the story isnt very deep its a horror and it succeeds in its category this is definitely one to see on the big screen while you can,cruel
im not sure which question perplexes me more 1 why would anybody make movies like this or 2 why would anybody want to see crap like this horror and thriller movies can be very very effective without such over the top extreme excessive sadism torture and gore tarantino is a onetrick pony  only going for shock value in his movies that have no other redeeming qualities whatsoever please tell me whats actually good about his films i really wonder what goes through the guys mind when is in the creative process lets see the goal of this movie will be to get people to barf while theyre sitting in the theater brilliantwhats the point quentin tarantino is a useless filmmaker,cruel
this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen i went into the cinema with an open mind knowing nothing about this film except its endorsed by tarentino wow was that a mistake not only is this film so devoid of storyline that i was left feeling i had wasted my afternoon but it was also cheap beyond belief for a hollywood production i have to ask was this a scam taken from the play the producers get loads of studio cash make a really cheap film no name actors on sets that comprise of no more than 23rooms get a big name endorsement from tarentino make a few million in the box office from poor fools like myself and then pretend it never happenedthe only money spent on this film was in advertising and is purely a corporate cash cow that will come back and bite some studio sony own it no wonder they are struggling in the market with this crapcheap actors cheap sets cheap effectsmakeup softcore porn plenty of violence zero storyline worst film i ever saw and one very rich eli roth ive seen porno with better production values than this film,cruel
this movie was terrible im so sorry but i cant stand movies that everyone say are the most terrifying movie ever and when you sit down to watch theres an hour worth of boobs and 20 minutes of horrorgore ugh terrible this movie was terrible im so sorry but i cant stand movies that everyone say are the most terrifying movie ever and when you sit down to watch theres an hour worth of boobs and 20 minutes of horrorgore ugh terrible this movie was terrible im so sorry but i cant stand movies that everyone say are the most terrifying movie ever and when you sit down to watch theres an hour worth of boobs and 20 minutes of horrorgore ugh terrible,cruel
after enduring it finally became clear to me why some people slow down to get a good view of a bloody auto accident if one is honest in their thinking is just another slasher film with better gore effects which keeps those entranced with such effects happy and as always in slasher films the story is very lame to say the least but then again they have to be because to do otherwise might require the viewer to actually think to be classified as a horror film is not and to those that dont understand or may resent what im saying here go find beg or borrow a copy of john frankenheimers seconds and let your imagination do the rest,cruel
this film is the definition of exploitation that is to say it depicts torture and sadism simply for its own sake with no underlying comment or meaning or as people like to say no redeeming social value this is the complete opposite of say american psycho which depicts these things yet at the same time is clearly a satire of our culture and lecture condemning violence it is astonishing how many unique intelligent scripts cant even get a greenlight yet someone actually handed this director several million dollars to make this fetish film see it if you like movies with nothing to say to you except perhaps to reiterate your assertion that quentin tarantino is as vapid a producer as he is a director,cruel
before i start writing a long comment about how hot jay hernandez is and how awesome his character was in this movie i have to say that the making of was a job welldone first of all it is very unpredictable this is a quality were losing during an era of frequent remakes it is nice to watch a movie these days and not know how it is going to end until the actual end when hernandezs character escaped from where he is staying in the slovakian city i figuredhey thats great but hell either die in the end or the evil characters will win this is usually what happens in most horror movies and while a lot of people like that it gets to be quite an overused approach the one part of the movie that did not prove unpredictable was when the japanese girl committed suicide after viewing her deformity i really did see that one cominganother great thing about this movie is that it is somehow able to mix humor with thrilling and gory scenes most intense thrillers do not have truly funny moments that leave you to bust out laughing but this movie had moments to be scared moments to laugh as well as moments to clap for those of you who have not yet seen the movie i will tell you that the whole ending portion is truly different from anything you have ever seen in a thrillerhorror movie before but do not be discouraged change is good and it proves to be refreshing in this movie the acting is great too when the backpacker friends are scared they dont give us this special thought out reaction they just give us a realistic portrayal of fear one panics and begs for mercy which is probably what i would do and the other shows fear but also tries to use whatever strength he can muster from his brain to develop his strategy for escape that would be jay i will not reveal anymore about this movie but i will say that you just have to see what hernandez does at the end it will truly serve as a surprise,cruel
i think this movie sucked the first hour and 12 is nothing but the three main guys going through europe doing drugs and having sex with as many women as possible the acting wasnt that great     and i was expecting this movie to scare the hell out of meit did not   just made me want my 800 back and i realized this was an hour and 12 of my life ill never get back i advise people not to go see this movie  i was disappointed and so was the group of friends that i went withwe were also expecting it to mostly be more of a torture movie  seriously maybe 20 minutes is torture  literally  and the other is the one survivor and some girl trying to get out of the city sucked,cruel
when i walked out of the theater i hated this movie i felt it was just something meant to make the audience squirm much like saw later on though i realized some things about the movie that were greatfirst everything is told from the characters views they dont bs the audience they dont reveal anything unless one of the main characters witness it first hand i felt this added a lot to the story tellingsecond they played on clichs even mirroring some scenes like eurotrip guy getting felt up in the train in this case spoilerthe character josh who is setup according to clichs wont screw around because he is lamenting his last girlfriend sweet next door innocent type etc is not the survivor i felt this butcher of his character led a lot of rage to the movie as his character was endeared to the audience this helped with the vengeance scene at the end everyone laughed with glee as pax ran down 3 characters and bribed the kids to kill thats how i took it the thugs of the hunting group another shocking scene of brutality that the audience agrees with then the bathroom scene though extremely violent by a lot of measures again this the audiences vibe was fori dont think i will bother watching this movie again but because of how it was told as opposed to the surreal content i would name it a film instead of a flick,cruel
this is easily the worst horror movie i have seen since roths other excuse for art cabin fever eli roth in much like in cabin fever uses excessive violence to cover the fact that this movie lacks a point direction or conclusion this movie is nothing more than an excuse for eli roth to construct a film that people will hail as the goriest of all time what is the issue that this films represents none is this film making a statement of any kind no one cannot tell if the point of the film was to glorify torture or deconstruct it beyond the fact that this film only appeals to the most brutish among us the characters were horribly stupid the character played by jay hernandez paxton is a retard why would anyone go to eastern europe in the first place just to meet girls that almost makes sense then there is the part in the movie were he is convinced that an art show is taking place within a dilapidated building surrounded by guards with guns that makes sense i can see how anyone would come to a logical conclusion like that also these characters must have an enormously high threshold for pain because not one passes out from the pain or shock of being tortured not even the asian girl getting her face blow torched in conclusion the best part of this movie was when the asian girl jumped in front of the train because it best displayed my general feelings at the time nothing is worth seeing this movie again,cruel
poor bratislava and slovakia talk about a place getting bad treatment from the movie industry first it gets armpit of the world treatment in eurotrip then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in i saw on impulse seeing tarentinos name after the film title on the theaters list of showtimes without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of eli roth who apparently intended it as a homage to takashi miikes audition it is an improvement on roths boring first movie cabin fever although neither movie roths stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film is even remotely scary at least with roth keeps his tendency toward evil dead silliness in check until the last few minutesanyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of eurotrips amsterdam and train travel scenes including the funny pervert in the train compartment i found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with michelle trachtenberg this wish intensified during the sauna scene in the where the only exploitation elements were a skanky russian blonde and her fat sluglike friend the movie would certainly have benefited visually from trachtenbergs presence or even from the cabin fever brunette despite her nonexistent acting skills she at least looked good heck by this time i would have even settled for jay hernandez hooking up with his hang time girlfriend amber barrettoanyway the three guys arrive in bratislava and roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill watch 2002s my little eye if you think roth might actually be doing something original at this point the thing starts to look a lot more like toolbox murders or the driller killer than audition and i began to yearn for an appearance by angela bettis but instead roth gives us a confused asian girl who cant speak english very wellfortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured but there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultraviolence once the tables are turned and the audience a excuse to mildly cheer every silly development from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires there was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some bbq down the streetto make matters worse for the slovakia ministry of tourism the one thing roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of americans in foreign countries these days given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that american victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium there are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitorss wide theatrical release and 18 million marketing campaign verses just 4 million production cost pay homage to pt barnums comment no one every went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people there is little danger that roth will ever be mistaken for david cronenberg save your money for the saw ii dvdthen again what do i know im only a child,cruel
the only reason i didnt walk our was because my wife and i were another couple apparently they wanted to as wellbefore i go into a rant about why this movie was such a let down let me let tell you a little about the perspective this is coming from i am 32 and a huge fan of horror films im such a fan that for a few years i spent time as a special effects makeup artist and worked on a few major films i like everything from the classics horror films like nosferatu to seventies films last house on the left and the exorcist eighties flicks hellraiser and had a good laugh with texas chainsaw massacre 2 and now and again theres been films since then that i have enjoyedso why would i hate this movie so much simple there was nothing to it it was two hours of soft porn and shock scenes the plot if you will call it that was summed up in the first 15 minutes of the film honestly this film could have easily just cut out the cheap dialogs and released it as a part of faces of death and shown the sex clips as a collage on cinemaxwho was this movie made for as a horror fan and i love a good shock and stomach a lot of gore in a film but it just became pointless violence i estimate that things didnt start moving in the movie until almost 50 minutes after its start i say if you want the gore go watch faces of death if you want to see soft porn watch cinemax but dont try to splice the two together and call it a movie,cruel
when you watch this film the first question that comes to mind is why why watch this film if you want to watch it like a normal hollywood film you wont stomach the film to the self righteous endhowever if you watch this film as a student of the arts and recognize that this film is a tribute to the cinema of torture youll be thrilled chilled and most likely satisfied maybe even pleasantly surprisedbut if you want to watch this film for sheer entertainment and you were not involved in the making or producing this film you belong in a nuthousethe story is about two backpackers who the third one is met on the way while backpacking through europe are invited to an out of the ordinary that is filled with horny girls who desperately want sex with american men sounds great right of course happiness and good times are short lived for old paxton and josh because they become victims of a sick twisted and depraved individual who gets his rocks off by brutally torturing peoplethis film is very dark sick disgusting often at times vomit inducing and takes human depravity to an entirely different level the violence and blood in this film is off the charts a portion of the audience walked out midway through the screening all in all is not for the faint of heartwhile the ending was good it could have been so much better why after sitting through all that garbage and sickness the ending didnt do enough justice to all that we as an audience went through sorry it could have been so much bettermy rating is for all you cats who think this film is the best ever made and gave it anything more than 2 starsi will conclude by saying that if you watch this film you are just as guilty and no different than those rich people in the film who pay to see young lads brutally tortured pass on this film youre not missing anything,cruel
having just seen as the last film shown at the toronto film festival i was so impressed roth has honed his skill as a writer and director giving us not only a huge leap over cabin fever no mean feat in itself but also a grand contribution to the subgenre of revenge films yes the horror in the film is mundane that is not fantasy but the measure of revenge scenes in the film is just perfect yes the film is very violent and graphic but for those of us who find a sublime beauty in that will reward you in spades eli i hope you remember me from the above statement and tagging cb as a horror movie in reverse back a few tiffs ago i am anxiously awaiting your next film already everyone else check into the ,cruel
bar none the worst movie i have ever seen i was actually mad when i left because this movie is such a disaster before this flop the worst movie id seen was cabin fever but i fell for that gay add quitin tarantino presents well he has just ruined his rep with me for having any affiliation with this junk i mean come on there is absolutely no plot nothing is explained all you do is sit and watch some bad porn for a half hour then watch some guys get tortured for the next hour and a half how could anyone make this movie and think they have created something good 5 mins into the movie i thought what is this the movie or an add before i went in the theater they had to clean up puke that was kindly left by previous viewers and get this during my viewing some poor guy had a panic attack and 911 had to be dialed i cant believe anyone would see this movie if they had any clue what it was about,cruel
i cant believe the amount of positive feedback this boring little yawn is getting it amazes me that people think this is extreme or depraved or graphic or twisted the first half plays like a toned down american pie movie and then the rest consists of people looking for their friends giving gum to dirty street children looking for their friends again giving more gum to dirty street children then being subjected to unimaginative and laughable attempts at extreme and hardcore torture yes cringe as someone gets a drill in the leg gasp as fingers fall off scream in terror as a neck is cut sure in real life this would be terrible but in cinema in a movie backed by tarantino and miike and peter jackson its just pathetic if this is as sick as mr roth can get then he needs to start stealing from some other movies i almost wonder if miike cameoed in this flick just to make fun of poor little roth and his sad attempts at being wild though i suppose one could say that is kind of cute for trying so hard to rip off better movies like a child imitating jack the ripper this had the potential for greatness but in the hands of eli roth and his inability to be creative in any possible way its just a dumb waste of time,cruel
a few weeks agoi rented from the local quick shop for 99 cents on a drunken saturday afternoon the girl at the counter said she and her boyfriend saw it and it made her sick to her stomach i told her now i definitely have to see it i got home and put it in the vcrthats why the rental was so cheapand sat down and started on my second twelve packi loved this movie from the first scene especially the part when the dude across the room was choking on the bong hit in the coppenhagen hash house i immediately said to myself thats me this movie was made for me anyway at this point i dont want to give away anything as far as plot and or the deeper meanings that this film reveals to those who are really watchingi have since purchased the tape and have watched it at least 25 times and each time i learn something new about this film as well as myselfis a true revelation,cruel
im not going to comment on the plausibility of elements of s plot which doesnt really interest me whats important here is that eli roth has made a horror movie that represents a significant step up in style and horror storytelling from the merely okay cabin fever a horror movie that even harks back to the days when quality horror movies were made by auteurs such as john carpenter and david cronenberg intelligent upandcoming filmmakers with talent style and vision to burnin these days when the horror genre consists of pretty much nothing but lame sequels and even lamer remakes that rarely even achieve basic watchability its almost a relief to see a movie like again not because of its unrestrained violence but first and foremost because it looks and plays throughout like a real movie with actual characters interesting and varied settings genuine atmosphere steadily mounting tension and an increasingly sinister and threatening sense of mystery compare this movie to the hypedup video game commercials goofy concept garbage like those awful saw movies and soulless spazzy remakes that the studios have been vomiting forth to capture the horror market in the past few years and almost looks like a hitchcockian masterpiece in comparison of course in reality and by any earlier standard of competent filmmaking its not quite that good but its good enough,cruel
well i should start by saying that eli roth is an interesting person he i believe helped to write movies like citizen toxie and terror firmer for troma and directed cabin fever which wasnt a bad movie but could have been a lot more on the other hand is a sick movie with some good old fashioned special effectsthe two stars of the movie and a swedish guy go off to amersterdam to really party it out and get laid when they check into a certain their swedish friend disappears mysteriously then one of the other stars disappears leaving only one to search for his friends leading him into a sick world of murder for profitthe first 40 minutes of the movie just sucked i hated the main characters and didnt really care about what happened to them i hate sex craved characters in movies the last 50 minutes of the movie is quite good and can be extremely disturbing the special effects were great in the movie and very old fashioned in the sense that it reminds you of something you may have seen in the 80s no cgi here my friends the intensity is spectacular and i actually found myself really hoping that the main lead character made it out alive no one deserves to get killed like this except for the people committing these atrocitiesi would say if you are looking for something sick step right in if you are looking for something with story this is not your movie 810,cruel
dont believe the panic around here this is a very well made movie about psychopaths and their goings honestly what have you expected a main stream hollywood flick this movie is not hollywood mr tarantino was s long time in japan and he had the chance to learn  from takashi miike who participated on this film i assume all the panic makers here have not seen one movie from miike so could it be that most of the viewers dont understand that this work is a different horror movie if you are expecting an evil dead one movie go ahead and rent evil dead or other similar horror movies mr tarantinos work looks for me like a miike onehey and no one will blame slovakia for the contents we are not stupid boys that cant see the difference between a film and realityi am sorry for my simple english too i wrote a comment for the first time here,cruel
i have been through a year of constant torture scenes saw 1 and 2 wolf creek house of wax yet these scenes failed to shock me as i was used to this kind of stuff after spending a year watching crummy horrors like jason x and alien vs predator yet once i heard about i decided to see it i couldnt as it received an r rating or nc17 for the americans reading i was furious when the ushers refused to grant me entry thinking that the high level violence that i couldve been witnessing at that very moment couldnt possibly be as bad as the ratings say i was proved wrong when i witnessed the violence on dvd for the first time in 45 years i have been truly shocked and scared of a modern horror eli roth deserves to be recognized for this bundle of porn blood and power drills his previous movie cabin fever was in my words fantastic but this movie tops it by far nothing beats watching some clot chained to a chair with a chainsaw inches away from his face the minor cutbacks however are the stereotypical americans in amsterdam but that doesnt matter when they look like calvin klein models one minute and diced ham the next i cannot wait to see roths next movie and i wont care for the rating even if im underage,cruel
this is an insinuatingly effective horror whose premise quietly creeps up you and really hits you after seeing it it is gory but unlike films like hellraiser or the innumerable holloween and friday 13th films it doesnt veer off into the supernatural and unrealistic gore the idea that wealthy sadists pay enormous amounts of money to practice freely their sickest fantasies in countries in this case in eastern europe poor and desperate enough to accept such money and turn a blind eye to what happens to the victims of these people isnt as off the wall as people would like to believe with real life horrors like darfur bosnia cambodia the holocaust is it so implausible that such a torture pit as shown in this film could exist unfortunately i dont think so,cruel
ive seen a lot of movies and even a lot of socalled sick movies but this one was frightening gruesome ugly realistic stylistic but at the same time funny entertaining unpredictable and i dont know the word for to think about it was like a rollercoasterride of perversions and i dont mention the as you americans would call it porn sequences which we old europeans would call evening commercials this is imo very realistic if you would live under poor circumstances you would deliver your guest to the butcher for 10000  and if youre a sadistic psycho and got the cash youd get a victim for 25000 dollar wouldnt you  i dont think it would be in the news for more then 5 minutes,cruel
it is not hard to find words for this is the worst film i have ever seen in my whole life no characters and very artificial dialogues a not existing story with a lot of mistakes just to keep the dilemma running the screen layout is always the same and absolutely boring quite the half of the audience left the theater before the end of this movie was there if you watch the credits you can find names like quentin tarantino and peter jackson i cant imagine why they give their good names for a movie like this this film is just blood and gore it shows things you dont have to show to tell what is happening and if this is the only unique selling point  good bye eli roth,cruel
im going to make this quick dont believe s hype this film will bore you to tears long before it might manage to get a scream the first half of the film is eurotrip without the funny or even the good then it turns into a dull surprisingly violencelight thriller the film only had about three moments in which i was entertained at most a rental if you do a lot of fast forwarding my girlfriend actually fell asleep during this movie this movie is all sorts of predictable uninspired and dull if you want to be shocked or disturbed stay in and watch an episode of csi or svu or something look elsewhere this film wont do it for you,cruel
ive just watched this movie on dvd what a waste of space seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen it makes the last george romero flick look like citizen kane its completely lacking in tension or mood isnt this meant to be a horror movie is fake blood and by the numbers gore meant to be frightening alone this is desperate film making as if the director was clueless how to scare the audience i guess some people might get a very slight kick out of some of the subteen movie sex scenes quentin tarantino presents the poster says well quentin you buy every copy back and personally cut his name off this save your money and go backpacking in europe,cruel
is a film that you will always remember no matter what viewers say a bout it the film is original and it is smart creative and passionate some people might say it is just another gory flick but it is really a deep reflection of humanity everybody has evil in them brings out that evil and displays if for the public it is a film that shows how truly sickening our race can be and how truly just we can be it shows us that the world is not a safe place yet there is something we can do about it the film is realistic smart and truthful they would not just make this stuff up and say it was real if i thought of this idea on my own i would take all the credit for it this film is a great film to learn from and to be psychologically scared by,cruel
what i experienced was pure evil there are three backpackers who want to live their sexual dreams in different places of the world in the movie the movie has actually two definite parts first one is the erotic part which is a very successful transition part before the gore beginsalthough it lasts a little long and when these young people move away from amsterdam darkness starts to fall upon them and you can sense the evil atmosphere of the new country they have arrived although their sexual dreams come true before it all starts this movie shockingly demonstrates how human beings could possibly get lost in their darkest dreams both victims and psychopaths elite hunting phrase shows how the sickest and animalistic things could make sense in a modern manner but i think theres a little defect in the scenario about circumstances in which the slaughterhouse and this secret community makes this mess work through all the security powers in the country although in movies like that it is impossible not to find something missing or not clearly clarified its not an adventure or an action movie which we wait for all the things to settle of course in every movie events should unfold but in some movies like sense of terror dominates peoples mind by using realistic fears in scary and dark settings which are unrealistic in a way one other thing in the movie tells us that terror and brutality dont only stay in the borders of the unrealistic slaughterhouses brutality is also possessed by children living in the streets and image of gore is also related with these little people not everyone could watch and like this movie honestly welcome to the darkest dream of humanity,cruel
i have seen every horror movie there is and nothing has ever really scared me at least not in a bad way frailty wrong turn cabin fever and saw did come close though but nothing could have prepared me for i rated it a 10 because it did its job however it was not enjoyable to me at all i am not a squeamish person in the least but the gore and violence in this movie were almost too much to bear way worse than kill bill with people vomiting all over themselves in fear and crying rather than just screaming it seemed more real that any other horror movie ive seen the only thing that could be more horrifying in my opinion would be watching live footage of people being tortured and killed in concentration camps the eyeless asian girl throwing herself in front of the train will haunt me for i dont know how long i felt sick to my stomach after it was over and even cried that has never ever happened to me before i guess i am human after all,cruel
im sorry this is probably the worst movie you could ever imagine unless youre the type who loves to just see torture if youre looking for a horror flick i suggest you see house of wax or something more in the genrelets start off with the plot hmm well first off the first half of the women is all about sex drugs and clubs which as a teen i can relate to the second half of the movie is basically like watching something totally different and doesnt share any of the same qualities of the first half the second half is almost disturbing while the first half is definitely enjoyablethe reason i bothered watching this movie is because quentin tarantino had the courage to put his name on it hoping to promote it i just have one thing to say to that shame on you qt you are ruining your good name this movie lacks motive plot has horrible acting as you can see almost every member of the class had never acted before the sound was absolutely horrible it was like watching a typical 90s horror film except they replaced the jump atya scary parts with horrible images which arent even worth addingall in all id suggest sticking with the saw series if youre into this kind of movie this movie will leave you puzzled and with lots of questions in most cases thats a sign of a good movie dont be fooled its just really that bad of a movie no offense to eli roth i know he can do better,cruel
great horror at its core has always been a mirror of the societal values during the time frame in which it was created what scares us as a collective whole those films that tap into that phenomenon have always been the most successful and the most memorable while not the only interpretations frankenstein can be seen as a warning of technology and science gone awry invasion of the body snatchers is a clear allegory to fear of communism godzilla teaches us to be wary of nuclear experimentation texas chainsaw massacre can be seen as a flower child awakening in a postvietnam us even the slasher flicks of the 80s are modernday fairy tales exaggerating the dangers of sexual experimentation in a time of stds and aids what we have not seen as of yet is a reflection of our society in a post 911 world one where the terror is in not knowing where the terror may be and one of ourselves being the monster the aggressor and the hated may be the first to point in that directionbegins almost as a lighthearted albeit xrated sister film to 2004s eurotrip we begin as our heroes arrive in amsterdam looking for ganja and sex not necessarily in that order paxton the alpha male and josh the sensitive one think favreaus character in swingers during their backpacking trip have picked up oli a doanythinganyone icelander who comes along for the ride  so to speak the trio jumps from dance club to hash bar to red light district leaving no pot unsmoked and no whore untapped when they arrive at their after curfew they are saved by a stranger who guides them to eastern europe with the promises of women who are as easy as they are beautiful then things as they say turn southfor the first 45 minutes revels in its cinemax after dark qualities tanned breasts trimmed pubic regions and voluptuous rearends are all on display in various states of coitus however as the groups travels to bratislava they begin to encounter the creepiness and perversion that only a piece of the defunct soviet empire can provide one by one our protagonists begin to disappear after being lured away from the group by a nubile young topless women as they soon learn they have been duped they find themselves on the bad end of a scheme that offers up live subjects that for a price can be tortured and killed in any manner in which your sick heart can dreamutilizing my sat skills  what the first 45 minutes are to breasts the remaining 50 are to blood and gore includes but is not limited to human drilling achilles slicing unpleasant eyeball removal chainsaw induced leg removal and a savage beating resulting in a cavedin skullwhile may not ever be shown in moma it does present an interesting portrayal of american attitudes of ourselves and those from the outside our backpackers are the ugliest of the ugly americans young and wealthy and with no concern for the consequences of their actions they drink and fornicate their way across europe and are despised by everyone outside of the young women who are impressed with foreign accents americans bring the highest price of all of the people you can torture for a price lastly when the film turns toward revenge the infliction of pain and torture to those that had hurt the americans is just as violent and is handed out with an ask no questions kill em all mentalityis fine art probably not is great horror it is close the problem with is that is never really presents itself as scary by the time the main characters get to the place of torture the audience has been numbed by endless sex scenes and unlike those being tortured we all know where they are going to end up basically outside of inventive ways to mutilate offers nothing of a surprise and thus offers very little in the ways of scares unless of course you are planning a trip to europe anytime soon what we are left with are the elements of great horror the reckless bravado the moral depravity buckets of blood and the promise of an even gorier sequelis 95 minutes long and stars the linebacker from friday night lights and the guy who played young jeff daniels in dderer it is rated r for countless breasts a single beaver and many many other body parts that were not connected to other body parts mandrake grade b,cruel
before seeing this movie in theaters i had looked for it on a few internet forums and herd it was going to be very sickeningly gory being a splatter fan i was interested after seeing the movie i was really impressed with the quality of work that had gone into making the movie as a whole not just the special effects there is a lot of very good character development so you really feel for them when things start to go bada word to the wise i have a very strong stomach for gore and i found this movie quite intense you see all of the torture no cuts very little movie magic not for the squeamishi truly enjoyed this movie and fully endorse anyone who is a fan of eli roths work to go see this he has really outdone himself this time,cruel
i myself am not a big fan of scary movies but i enjoyed this movie for the most part i have not seen the chainsaw massacre or any movies of that sortbut i liked the way they worked the first half porno into the movie plot i liked the way the torture was in your face and the actual showing of whats happening i think the scariest part was when paxtons phone gets stolen and it makes you jump darn those kids i also liked how roth worked humor into the movie as well with the king of swing and how you know what is going to happen because you can see it and then others get the crap scared out of them like in the torture museum all in all i changed my whole idea of backpacking through europe and now plan on renting a car and actually staying and nice expensive hotels,cruel
very very gruesome indeed but almost constant tits throughout the entire movie defitnitley not for the faint of heart like other tarrantino films namely reservoir dogs it takes sort of random directions of its own but done in a way that you dont leave the movie dissatisfied these were all reactions during the movie cheering and whistling applause cheering whistling and applause disgust laughter dead seriousnessanticipation at the end of the movie you dont really feel like you just saw a horror film of a type not often seen these days spoiler for example when pax has to cut kanas probably misspelled eye off you dont expect yellowish stuff to leak fluidly out of it also the way when pax runs over the 2 girls and the lipguy you dont expect him to run the surviving girl over again the camera work is done beautifully that way the only real disappointment i had in the entire movie was when pax holds the good doctors head in the toilet cuts his throat and throws his head back into the toilet he never flushes it,cruel
by far the most disturbing and graphic of any film ive ever seen wonderful the guy that wrote the other comment has absolutely no idea what he is talking aboutive seen a ton of horrorgore movies but this is by far the most shocking im not exactly sure how this didnt get a nc17 or even an x rating trying to compare this movie to army of darkness is he kidding not even in the same league both absolutely great movies but totally differentas with all movies i recommend disregarding what critics say and see it for yourself in my opinion go see it be sure to bring a strong stomach or a vomit bag,cruel
this really isnt your typical horror movie where some crazy maniac chases you with a axe or chainsaw it isnt a movie where some stupid little dollmunchkinmythical creature or space alien chasesshootseats or threatens to destroy youover the years those movies have become general and run of the mill what this movie is is a disturbing unnerving psychological thriller that as you watch it it feeds off the real fears and horrors of the real worlda horror that can actually happen to youwhen you watch a slasher movieyou already know that its fake and a story made up for hollywoodbut as this movie shows an ordinary average college aged person much like you and i can indeed fall victim to this type of scenario and in fact is possible in todays greedy money hungry world where if you have enough cash you can pretty much do anything you please,cruel
first time reviewer  i just had to warn people about this complete load of trashit is hard to think of any redeeming qualities of the film i suppose the bit of gore towards the end the idea was quite a chilling one and writtendirectedacted properly this probably could have been made into an ok filmi should have known better when i realised it was from the creator of cabin fever as much as i disliked that film this one is even worsethe characters well i was just wishing they would all get killed if only to end the movie sooner not since the 80s have there been a bunch of protagonists who the planet would be better off without unfortunately one survivedthe last 20 minutes or so where something actually starts happening in the film are not enough to make up for the first hour of breasts idiocy and generally poor filmmakingavoid it at all costs or if you really do want to see it wait until you can see it for free,cruel
this is the most overhyped movie of 2005 it was boring for the first 45 minutes and then turns to complete exploitive torture gore sure its gross but that isnt scary gross is gross this movie is stupid disgusting and a waste of time its all t  a no plot no point no direction no good characterswhat else can i say its just trying to be saw or texes chainsaw massacre by borrowing their gross out elements forgetting a decent plot or good direction make a difference between a great horror film or a piece of crap wanna be this is a waste of time and a huge disappointment well youve been warned all i can say is we hated it,cruel
okay someone bashed me for my comments on ill picture it vice versa so that i put you into my position and you can see from my point of view this is how the would look like from the opposite point of viewimagine you go to the movies  you want to see a really scary horror movie now the movie youve heard of  it is supposed to be cool is about europeans coming to the usa imagine you watch the movie you see two young characters from paris or london they are obviously modern guys living in 21st century they have cellphones and internet clearly its the world today they set off to canada by plane they meet a third guy lets say hes european too they smoke pot and have sex with some girls imagine you see them travel by steam train to new york city after they arrive in big apple you dont get to see statue of liberty you do not even see empire state building anywhere no brooklyn bridge either the river hudson is a small brook all you can really see are 10  floor buildings no skyscrapers no highlights no highways no junctions in a hotelyou see these european trio hook up with pretty ladies they meet two asian girls as well but they dont like them however you are forced to notice that they have tvset with no remote in there and the actors on tv speak british whats more all new yorkers speak british then the three main characters go to a disco you can hear elvis presleys songs only in the disco you may even catch a bit from beach boys the byrds the who troggs on the walls you see posters from casablanca gone with the wind or elvis movies after the disco you can see 10yearold black indian and white kids begging in the streets of new yor city or even stoning people to death then you watch the european trio end up on manhattan  here they find a house in which they are tortured for money and pleasure the sexy ladies torture them too here come scenes exactly like in the actual eli roths for some it is scary someone calls it disgusting sadistic still its a horror scene so lets suppose you are quite satisfied after the torture and murders one survivor and one asian girl escape they dont call police for help they escape riding a 50 years old ford anglia they just happen to run into the sadistic ladies who tormented them before and run them over with the oldfashioned automobileon their escape they ride through an old westernlike road they never see any highway and run into a police officer who looks rather like a sheriff they see him beat up some whitehaired man for no apparent reason there are 20years old automobiles all around therefore they run past the police secretly and get to new york city steamtrain station the asian girl sees her oneeyed tortured self in a mirrorlike wall and therefore commits suicide the european survivor sets off on the steam train away from new york city meets the last villain on the train he catches up with him in canada gets to him in the toilets and does his revenge end of movie now seriously would americans call a movie like this a very good professional horror ps and i am not against eli roth i would be mad at anyone who lies about my country no matter whether its roth or mother teresa,cruel
my wife and i usually like tarantinos films my question to the makers of this film is why why did you waste all that talent why did you squander all the financial resources why was there so much pointless violence why is there no discernible plot why would any collegeeducated young men behave so foolishly we left the theatre about halfway through we could not even stay to see if anything would make sense do you know what we mean it is like watching some stupid b movie at two am and you just have to watch the rest of it to see if the movie redeems itself or if it becomes more stupid please do not waste your time or money on this film i would like to become jay hernandezs adviser he should fire is current adviser for this film will not aid his career jay has the makings of a fine actor,cruel
the director shows his ignorance putting down other countries with cheap horror stories too brutal too cruel was a torture to watch it and besides with nothing to learn or get a good thought please get out of the business and read a bit travel too what i learned is how twisted his brain is and youre showing the world that we americans travel only looking for drugs and prostitution like if we were not interested in other things like culture art or any other beautiful things that the old world offers us to see you sell the world the idea that this young generation is full of ignorance and their tendency to be drug addicts,cruel
look i realize cabin fever was an atrocious movie at best but that should not be grounds for saying that was a great movie true eli roth improved the plot of the move if you compare it to cabin fever but dumb and dumberer had a more interesting plot than cabin fever did in other words it didnt take much to improve over the garbage we know today as cabin fever has very little plot and if anyone here is saying the ending is unpredictable and exciting then they werent paying attention i can honestly say this is one of the single worst movies i have ever paid to see i usually respect the imdb reviewers but this time they were far from right the murders in this movie were pointless and the senseless gore did nothing to improve the interest of the movie at the same time the movie did not scare anyone and it was not as gory as any of the saw franchise movies have been the twists were not there and any movie that revolves around guys trying to get as in other countries should be stopped on the press before it can be viewed by anyone else it is sad that movies as badly as this one can be viewed as a success that really shows the difference between people in the world and how we perceive movies i just dont see anyway to think of this movie as a success it stunk and will always be complete garbage in my mind,cruel
i went to this movie expecting to see a horror yes the movie did contain some horrific moments unfortunately those moments where because of gore and torture this movie was more of a soft porn and started way to slow for a horror movie nothing like what was expected to see from the advertisements shown the rated r rating did not come from the horror expected from this movie the rating should have been xxx for nudity and swearing maybe the writers directors and producers will get the horror title correct the next time when i go to see a horror movie i expect to be scared i expect to be jumped i expect to have an adrenaline rush when i go to a horror movie i expect the plot of the story to make me feel for the characters i expect the movie to make me feel like i am the character i expect much more than i got from this movie for the first hour and 15 minutes i should have taken a nap at least then by the time i woke up i could have had the feelings i expected,cruel
and to think i thought that cabin fever was a piece of garbage was worse in fact ill list it as one of the worst horror films ive ever seen the story stunk the characters were unlikable boors  the typical ugly americans in fact the only one who i even liked was oly the brutality in it was a descendant of the crummy and overrated last house on the left and unfortunately since quentin tarantino obviously no judge of talent is roths mentor im sure that more garbage will be coming from this director amazing that with all the great novels out there waiting to be adapted crap like this gets the money to be made simply amazing ill put this in the saw category of too dumb to ever see again id say more but that would lead to spoilers and i wouldnt want to do that to someone who might actually want to see this crapfest want to see a good or great horror film skip this one,cruel
this is sick fare for the very sick and it doesnt matter whether youre a citizen of the usa or the eu or elsewhere it is an awful waste of film time talent and energy in an effort to entertain the sick fancies of demented minds covering it over with the cloak of art does not make it any better nor does it make it truly art whenever human beings are made the objects of torture and there is already enough in the news for those who choose to see it in the real world there is a definite diminishing of humanity this film does nothing more than contribute to the obscuring of whatever is best in humanity and civilization i recommend it to the dumpster where it belongs,cruel
2 movie goers head to a movie that promises to meet their cinematic expectations with no idea of the hell that awaits themas my sister and i watched this we thought whats with all the gratuitous porn we came for horror and all we got was breast shots and nonscary gore the only way we would see a movie from the same director is if he was the torturee on a reality television show we are not prudes by any means  we like a good horror as well as the next girl but even we felt as though we needed to gargle our brains in salt water the movie may have been salvageable if they had left out most of the nudity and devoted more space to actual horror and plot development i have never been so relieved to see people getting killed off,cruel
i really wish i could give this a lower rating than 1 this was possibly the one of the worst movies ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of bad movies i usually like twisted horrorthriller movies but this was garbage dont waste your time or money on this one it starts out okay only because of all the skin you see but i found myself wondering where they were going with it all it takes too long to get to any of the exciting scenes and when you do see them theyre totally bgrade theres not a single turn or twist in the plot which is usually the best thing about this type of movie i guess if youre a fan of other eli roth movies like cabin fever you might like this one,cruel
i was really looking forward to this movie and finally went and saw it last night and i thought it was pathetic the first 45 minutes of the movie reminded me of a teeny bopper movie with 3 horny guys getting stoned and trying to get laid then finally we get to the torture scenes and they were a total ripoff the first guy oli we never even see anything happen to him the second guys torture lasts about 2 minutes and you really dont see anything other than the aftermath and the last guy get a whopping 2 fingers cut off and gets away every aspect of the movie was completely preditable from the guy in the train turning out to be one of the butchers to the guy running back in after the chinese girl to him running over the whores and getting his revenge on the guy at the endgo buy saw and saw 2 if you want a real horror movie,cruel
i am highly upset with this film the thing that bothers me the most is tarantino i realize that he is just selling his name and trying to make a few dollars but all the people that dont understand that kill me he had nothing to do with the writing or directing all he did was produce now for the movieit should have aired on skinemax cinemax the first hour of the movie was nothing but nude women and corny comments the next half an hour was ok because you seen some nasty stuff but the problem was that it was just nasty for the sake of being nasty there was no scare involved nor was there any taste involved it was simply there so that people can say it was sick and idiots like me go and see it overall i would definitely not recommend this movie,cruel
i went in to this film looking for a decent scary movie and left having seen a simply terrible movie please please please do not waste your time watching this movie terentino attempted to show as many naked women as possible and then to stay true to his form threw in some of the most disgusting things imaginable i would not recommend this movie everbut i would definitely not recommend wasting your money seeing it in the theaters this is a sad excuse for a movie and is a disgrace to hollywood and american film makers the plot is nonexistent there truly is no content to this film to me it is simply an attempt to push the limits of our cultures tolerance to cruelty and gore i feel terrible after my experience of watching this movie my biggest disappointment is that i did watch the trailer for it before going to view it and the trailer in my opinion did not adequately portray what was to come in the film the trailer doesnt even touch on how disgusting this film is,cruel
this movie was absolutely the stupidest movie i have ever seen farfeched isnt even the word a horror movie is horrifying when it is just slightly realistic the only realistic part of this film was how easy it is to get laid overseas i would never recommend this movieever dont waste your time the whole movie i sat and waited for a thrill or even some part i didnt want to watch never happened i think there has been too much hype with awful films nobody could have been so scared during this movie that they would have been led out on a stretcher never this movie should be characterized as a softcore porn with 30 minutes of overboard killing at the end killings that dont make sense,cruel
this is the first time i have ever written a comment i just couldnt help myself every once in awhile ill browse through the comments to get the reasons why people liked the film or even why they didnt i usually only do this to find out why the rating of a good film was so low if you are one of those people then you must read my comments belowi wanted to start off by agreeing with the great things that have been written about this movie there is no need to rewrite what some people have already written they did a wonderful job describing a great film so if you are looking for reasons why you should see this film then read another comment that gave it 10 stars because this comment is about the ignorant negativity toward the filmi found out why the rating was not as high as it deserves to be so i just want to warn the people who are wondering if its worth seeing about the negative comments made toward this film ive read quite a few of them and their reasoning doesnt really make much sensesome of them talk about how the film isnt realistic realistic since when has any horror movie ever done in the history of hollywood ever been realistic i mean come on theres always something in every movie that isnt realistic even some of the true stories are changed to make the movie more of a blockbusterothers say that the movie should not be categorized as a horror film because its not scary enough if it was supposed to be the type of scariness where we scream around every corner it would be categorized as a thrillerhorror not simply a horror it is simply supposed to be a hardtowatch and psychologicallyscary movie due to the gore the scariest part about this film is that i would not be surprised if this the plot of the film was really going on somewhere in the world now thats scarythey also think we dont know enough about the background of the characters for it to be fulfilling why does anyone need to know how some people could be so evil would it make it better to know that they were abused as children no its suffice to say that there are some sick people in this world and knowing how they are like that is not going to change it also why do you need to know a lot about where a person came from to have sympathy for them i dont care who you are or what you did no human being truly deserves to be tortured like the way they are in this film and if you cant naturally have sympathy for someone being tortured like that then you are just as evil as the men doing it in my opinionthe rest of the people who gave this film a bad review had no reasons why they simply said that it was horrible theres no logic to their opinion so how am i able to listen to them when they say its not worth going to see i think these people just go around to every movie website and put a bad review in because they were getting too bored downloading pornography please just stick to pornography because some of us do actually take films seriously some of us even get paid to theres no need to trash a film you didnt even seeso please please please dont pay attention to the low rating this movie received because if you read what i wrote above andor actually saw this incredible film you would agree with me when i say it is definitely worth seeing,cruel
i am a major fan of horrorgore films and in my opinion this movie was an insult to the genre of horror films this movie was basically a porno with blood sex in movies is acceptable if it adds to the movie but more than 12 of the sex scenes didnt add anything the gore was weak and didnt even churn my stomach i have seen old classic horror films that had gore that put this movies so called gore to shame i had so much anticipation and build up for the gore in this movie i was ready to be throwingup when the gore scenes finally started i was excited and ready to be disgusted but to my dismay all of the gore scenes cut away at just the right part the story also lacked an interesting enough plot 3 horny college guys and boobs in my face for an hour is not my idea of a plot there should have been more focus on the so called gore that this movie was supposed to loaded with the plot line needed to be developed much more and deepened with some interesting twists and turns overall this movie was a huge let down,cruel
this movie sucked so badly i mean who could make such a gay movie i mean it wasnt even scary it was so stupid its was more like a porno movie then a horror movie i fell asleep it was so gay chain saw massacre was better than this movie gosh who ever made this movie is not gonna make a lot of money off of it whoever made this movie is a dumb f this movie and the characters i am not kidding this movie was so boring a disney land movie is better than this crap the director of this movie was a drug addict himself he was on crack when he made this movie its a waste of space this movie is i hated all the parts no good parts a bunch of hookers and hoes,cruel
this film was a total waste of my money it was oversexed and immoral there are some sick people in this world i felt as if my people put this film outafrican americans it would immediately be removed and banned from theaters the purpose of this film is where is the art that was found in seven or hannibal there is none in this filmits just let us see how far we can go this film made russian women look disgraceful and in american culture they are not seen as it is i say remove this piece of crap from theaters where are our standards i did not enjoy this film one bit from the beginning to the end i questioned the purpose the joy of killing was glorified yes there are sick people in this world but are we really that sick to glorify this the script was very obvious and irrational i didnt find myself screaming i found myself wondering why,cruel
im not sure why i dislike this film so much seeing that im a huge fan of the grotesque this movie was justwellboring the idea was there but it just wasnt done properlymaybe better actors could have pulled it off also since it takes place in eastern europe its hard to be frightened by a place and people you cant form an association with maybe it would be scarier if it took place in the states in some common city we all as americans can relate to it was arrogant in its approachtrying to bill it as one of the most graphic movies ever it isnt theres actually no violence in the film until the last 40 minutes or soand that violence is just a bunch of poorly executed 80s amateur bloodspurting sophomoric at best they practically show you anything one might consider as scary in the trailer its basically roth masturbating in your face and saying oh look what i can do looki can squirt blood and puss sowatch the trailer and save your money youll get the same effect and if you must see itwait or the rental at least that way you can do the laundry while the first boring hour of the film drags on,cruel
i wasnt expecting much when i saw previews for it looked like saw 3 to mebut i was wrong it had a storythe whole college frat boy like guys traveling across europethe previews should of showed that i think they would of got more viewersi mean the first half of the film is very much like eurotripbut with more laughs and better characters then about 40 minutes into it your blown away and it never lets go i actually cared about the guys which made it better then just watching some people get tortured some people say you have to be sick to like this or very morbid its like the original tcm to me in that way some things in it are pretty nasty and it does have a lot of gorehowever people are closing their eyes or letting their imaginations go wild a lot is not seen people say the original tcm is the goriest horror movie of all timewhen in fact there is hardly any bloodbut sometimes watching someone scream and knowing something bad is happening to them is much worse than actually seeing the knifehammer or hatchet tear their ass up so in conclusionif your a horror junkie like me you will love it if you get scared easily or you like sawyou will love it if you want to see a movie that your friends will be talking about some of the famous parts eye scene and you dont want to feel left outyou will love this movie if your looking for something to take mom and dad to or watching a balls to the wall horror movie with someone just cause you want to get out you will hate this movie and prob get sickso from a very morbid horror fani guess they would sayhas a spot in my top 25 horror films of all timenumber 23,cruel
right of the bat this movie sucked the plot is shaky and then there is a ton of sex and partying soon followed by gallons of blood the story just wasnt believable not to mention the acting was pretty poor because they couldnt get any real actor to play in such an off the wall movie finally the gore most of the effects werent that real so if i were you i would save my 825 and see something else i think eli roth was trying way to hard with this one he tries to be too much of an artist with his gore but in the end it just is a little gross not scary for this movie to work it would need better actors and some form of a plot line pulp fiction and resivior dogs both great films and both had a significant amount of known actors also because tarantino used a unique style of filming and revealing the story it sucked the viewer in they still had gore and they were directed by the producer of thats the only reason it seemed promising on the other hand was missing most of that like i said poor plot and acting not to mention there isnt creativity in the way is was filmed it just appears the the movie was running low on funds and roth had to slap something together instead of screaming or being creeped out my friend and i were laughing so hard pointing out all the flaws in this movie,cruel
first i must say well done mr roth youve proved yourself in the horror community this was the most pumped ive been for a horror movie in my entire life i read sooooooooo much about it online from all the people who saw the uncut version at the toronto film festival i dont know how that version was but this one was great a slow but affective start we got to know the characters very well and learn a little about amsterdam in the process i must warn all men do not take your wives girlfriends or mothers to see this filmthere are more boobs then all the american pie films put together plus euro trip i had heard that eli roth was a big takashi miike fan and that he was heavilyinfluenced by audition in the making of this got me excited and my excitement was fulfilled the torture scenes were very similar but not too similar still original the camera did not cut away too often either we saw most of the action i was also pleased with the level of gore in this film during a certain eyeball and puss scene a man in the audience left which is always a good sign im rambling well if you are either a fresh off of puberty boy a thrill seeking person or a straight up horror fan i highly recommend this fantastically made movie kudos to eli roth and i hope he continues to push the limits with his filmmaking,cruel
i was sitting in the front row of the theater for this movie hoping to be scared senseless i left the theater not scared at all this was just going for the extreme for the senses extreme drugs and sex in the first half and then extreme gross details in the second there was some plot and writing but this movie lacked the part of the movie that would have scared me here is the spoiler i liked the end when you see the people that set him up and he gets his revenge that was nice because he made them suffer rather than just kill them i expected better from this since it had terentinos name all over it i would have hoped he would make sure it was good if he was connected to it i will be weary of the next terentino movie written and directed by others,cruel
i saw the previews and thought well it looks ok and tarantino has his name on it so it should be good boy was i wrong this was is and hopefully always will be tarantinos worst movie if you want to see gore i suggest seeing csi for even that has more gore than this movie the only gore that was shown was for a split second as the camera panned other than that it was just all nudity and blood splatter the only r rated scenes were the ones that contained nudity and it wasnt even great nudity i expected this kind of boring pg material from the incapable and incompetent directorwriter of cabin fever but not from tarantino he has really lowered his standards on this one and hopefully will come out with a good movie to make up for this garbageerr not even garbage this film is the lowest form of existence it is useless i do not think i can bring myself to watch another tarantino movie without at least having a pillow and a free ticket i would rather sit in a room of stereotypic blondes scratching blackboards with their long nails and open mouth chewing of bubble gum than watch this filth again usually lions gate and tarantino can pick good movies to add their names to but this is the kind of movie that should be taken out beaten destroyed burned incinerated more and then launched into space with a heading towards the sun it is not even worth getting a free ticket or viewing and if i could rate less than a 1 awful i would for even awful is an immense compliment for this thing called a movie,cruel
imagine its only january and already weve got two films jockeying for the crappiest film of 2006 award uwe bolls latest sickup bloodrayne and now this tedious dull horror pic from fast rising mediocrity eli roth the plot if you can call it that runs something like this in a europe inhabited primarily by nymphomaniacal supermodels two strenuously annoying american teens are in the middle of some kind of sex n drugs tour while wallowing in the fleshpots of amsterdam they find out about an even more debauched town somewhere in the ruins of yugoslavia or croatia or where ever hopping a train with their much older icelandic friend oli the two obviously immensely rich pissants whine and pout across half of europe these two make the trio from the blair witch project seem like intrepid explorers until youre ready to leap into the film and strangle the little twits yourselfeventually they arrive at the aforementioned village which is predictably by now inhabited by nymphomaniacal supermodels more sex and drugs follow until oli suddenly goes missing andwhat dont know i walked out after over an hour of this thick brick of ennui without having seen anything even remotely scary roth establishes nothing except heres two annoying teens sometime in this film ill get around to torturing them to death meanwhile heres some more softcore porn on the strength of this pic i see a big career for roth directing latenight movies for showtime,cruel
this movie was absolutely retarded it was definitely the worst movie ive been to uptodate previously war of the worlds i will admit thought i laughed my ass off during most of the scenes qt should be ashamed of himself for having his name affiliated with this film the acting was boring and unoriginal the plot was weak and for a horror film there wasnt a lot of gore at all horror films now should be crazy with the technology of the three characters that get torturedkilled one of them wasnt even shown the idea for the film was good but it definitely wasnt worked on enough i give it an f for effort and a g for wasting my cash and time i envy everyone who walked in to the screen next to to see munich,cruel
i cant believe people think this was a good movie this movie was so ridiculous and so full of crap i was so excited to see it and was horribly disappointed when i did they could have used the 1st half of the movie to do really cool things if you liked or didnt like saw 2 at least the very 1st scene was tense and pretty sweet was pretty much like watching euro trip which was extremely retarded and a really bad softcore porno for an hour followed by really brief sawish gore the movie failed to make you forget you were in a movie theater and make you feel like you were the one in the situations i would flick on mtv if i wanted to see 3 idiots party for an hour there was about 15 seconds of cool gore out of the 34 seconds of it in the entire movie eli i hate you,cruel
lions gate films is starting to become known as the gore production company and with good reason however this movie is overhyped and underdeveloped the story is so hokey and predictable you never once connect with any of the characters it starts as a porn movie and then turns into a snuff film personally im not complaining so much about the fact that there was nudity im not going to lie im a guy i like boobs just as much as the next guy gore isnt exactly my forte but if this movie is as bad as it claims to be i want to witness the proof its not want to see this movie for free look up some pornography on the internet for 45 minutes and then go to rottencom for 50 minutes not only will you have saved some money youll have enjoyed yourself much better go see something else,cruel
if you like qt go see this movie it is great my reasoning for going to see was purely out of the backing of qt so i will warn the faint of heart or those who dont like qt you probably wont like this movie i on the other hand loved this movie the previews make it seem a lot more grotesque but its not just stupid gore and violence there is tons of gore in violence in this movie on the other hand so dont think the previews are misleading this movie has a great story line that shows real life in an artistic sense it also has great cinematography with suspenseful scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat and at the same time your hand in front of your face,cruel
the only reason i did not give this movie a perfect score is because the teasers led us to believe this movie will be torture all the way through and i got my guy friends to come and just sort of hangout but it turned out to be well plotted rather than torture the movie has a heroic plot and is definitely recommended for couples to cuddle and just enjoy the well balanced sadistic yet genius movie incredible acting super plot this movie also proves it doesnt take multimillion contracts on a single actor to make the acting good also i found this movie to be more of a thriller rather than a horror if you want to enjoy the hot girls the sex yet see a good semiunexpected plot with somenotice not a lot of torture this is for you910,cruel
the movie has a lot of obscene things including many vulgar scenes through out the movie as its more of a teen life based movie and it is also really a shocking experience as it has a lot of brutal and horrifying scenarios i like this movie as it really graphic and its also a thrilling experience to watch itits not a family movie some scenes might be too gross to watch as its ultra violent and some scenes might be too disturbing so be ready for it the movie is going to be a sure hit as its a movie that everyone who loves horror movies would like to watch overall the movie is an excellent one if you are looking forward to watching a horror movie,cruel
first of all let me say i didnt want to see in fact if you read some of the discussion threads i have been quite vicious on the movie purely from the idea of what the movie is comprised of asking questions like if the next avenue for horror will be to watch police films and snuff films for our scares indeed were it not for a nagging voice in my head accusing me of being a hypocrite for writing the movie off without so much as a viewing i would never have gone to see this filmbut i did and im glad i didthe story you know of is this a pair of american backpackers and an icelandic backpacker are backpacking through europe looking for the next big orgy or sexcapade to keep them interested in their journey in amsterdam the promise of the red light district is something they take up with glee until one night when they return to their and are locked out to their surprise a friendly russian allows them to crawl up the fire escape and party with himhe tells of a in bratislava slovakia where the women are absolutely gorgeous the sex is free and frequent and hes quite certain that these two horny americans and their hornier icelandic friend can have the ultimate experience at this point i feel its important to interject a lesson when you dont know someone its best to smile and agree but not take their adviceas soon as they can manage it the trio is on the next thing smoking to bratislava on the way they encounter an elderly traveler who confirms their hopes about bratislava but freaks out the nice lad josh when he makes a somewhat minor homosexual advance of course joshs reaction will be one that he will wish he could take back but he will not get the opportunityin bratislava they are placed in a room that is coed and the two women in the room both of whom are russian prove that their advice about bratislava is correct things seem to be going good when our americans josh and paxton bed their roommateshowever in the morning they are told that their icelandic traveling companion oli has checked out and they come across a photo of him and a japanese girl who was also staying in the provided by her traveling companion it all feels too strange for josh but paxton tries to convince him to give in to all of his desires as they didnt really know oli at all and he could very well have left themit turns out to be bad advice they will soon find out that there is a torturemurder service available here that allows the highest bidder to live out hisher fantasies of torturing or killing another human being josh paxton oli and all the others have been sold to be slaughtered for the highest bidderto provide anymore detail about the movie would eliminate the tension that the movie works so hard to create so i will not go any further to reveal what happens i will however say this does have an abundance of gory disturbing torturous scenes that sensitive viewers will definitely find over the top and so i believe a more mature audience is an absolute mustthe story in my opinion resembles the last house on the left not only due to the torture elements but also due to the conclusion which i feel actually renders this film as a very good one unlike with the abominable wolf creek does not hand over all of the power to the malicious sadist nor does it portray a preference for female suffering that gives it a very misogynistic feel the victims in this movie do suffer but something else comes out of them as well a desperation a defiance compassion and a mean streak that balances out the movie to a very effective degree in my opinionthe bad guy sometimes can be a woman the good guy sometimes does try to help out others the good guy can be forever changed by his encounter enough to take bloody revenge on those who so cruelly and coldly murdered people for moneyeli roth took the movie in a direction that i certainly didnt see coming it was through moving in that direction that he places above movies like high tension and wolf creek for the first time we have a quality movie to compare to last house on the left and i for one enjoyed the journey even if at times it is hard to watch and listen to,cruel
a note first this movie is not directed by quentin tarantino if it were you can bet your sweet bippie that i would be all about it this film was written and directed by eli roth whose previous film was the somewhat interesting cabin feveranyway the movie is about two americans and an icelandic chap they met in their travels who are backpacking through europe for one last fling with sex and drugs before they move on into adult life during one disastrous night in amsterdam theyre told about a utopian far away where the girls will do anything especially for americansof course they gotheir first night at this miracle is exactly what was promised but the next day their icelandic friend has left without wordand apparently left with a japanese girl hed shown no interest in previously the american boys are worried but the pakistaniamerican i dont remember their namesthats how invested i was in these characters told his friend that thats just how they do things in europe and they should just continue to party and screw so they did the pakistaniamerican passes out in a liquor closet but his friend manages to make it back to their roomand wake up handcuffed to a chair naked save for his boxerbriefs with some guy choosing which tool to use first torture ensuesthe pakistaniamerican wakes up in the liquor closet and goes about trying to find his friends he meets up with the girls from the other night and now theyre not so mesmerizing as that first magical night theyre not wearing make up or club clothes and they look a tad strung out but otherwise like every other girl in the world a nice touch imo eventually one of the girls takes him into the heart of darkness and he has to battle his way outits like a 95 minutes plus 10 minutes of trailers cautionary tale about being a horny american in europebut theres no investment in the characterswould have fit well in the 80s tna horror flicks we all know but it has a timeless vicious intensity that almost elevates it to the level of a good horror flick almost however just as with roths previous flick cabin fever its unfocused with some pretty bad dialogue and bad actingit felt as though the two or two and a half reels of lusty girls and pot were really to pad out the script to feature length not to make the torture scenes that much more brutal eli roth really needs to work on his writingreally reallythe worst part about the movie has to be the score note to eli roth and his composer youre not making lord of the rings hereyoure making an attempt at a new millennium grind house horror flick your score is laughable and not in a good waythe best thing about the movie other than the great effects from nicotero and berger miike takashis cameo id read about it in fango but forgot until i saw him that was a wonderful surpriseroths obviously a horror fanand a fan of tarantinos as evidenced by the usage of a clip from pulp fiction featuring samuel l jackson  ezekial 2517 he references sam raimi and suicide club as well id have to watch it again for more but i didnt like the film well enough to botherthis sounds like a negative reviewand it is however i must say that the last reel and a half or two reels were more along the lines of what i was expecting based on the trailers there were two scenes where i was like dayum kana and the kids at the end but as far as being disturbing or whatever i felt the impact lessened by a poorly written script and didnt really have anything to elevate it from that quagmireas for gore welli was brought up on fulci argento and bava i can understand where the average american will see this film and throw upthey havent seen the gates of hell for a horror fan who is welleducated in the genre and doesnt necessarily feel that the terms well written and horror film are mutually exclusive its a disappointmentoh and as for the based on true events thing harry knowles from aintitcoolnews showed eli roth a website where you could purchase a murder vacation for 10000 and thats the basis for the story roth doesnt even know if the website was realoverall i wouldnt waste my ten bucks to see it in the theatres im a projectionist so yippee for free but i would waste my four bucks for a dvd rental and watch it with friends,cruel
i saw this at midnight madness as the closing film of the toronto international film festival this is one of the most brutal and violent films ive seen in a long time kind of a revenge horror flickcautionary tale almost an attempt to create an urban legend about american college students backpacking around europe i think the best way to describe it is to say which directorsfilms it seems to be inspired by the most prominent influences seem to be the works of takashi miike films such as audition or ichi the killer other influences seem to be sympathy for mr vengeance pulp fiction zeds dead eurotrip or at the very least the clich american college student backpacking around europe experience sex and drugs it presents an extremely disturbing and bleak outlook on human nature which one would hope is an exaggeration but sadly the operation depicted in this film to me at least is plausible in some aspects of its depiction it seems very much inspired by the brutal and senseless torture inflicted in nazi concentration camps i loved the irreverent humour of cabin fever there are still some traces of this in i was riveted watching the whole film at times titillated other times revolted i totally marked out and was cheering at the end of the film when retribution was delivered definitely not for the faint of heart rick hoffman is great as the smug american businessman the character is a little bit stock but he does a very good job at quickly creating a character that you just want to punch in the mouth if you liked last years festival closer saw or any takashi miike films you will enjoy this see this film with a crowd preferably late at night,cruel
i expected a good gory horror film granted with most recent horror films some female skin even a few chest shots are to be expected what i didnt expect was to spend the first three quarters of the movie watching three ugly horny guys chase uk women apparently us girls dont do it for themthe least the director could have done is given us girls a nice six pack to look at while more women flashed their chests then i have ever seen in my life the pointless sex scenes included four guys ogle at a couple having sex while they were too high to realize anyone was watching to the three companions having sex while their female partners looked at each otheri will be honest and say i felt a bit of satisfaction when the perves diedso boys go to this movie and enjoy but girls dont waste your money and if your guy wants you to go with him to avoid odd situations recommend he go with his friends,cruel
this is the only movie i have ever see that has made me want to walk out of the theatre and not to mention only 30 minutes into it at thatthe opening seems to have nothing to do with the moral of this story i dont need to see the sluts of the red light district or people so drugged up that they dont even realize they are having sex unimportant unnecessary stupidi really never have felt so strongly about a movie as much as i have this one please if you are interested in what this movie is about ill sum it up for you drugs sex torture and revengeoh and ive seen more gore in movies made twenty years agoworst film of the year,cruel
i have to say i am a huge fan of horror and the gorier the movie the better i also must admit i am biased in this review because i love these kinds of movies just that much however i can safely say gore aside eli roth has created a captivating thriller that can keep the attention of even the most attentiondeceived viewerthe beginning really sets you up for a different sort of movie which is perfectly executed honestly thirty minutes into it i was very shocked by the sheer level of nudityby the climax of the movie you are enthralled and if you have a weak stomach about to throw up i honestly laughed at the goriest parts because ive seen it all done before nothing new nothing really shocks me anymorethats not it though eli roth creates suspense that can not be learned in a day he has perfected this and really exploits it towards the end i was cheering basically if you even have a passing interest in gore you owe it to yourself to see this movie you will not regret it,cruel
i never wanted to see really because although i love horror movies i cant really get into the ones that are just 90 minutes of disturbing violence or torture which is what i expected of this but no theres a story  its the best horror ive seen n awhile i dont get all the bad reviews especially the 1si noticed details such as the sexy women looking ugly  different to the main character after he caught on something was very wrong and the ending although it was kinda cheesy how he just happened to run into all the right people was satisfying revenge i was expecting the trend especially of that time period in horror of no one escapingi liked this movie all the way through,cruel
perverse  thats the only thing i can say about this movie only sick people would come up with a script like that and only sick people would like to watch itits got absolutely no scarevalue at all the sexual references in the beginning of the film makes the whole movie appear like a movie for real life hanibal lecters who get sexual pleasure from watching people being tortured to deathi dont have any issues with gore per se its not the gore in this film that disturbs me but the thought of the people who enjoyed making or watching it gore can be scary gore can contribute to making a story more exciting gore can even be funny bad taste etc in all those cases the filmmakers are using our repulsion for gorethis movie is using gore in the complete opposite way were supposed to take pleasure in it and then it just becomes sick,cruel
when i first saw this movie back in 2005  i hated this movie as i heard is was really great horror movies and few years later 2 come out which is even worse then this movie i find the sequel to be really bad i always watch movies twice to see if i have missed anything the first time around i was laughing from start to end of the movie i think the sequel makes this a better movie the plot two adventurous american college buddies paxton and josh backpack through europe eager to make quintessentially hazy travel memories with new friend oli an icelander theyve met along the way paxton and josh are eventually lured by a fellow traveller to whats described as a nirvana for american backpackersa particular in an outoftheway slovakian town stocked with eastern european women as desperate as they are gorgeous the two friends arrive and soon easily pair off with exotic beauties natalya and svetlana in fact too easily initially distracted by the good time theyre having the two americans quickly find themselves trapped in an increasingly sinister situation that they will discover is as wide and as deep as the darkest sickest recess of human nature itselfif they survive this as so much nudity in this movie and it was not as gory as it was made out to be  i thinking it be like gutterballs which has a lot nudity in that movie too but as really nasty gory scenes in that movie however this movie not as gory but then did have really nasty scenes that were really good the acting was really good from the whole cast it not the worst movie out there but not a great movie too since this has been on dvd its as grown on me a lot and i gave this second watch also gave hotel 2 a second i hate 2 a lot more then hated this movie back in 2005 i going give this movie 5 out 10,cruel
this movie really wasnt for me on any level i like horror from cheesy b movies to horrific chillers but this to me was just an excuse to try and be controversialto give them their due the special effects were good for which they get off the bottom rung but that was it there was less storyline than found in top shelf movies and less believable if possiblei am no mary whitehouse but there is not need for this kind of film where there is no reason for the torture or pain or suffering of the characters and no resolution or moral story this film left me really disturbed mainly because of its sheer pointlessness and the fact that within its pointlessness it showed truly and i really mean trulymonstrous acts for no reason i wont say that it should never have been released but i think the authors and producers should take a real good look at themselves and perhaps consider professional helpthe worst thing for me though is that one of my favourite directors put his name to this monstrosity and its kind of lowered my opinion of him qt does gore and shock tactics but in his films there is at least normally some good reason other than an excuse for gorei give it a 3 for its special effects but unless you really like depraved films of no merit avoid this film like the plague,cruel
the plot  three friends backpacking through europe and when they hear that bratislava is full of horny chicks they immediately pack their bags and jump aboard the train well what theyve heard is all true but what no one told them was that a company in bratislava makes a living by kidnapping tourists and letting their clients kill them for a price the three friends soon find themselves in some very difficult situations to say the leastafter reading all the stuff about this movie and seeing trailers and pictures on the internet and magazines and ended up 1 at the box office and became a smash hit so i was expecting something brilliant violent brutal and gory in the same vein as saw probably made because saw became a surprise box office hit and the film makers wanted to quickly cash in on the ongoing crazebut in my opinion is overrated yes its violent and gory but to my feelings are mixed its an okay movie but its not something i would watch time and time again and what gets on my nerves is that a lot of horror movies that come out these days say theyre based on true events which i think is complete ballocksthe three friends play theyre parts well but none stand out for me to be honest hostal is a good movie but not great and its great that theyve made gory horror movies mainstream because for gore i revert to old italian horror movies in which none of my friends ever heard off saw im glad this and other movies like this have paved a way into a new wave of horror plus there are some pretty gruesome gory bits in which i wont go into much detail about but its definitely not for the faint heartedall in all is a good movie it just isnt as gory as it is hyped up to be,cruel
i dont see all the noise around this little flick ultrabrutal hell no funny in a trash sort of way maybe and since it was basically only advertised by its failing gore the rest as i expected isnt worth any attention the story is just nonsense maybe someone should have told eli roth that to feel and fear with and for the main character the main character should have a character here we have somebody whos about as interesting as an axe tv model minus the abs two eastern european babes one sex addict from iceland and of course the villainsits just not enough for a full length feature the settings are pretty decent and probably the only believable thing the cinematography has a fresh look since movies arent shot that frequent in this area but thats about it is boring lame not even especially gruesome and it does never justice to its hype but for kiddies who havent seen somebodys finger getting cut off enjoy it while your parents are out for anniversary dinner you little punks,cruel
this movie is so incredibly bad i just had to write about it some key problems1 there is no plot the things that happen and the dialogue seems completely pointless 2 the acting is horrible derek richardson is so bad i actually got sick to my stomach none of the characters seem remotely real 3 the gore is just revolting not entertaining in any wayi turned it off about ten minutes from the end i wouldnt waste more time on it this dvd is going and im not joking in the trashdont watch it youll be glad you didnt,cruel
despite all of the debate over the political and social issues and despite all the reference to this being too shocking degrading or pornographic when it comes down to it there are only two reasons for watching this film  sex and pain i was going to write shock instead of pain but the shock is only of the pain variety if you object or do not enjoy seeing these things on the screen then you probably shouldnt watch this film also if you are looking for good acting or plot development if you are looking for complex subjects or depth and insight into life then you should go elsewhere the acting is strictly high school the script and dialog are infantile and any meaning attached to the film is fairly superficial giving the viewer the idea that it was thrown in to give film some justification for existence other than just being a way to separate the audience from its money for those of you remaining i will review the two aspects of this film which may appeal to you sex there is nothing pornographic in the sense of hard core x rated pornography you will see some naked women some of whom are pretty and others less so you will also see some situations of apparent sex there are some scenes of adolescent joy at sexual abandon which look very set up and trite i wouldnt recommend the film for its sexual titillation if that is what you want you can get much more of it elsewhere now we get to the real value of the film  the pain yes it is here in abundance  quality pain one reviewer here gushed at the fact that my stomach was still knotted up after we left the screeningthe last time i felt like that was when i saw aliens for the first time about 19 years ago since then no other horror film has ever made me feel like that if this is the kind of thing that you enjoy then you can splurge on it here however the pain is mainly in the second half so i would recommend you skip the first half and go straight to the blood and pain that dominate the second half this could save your a good deal of time on the other hand there is something to be said for watching the first half and being so disgusted at the idiocy of the main characters and being bored by their poor acting that you feel some satisfaction at seeing them tortured in the second half however that would is not to everyones taste and you would have to decide on an individual basis if this would be worthwhile all in all the film will appeal to many who enjoy viewing activity in the areas of sex and pain particulary the latter as a means of entertainment i do understand there are a large number of people who fill this group and so did the marketing people who put this film together to you although i am not of your tastes i simply say  to each his or her own and i hope you find this film satisfying all others will find their time better spent in different pursuits,cruel
why 1 of 10i didnt like the film at all take a portion of a bad czech tv porn movietake some poor actors with really bad dialoguestake at least 510 minutes of a torture movieand finally take a headline quentin tarantino presents these all are the ingredients of  nothing more and nothing lessi was so nerved by the characters that i even didnt worry when the first got slaughtered i just thought ok  one less  next one pleaseits not the dark film you would expect to get after seeing all these trailers its just another bad made movie,cruel
to be honestly i thought i was going to see a movie by tarantino when i started to see this movie after it when i realized that its not i was not really surprised now not that it found it a that bad movie for me the movie was scary if you see a horror movie and you find it scary that the movie reached its goal already a bitso the good part of the movie for me was that it could scare me otherwise the movie was not that great the storyline was straight with not too many surprises the acting was average at itself the actors where not that bad but they didnt got a change to say something interesting or to show to much emotionsif i look back on the movie now what would have made it a bit nicer would be to have a decent ending now the speed is put a little bit higher towards the ending one guy survives the horror and then he start to do kill anyone that comes on his way and then it ends no meaning of it all its a simple an eye for an eye law without too much dialogs about it eitherif youre in a critical mood while watching this movie you can criticize a lot on this movie if youre not and you just want to see some horror you can enjoy it,cruel
whats up with horror movies today either they are wimpy toothless stuff or they rely only on violence forgetting character development pacing and other essential elements of the genre both extremes stink falls squarely in the latter group three sexstarved friends reach a town in eastern europe and meet a group of attractive suspiciously friendly local girls one after another the friends disappear only to wake up in a dark room tied to a chairtorture is not interesting  and its not scary or entertaining just unpleasant whats sad is the idea beneath had potential every time one of the protagonists vanishes there are intriguing bits with a creepy atmosphere and the growing realization something horrible is happening features also an attempt at subtext about the comparison between sexual tourism and torture tourism by sadists who pay the to bring them victims but the movie squanders mood and social commentary and goes for cheap gratuitous gore the unnecessarily long first act is a crass teen comedy the last part essentially plays as a snuff movie  tonally inconsistent doesnt quite convey it worth no viewings110,cruel
ok it is one of those movies that basically does not have a story or a deep plot so for those movie goers who like to rack their brains about what happens next like twists and turns in movies this movie is definitely not for youbut yes if you are on of those whod just like to see a movie for fun without bothering too much about the intricacies of the plot script and the story line then you are welcome to watch itand if you want to watch this movie then kindly make sure you are not weak at heart and also make sure that you do not get offended by sexual contentthe plot may be summed up as follows  three guys looking for fun in the form of women end up in the wrong place why is the place wrong people are allowed to be tortured by other rich people who are willing to pay for the sameinitial part of the movie is loaded with erotic content and the latter part of the movie with incredible gore and the reason why i have given this movie a 6 is only because of the boldness the film makers have shown in depicting certain scenes sometimes i cant help wondering whether the movie makers really had the fingers of the actors cut and a word of warning make sure the weaker ones never see this movie very high on blood and gorecheers,cruel
to the people who expected some kind of deep darkly comical amusement a la pulp fiction this isnt the film for you this is far more similar to a david fincher movie very dark both visually and on a far more primal leveli was happy with this film and didnt expect it to take residence in my top 50 but very few films do nowadaysa decent gross em out movie with enough backstory to keep you interested in the charactersits good to see tarantino branching out a little from the typical crime thrillers hes bee dishing out for ages,cruel
this movie was amazing it has a plot it has the right actors it has everything that is needed for you to be at the edge of your seat blocking your eyes hoping that you need to use the loo just when the gore startsjust so you dont look like a punk in front of your mates i had to leave one or two times during this movie it was some heavy stuff very well done though beautiful the movie stays with you days after you have seen it this has ushered in a new era of horrori am sure that eventually one or two producers are going to want to attempt to emulate this film it is truly a hard act to follow some would say that it had too much gore but heythat is the movie it all has a point and it illustrates the character involved perfectly well put together,cruel
2002 was a big year for director eli roth as the huge success of his modest debut film the lowbudget horror cabin fever quickly gave him the attention of a young audience eager of horror films aimed to their generation while not exactly an original or exceptional film roths cabin fever became a huge hit among the audience because it offered an edgier raw approach that proved to be very attractive to die hard horror fans but at the same time was friendly enough to gather the mainstream audiences not entirely familiar with the genre it was this success that attracted producer quentin tarantino to help roth to make the followup to his initial success the 2005 release of was the result of that joint venture and the movie that showed that roth is finally growing up as a horror directoris the story of paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson two backpackers traveling across europe during their last summer before going to college in a wild trip of drugs and sex in their quest their are joined by oli eythor gudjonsson an icelander traveler who is also looking for good experiences during one night on amsterdam the three travelers meet alex lubomir bukovy a young man who tells them about a located in slovakia where they will find not only the best looking women of all europe but also the ones that are easier to get into bed excited about this information paxton josh and oli travel to slovakia to discover the paradise alex was talking about but they will also discover a dark side of the business that alex conveniently forgot to tell themwritten by roth himself is at its core a very basic tale of punishment as the young protagonists go from lustful consumers to products of consumption by their own choice however its commendable the effort roth has put to the development of the characters to give some flesh and make the simple story a bit more engaging the lack of sympathetic or wellbuilt characters was one of the most criticized aspects of cabin fever but in roth creates a trio of characters that while at first are like xerox copies from his cabin fever boys later they evolve into real persons with realistic motivations and surprisingly heart proving that the directorwriter has learned something from his past mistakesits important to point out that its hype as an extremely violent movie is deceiving as it really doesnt offer anything new or groundbreaking to old and experienced horror fans familiar with lesser known gems of the exploitation genre that said is a visually impressive movie thanks to its bigger budget that showcases a stylish yet very realistic way of violence rarely seen in the current mainstream horror as a director eli roth follows a straight forward approach to his story that in many ways is the obvious evolution of his work in cabin fever as even when this new film is definitely more brutal and remorseless than his previous work it also offers a slightly friendly face that makes it attractive to bigger audiences outside the traditional horror fan basethe cast of the film does a commendable job but never goes beyond the expected jay hernandez is probably the best of the main cast giving a believable turn as the naive american who gets in the middle of something bigger than himself while he is good in his role his character loses all credibility by the last third of the movie due to the sadly unrealistic way roth ends the film derek richardson is pretty good too as the less enthusiastic and introverted josh eythor gudjonsson as oli exudes his natural charm in a role that is probably an exaggeration of his real life persona jan vlask gives a terrific performance in whats probably the best acting of the film the rest of the cast is pretty much ok without any real surprisesas written above it is roth who is the main responsible for the fatal flaw of the film its conclusion is divided basically in three acts and sadly its in the final part where roth decides to conclude his story in a way so fantastic that betrays the realist approach he had used in the film so far without spoiling the finale ill just say that the unfortunate decision makes the film look like a complete different movie and totally unbalances what otherwise could had been a new classic has been criticized by the naive and ignorant view it has on slovakia and other european countries in their portrayal as poor countries where life is cheap while roth has defended himself by saying his film is done that way on purpose personally i think that the ambiguity the film has on this aspect its very realistic at times while overthetop fantastical at others doesnt really help roth to make his point clearwheter it is a socially aware film or not the fact is that with director eli roth gained another financial success and proved that he was more than a lucky one hit wonder while not a movie without flaws and it has some serious problems is a big improvement over cabin fever and hopefully roth will make a masterpiece if someone else writes instead of him 710,cruel
i agree with the above review there is just one small thing as a czechslovak with some knowledge of the geography i cant understand how they have set up main part of the movie in bratislava  capital of slovakia but they have capture the whole train station and the signs on the streets etc in czech as it was czech cityvillage where it was taken otherwise  great movie it was pretty scary too as i know that there are people like that out there living in the world pretty sick parts i had to take a deep breath few times to not close my eyes watch it if you got strong mind do recommend close your blinds and turn the phone off  turn the volume up and enjoy,cruel
i had read a good deal about this movie before i watched it  that it was a poorly scripted bit of softporn trash and such however i found to be a well acted movie with a good atmosphere of foreboding and dread given the first fortyfive minutes or so were required to set the stage for what was to follow but i still believe this portion of the movie could have been shortened a bit if you watch closely however much of what happens in the beginning is very relevant to the latter part of the movie the violence was nothing close to what i expected based on other reviews and what scenes were shown seemed necessary to telling the storymy main complaint is what the hell did he have to cut off the girls eyeball for when he rescued her she was screaming as if to imply that her dangling eyeball was paining her uh yes ill bet it was but how about wrapping her face in a cloth or something this seemed a bit much and simply an excuse to show some pus squirting out of someones faceoverall i found to be an entertaining movie yes it is a gruesome flick but that should come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about the genre i also feel there was a worthwhile message here all is never as it seems so watch out definitely worth the dollars and the time after watching the glut of teen crap that hollywood is spewing out these days i appreciated something that at least pretended to take itself seriously,cruel
it shocks me that someone thought that the idea for this movie was entertaining enough to merit actually filming it it shocks me further that people enjoy watching this movie this is the most twisted and disturbing film i have ever seenid also like to comment that according to the wikipedia article on this movie the director wanted to point out the ignorance of americans so what does he do he makes a movie that reflects american fears and stereotypes of this part of europe secondly the movie is claimed to be based on a true story the director said himself that it was based on a website he saw and has no idea if it was real or not were obviously dealing with a real intellectual giant here and he should be praised for his brilliance or he should be institutionalized,cruel
its been a while since i saw a hollywoodlike horror flick because my previous experiences have been disappointing i have since moved on to east asian cinema almost exclusively i decided to rent this one because ive heard a lot of positive comments about it unfortunately its typical hollywood horror which means it sucksthe first part of this film goes a little something like this some college guys start smoking pot and talking about banging girls while swearing up a storm because you know thats so cool then theres this nightclub with scantily clad women everywhere then theres some guy banging a girl in the bathroom all of this occurs during the first 5 minutes then one of the guys gets into a fight cause thats so cool then they go and pay for sex cause thats like totally fresh then they go to an apartment with more potsmoking sex and rap music cause thats like so phat then they go to this heavenly and almost get mugged by a gang of 5yearolds no kidding so basically the first half hour is a completely pathetic attempt at character development and storytellingthe next half hour is where the real meat of the film lies most of the torture occurs during this part of the film the gore is explicit yet brief it doesnt drag on for very long which is a good thing it seemed as though the filmmakers wished to use the violence to propel the rest of the film similar to high tension without the ridiculous plot twists unfortunately the suspense is not nearly as pronounced or effective as high tension not even closethe final half hour is moderately suspenseful but there are way too many hollywoodlike moments that completely kill the mood of the film here are a few of them 1 the lead characters torturer was a complete moron allowing him to escape2 theres a really stupid eyeball scene youll know when it happens3 the lead character fortuitously sees the 3 antagonists who led him to the better yet they just so happen to walk directly in front of his car as he is attempting to escape the town so he then proceeds to run them over with the car even though 1 of these antagonists was introduced in an entirely different country at the beginning of the film quite an unrealistic coincidence4 the lead character hires a gang of 5yearolds to kill some of the bad guys who are attempting to catch him how exactly does he pay this gang of toddlers with bubblegum this was completely stupid and yes it actually happened in the film that way 5 the lead character fortuitously sees the antagonist who killed his friend on a train allowing him to get his revengeall of these events kill the basis for the entire film which is this could happen to you sorry filmmakers but s sense of realism goes out the window when you invoke idiotic murderers fake eyeballs ludicrous coincidences of vengeance and deadly toddlers who kill for bubblegum also note the blatant product placement for pulp fiction in the i know the cover of the dvd says quentin tarantino presents but for goodness sake do you really have to insert a clip from one of his products into the actual movie in any case this film presents everything thats wrong with hollywood horror i wanted to keep up on some of the more popular hollywood fare just in case the filmmakers actually got their act together they havent,cruel
well where do i start well basically ive never been a big fan of horror filmsit wasnt till the other day my friend brought round the film for the both of us to watch that i started wondering if it was worth watching and to my surprise it wasthe beginning had a slow pace but was well worth the build up of what was meant to happenas soon as the gore started showingi did honestly try to turn away but was well into it by thengreat acting by all the cast throughouti rate this film very highlyas soon as the film was over i just couldnt speaki was quite taken by the whole thing which has made me go out and buy it for myself on dvdwell worth it,cruel
i saw this movie last sunday and was excepting it to be at least decent considering tarantinos collaborationwell what to say really a bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad movie i live in amsterdam and i was really surprised to see that no character in the movie spoke dutch but only german and they were not tourists as the american guy during the scene at the disco insults one of them as dutch faggot well maybe who made this movie thinks that the official language here is german sorry hoorits notfurther the last scene when the guy arrives in prague at the station the platforms sign are not in czech but also this time in german mmmm when i was in prague i did not notice thisanyway this might be futile particulars but further no story kind of soft porn full of insults and fk here and fk there full of clichs about eastern europe and amsterdam as welli bought this movie and luckily it was cheap so i did not blame myself that much when i threw it away in the garbage the minute after it was oversave your money folks,cruel
this movie is awful i only watched it because where i worked they had all seen it and i was curious i will probably never watch this again it should have a healthy warning on it too much blood guts etc my blood pressure must have soared sky high and now i have heart palpitations i will probably also have a nightmare tonight when i turn in for bed as well i wished i never watched it cant movie goers make some nice chick flicks that actually relax people i also feel nauseated as well to add to my other health problems why pick a scene in eastern europe as well i have recently been to poland and it was beautiful i may never speak to a slovakian again,cruel
is a mystery why would tarantino present such a movie it has been a while that tarantino presents movies and it is getting time that he directs more than presenting im a fan of hisyou would think if tarantino presents this movie he would be proud of it as he would have done the same thing therefore it would be like a tarantino movieit is notokay it is sexy very gory and fast paced but the properties end there no script no visual aesthetic no acting no budget for proper cgi effects no camera work and very weak scenario everything is just a pretext for the last part of the movie nothing to build the appropriate suspense ambiancethe acting is not very good except for some evil characters and one of the heroes derek richardson the sound track is acceptable but you could have expected more sound effects are effective thoughas for the plot the twist is interesting but takes too much time to develop even for a 90 minutes movie separated in 3 parts the scenario takes too much time on the first one during the second part you wonder where this is going as it is going too fast for a conventional horror movie the 3rd part reveals that is more a gory movie than a horror movie acceptable but it is not what i paid for i expected a bit different albeit they suggested in the makingof that it is inspired from real eventsanyway i did spend a relatively good time but thanks to the producers it was shorti dont think i would see this movie again i would recommend it as a rental more for its gore than horror other than that wait to see it on tv,cruel
i cant believe quentin is the director of this bad sht i thought i was going to see some good nasty horror movie but it starts like some fing teenagecomedy about some stupid assholes who go buy whores and stuff and then after they end up in a cellar where people get killed by elite hunters i think this crap was made just to show some boobs and nudity damn i think eli roth is the worst filmmaker in history seriously i hate you and i would beat his ass so hard if i stumbled across him in the streets this is what i think of this movie110,cruel
is the story of two friends who go backpacking in a forine country and they stay at a or a kind of hotel then they find out that business men from all over the world meet there to torcher people without mercy the thing that i saw which was the most terrifying was when paxton gets the achillys tendon in his foot cut by a guy who looks like a freaking huch back of norta dam i screamed out in the theater at the very end when paxton gets revenge on that dutch business man yes thats what i am talking about if you like gore and sex this is the movie for you or you could be one of them sceamish people who faint at the sight of caked on blood on the chair of torcher,cruel
i had this film on my shelf for around 2 months before i watched it i thought saw was bad but this is sickeningly real it makes you think that this kind of thing really happensit started so softly but jumpily i defy anyone that say they knew what was going to happen at the beginning of the filmi have a particular aversion to achilles heels injuries if you have ever seen murder in the first you will know what i meanthe blowtorch was a particularly nasty moment  the extras show that the actress is britishall in all a fantastic film that has made me really think about the darker side of the human psyche,cruel
i have to say the ads for the movie were what peaked my interest at first then hearing a bit about the plot whetted my interest more sort of a combination of the most dangerous game and salo i wasnt a big fan of roths earlier work cabin fever but do like tarantinos work for the most part long story short i finally got to see the unrated version of and have to say it angered me more for the amount of money time and hype this piece of dreck generated some of the other posters on this site have said similar as far as the characters themselves  where the basic backbone to any horror movievictim is you have to like or at least tolerate the intended victim in order for there to be any sort of suspensehorrorfear but give us three totally unlikable selfcentered hedonistic spoiled holes and who really cares what happens to them the only thing i could think of was could we please just kill these jerks now and move on to something else when the nice guy character nice guy insofar as he isnt quite a big a pustule as his two buds disappears and then is shown tied up and being tortured in the club i felt no fear suspense joy elation nothing  only the feeling that he really did in some way deserve this and worse same for the other two nimrods this plot idea truly had some potential but really got wasted in the softporn drugs gaybashing racist remarks jokes stereotyping,cruel
honestly this movie was positively awful we were set up for a let down the ads showed us the wrong plotto begin with the movie was filled with irrelevant pornography the first hour or so was filled with topless females and unnecessary sex scenes it was too much i watched it alone and even so i was blushing the comedy used in these scenes was nothing but annoying misogynistic male get some type conversations i was nearing offended and movies do not offend methe torture was excessive and gutwrenching they did a good job with the sfx but this was really just a parade of them we see a toe being broken fingers being sawed off and something that i can not even think about being done to an achilles tendon i have a strong stomach when it comes to blood and gore in the movies but this turned my stomach quite a few timesto sum it up this is quite possibly the worst movie i have seen to date,cruel
i know it says that this review contains spoilers i find it difficult to say that anything in this movie is going to be spoiled by my review when you start at the worst possible the only way is up right to begin with the theme of a group of people paying big money to hunt humans is so hackneyed and tired that anyone wishing to have this experience would do well to just check out a copy of the most dangerous game from their local library and call it a nightthe writing if it indeed can be referred to as such is one big stereotype after another with nothing much to create any sort of empathy for any character by the time the first killing is alluded to the viewer is thrilled if only to end the incredible tedium of gay jokes unnecessary shots of breasts and drug referencesthe film limps along for the rest of its run time spurred along only by very intense visuals of blood and gorefor my money if you want to see some blood and gore just rent one of the faces of death movies and save yourself having to sit through an interminable unoriginal and painful plot,cruel
lets get one thing straight eli roth is a dirt bag and quentin tarantino is an even bigger dirt bag for lending his ohsovenerable name to this vacuous mess of a filmthe core idea of the film is good in fact it had the potential to become one of the most gutwrenching horrors of all time the idea of a business that captures and provides helpless victims for wealthy sadists who like to vent their frustrations by shoving powerdrills into peoples eye sockets is bloody terrifying especially since in this day and age we know that somewhere in the world that idea is probably a reality however when the director is eli roth who cant seem to see anything past his permanently erect penis the potential for a structured horror movie becomes marred with senseless sex scenes that serve no other purpose than to pacify roths miscreant compulsionsif i want to watch a porno i will go to an adult video store and rent a porno when i watch a horror film i do not expect to have to sit through an hour of giggling nymphets with gigantic breasts copping off with each member of the male cast as well as each otherthe three lechers in question start off their escapades by sampling the offerings of perhaps all of amsterdams red light districts before heading off to bratislava where according to some random sleazeball with a mole on his lip the girls are more wanton than pigs in heat they check into this where even the receptionist looks like she warped out of naughty nurses ii and become roomies with two flirty 25 inchwaisted amplebreasted slovakians clearly its a dream holiday for any man who has never heard of venereal diseaseshowever things turn nasty when one of their compadres disappearscue the cheesy doomimpending trumpets from the 1930s the film then descends down the usually trail of illogical pitfalls and contrived coincidences pervading most horror movies our hapless goons follow complete strangers around the alleyways of bratislava looking for information in derelict warehouses obviously the first place youd visit after checking out of a and as the gloved hands reach out of the shadows and strap them into rusty metal chairs in a room cluttered with sharp gardening utensils they realise too late that theyve been led into a trap who would have suspected such treachery from the brunette with the evil laugh and perfect tits the torture scenes that follow are tense and a little cringy powerdrills chainsaws blowtorches wire clippers but they are still tame in comparison with takeshii mikes audition since the camera usually flicks away for most of the sick shots and since we feel absolutely nothing for the victims it seems little more than violence for the sake of it another form of pornof course fortune smiles on one boy who manages to escape through a string of unbelievable conveniences his retarded torturer slips on a pair of fingers lying on the floor and shreds himself in half with his own chainsaw after our guy breaks free he finds a snazzy business suit to conceal himself in a glove to cover his severed hand a pistol to shoot bad guys with and an escape car with the keys still in the ignitiontowards the end of the film the violence becomes so random and sensationalized its almost comical as he drives out he happens upon the two girls responsible for his capture and rams into them at full speed a group of young vandals paid with bubblegum cover his ass by smashing in his pursuers heads with rocks and crowbars an unfortunate japanese girl who also escapes the torture chambers spots her mutilated oneeyed reflection and despairingly throws herself in front of an oncoming train and just when you think the bloodbath has run dry he spots the man who killed his best friend follows him into a restroom and slits his throat i guess were supposed to realise that our protagonist has become what he was initially victimized by but if youre like me you will see it as nothing more than a vulgar excuse for mindless eviscerationthis entire film seemed to be fashioned around violence and sex like roth had all these fantasies of different ways in which he could show women with their clothes off and niggling thoughts about the most excruciating way to kill a man and then weaved a script around that the dialogue is pathetic full of numb headed frat boy humour and rainbow hued profanity the acting is quite stilted except maybe during the torture scenes but heck anyone can scream non stop for five minutes the music is cheesy and out of sync with what is happening on screen blasting out ominous tones when their is absolutely nothing ominous about the scenei have not seen cabin fever but i have heard it was made in the same vein ergo i will not be watching it i must seriously discredit eli roths ability as a film director his films have all the half baked emptiness of a porno,cruel
this movie has nothing to do with entertainment it is dull unnecessarily alongated and seems as the first part is a completely different film than the other half it is cruel and sadistic and only recommended for people attended to sado quite boring though cause you see the peoples suffering about 20 minutes and it becomes quite dull hearing the continuous screams the setting unnecessarily breaks down the image of bratislava there wasnt even a nice part of it in the film the city is completely different from its actual state all in all if you would like to spend an hour and a half wondering when you should stop the movie i really recommend it but otherwise definitely not,cruel
i wasnt sure how to rate this filmi had no idea what this movie was about but was board as a 37 yo guy there was initially much to keep my attention as the plot unfolded i dont know if ever i have seen a movie i was more disturded about i literally lost sleep that night with the graphic images it was very terintino did i like the movie well as much as i would say i liked a bad car crash did i like it no would i watch it again no but its kind of like that nasty tasting soup it absolutely disgusts you and you now want other people to feel the same level of pain so i do want you folks to watch it but it will scrape at the darkest side of human nature and leave an impression,cruel
im not looking to be poetic or flowery in this review i have seen some really bad film i went to film school in canada and this by far is the worst waste of celluloid i have ever had the misfortune of witnessing not only does it leave one asking for plenty of terror gore and suspense but it leaves one begging for something  anything remotely resembling texture or talent the only thing it had plenty of was plot holes and breasts the only thing deadly was the pace slow from beginning to end a shift in focus from one main character to the next was unexpected to say the least  and not in a good way i use this dvd as a coaster now to remind myself to that anything connected with eli roth is pure and utter stink and that my 1149 could better be spent on films of substance like ishtar i actually felt guilty for spending money on this film,cruel
i agree with much of what nowonmai42 said but i choose to celebrate those things about the film rather than dismiss it it seems perhaps unsurprisingly that this is a very polarizing movie you either connect with it or you dont to correct one of the observations though paxton does know that the dutch businessman hacked up josh he sees him operating on josh as paxton is being dragged into the warehouseyes roth has made an unpleasant film with unpleasant characters if you saw cabin fever you know that that is quickly becoming a trademark of his thats the point and thats why i enjoyed it truthfully like many others i actually expected to see more violence than there was although im sure im not alone in saying the tendoncutting scene and the eyegasm scene will stay with me for a while roth has made a small triumph here in three ways 1 ill never forget the headline in i believe it was entertainment weekly were all going to hell beats narnia at the box office in a way it reminded me of 15 years ago when nirvana knocked michael jackson out of the top spot on the billboard album chart its nice to see the little guys win roth has created quite a sensation on a 5 million budget nice job especially in a year of bad remakes and overblown sequels2 like romeros nold movies hes made a satire full of social commentary and i think that this film just might have similar staying power like the original texas chainsaw i wouldnt be surprised to see its cult status elevated through the years3 as unpleasant as the film is it does have a happy ending paxton is redeemed by saving the girl something he couldnt do for the drowning girl when he was younger she turns around and saves his life and he gets to avenge his friends killers which may be why tarantino signed off on it pulp fiction was really all about butch and jules redemption and kill bill was about beatrix getting her revenge and getting her daughter back violence aside these are redemption filmsall in all the surprise of the year for me so far,cruel
based on some other reviews  plus the ad campaign i expected an unrelenting gore fest actually this is a very grimm fairy tale pun intended with just enough fantasy and allegory to keep you interested while not losing your lunch thematically this is also a very political film that takes various swipes at the notion of antiamericanism note how jay hernandez bilingual ability unusual for monolingual americans is a plus of course there are many incidents in the movie that are way over the top and highly implausible but again this is a cautionary fairy tale and it sticks to those oldfashioned rules of good evil and retribution while being very entertaining,cruel
genuinely well made as a horror film the locale of the film added to the overall spookiness the acting was right on and i will be thinking about this for a long time to come i have been to that part of the world and am convinced that it must have been filmed on location one can imagine that the people as depicted in the film were capable of just this sort of sick sadism in ways it reminded me of that other fine dutch film the vanishing which incidentally was poorly made as an american and hollywood followup both explore the tragic and sick make up of the leading sadistic characters in these films anyone really interested in the behavior of mentally disturbed people should see this one and be prepared to be shook up,cruel
a group of oversexed college students go on a party fest through europe wind up at a that seems too good to be true or is it see i can write corny tag lines tooanyways in all this was a good moviei will break it down into positives and negativespositives 1realism this could seriously happen small eastern european countries are shady at best these backpackers would probably never be found trust me if you have witnessed the lack of power that embassies actually have particularly the american and canadian you would fall into psychosis travellers are utterly helpless in these situations and by the time the family members report their missing kin no traces of them will be found the villains are not superhuman meaning that they dont magically reappear in front of the fleeing victim like say mike meyers or jason they are regular people and are killed like regular people the lead character whats his face the one that doesnt die reacts appropriately to his situation his survival instincts kick in and for good reason he isnt an uneducated numbskull teeny popper he is on his way to graduate school2dialogue i can seriously see me and my friends behaving and conversing like that drunken debauchery as such but when the shizen hits the fan we would rationalize the situation3restraint they could have went way farther with the violence but they didnt which is good they showed what needed to be shown in order for you to grasp the utter brutality and indifference their captures and customers behaved withnegatives 1this might knock a little bit out of realism but the coincidences that occurred near the end the lead manages to run into all the people that did him wrong and murder them2i had a problem with the fact that they were able to recruit that many into an organization that kidnaps people so others can murder them i mean how many sociopaths can they interview for a job before somebody goes and tells on them in reality i doubt there would be so many people involvedconclusionthe positives out weight the negatives greatly as you can see from my negatives i am just knitpicking i strongly suggest you see this movie,cruel
i wouldnt condemn this movie to saying its a horror its more of a horrorthrillersoft porn flicknow women dont be put off by that my brother watched this movie and lent it to me to watch and he told my husband the first half hour was excellent  typical man watch it and youll see what i mean by thatif its true that a horror flick has to have and i quote from scary movie the obligatory tit shot then this film has them in an abundancethe movie is about three guys on your typical run of the mill road trip around europe they bump into an icelandic guy oli who is alone and the three of them team up to do weed and get laid although they obviously think that the weed and sex they are getting isnt enough so they are told to go to a slovakian town where there is a to die forit really is to die forthe lives up to its reputation within hours they are out partying with knockout girls and having a good time until people start going missing you see one by one the party people start to disappear questions are asked but left unansweredi cant say much more without giving away the whole shebang this is a movie you have to see if you are a fan of cabin fever youll love iteli roth the director is in the process of creating a second helping if the first movie is anything to go by itll be another ride filled with chills spills and not forgetting eyepopping goo,cruel
i had to check spoilers since i couldnt resist reviewing this without giving some parts away but i have not given everything away  perhaps just a little more than one might take from the previews read at your own riski watched the preview for this movie and put off watching it until i was in the right mood if quentin tarantino hadnt been involved in some way i probably would have given it a miss but even though i still didnt think i was up for seeing graphic scenes of sadistic torture i couldnt resist watching itthe first half hour sets up the main characters 2 americans partying in amsterdam with a guy from iceland they just met theyre into normal stuff like getting stoned and getting laid on the advice of a stranger they head off to slovakia where the girls are hot for foreignersas soon as they arrive you get the sense that something isnt right of course i suppose the previews helped with that the scenery is what youd expect from an eastern european country behind the former iron curtain very industrial very bleak but then they find their oasis a with hot chicks a spa a discotheyre in heaventhen each morning they wake up to find that one of them is missing and they cant get in touch with them first the icelander then one of the americans we are shown some of what happens to the victims and while it was hard to watch because of the torturegore factor most of it is actually left up to the imagination of the vieweri was reminded of the torture scene in reservoir dogs as one of the victims sat helplessly in a chair in anticipation of what was surely to come but as tarantino points out in the commentary for that film they never actually show the graphic brutality of the cops ear getting cut off  different torture here but again they dont actually show that although the buildup and the aftermath make your imagination fill in all the blanks so you feel as though you haddo not be misled by these comparisons to reservoir dogs though  the 2 movies are nothing alike beyond what ive already mentioned is definitely more graphic i do have to agree with the poster who said this was more of a thriller than a horror flick the horror is contained and once the lone survivor escapes there is suspense as he tries to get away from the slovakian mob which has obviously enlisted the police in their effortsi see the movie in 3 parts the setup introducing the characters and how they get into the situation the movie is about the terror and the escape the escape is what really saved this movie from being a torturehorror flick  it wasnt like so many horror films where the escape consists of the final 34 minutes,cruel
begin transmissioni watched this film last night without reading any internet comments i wanted to have an unbiased opinion on the whole thing so onwardnow having watched the movie i came online to see what people were saying the typical comment is something like dont see this movie its just sex and torture or not scary at all dont waste your time or this movie was way too violent i couldnt even finish it i will address all three of these in reverse order this movie was way too violent i couldnt even finish it well sorry this movie aint for you what did you think you were going to see unless you were dragged there completely unawares you had to know going in that this is a horrorgore movie i mean you dont go into a movie like spongebob squarepants and then leave the theater complaining there was too much underwater animation do you fact is horrorgore is a genre when working within this genre the idea is to make the bloodiest most disgusting thing ever people who are fans of this genre watch these movies to see spectacular makeup effects large amounts of blood and copious violence if thats not what you want to see go see a different movie you cant call this movie horrible just cuz it was following guidelines of its particular genre i mean when i get roped in by my gf to go see some cheesy romantic comedy like failure to launch for example im not gonna enjoy it but i dont hold the fact that it was full of sappy romantic comedy against it its just not my cup of tea not scary at all dont waste your time now this kind of response i can understand it comes from typical confusion about horror subgenres this film falls into the horror subgenre known as gore this is as opposed to horrorsuspense in a horrorsuspense film the object of the genre is to scare you hence suspense horrorsuspense movies are critiqued by their genre fans based on how scary they were these suspense movies can also be violent and bloody but it is not required it is more important that they be scary likewise in the horrorgore genre the object is to be take a guess hence gore horrorgore films are critiqued by their genre fans based on how disgustingly bloody and disgusting they are the bloodier and more disgusting the better these films can also be suspenseful and scary but it is not requiredso i will assume that the comment im currently ranting on stems from the misconception that all horror films must be scary this is simply not true however i understand where the misconception comes from and understand how one might walk into this movie expecting to be scared and then being disappointed when there were no real joltsdont see this movie its just sex and torturenow heres where i call people stupid ok maybe stupid is a bit harsh but if this is what you thought about the movie then i am accusing you of not reading between the lines you looked at the surface and passed judgment shame on youthe word just in the comment implies that there is no subtext at all that this movie is sex and torture and thats it no i will agree that this movie is sex and torture i dont think anyone can really deny that statement however it was sex and torture with a subtextual purpose what purpose read on the first half of the movie sets up the characters as rowdy postcollege types everything we see them do in the first half is in the quest for pussy they see europe as a place where they can freely indulge in their sexual wants and fantasies they even go as far as to repeatedly attempt to buy sex as a commodity the one character josh who refuses to indulge in paying for sex gives the audience a moral reference even as everyone else around seems to have no moral qualms about prostitution josh doesnt like the idea of buying fleshnow suddenly the tables are turned these kids who were first looking to buy sex as a commodity now become the commodity themselves the duality here is nicely illustrated in the two hallway shots the first being in the amsterdam brothel the second being in the torture house the shots are basically the same except one hallway has rows of rooms with sex taking place and the other has rooms with torturei found a line in a review that i really liked here it is roth by presenting his characters as victims of the same world of fleshforfantasy they were grooving on in the first place digs deep into the nightmare of a society ruled by the profit of illicit desire  owen gleiberman entertainment weekly now if thats not your cup of tea thats your personal opinion does it warrant a recommendation that nobody ever see this movie again of course not just because you dont like a movie doesnt make it a bad moviepersonally i dont like gone with the wind i think its long and boring with nothing in it that i wanna see does that make it a bad movie of course not i recognize it as a masterpiece of cinema despite my personal opinion that it was long and boringi liked this movie its not the best horror movie ever but it was the best newish horror movie ive seen in recent years was this even the goriest movie ive ever seen no way this movie is really disgusting but its not the most disgusting thing ever as many seem to believe for even more disgusting see cannibal holocaustend transmission,cruel
wow i was really surprised to find that so many people hated this movie i kind of loved it i guess a lot of the criticism is due to the fact that its not wall to wall blood from the get go well that and the characters dont seem that likable on the surface now i love blood and guts as much as the next girl and im the type that usually cheers for the bad guys to kill kill kill i found that i actually wanted paxton to get away at the end and was afraid that roth would kill him off anyway why would i root for such an ass you might ask because i know that guy i think everyone knows that guy hes the frat boy that you laugh with despite the fact that hes a jerk hes the guy who always tries to act cool because of his insecurities an comes off looking like and absolute tool yeah he kinda reminds me of my youngest brother  too much swagger but basically good at heart so yeah i rooted for the bastard despite myself the other thing i really liked about the movie and it is a movie not a film is the parallel of the beginnings hedonistic candyland full of hookers and drugs and any taboo fantasy you could possibly want right there at your fingertips to that of the ends gruesome house of horrors where experiencing the ultimate taboo is simply another matter of price the fact that the brothels hallway with each door revealing yet another sexual indulgence so eerily resembles that of the factorys hallway with each door revealing yet another insane horrific act of murder as a not so subtle comment on todays culture was not lost on me sex and violence is so intermingled in todays way of thinking that sometimes its hard to tell the two apart they seem to go hand in hand our characters at the beginning only see their actions as a great story to relate to others after they get back to real life they dont see any of the women as actual people just a part of a good yarn when the tables are turned and they are treated as so much meat um pun intended its nice to see that someone learned a lesson i mean paxton did go back for the screaming girl when he very easily could have gotten the hell outta dodge it was nice to see that under all the bravado and bad behavior there was an actual human being someone i could get behind thus when it came to the revenge sequence i didnt feel bad for clapping of course maybe im fooling myself and just wanted to see more blood could beall in all i really enjoyed this movie i liked the slow build the foreshadowing the switcheroo from one main character to another with little warning and the utter creepiness of the whole premise my husband liked the boobies go figure,cruel
this movie is so stupid and tasteless that i dont know why i gave it such a high rating 3 outa 10 is really pushing it and i only gave it a 3 because i thought id show a little respect to those actors who had to put up with the crappy directing and totally crappy plot linenow i will explain my reasoning behind my 3 outa 10 ratingthis movie is supposed to be scary its not even close to scary its simply disgusting and totally tasteless it was so bad that after the movie was over i took it out of my dvd player and played frisbee with it btw dvds can take a lot of abuse it took more than 3 tries to bust it against my living room wall lol i guess i was expecting something a little more intelligent and entertaining after listening to all the hype my roommate put into it man ya gotta see this its so cool note to self dont listen to the roommates advice after this debacle lolto me a good horror movie needs a plot that breaks some new ground does break new ground its unfortunate that the new ground was more tasteless gore in an era where tasteless gore takes the place of intelligent plots and villains with style in horror movies this movie has no style at all its just sick i wish the director would take some cues from see no evil now that movie has some style and the gore isnt needlessly wasted it actually serves a purpose in the plot and the villain is genuinely scary and very capable of giving ya the creeps and thats what a good horror movie needsi could go on all day about this stinking pile of horse manure thats supposed to be a horror movie but i already wasted 23 hours of my life watching the movie and writing my lessthanenthusiastic opinion of the movies merits if i ever catch my kids watching friday the 13th or nightmare on elm street i would probably condone that if i catch them sneaking into my house or any other house for that matter they will spend more time being grounded than most convicted felons prison sentences and they would also have write a 10 page essay to me on why its crap and convince me that they have seen the error of their ways before i allow them a taste of freedom ever again i would want my kids to make intelligent choices when it comes to horror movies and to me intelligent and cannot be used in the same sentence,cruel
two american college buddies backpack across europe and wind up at in a slovakian town which is advertised as a nirvana for travelers there they encounter all sorts of exotic women willing to do their bidding but theres a darker aspect of this place that they only learn about too lateis your typical sadistic horror film offering enough gore and scares for the audience the premise is pretty creepy and the execution is very effective eli roth is really good at directing horror movies he doesnt mind going over the top and hes pretty good at building suspense his story telling skills are a little weak though the first forty five minutes or so was a good opportunity to build on the premise however roth just inserted dull dialog and idiotic scenes that didnt really have a point if anything it just made the audience hate the main characters after the really slow start the movie picks up and becomes more exciting the death scenes are ridiculously over the top yet still very scary to watchwhile these torture scenes are occurring there is still no sign of a story it was really just a bunch of torture scenes strung together without a story but with a lot of style i still liked the movie but it was kind of pointless the characters are pretty weak as well they were your typical college students annoying loud and rude still it was hard not to feel sorry for them when they were being murdered very few people deserve to be murder that way so it was easier to root for their survival some people may have difficulty in doing that thoughthe acting is okay nothing special jay hernandez and derek richardson play the two americans and they both give decent performances the rest of the actors were a bunch of unknowns and no one really stood out despite the movies vacant story the film still showed some scary real life situations the whole torture chamber thing is probably a stretch but the fact that people are willing to pay to kill other people is a pretty sick thought it shows that some people may appear harmless yet have a very twisted side to them also near the end of the film paxton hernandez is portrayed as a hero for saving a girl and for getting revenge on a bunch of people after escaping he could have just left and forgotten about the people who put him there but he went after them it shows that someone without a disturbing side can still murder after being near death themselves or maybe im just looking into the movie too much in the end is worth checking out for horror fans just dont expect a lot of substance rating 610,cruel
received some really bad reviews some of them claiming it to be one of the dumbest films of 2005 i do not know where you spent your last year folks but suppose it was not at the pictures because when i last checked there was a real shtstorm of much much dumber movies going on in cinemas but then again here in germany the usual hollywood crap is accompanied by even worse german productions full of fabulous new young actors that all make you want to scratch out your eyes and fill your ears with burning hot lead and finally say crack open your own skull and eat your own brainsaccidentally the slovakian torture house in eli roths is very much like a german movie theatre only the scratching and cracking is done for you the story is simple two americans come to europe accompanied by an icelandic friend they enjoy the two foundations that made europe what it is today drugs and girls in the netherlands they meet a guy who promises them more drugs and girls somewhere near bratislava they go there and end up in a death trap until the torture house sequence the viewer has to endure  enjoy a load of party fun and sex scenes there is a lot of stupid jokes and bare breasts in this the somewhat uninteresting second act is about the guys wandering around in town sensing something strange going on and one by one disappearing the third act is straightforward disgusting miike torture action and mr miike even does a short cameo here there is some good suspense in this part and of course a motherload of gorei guess received most of its bashing for being a movie with the name tarantino attached to it while not being a tarantino movie do not be fooled does one thing very well and that is to entertain and to keep up your interest for the whole length of the movie and that is precisely where most american horror flicks fail today it is a good mixture of old italian horror fulci style and modern japanese extreme horror it strays from the boring scream and i know what you did blah concept of having one villain with some trademark outward appearance but presents a bunch of nameless multinational businessmen given the opportunity to let out the darkest parts of the human soul the need to torture and kill which normally resides inside a sleeping repressed part of your mind is the real antagonist here that idea the sheer possibility of human beings paying to torture and kill another human being is what fascinated me most about even beyond the extreme scenes of violence that said i have to admit that often looks kinda cheap effects are all well done but camera and lighting are nothing to get excited about to put it mildly the score is subpar often even annoying and very cheap and cheesy acting ranges from okay to good surprisingly with brilliant performances by eythor gudjonsson and jan vlasak all in all if you are into horror flicks go and see this one it is vastly entertaining brutal and fun at the same time,cruel
im not a horror movie fan im also one of those who doesnt appreciate a lot of violence and nudity in films i focus on the film making acting and story i dont try to judge acting in scary movies because how am i to tell how a person would honestly react to such beastly situations but i thought the acting was fine now where the story and photography go it is outstanding you realize early on who the bad guys are what isnt clear is their purpose and their plan not to mention that many of them are only connected by the organization they belong to it isnt until right near the final chase scene that you really know what is going onchase scenes annoy me this one was perfect there were just enough obstacles but always a believable escape and as paxton makes his way from the factory he runs into everyone that he encountered on the way poetic justice flows forward like sweet wine right down to the last perverted thrill seeker even the young asian girl receives a form of justice i really felt she should have been put out of her misery instead of saved im not materialistic but how would she get by being deformed in such a way and then considering the liability she is in escaping her death not only saved her from more pain but helped the main character make his escape and avenge his friends deathi thought it was perfect great story the story really could have stood on its own and thats what i think makes it so nice,cruel
i dont know exactly how old most of the people commenting on this film are but i think some folks dont seem to realize that a lot of guys in my age group 23 are like the characters in the movie itself i saw it as almost a commentary on not only how americans are viewed by the rest of the world but also as how we kind of act in other countries the end i felt like the tables were turned towards the fact that no matter how hedonistic these kids were that the guys with money turned out to be the real hedonists anyway i thought this film was great it had all the trappings of a movie i enjoy nudity  thats right admit it violence gorerevenge and even eli roths subtle sense of humor the lighting in the torture chambers really brought you in to the picture the surprise cameo of takashi miike made me almost jump outta my seat all in all i really thought this movie was amazing eli roth did it again,cruel
the horror genre has been on somewhat of the decline of the past few years with movies such as alone in the dark and feardotcom however this movie was creepy and totally effective i hadnt heard of cabin fever till recently meaning i havent heard of eli roth till the release of this movie but man does he have a mean recipe for horror if you want to be scared out your wits and have your stomach churn see this movie if you are the squeemish type than dont and this may be a spoiler but as its obvious this movie is jammed packed with gore and torture so be at risk when watching one thing is for sure i am never going backpacking or just in general travel outside of canadamy home country after viewing this movie people have been calling eli roth sick and twisted but as i might be called nuts for this no hes not hes brilliant he knew exactly how to fire up a frightening story an a grade a horror movie by my standards scared the crap outta me and my friends and just to add im a big fan of blood and gore but even this movie had me shielding my eyes keep it up eli i look foreward to your next project 810,cruel
the trailer promised us a new standard in modern horror a new wave where extreme violence would be shown uncompromised with characters and situations that disturb you so much it gets you vomiting your way out of the theater a horror unlike anything you ever saw before and what a horrible film it wasnever ever did i saw a film so uninteresting and so boring before a film that has no idea what genre it wants to be the amount of gore in this flick is extremely low and the gore that is supposed to be gory is so ugly and comic style it isnt disturbing at all it makes you laughafter 40 mins of tidies you dont give a f about the characters for the good and worse normally you feel for a character so you dont want them to be tortured or you hate them so much you cant wait to see it well this had none of both and the concept is so awesome what is that place the only good thing of the movie the place itself but what do we know or find out about it nothing we get a cheesy escape flick i want to find out why they are tortured and what the intention is of the people involved this film has some good moments but those are just not enough to make this a total failurewaste of our time 2 better be much better or i never watch a eli roth film again,cruel
i thought that the film on the whole was very good a few dodgy parts here and there for example people in holland speak dutch not german but other than that i had no major qualms about the filmit starts off in holland where 2 american backpackers josh and pax and there drifter friend oliare having the time off their lives getting high on pot and the beautiful ladies they get locked out of their and cause upset to the local people when they are called up to a flat where a lad called alexei lives he tells them about a in bratislava slovakia where there is women by the shed load willing to do anything with three strapping lads like themselves and being american well accept for oli the king of swingwho is the viking equivalent of casanova in this film the women of slovakia would fall at their feet this said they up and legged it to slovakia well actually they got a train but that is besides the point on the train they come across a man who takes a shine to our young josh and upset pax by eating with his fingers cos that is a crime in some quarters of the worldthey finally get to slovakia and it is exactly like alexei had described of course but thats where the strange events unfold oli is dancing with a girl from holland i think but in the morning has left with one of the japanese girls he is later seen with his head stuck to a chair and the japanese girl is getting her toes clippedjosh and pax meanwhile are tanked up on booze and josh becomes so intoxicated he goes for a lie down and wakes up in a torture chamber jesus that would be some dream this is where he discovers our finger eating friend from the train who along with others is aroused by torture pax is the last man standing and he goes to the shop of horrors and almost gets served up with lettuce when some weirdo comes at him with a chainsaw but he gets away finds the other japanese girl who was having a date with a blow torch but when they get to the train station she sees her reflection in a glass sign post and jumps in front of a train like you would you know so not even this can stop our gallant hero pax he gets on the train and is just relaxing with a nice sambucca when he hears the man that was on the train the last time he was he follows him to a mens room and does the business at hand giving him a taste of his own medicine but then the credits roll and i was left wondering what that ending was all about maybe someone knows but i didnt,cruel
the movie is about three guys who while on vacation to europe they go to a small town in slovekia hearing that there women are hot and down for whatever they end up getting a little more than they bargained for and are faced with a sinister reality that seems what hell must look like will they get out of hell you must see it to find outi definitely recommend this movie if you are the kind of person that likes scary movies it has all the horror you can ask for in a scary movie however if you are the kind of person that likes his movies meticulously thought out you are sure to find some minor flaws in this movie which could tamper with your opinion of it this all said and done the movie is a great improvement in horror movie i cant wait for what eli roth directs next why not 2 eli i proudly give this movie a 9 out of 10,cruel
with director eli roth set out to make the most horrifying film that he could prerelease announcements promised that the film would be wild ultra violent sick and disturbing and close in tone to takeshi miikes audition or tobe hoopers texas chainsaw massacre the wonderful marketing including a suitably grimy website and the inclusion of industry whore tarantinos name on publicity material suggested that the film would be a milestone in grindhouse horror expectations were high to say the leastsadly roth has failed in every way possible to achieve his goal the result is a good example of how a great premise can be thrown away by a poorly developed script and bad directionthe story follows three backpackers who travel to bratislava in order to find a in which the women are reputedly super hot and up for sex 247 the guys soon wish that they had followed their original plan to go to barcelona when one by one they are abducted taken to a charnel house and attacked by sickos who have payed for the pleasure of inflicting pain misery and deatha talented writer and director could have crafted a gruelling terror classic from this interesting premise but eli roth is neither and he screws up from the word go the first 45 minutes or so roughly half the total running time is spent following the sexploits of the three young men as they sample the delights of amsterdamn there is plenty of nudity but nothing that can be classed as wild sick or disturbing in the next 15 minutes we follow the annoying trio to the titular where we get more nudity and absolutely no horrorfinally roth decides he has had enough of filming tits and ass and begins the bloodletting for a while the film delivers on its promisesthe backpackers are abducted one by one and we get to witness some great gore courtesy of makeup maestros greg nicotero and howard berger leg drilling tendon slicing chainsaw slashing and assorted bloody gunshots drench the screen with bloodhowever it is not long before the film enters the realms of idiocy again with the escape of the final backpacker having freed himself and made his way to a car undetected it even has the key in the ignition our plucky survivor turns back to rescue someone he hardly knowsa japanese girl he met the day before who is already being worked over by a maniac with a blowtorch from this point onwards any semblance of logic and plausibility goes out the window and the audience is treated to a trio of classic unintentionallyfunny moments the threeinone hitandrun the street children attacking the bad guys in exchange for bubblegum and the tragic suicide by speeding trainwith eli roth citing the vanishing sympathy for mr vengeance henry portrait of a serial killer and the wicker man as influences one does wonder what the hell he was thinking whilst making a film that has absolutely nothing in common with these masterpieces is entertaining in a hokey waytits ass guts and blood are classic schlock horror elements and all score points with mebut it is far from the gruelling and relentless shocker that roth had promised to deliver,cruel
disgusting brilliant a true horror movie eli roth is now one of my all time favorite directors with this film he gets all the true elements horror movies have this is one of my all time favorite films i loved cabin fever and expected no less from this movie but i got more eli roth has been one of my huge inspirations to go to film school and become a film director i have to warn you though it is pretty gross but it is one hell of a movie the first forty five minutes there is quite a bit of nudity but its all part of the plot trust me u will enjoy this movie seeing this in the theater i was scared to death but now that i see eli has more movies coming out im so excited hes right there with wes craven and alexandre aja on horror movie directing possibly better 910,cruel
well the director really stands out on a limb in this onea limb on the end of a bloody stump that is contemporary horror artists seem to by trying desperately to recapture the singular sensation engendered by texas chainsaw massacre which when compared to tobe hoopers other films seems to be a masterful fluke if you ask me something which is stumbled upon like a diamond sitting in the dirt and cannot be achieved againweve had tension wolf creek and now and inspecting the whole process here its hard to figure out why these films fail by comparisonbut they do sure i winced during some of the more grisly scenes but the primal horror i felt during tcm was nowhere in sight the sadism in tcm was far more brutal and alien the victims were reduced to absolute and sheer panic without a shred of composure left to themwhich is what blind insatiable sadism wantsblind and insatiable fear the victims in the most recent horror films still maintained an element of heroism the final twist in tension was kind of a copout if you ask melike the writer was retracing his steps to cover up a stalling plot line all this says to me is that the writer and director seem unwilling to cross the line into true horror and opted to save a shred of hope for their audiencewhich may be satisfying on one leveland yet we all still compare them to the shrieking nightmare of tcm shake our heads and wonder what happened to the good ol days,cruel
this movie was very intense and almost a relief when it was over people from other countries should not be offended by this movies setting americans film many movies in many locationsyes even in america and we all know its a fantasy not real duh overall this was a nailbiter and i had to close my eyes 2x that rarely ever happens great job eli roth the setting was in fact beautiful and the scenes in amsterdam were great a part two would be welcomed with open arms unforgettable i was wondering if this story were made up entirely or perhaps based somewhat on fact i know in america we had a few instances of similar actual events so please do not think this question is aimed at any particular countrynation,cruel
quentin tarentino is a fan of eli roth the director of i can see why this movie is similar to tarentinos from dusk to dawn if you have seen that movie then i need say no more i am not a fan of horror in general but tarentinos name was on the dvd case so i had to give it a try i imdbd it after enjoying it and wanted to know more about roth i was not disappointed has a european flavor but american panache the mix of american and european actors from iceland to czechoslovakia adds depth to this movie this movie has it all suspense horror nudity oh those european babes are fine and you get caught up in the action the element of reality is what brings it home roth is able to bring transylvania back to life in a daring way if you have traveled or are going to travel europe and stay at youth s then this movie will add an element you have never considered having backpacked and bicycled parts of europe via s i am glad i saw this movie after the fact i am a lot older now but this movie is so well done that it stirred a lot of memories of my youth the special effects and makeup are excellent and their is a great group of k well see for yourself executive producer tarentino knows how to pick them he knows talent when he sees it roth started making shorts at the age of 8 according to the imdb database and he is an intelligent and up and coming directorwriter kill the car is a multiangle interactive feature that you should take the time to watch before the movie this is the first multiangle 3 separate cameras interactive i have seen and i enjoyed switching from one to the other it really lets you appreciate how a director can add intensity to a scene with the right angle i also recommend you watch the featurette documentary of the film as it was being made dissected which is directed by gabriel roth elis brother gory yes but the writerdirector roth is able to add a reality to the plot that is not often present in your average horror movie this movie is not an average horror movie if cute busty nudesand gore arent your thing then dont bother with this movies portrayal of art of the horror genre,cruel
slovakia without men joke  because of some war but which is that war really the nazilike police is funny too when was it last time tarantino visited slovakia howerer the party feeling is huge at the beginning girls in hordes pity that it s followed by some boring and unsavory thing anyway its not a real horror movie for sure beautiful girls and gorgeous tits but nothing more i think tarantino has a lot of better movies than this and whatever why must i write 10 sentences i am out of words  so that unsavory scenes are very bloody the last laceration the only one what i like really like if you see this film i think you will be know why  i am sorry but my not too well english is getting from bad to worse very apropos soundtracks every one of slovak girls speak really sweet english and articulation i like these car which in this movie but i think the really slovak cars are must be skoda and finally i beg to remark  this is my first comment in imdb please do not hate me  i am through with this comment and try submit it is maybe reach that minimum of 10 lines ,cruel
its not a great film but its a lot better than the current imdb ratings show sure theres a lot of sadistic violence and things dont make sense all the time but i found the weirded humor to my taste and definitely fitting the movie the movie starts off in a sort of traditional teen horror movie fashion but luckily as it speeds along it gains some momentum and doesnt lose any slovakia is definitely not such a dark and perverse place  and neither are all americans so stupid but its so nice to see the idiot get his due mmmmm and the ending is well fitting like a sawed off leg on a circus dwarfi loved it would have given it a 10 if everything else about would have been a bit more professional,cruel
spoilers i think the real punch for me was the fact that this kind of organised sadist rings could be reality this is the horror twist never mind the gore and special effects weve seen all that before and the special effects werent the best ive seeni thought the opening chapters where we get to know the characters were ok it kind of reminded me of the beach in that they have to search for this wonderful paradise type place where the girls throw themselves at any americans but they werent doing too badly in amsterdam either so with their greedy lustful natures aroused they follow up the trail given by the dutch manto start off i thought the more reserved man would be the surviver as he didnt have the same zeal for skirt chasing as his friends he seemed the more decent but he ends up as the failed surgeons plaything and the tortured man who had failed in his childhood to save a drowning girl was the one to survive and try to save the chinese girl who else would have gone back in another film i compared it to was my little eye  in that the poor suckers were at the mercy of a highly organised group who paid to watch the housemates demise one by one only in the paying sadists get to do the torturing raping and killing themselves all for the right price americans being the most expensivecant figure out why that is though the film did wimp out a bit towards the end got a bit cheesy i mean what are the chances that when hes escaping in the car he sees an opportunity to mow down not only the two girls who seduced and drugged them but the sly dutch man who sent them there in the first placeadmit it was a satisfying moment thoughid have liked to see what happens next how did he blow the whistle on them etc i mean hes back from backpacking minus some fingers and best friendbut someones i spoke to thinks they might do a sequel i like to see closure,cruel
nudity sex drugs gore and violence if youre looking for a movie that has all those elements then look no further than which has got them all written and directed by eli roth and given the stamp of approval from quentin tarantino this film doesnt shy away from being seen as promoting a decadent lifestyle and making fun of stereotypical euros and yankees the horny and the stoned getting their just dessertsthe movie tells the story of three backpackers going around europe living from to indulging in sex and drugs we meet them in amsterdam and accompany them to coffee shops for that high from weed as well as visiting its famed fish tanks didnt know what the interior looked like until today from the movie yeah what did you think and yes those fish tanks which you see from the movie are what you get though you can try whipping out your camera and see what will happen to you p anyway our trio are getting bored with the ahem taste of europe and are seeking something different they meet up with a pimp who recommends them a slovakian city to indulge in where the chicks will do anything for the right amount of money tempted the trio really made their way there surely youve learnt enough not to trust strangers but i guessed they thought with their other head instead and checked into the where it simply is gratuitous nudity galore with beautiful easy chicksso while the first half of the movie focused on them getting their rocks off the gore and violence didnt arrive until the second half where one by one our friends disappear under mysterious circumstances they get locked up in some strange cell and get tortured you begin to wonder exactly what is happening behind closed doors but i wont spoil it for you suffice to say that while it might initially seem like saw with its enigmatic psychopath calling the shots this film offered a more stripped down version to the madness no elaborate games just brutal simplicity picking from available weapons of choice like the scissors knives hammers pliers scalpel chainsaw pistol you get the driftmost of the violence happen off screen  your imagination is left to work what exactly is happening given cues from the helpless screams and the mechanics of the tools of death the gore department isnt stinged upon and there are enough blood spewing dripping flowing to keep the blood lust factor up but there is one detectable cut in the movie which i thought didnt really mar the sadistic enjoyment if i can say this of the moviehowever there is a reasonable logical explanation to all these happenings though and youll share with the pain of the victims and wonder in reality if such an underground thingy perhaps could exist i mean why not and theres a satisfying ending to this movie too there are no losers or winners but the last 15 minutes are filled with so much gore the squeamish will find it hard to tolerate and without spoiling it for you i particularly liked two scenes then which involves vehicles the first one is one that is seldom seen in a movie while the second one is perhaps as close to the real thing as possible without me being a witness to the eventi sound sick i know but then thats what this movie is satisfyingly sick,cruel
couldnt wait to see this after hearing so much about it had read a few bad reviews and some pretty good ones so decided to give it a go today i had been told that the beginning had plenty of topless women and that the three main guys were good times guys out for free sex with anything and everything why did the one guy seem to have a thing about his ex yet soon got down to it at the seems a bit of an odd thing to add to the storyline when it made no difference to the way he acted about forty minutes into the film i was feeling a bit let down as usual an american film with fresh looking good looking slim people who arent too bright but it does get better the one torturer seemed a bit odd and kept hyperventilating and eventually gets killed the achilles heel part was pretty gory and i couldnt help saying yuck and it gorierthe oriental girl and the eye part was pretty gory and i laughed at the scene with the people waiting for the train and how they get splattered with blood when she jumps in front of the traingreat bit and the guy in the car when his head was being smashed by the stones one of the bits looked really realistic i love a good horror film or a scary film and would probably watch this again but do feel it was over hyped in the adverts about it tarantino should stick to the kind of films he is famous for this wont be one of them the ending in my view could mean maybe a second one they have his passport so know him and may follow him to kill him rather than him tell people about the killingspolice etc etc,cruel
why dont have any expectations well when i first heard about this film i was led to believe like so many others that this film was all about torture and gore its not i later learned that this film has lots of female nudity it doesso is this film simply about nudity and a touch of horror only no confused you wont be huh  ok i will explaini watched this film on the second day of release in the uk my expectations of the film were one thing and on coming out of the movie my realisation was differentthe film starts in a seemingly cheesy way that any teen horror might start and you begin to think to yourself i thought this film was supposed to be different to all that rubbish bear with it the tide will turn soon enoughin the mean time enjoy the jokes the humour and the female nudity for the ladies dont worry its not gratuitous this comedy show lasts for a good proportion of the film and you start to wonder where the gore comes init will and when it does dont expect too much of it it only happens in bits and pieces but its certainly gory although having said that its not as gory as i expected it to bethats probably thanks to the hypewhen the action starts though it really shines through and you become more and more involved with the lead character the director certainly has us by the short and curlies as the film progressesfor me the escape and chase scenes really grabs youthe acting is good and strong i really have no complaints the film left for me a strange feeling i left the cinema asking myself was that one of the best horror films i have ever seen well i would have to answer yes if you take horror in its real formthink texas chain saw massacre hannibal silence of the lambs saw etcit is one of the bestpersonally i think films like sixth sense 13 ghosts and the upcoming the darkare more terrifying due to the spine tingling that occurs but really is a great horror flick yet its not just about the goreits so much more than that and i think the hype around the gore aspect has done the film an injusticeis the film worth seeing though yes and yes again go and see it,cruel
when i viewed i was thinking along the lines of saw and i was rightin fact i thought it was a better movie it contains quite graphic and disturbing scenes but what held me was the atmosphere an eastern european setting was perfect for this movie yes it contained elements that youll find in any horrorcrazy teenagers etc but it was this same setting and atmosphere that had me glued if it was shot in the us id probably not like it so much i recommend you give this a watch and then tell me if you would like to visit a strange slovakian town in your next vacation trip however the story couldve had a bit more meat in it and probably no teenagers,cruel
is very much like two movies in onethe college male fantasy eurotrip followed by a psychotic deluge of raw torture the story line is rather simplistic not in a bad way void of any intricate plot twists tension buildups and surprise endings not much thinking is needed to follow this movie it is obvious that the director eli roth is very influenced by filmmaker takashi miikes work because miike has a cameo in and this movie follows the same time line format as one of miikes films audition as with audition is rather tame for the first 34 of the movie and then the gorefest mercilessly comes at you full force for the last 30 minutes it seems others try to compare with the two saw movies i totally disagree where saw and saw ii are more of a psychological mind thriller that keep you guessing is just raw torture that makes youdisgusted the real horror of is that the main reason for the torture is based on actual events to think that something like this takes place in the real world is very scary and sick the one actor i enjoyed seeing in this film if only for a few minutes was rick hoffman he seems to perfect the character who we all would love to beat the hell out of in the movie cellular he personified the prick lawyer type he brings that same characters traits to this role in a refreshing twisted way if anything definitely pushes the envelope on how far a film can go to show you mindless torturous gore i cant put it any simpler than that,cruel
i must say i was seriously considering leaving this awful flick before it ended i was constantly trying to find the plot there isnt one waiting for something like a surprise or a really unexpected twist nothing there either and eventually just wanted to see how they were going to end this disastertrotting out of the theater i heard comments like  huh and who could be so bored as to write something like this etci honestly feel at ease saying that this is a movie i do not recommend to anyone its so called scary parts are no existent its not even trying to scare you simply trying to get you to have a puking contest with the stars of the filmi hear people comparing horror films in forums here and saying that this is a winner compared to stuff like the grudge and others i really think that they are full of it the grudge scared me simply made me look at my watch all the timea waste of time money and maybe a good meal,cruel
impressed me it takes its sleaze and violence as far as you can go with an rrating it feels like a euro film and even has a europornrocco siffredilike atmosphere the women are hot and slutty the menace is mute witness pushed to its outer boundaries and the gore is realistic and nasty takeshi miike has literally a walkon and there are nods to satos naked blood lados night train murders and the texas chainsaw remake at times the music is unnecessarily dramatic next time eli trust your images a bit more theyre strong enough to resonate the plot is simple two americans and an icelander travel to eastern europe to meet women who will put out instead they become the playthings of businessmen who pay good money to experience murder works because it breaks contemporary movie rules and takes 70s exploitation for its moral compass it is dirty direct and defiant roth opts to shoot everything plainly and clearly his style is not invasive he builds a strong murky atmosphere of dread and keeps on punching until the very last frame there hasnt been an american movie like this for a very long time,cruel
i saw this movie on quentin tarantinos recommendation alone  apparently the previews of it scared my entire friend network and family away everyone said too gross too scary which i think are perfectly great reasons to see a horror flick having read many interviews with tarantino one of which in fangoria i figured he has similar tastes with me and so i figure if hes presenting im paying to see it on the big screenstarts out with three friends two american one icelandic staying at a in amsterdam sex drugs and jokes ensue actually the portrayal of the american postundergrads is one of the better representations ive seen usually the kids are really dumb and all cookiecutter the same so it was refreshing to see some kids that i probably would have known in collegei should warn the setup to the gore and horror is slowcoming because i think roth really wants you to like his characters i didnt find the beginning set up to drag at all but i know many horror fans will because they want to see the violence right off the batwhen the gore and horror do begin they dont disappoint following a promise for some of the sexiest and easiest women in the world the trio travel to a slovakia where they have a pretty good time before one of them disappears what is this place and why are they killing kids i already knew because id seen tarantino and roth interviewed on late night if you know the basic premise it will be pretty easy to figure out whats going onthe gore is excellent and expertly done id like to consider myself a connoisseur of horror makeup and this was perfect for me not too overthetop not to stingy if you were disappointed in not seeing anything sawed off in saw then watch this also to note there are many tarantinio directorial touches in the filmits like he said eli wouldnt it be great if you did this with that shotetc so well directed is what im saying  great camera work was donethe movies ending took a bit of an unexpected turn for me but that is because i was expecting something really wacky for an ending roth did do cabin fever but there is no wackiness thereactually its pretty damn seriousthe acting was pretty good for a group of unknowns and thank god they didnt use another blist tv star getting sick of thatif youre going to see a horror movie on the big screen this is the one to see im glad i took quentins recommendation,cruel
may contain spoilers you have been warned the gore in the movie and the torture scenes were more than most american audiences are used to for sure but the story was very predictable for the most part in fact the premise behind the story was not much different than that used for the movie the game or the novel the most dangerous game nothing new here really plotwisesecondly the protagonists walk right into things that any sane person would run like hell from because 999 of the people in this world would realize something was amiss an art exhibit in a rundown freaking factory looking place give me a break basically for the story to work you have to have dumb asses as pseudoheroesi also thought the movie was more about voyeuristic viewing of the audience watching torture and murder should say a lot about our societyin the end as a horror movie the plot was thin the story was a recycled one with a different twist the main good guy characters are all idiots and the ending of one left standing is pretty well predictable the only thing this movie provides is very graphic violence usually not seen in american theaters,cruel
this is absolutely the worst film i have seen in my life the first half of the movie is overtly sexual and viewers are forced to sit through pornography without being warned first the second half gets worse this movie goes from pointless and silly to pointless ridiculous and far too gory i just saw casanova and cannot believe that film unfairly was rated r just like hostile i firmly believe that hostile should be rated nc17 for its pornography language and disgusting gore viewers arent warned that what they are about to see is filth i never would have seen this movie if id known what it was like at the end you feel youve been punished by watching the movie and there is no real end to it nothing is accomplished and you leave feeling as though youve missed something i strongly warn against seeing this movie because you too may become hostile after seeing it,cruel
spoiler alert spoiler alert three guys head to slovakia to party nothing says good times like slovakia they get a tip that the women there will do anything they want next stop slovakia it turns out that they were misinformed actually its the sadists there who will do whatever they want to them the theyre staying at is running a special on torturing horny backpackers for a reasonable price the local freaks can have their way with the lousy touristsis a fine horror flick i was pleased there is plenty of blood gore and general sickness here to please any horror fan the first half of the movie has the guys partying down in europe with various topless women once they get their hot tip on the compliant slovakian ladies the movie clearly illustrates the danger of taking travel advice from someone you just met the in slovakia turns out to be a slaughterhouse of wayward tourists the last half of the movie has many fine gore scenes as the sadists go to workbesides its large amount of gore effects also has an abundance of female nudity i was very happy to see so many unnecessary naked breasts in a mainstream horror flick this movie does not skimp on the exploitation its got blood guts breasts and guys in doctor outfits torturing people yeah delivers the goods its worth a look,cruel
eli roth has created a bloody masterpiece that will hold the test of time when family friendly pg13 horror films snip the nuts of the genre im happy someone has the balls to create such shocking images the story was simple but effective we follow three horny tourists in europe who travel to a small town whose population consists of lonely female locals who all happen to look like playboy playmates good deal right except for the fact that there is also giant eurotrash killers who have more torture devices then abu ghraib and dont take fondly to americans it was shot stylishly and not in that annoying sort of way where the director requests a 360 degree camera move for no reason other then it might look cooli would recommend this film to anybody who can stomach ichi the killer,cruel
jay hernandez and derek richardson play paxton and josh two collage grads who are going on a last sex and drug binge through europe before going back to the us and going into law school and getting trapped in a life of privilege and excess that most people in the world can only dream about poor lads who can blame them for wanting to get down with their decadent selves these two are the classic ugly americanswith their brash ways and million  mega watt smiles they stand out among the inhabitants of eastern europe like  americansso these fellows are assholesfor the first half of the story its all fun and gameswhile back packing it through europe they encounter a wild and crazy guy named ole from iceland played by eythor gudjonsson who surely must have studied steve martin and they all embark on an adventure in new amsterdam while there some eurotrash type points them to a town in slovakia where when women hear american accents they fall over on their backs and beg for sex sound too good to be true it is because this is a horror film where trips gone horribly wrong rule huzzah were off on the road to  well somethingvania and like any country ending in vania you can bet its got some nasty pitfallsat first its great the far from being some dirty dingy little flea trap is in a gorgeous building reeking of old european charm where you must have roommates but it so happens theyre female with large breasts who are constantly changing their clothes and urging you to join them in the coed spa downstairs where men and woman can sit around and sweat au natural before you know it theyre all in bed together and it seems the boys have found nirvana sound too good to be true it is because this is a horror movie and if someone is having great sex can a grisly death be far behind pretty soon though they wake up after making the sign of the twobacked beast all night long with their sexy if slightly off girlfriends minus ole and thats when things start to go seriously wrong our boys arent without a conscience or feelings of affection for ole so there follows a fruitless search during which paxton and josh are drugged by the girls one night at a club paxton wakes up on the floor of the bathroom in the club but the hapless josh the more sensitive of the two on the rebound after a broken love affair wakes up handcuffed to a chair in what seems to be a filthy dungeon naked except for his briefs a man dressed as a surgeon enters the room says hes always wanted to perform surgery and you can imagine the restin the mean time paxton twigs to the fact something is terribly wrong and becomes obsessed with finding his friend he goes to the police who of course do nothing except take note of the missing american and then he reluctantly enlists the aid of the two women because he simply knows no one else to turn togirlfriend leads him directly into the belly of the beast laughingly telling him as hes being dragged away that shell get great money for himhe is dragged through the dungeon where he gets along with with us subliminal glimpses of people in different rooms being horribly mutilated he is chained to a chair in a room and we know he is destined to get the same treatment as his friendbut nowhat follows is an immensely satisfying turning of the tables by paxton an exhilarating escape and the revalation it wasnt all just pointless torture it was an outfit run by an organization called elite hunting for many thousands of dollars you can slowly or quickly kill a person of the nationality of your choice americans are the biggest prizes and the most costly of all victims 25000paxtons escape is damned exciting  i was cheering so hard for him i was having trouble staying in my seatall the reviews of this movie ive read say you cant root for paxton and josh but i disagree totally yes theyre assholes but lots of people are assholes at 21 years of age and i disagree that theyre unredeemable assholes josh has a sort of sweet forlorn quality and paxton actually ends up doing a heroic turn at the end of the story when he could have escaped free and clear he hears the screams of an asian girl being tortured he goes back down into the slaughter house kills he tormentor and brings her out yes thats our boy  although not before performing some interesting eye surgeryive also read that the movie is misogynistic i disagree againthis movie takes a dim view of everyone men women and children wait until you meet the darling little gang of street kidsthe production values are very nice the cast is unknown at least to me and very good and theres a nice feeling of paranoia throughout almost everyone the americans meet is in on the plot to process people through the killing machineohand i think the hype is over done i actually went in nervous thinking i was going to see things id not seen before it didnt happen even though i was highly entertainedalso there is a disturbing political subtext in the flick you can read into it or not it may or may not have been intended but it is most definitely there you cant help leaving the theater thinking holy crapare we that disliked by the world now make of it what you may  and check it out,cruel
let me start off by saying that you really shouldnt take this movie too seriously the concept is awesome  that is where people pay to torture innocent victims just for the rush it could very well be real although i really hope not plus there is plenty of sex to go around and there is some of the most gruesome violence ive ever seen in a movie from a completely shallow point of view i loved itthe basic plot leading up to the torture etc is very shallow as well but because it is more just a prelude to the real meat of the story it doesnt have much negative effect on the movie as a whole more than anything it is just ridiculous so it is really just something to laugh at and enjoy for the sex and nude scenesat the end of the movie when all was finished i was wondering if there were any major flaws like there were in saw which was similar in many respects to my amazement there was really nothing that they forgot to do in closing the story i was very impressed with how professional and well directed was it gets a 9 out of 10 because it obviously wasnt the best movie ever but it was pretty damn good,cruel
this movie should not be totally at fault for my discontent with the horror genre in general but it is a great example of how poor the art has become ive read some message boards and reviews of this movie and i was really excited to give it a chance because everyone in toronto was raving about it alas i feel like i have been suckered into another hypefilled sensationalist horror flick with the standard recipe of arrogant teens sexual overtones poor plot splitsecond frames used for screams and gore that is substituted for movie substance its been a long time since ive seen a truly original work from the horror genre that didnt suffer from poor acting or clich and this movie is no exception ive never even written a comment on imdb before and this movie prompted me to comment on it because i have trusted naively the reviews posted on this websitemany message boards are trying to highlight the terrific social commentary and latent meaning behind the movie to create the impression that this movie is either groundbreaking or important but i would say that if you search deep enough you could find the social importance of any movie if you want to and that if that is your agenda this is an important commentarynothing new or creative exists in the movie as soon as the three men meet the guy with the mole on his face and he directs them to the i figured out the entire scam including the main surgeon not that figuring out a movie is bad just that there were no plot twists to make me second guess it and nothing interesting in between to keep me entertained does it show the arrogance and promiscuity of visiting americans yes does it objectify women yes does it follow the current them of the grungy rundown industrialized killers rooms that we see in movies like saw yes im beginning to think that there is a template for turning out bad horror movies to generate profits and that someone took a blender from every late 1980s horror movie and poured the remains out into our horror movies todayif you want social commentary on american arrogance or paying for the consequences of your actions read a newspaper or listen to npr if that is your taste if you want a halfhearted attempt at a horror movie that takes an elementary approach to the discipline of film then watch this movie 4 stars because ive seen much worse but dont let that make you feel like you should see this movie,cruel
in my opinion was great but i also really enjoyed cabin fever i wouldnt vote as a horror in the traditional sense but the same elements that made cabin fever good are what make good as well the things i am referring to are the gross out factor and the horror in realizing this could happen in real lifewasnt scary it had some pretty gruesome scenes but i almost expected more there was heavy drug use sex and lots of nudity if i rented a movie like i probably wouldnt think it was very good or recommend it to anyone but the movies isnt like it is a quick summary two friends travel to europe at some point i think the summer before their senior year in college they meet a european guy ole and travel as a trio their main goal getting drunk high and laid after traveling all over europe they realize that everywhere is overrun with americans like themselves and they want to get somewhere a little more secluded with hotter girls and less tourists after a random encounter with a guy in amsterdam they are on their way to a small town in a slavic nation on his advice of course once they arrive they meet the hottest girls on their entire trip and have lots of sex and drink lots ole vanishes and they try to look for him they decide to wait a little while when the nice guy of the duo also goes missing both people missing include scenes of torturedeath and a not so clear but easy to figure out message that is the main point of the movie finally the cocky guy demands to the people they have met to be taken to his friend and he is taken to a gain warehouse where the torturedeath takes place as it turns out he is next i wont explain more as it would ruin the ending which i found surprisingmost people look at cabin fever and i think eventually will be looked at the same way as a horrible teen horror movie sadly these people miss the point the overarching factors that turn from a mediocre gruesome b horror flick into a cinematic well not masterpiece but something really good is the fact that a this could really happen and for all i know does happen and nobody knows about it the actual horror element b eli roth knows thats not good what the movie seems like and makes his horror a bit lighthearted which gives it a little something extra c roth makes so many homages to old horror movies you know he appreciates the genre and lastly d he roth never wanted to make crappy horror flicks so hes taken a general idea and made it something all his ownif you absolutely hated cabin fever you probably wont like if you go into the movie expecting to have your pants scared off youre out of luck if you expect this to be something its not so far what the general public seems to have expected of this flick then you will be disappointed if youre ready to see something with a good story that utilizes a great idea some pretty gruesome and interesting torturekilling scenes and enjoy yourself for 95 minutes or if you got cabin fever and get eli roth  this movie was made just for you and you wont be disappointed,cruel
the commercials for this movie had me thinking this was going to be some great work of art and would stand out as one of the greats i am still trying to figure out what part the supposed people at the screening fainted and have to have the ambulances called i love tarantino but comon this was a big let down for me sure it had me going for about 5 minutes but after that  it was just ridiculous people were laughing at it not with it at this movie in the theater thats what we get for believing the hype that the commercials portrayed this could have been written a whole helluva lot better if ya ask me,cruel

is a suck ballz waste of time and quinton should be ashamed for brandishing his name all over the television previews cause now everyone on earth knows he had something to do with this turd of a movie i was so disappointed it could have been so much better it ended up being more about sex starved spring break type airheads looking for tang then being about anything scary if got really good maybe the last 15 minutes i wish the preview would have shown something about the bulk of the movie instead of leading us to believe it may have been worth 700 to see it go rent session 9 and see how a good horror movie looks that was a good movie for its budget,cruel
let me start out by saying that was a pretty decent horror film the subject matter is brutal and unrelenting and the actors in this movie do a very good job butis going to be a victim of its own hype every person i heard leaving the theater tonight was disappointed in some sense because ultimately was not as scary violent or depraved as people have made it out to be to me was more of a thriller with horror elements mixed in it was painfully slow to get going and by the time the climax hit the movie was almost over all in all i was very disappointed and let down when the end credits started rolling maybe i was just expecting too much but ultimately i think was a bit of a letdown,cruel
spoilers ok so i thought this movie was pretty bad the concept of people paying to torture and kill other people is interesting though i think there could be so much more to it though i just feel like this movie was rushed and i think it couldve been so much better honestly not once was i horrified at any of this it seems like this movie was intended more for shock value and not giving you an awesome moviegoing experience it was really like a softcore porno for the first half and senseless violence in the second halfsomeone said that already oh well people make mistakes and i made a huge one by paying money to see this,cruel
is an excellent follow up to cabin fever the cult classic dubut of director eli rothwith his 2nd movie roth has created a terrifying eastern europe nightmare world but this stuff does go on all around the world thats a fact anyway 3 backpackers are travelling around europe  end up in a beautifull luxury that is a front for an evil institution of torture for money  its brutally played out  set up by the excellent rothwhat eli roth has shown here is the evil of the world the evil that men do  the dark sadistic real world we live in this stuff happens in real lifei totally agree with roth nothing he could put in a horror film could ever compare to the real horrors of the worldthe world is darker  more sick  twisted than any film could ever try to be  thats the truth we exist in a living nightmare where the absolute worst things happen to women children  meni loved cabin fever  its one of my favourite movies of all time  is an excellent follow up moviealthough completely different its still exciting  you can feel that roth has lovingly crafted this movie too just like he did with cabin feverthe musical score is beautiful  exciting by nathan barr  the look  cinematography is excellentthe stand out performance is definitely jay hernandez hes excellent as paxton the party womanizer who ends up being a tough smart hero  turns the tables on the hunterseli roth is a fantastic horror director as he knows the genre so well so with his first two films cabin fever  he really gives you brilliantly made movies for that genre  he still hasnt beaten those 2 films or the impact they hadis brutally savage survival shocker with disgusting  disturbing scenes of gore  torture but its all worth it to see paxton hernandez get some well deserved revenge later on in the movieis an excellent shocking survival horror film  one that really brought back the blood  guts in horror back in 2005is great but doesnt beat his first blood soaked masterpiece cabin fever 2002,cruel
this is the second movie i have watched despite of the bad reviews on it and first of all if you have watched game of thrones at all and i mean like one episode you can handle this gore its not like watching someones head literally explode on camera to the worst visual torture it shows is cut off fingers i also have concluded after watching that the plot was not underdone but it focused on the silent in between the lines story and if most people dont have curious creative minds they cant follow these kinds of movies but it was obviously about a man who wanted to be a surgeon and decided to open a torture house somewhere extremely abandoned and small enough to pay off it makes since that sense that a man who was rejected from saving lives could trigger the psychotic break that set him in the path of these decisions but it closes every door it opens as to the ppl that helped were involved and bought off without going into too much mind numbing detail i thought it was a very good movie and the only thing that cracked me up is that the movie was set in slovakia but the drivers side was on the left side still  like not just the american tourists but the german bad guys too definitely gave me a giggle but it was 2005 and other than that it was a good movie,cruel
long answer eli roth jettisons the satirical potential of his screenplay in favour of not a lot to be honest the thing is the torture scenes while repugnant and disgusting mercifully dont take up too much of the film as a result this is mainly a film consisting of 3 repulsive guys going around objectifying women and having sex before as always in a horror film their search for action leads to a very bad place indeed i have heard this film described as a satire or sociopolitical commentary of some sort and there is something there for sure the trouble is there just isnt an awful lot to its nasty and meanspirited but mostly its just tedious there are intense moments but theres not enough atmosphere basically the film just wonders what to do with itself for an hour before exhausting the viewer with endless torture porn towards the end it is undeniably disturbing and the acting is good for a horror film theres definitely an element of fear but eli roth although his direction is perfectly fine didnt quite manage to back up his ideas with a decent script watch saw instead the first one not those awful sequels410,cruel
this film uses a tried and true scenariocrass over privileged teens from north america travel to a less privileged country and get their asses kicked by a greater evil than having no class whatsoever the film works at a basic level but without giving away the plot lets say the film creates a false sense of victory at the end that the sequel squashes within its first five minutes in that way this film is nothing more than a conduit to an even darker tale of hopeless suffering  evil it could be seen as a cautionary tale and perhaps in a way it is who knows what goes on in out of the way villages in darkest eastern europe transylvania is in eastern europe this story is derivative of the story of count dracula on many levels vlad the impaler was a sadistic individual who killed entire villages via cruel torture methods much like the antagonists in this filma russian gang operating out of a secret hiding place  camouflaging their particular brand of satanism beneath the disguise of organized crime whats the message here i suppose dont go to such townsif you value your life i can see that,cruel
i happened to tune into the scifi channel yesterday and the movie was on i never saw the film before and only caught the last 15 minutes or so im not into gory movies but nonetheless i felt i had to comment what is it with all the gore in movies today are we really that violent a species that enjoys watching people being tortured maimed and killed i just dont understand what pleasure anyone can get out of that but apparently these movies are popular with a certain sect of our society i find it disturbing that teens and even children would watch these particular kinds of movies and get some sort of thrill out of it sorry i just dont get it or find them at all entertaining in fact they sicken me i read and see enough violence in the news everyday and wonder why,cruel
it used to be one of my favorite movies when i was a teenager things may have changed after watching it more carefully you know i will not deny this is pure entertainment with an engaging storyline mainly if you are a boy cast is most of the time professional and the mysterious plot makes it very interesting to see torture scenes are well done and you feel like youre the one being tortured given that actors and director do their jobs very professionally however weve got to admit there are some plot holes that makes it unconvincing at times for instance why would svetlana bring paxton to the slaughterhouse to see his dead friend wouldnt she imagine he could run and kill the bad guys just like he did and more how come nobody found out about the american carnage after so many dead people wouldnt the families seek for help wouldnt fbi interpose in that shambles however considering did its job in delivering a tense and entertaining torture movie this is still a good movie,cruel
i dont recall watching in the theater im pretty sure i did but i have no recollection of it whatsoever for whatever reason my brain has totally blocked any memory of originally seeing the movie all i remembered was that it was brutally violent and helped the saw series solidify the profitable nature of torture porn i hadnt watched the movie in years when i saw it sitting in my collection a few weeks back and decided to reintroduce myself to eli roths gorefest after watching it again with a few years of letting it settle in at the back of my mind i realized its a little better than i rememberand a little less violent thats not to say the movie seems tamer after watching it again can never be considered tame is the story of three friends backpacking through europe paxton josh and their new icelandic friend oli the king of the swing these guys are one a neverending quest to get laid and when amsterdam doesnt quite live up to their expectations theyre directed to a in slovakia thats loaded with available women arriving in slovakia and settling into the rumored the trio make a connection with two beautiful women natalya and svetlana who act as their guide to the booming nightlife but soon things take a dark turn as oli disappears one night supposedly making a sudden return home and the starts feeling a little less welcoming by the time we learn the s horrible secret its already too latelet me start by admitting that im not a horror fan less than 20 of my total dvd collection might fall into the genre the average horror movie has nothing to offer me and my personal tastes so a horror movie needs to have an interesting angle or some incredibly good reviews for me to hunt it down and has just that the premise behind is an intriguing one and is rumored to be based on truth in that the organization at the center of the movie might be based on an existing service when i watch a horror movie its got to be truly frightening and the idea that psychopaths like the ones we see in this movie might actually be out there somewhere doing business is a grim one we all have the ability to commit horrific acts and the concept that there are people out there that embrace this ability and treat it as fun or a form of release is disgusting and this movie is if anything disgusting in a good way though the movie gives us a solid 45 minutes to get to know these characters before they get to the meat of the film even if they do come off as a bit twodimensional at first it gives us a chance to know them so when the horrible stuff hits its got more of an effect the first half of the movie is pretty slow and at times outright boring but it all builds up to a gripping final half hourthe gore in the movie is awesome i love practical gore ill take some rubber intestines over a cg disemboweling every time runs with practical horror effects and it comes off as that much more disturbing there are a few instances where it might not have looked quite right for those whove seen the movie im primarily referring to kana but its all part of the fun of going over the top eli roth has an obvious passion for the horror genre and if theres any doubt listen to any one of the multiple commentary tracks that come with each of his movies his passion for terrifying an audience and his solid grasp of storytelling make a pretty cool movie he uses a bunch of unknown actors in the film which while im sure helped keep the overall cost to a minimum also helped see the victims in the movie as real people id never heard of jay hernandez derek richardson and eythor gudjonsson before and really i havent heard from them since i hear gudjonsson is pretty big in iceland though the real stars of the movie are the villains who are fleshed out a little better particularly the dutch businessman played by jan vlask considering that vlask doesnt speak english its that much more impressive how menacing he comes across eli roths is a really good movie for what it is and this is coming from a nonhorror freak the violence is brutal but shot in just such a way that a lot the worst happens off screen or in quick glimpses and roth leaves the audiences minds fill in the blank if more effort had been put into creating some more sympathetic victims this movie wouldve been even stronger,cruel
eli roths second film ushered in what is known as torture porn and man alive does this rub me the wrong way why exactly is it that we have to lump all things into subgenres lets put it this way porn is made to excite some sort of sense and in most uses of the word its used to sexually excite people how does torture in mainstream movies excite anyone not to mention there really isnt anything lingering in this film ive seen far more love and dedication paid to murder scenes in the old italian giallos they relished the gore this film really doesnt it does spend a lot of intimate time with the people being tortured but we dont get spurting bright red blood its called torture porn just so people who dont want to watch horror have an excuseand this is a pretty decently executed piece of horror like cabin fever before it humor dominates the opening twenty minutes we get to know paxton josh and oli as they take in amsterdams vices smoking pot openly and visiting whorehouses we find josh to be a bit indecisive even hesitant and because this was one of my first horror movie experiences when i saw it in 2005 i bought into that false sense of security for himhowever he meets a gruesome end when two girls who work for a torture club sell him as a victim he encounters a man who he had a strangely sexually suggestive encounter with on a train and that man takes great pleasure in stabbing drilling and basically ripping josh apart just when we think josh is going to escape he gets one of the most brutal cuts youll ever see in a movieso the rest of the movie is basically paxton looking for both josh and oli asking one of the prostitutes to help him she takes him to the torture club where he has to make his way out of the gruesome and disgusting rooms without being seen one of my favorite scenes is when he encounters one of the members of the club getting psyched up to go kill the scene is creepy but funny and over the topeventually paxton does escape but not before helping an asian woman with one of her eyes gouged out escape with him the two start to make their way through town avoiding the most brutal group of kids you can imagine before she throws herself in front of a train and before paxton makes it back home he has one more piece of business in a bathroom stall to take care ofthis movie is gory well paced and not as lingering as the subgenre may suggest it doesnt revel in its brutality there is a story here and the characters have some depth i know a lot of horror fans dont respect or even like eli roths work but his first two movies including this one deserve a second watch for all the horror bananas reviews visit httpmorozov924hubpagescom,cruel
i am from hollandi watched this movie and in the scenes where the people in amsterdam screamed at our three heroes my ears where bleeding it was german and the parts where the people of amsterdam spoke englisch it sounds like a russian person who has learned his first words of englisch my opinion is that the producers of the movie had to do some research on different languages before they start with it a few words for the scene is good enoughthe only good part of the movie was the punishment of the guy in the toilet by that part i felled the justice,cruel
i havent extensively researched the genesis of but after watching it i can imagine the sole idea that sparked the entire film what if there was a brothel that charged patrons for the opportunity to torture and murder people instead of having sex with them very sick stuff this and an intriguing idea to boot problem is you have to build a film around an idea to bring it to life while has its concept in place the movie that eli roth constructs around this premise is an incoherent messthere are so many things wrong with this inexplicably popular gorefest its hard to know where to begin lets start with our cast of obnoxious fratboy meatheads whose exploits were supposed to vicariously enjoy but who are so utterly unlikeable were left hoping that they die within the first five minutes we should also mention the seemingly inhuman ability these characters have to lose eyeballs and fingers throughout the course of the film but somehow not lose enough blood to induce shock or even mild discomfortim not sure if theres a message intended in this film but the moral i got out of is that people who live in small european countries are completely insane theyd pretty much have to be to necessitate an entire industrial complex where a dozen rooms are filled with paying customers inflicting unfathomable tortures upon anonymous flailing victims while this concept is certainly frightening im a bit more disturbed to find out that in some european locales bands of unbathed children roam the streets committing acts of murder in exchange for bubble gum this is not a joke by the way but actually a crucial factor in the climax of this wretched offeringbut you probably arent watching to see any intelligence on display are you youre really more interested in seeing grisly fates handed out to these bland interchangeable characters for no apparent reason right well you certainly get that here and if your weapon of choice is the unrated dvd release youre going to get plenty of it problem is you have to wait about an hour and sit through roughly 14 softcore sex scenes to get there should you decide to weather the endless barrage of gratuitous nudity okay not so bad ill give you that and heavy drinking you will find out fascinating things about the human body for instance did you know that when you cut someones eyeball out egg yolk drips down their face i do now thanks i really dont want to waste too much time talking about a movie that i already squandered 90 dreadful minutes on so im not going to spend many more words discussing this but i want to at least address the biggest problem with this film before i finish this review and sell back the useless dvd i just finished dirtying my player withthough the film eventually turns into an overthetop grand guignol feast of sanguinary delights the journey there is so longwinded and barren of suspense most viewers without a penchant for selfloathing will turn this film off before the horror part of our program even gets underway while there are certainly ample breasts on display during this hourlong road to nowhere if this is enough for you to justify sitting through the antics of characters whose ability to annoy outshines even the most bravura splatter on display in this film i really think you should leave your house more often the lighthearted tone and look at us talking like normal teenagers dialogue dont mesh with the brutality that follows and this juxtaposition doesnt make the torture scenes in this film more scary or powerful it just confuses what the point of this whole mindless offering really isi offer this film a 4 simply because the core concept is a very intriguing one even if the execution of this concept is so inept that it renders the original idea impotent a 5 might be a bit more fair but i had to chop off a point because this film actually features a hunchback wearing medieval chainmailif theres any resolution we get out of its that torture is never pretty well the agonizing process of sitting through this very stupid film is a lot more painful than anything the characters in the movie go through so exactly why anyone would praise this senseless and artless piece of crap is beyond me maybe someone gave them some bubble gum,cruel
this isnt a work of art but it is not intended to be it is a decent horror flick on the creepy side and horror fans would enjoy it if they tried but i do have to admit it isnt perfect ill come to that laterlets start with the good the acting was very decent for a horror slasher the three actors that played the backpackers all convinced me that they were young and in need of a good time they also showed fear as they were getting tortured which made me feel how they were feeling eli roth directed the film very well and he does have some talent which shows his passion for horror films and i do have faith that he may become the next george romero the storyline did keep me hooked as paxton was trying to get away from the villainsnow for the bad most of the gore scenes were quite unnecessary they didnt all need to be there and it seemed that it as there just to keep the film in budget it was a pretty sick film and is not for the kids to watch the goriest part was the eye gouging part if you dont mind that part than you will be fine the film as also split in two halfs the first half was a softcore porno and the second half was a gorefest the sex scenes were very erotic and the girls were all very sexy but like the gore not all of them were necessaryoverall this is a great bad movie with some entertaining scenes of gore and erotic sex that twisted minds will love but beware its not for everyone,cruel
yea oh my god i cant believe tarantinos name appear somewhere at the beginning of this movie awful thats an understatement and im not talking about the cast  they did their job well it is more subjective than that i visited bratislava few years ago and i dont know if the footage took place there but mark my words bratislava is one of the most civilized and developed cities in the former eastern block any war there but excuse me kids gangs haunting the streets you must be kidding me i dont know why those bloody americans dont place their plots somewhere in that southcentral la or in buffalo for example coz this movie is an insult to europe  amsterdam is about drugs and eastern europe is about poverty and misery get a life take a trip here and look around  youll see why this movie is full of crap,cruel
i just finished reviewing jaws and strangely enough i feel this film has a few elements of success in common the opposites jaws starts out with a pleasant scenario people are on vacation looking for a good time same in this makes a big contrast with the horror that follows the helplessness like a swimmer being caught in the water who eventually realizes something bad is going to happen to him but cant get out and cant defend himself properly against it due to his environment  our tourists are stranded in a foreign country with people that are unwilling to help them or are in on the plot to torture them the suddenness like the shark movie our tourists can be stricken at any point without warning the isolation like being alone in the water our tourists are all alone in the country the authorities they dont help much in jaws because of the money in order to not close a beach during tourist season in because of the money  they are in on the torture scheme the method all are picked off one at a time the deaths all are violent and painful the solution the heroes of both movies need to fight and conquer the evil all by themselves the realism both movies feel like it could happen in real lifethis movie obviously differs from jaws apart from jaws starring a fish with the element of betrayal and setup also focuses on the blood and gore indeed the intense gore of the movie turns it from a psychological thriller to a fullblown horror festfor a horror movie to be successful it needs realism and pulls it off masterfully it combines all needed elements and keeps everything brutally simple the aptly named eli roth nailed the essence of the genre with this movie unhindered by probably a low budgetwell done,cruel
a key thing in setting up horror is making sure that we as an audience care for the characters and are thus frightened andor disturbed when they are killed off simply presents killing and torture for the sake of killing and torture the characters are drug and sex seeking college students with lackluster character development and very graphic and disturbing death scenes this film is practically snuff legalized  gorno as ive heard it called  or whatever you wish it to be called but the point is it is sick it is a lazy sadistic bloody mess that desperately tries to be scary but is mainly just repulsive it has all the things that slasher fans would want  sex and nudity and graphic killings  but absolutely nothing to put them together in the form of a solid story the string of events is just a thin string that leads the audience along and not really caring where it ends up just as long as the need to show sex scenes before showing lots of gore scenes is fulfilledthe scenes of torture are admittedly welldone movie splatter and if their aim is to disturb then they do their job very well however in the age of the art of special effects the art of story telling which used to be the primary driving force for films is taking a backseat or rather it is being intentionally put into the backseat by filmmakers who only want to get cheap material sensations out of their viewers any fan of horror can name many films in the genre that have considerably less gore but are so much better due to them having a storyline that is worth paying attention to is just splatter and gratuitousness in one package what is even worse is that the slasher subgenre is essentially the simplest form of horror killer victims blood scares but this is even worse than that since they intentionally spoiled the most critical element  310bscdb classification 18  brutality violencegore,cruel
what is happening with horror films have we seen an end to the great works of our masters of horrors where is the suspense where is the build up and lighting effects the stories the horror industry is failing and its a sad reality that to sell a horror film to the public you have to first get the film banned and then build up its notoriety then everyone will have to see it torture scenes and more blood than german sausage this film is very poor it has all the hallmarks of a c grade gore shock flick and if your interested in watching people being tortured well i am personally not up for it to me contemporary horror films look back on great flicks from the masters of horrorwes craven tobe hooper john carpenter chuck russell and john landis but these contemporary films have really nothing to offer torturing people and then killing them sounds like snuff to me not horror it all went wrong here in this film i would leave this title on the shelf and rent hellraiser if you want horror dont waste your time,cruel
eli roth wanted to make a statement he wanted to show americans about there ignorance of the world outside there own hence he decided to use his talent to make a ignorant film about a fictitious place in the hell hole of a former soviet block nation where rich people visit to fulfill there dark desires of killing a person the way there minds intends a well oiled industry of slovenians performs the duty of finding the victims for there clients whether the statement the director intended to put forward had reached or not through this movie is not known but it surely does not matter as the message about the ignorance of common americans is reiterated each week by several hollywood films eli roth need not have tried so hardbut looking back at the movie by eli roth which is backed by master of gross greasy violence in cinema quinton tarrantino does not does perform efficiently on the gore quotient yes they are very much there but cannot be said that was the only thing in directors mind while making the movie the three leads in this slasher movie are straight out of the american pie franchise all they have in there minds while moving around europe are breasts our frat boys two friends from us and other one from barcelona so you pretty much know who is going to die first give us a very insightful tour of amsterdams erotic world every corner they go girls over there are ready to get laid a very whacky sequence of the boys trip down a whore house gives us the idea of the broad and bold textures the makers have planned to use for the film ahead so showing amsterdam as sex capital of europe is very much top of the directors mind heck when our boys enter a local apartment a couple are busy in there all stoned lovemaking session oblivious of anyone else being in the room this is where a very helpful person for our sex starved american tourists informs them about the much better quality of breasts available in the eastern block at bratislava where due to some war there are very few men left hence chicks over there are really sex starved pouncing over any stick so we enter bratislava complete with run down factories and yes the information is right sex starved women i mean for the first hour or so there are breasts hanging all over europe some deeply affecting war they had so the scene is set and the boys have fulfilled there appetite on the very first night and the barcelona guy has gone missing apparently with a japanese girl who is also present in the with her other friend named kaana now moving around bratislava one finds out that the only talent these people had in there country was torture they even had a torture museum and the kids over there are ready to smash heads of anyone for even a packet of gums after all they are nurtured by the best in the world so now the movie begins as our frat boys are sucked into the crowning glory of bratislava the torture industry looking at the rates the clients pay and the voluntary work of the entire town for the cause this industry must be the economical hub of bratislava so our boys go through the entire torturing process with only one survivor who then goes over to save the japanese kaana from a maniac whose torture process of using a burner to melt the eyes off is the ultimate bottom and then our frat boy hero uses scissor to cut off kaanas hanging eyeball after which i lost my appetite for mustard sauce slashing chopping and then some rescue effort from hell this movie simply wont cheer you upeli roths jumbled screenplay wastes too much time in build up to the ultimate slash fest and breasts the boys are not exactly charming either for us to care for them there is no room for creativity in the film except for a very chance confrontation of a client and our hero discussing about how to fulfill the rush for killing in the end what was suppose to be a global texas chain saw massacre kind of epic gore fest turned out to be a dampener and the message mr roth wanted to spread about the ignorance this movie did made me check about bratislava and slovenia on the net success,cruel
it is amazing what you can do with movies movies can evoke all types of emotions the can make you laugh they can make you cry they can make you love the bad guy and hate the good guy and in the case with the movie they can make you never want to visit a place that otherwise would normally be appealing to most anyone this movie does nothing to alleviate the fears of people who are already afraid to travel abroad implicates a small city in europe as a place where the wealthy act out their horrendous dreams of torture just to think that such people exist or that such a complicit place exists makes my skin crawl is most effective because of its setting more than the blood and gore that was shown just the very idea of such things possibly happening make this movie a horror classic,cruel
well after reading all the negative lynch mob press surrounding this movie i just had to watch it in order to see what all the fuss was about in the typical yankee style europe here is portrayed as a backward continent full of psychos and prostitutes where the kickass and cool cultured american youth can get laid and stoned anytime first off contrary to what the movie will have you believe the weirdo town where the is located is not in slovakia but in the czech republic leading me to believe that this picture was made for an american audience whose knowledge of world geography generally ends somewhere around the border of canada at best second slovakia or in this case the czech republic is not really considered eastern europe by any reasonable geographical standards but what the hell the plot is pretty thin two americans and an icelander nice touch of exoticism cant even get laid in amsterdam hahaha so they head out to some in a small town in slovakia ahem heeding the advice of some russian stoner they met a minute ago yeah makes perfect sense once there they hook up with two hot chicks who show them how to drink party and have sex slowly but surely they also discover the other main cultural attractions of europe from the american perspective filth poverty horny chicks who all speak english with a russian accent kids with sticks and stones wandering around the streets at 2 am looking for tourists whose skulls to bash and an organized gang of wealthy upper class psychos who pay tens of thousands to torture and kill youngsters for the heck of it all this in a rundown abandoned factory transformed into an allout torture center complete with pit bulls and some shadewearing machinegun wielding bad ass russianukrainianslovakianwho the hell knows anymore mobsters in black suits and commando boots acting as security guards the whole joint is run by some shady russian who else elite hunter companyorganization whose members all need to take a nasty looking blood hound tattoo on their arm wow evil the innocent victims who are naturally dumb dumber and dumbest are brought in straight from the which serves as some sort of a central victimfindersource with the staff members all affiliated with the ganganyway yank dude no1 and icelander get killed and yank dude no2 makes a heroic escape from torture central later exacting revenge on the two chicks from the town and the weird russian stoner from amsterdam who fooled him and his buddies into the joint in the first place yank dude no2 runs them over with a car after coincidentally and rather conveniently seeing them standing in the middle of the street not doing anything probably waiting to be run over by a car driven by angry yank dude i guess this thing could be considered as an attempt at a snuffpornhorror flick as some of the torture scenes are pretty gory and well in all fairness there is some amount of suspense every now and then the escape scene for instance is pretty well done the main problem here is that the movie isnt really scary its brutal its bloody its gory  but its not scary like a horror flick should be i even thought that a few scenes ended up being unintentionally funny for instance the barcafe scene in the morning which was intended to be dramatic and a turning point in the film with the main character finally realizing somethings not right the situation is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously the two girls are hung over and having beer and the dead serious main character walks in and demands to go to the art gallery as the entire bar packed with some 100yearolds dressed up like the gestapo stare at him angrilyanyways the point is there are way better horror movies out there check out tesis or the original and uncut japanese version of the ring the american version isnt bad either if you dont feel like sleeping for a few weeks,cruel
i got this film on a recommendation and given that i enjoy horror films in general i thought id rent it and see what i thoughtfrom the outset i was just waiting for the main characters to get killed off they were bland and banal and for the first 4050 minutes the only enjoyment youre likely to get from this film is the several shots of pretty girls and several of them nakedwhen the plot actually kicks in the idea is at first laughable as these three friends wander off to eastern europe to find the fabled what follows i suppose is intended to be shocking but the setup is so horrendous that i was waiting for some sort of twist or extra dimension to rescue this film which was already circling the drainwhat follows mixes a few stereotypes in with some slightly substandard special effects and finishes it off with such disdain that you wonder if the screenplay was written in an afternoonim unsure of the intended target demographic of this film given that it would have appealed more to me if i had been around 1415 although as far as im aware its an 18 certificateand as for tarantino i truly wonder if he has lost the plot a little and it puts me off watching his future work if he was so ready to plaster his name over this halfbaked projectavoid this if you can theres a huge range of better films out there,cruel
absolutely disgusting how anyone would put money towards making this movie god this movie sucks it just felt so so much wasted time with them in bars and in others citiestoo much build up which really built to nothing i didnt like the lead character i basically wanted him to be killed and i expected itso i was a little disappointed to find out he lived in the endive waited a long time to see this movie and now after seeing it i dont know what all the fuss was about generally i found this movie poor in most areas the directing and writing both sucked sorry elidont even waste your time seeing this movie its dull to start with and by the time it actually starts getting interesting theres only 30 minutes left its a typical movie associated with tarantino thats right loads of fillerreally just dont bother seeing this movie its dull and really has nothing to frighten anyone the most entertaining bit of the whole movie was seeing takashi miike speaking english now that is impressive and on a note about takashi miike if you want to see a gore filled movie just watch ichi the killer it was evident in this movie that roth wanted to copy miikes style and did it quite badlyhonestly dont see this movieitll only disappoint you,cruel
i put off seeing this movie for so long i was told so many different things about it there was of course the teenage guys saying how awesome it was people saying how gory it was and then people saying its just like an hour of porn with a bunch of violence thrown in so finally this past year i saw it at someones house i fought it as best i could but i was finally drawn in to the naked bodies and the moansto me this movie accurately portrays the two bases of human nature sex and violence i think the people who made this movie knew that and thought it would sellone thing about the movie that made me sad when the nice guy cant remember his name died that sucked,cruel
if youre on your last day of your life and you look back on a really big mistake you did and it still dont laugh looking back watching this movie will be a perfect example i shut it off after just watching ten minutes because all of it was just ton of pot porn and fwords and the story wasnt going anywhere and then another time came and there was nothing else on tv it was already a half an hour into it on showtime and i figured they had to have gotten into the story by now and it was still dull and boring it got to the point where i wasnt even watching the movie and i was just staring at the screen please if you have an iq in multiple digits then do not watch this movie,cruel
i cannot decide whether is a commentary on the history of european torture and an analogue to the holocaust or a nasty sadistic cynical and juvenile mix of softporn and gore designed to appeal to and up the ante for the saw cinemagoer market who knows what went through the mind of its creator reviewers comment on the realism of the effects well it was realistic enough for me how do they know what the bottom portion of a leg separated by a chainsaw looks like unless theyve seen it what is obvious is that uses a very american pov about europe to the point of satire the czech republic a perfectly charming recent addition to the european union is depicted as a grimy postindustrial hellhole generally populated by the criminal insane perverted or a combination of all three one thing to consider is that torture an unavoidable part of our european heritage  and now our heritage industry  is an aspect of life that america as a nation is too young to have experienced of course now they are making up for lost time and the irony is that some former east european states are giving them the facility to engage in it then again who knows also torture beyond its role as an instrument of the state and ideology but as a hobby pursued with a complete lack of humanity has happened within our lifetime where some of the events depicted here may well have happened is this film making us remember that or forgetting it certainly anyone who regards the blowtorching of an eyeball as entertainment has in my opinion deep issues likewise projectile vomiting brought on by sheer terror and other episodes of voyeuristic sadism i found all of those deeply disturbing to watch as much as because they had nothing to do with the plot but were designed to be enjoyed in their own right  to give the viewer a rush sadism one step removed sensation has to be the lowest form of artistic merit i just hope some viewer isnt inspired to try and go one better in terms of realism,cruel
now i will say i wasnt familiar with this film i was flipping through my premium channels and came across it i saw the part where the russian guy was telling them about the where the drugs and women could be had and then them on the train there i thought that this was to be a total ta movie so i moved oni came back during the part when jay hernandezs character was actually at the torture factory and saw his friends and then was tied up by the german guy and watch until the endso i know i missed a lotwhat i saw was a pretty good horror movie i just wished that i hadnt missed so much of the rising action part of the film i will totally watch it from start to finish the first time i can catch it on at a decent time i am curiousis the second one as good or is it like so many second movies not as good,cruel
i saw this on cable i have been seeing it in pieces having seen the end first i thought it built up a lot of suspense and i know he was very angry the main character for what he did in the end i do like tales of vengeance so it was fine with mei was then able to see almost the whole thing and it was really fine the eurotrash girls are horrible bitches in it i have myself been tired of them at work here i know they think americans are stupid and they are getting away with something and it annoys me there is more of an edge to the other lesser known parts of europei dont usually like slash things but i was concerned about them and the danger they were in there are holes in the story as i dont think the kids would help and they were annoying the part at the museum you wonder why he is still going it shows the less good parts of people  man that people dont want to seethe lead guy who gets out is really good as an actor the oriental girl also good in the end some of it also unknown i wondered about and he didnt see police why it would not be good for young childrenplease do not comment on spelling etc i am in hurry and know terrible i am a dumb blonde in mensai did miss the very beginning but i think not much and they seem nice guys as it goes it was on again and i was tired will try to watch,cruel
was a hotly debated movie when it came out examples of the past are the passion of the christ without any point boring or borat funny but nothing really special i had the privilege to see these films months after their original release and it allowed me to have lesser preconceptions the same it was with by eli roth it is not a bad horror film if you know the rules of the horror genre there wont be too many surprises in this film but it still is thrilling and shocking at times and this makes it worth seeing if it comes to the violence everything you heard is true its definitely one of the most brutal movies i have ever seen but still not worth the stir that it caused my point of criticism is that sometimes i was not sure if the depicted clichs and stupidities are just there for themselves or if the director actually wants to say more with that thats not a problem for me but it makes the film a bit trashy less serious and this again hurts the suspense,cruel
3 friends backpacking through europe look for sex and booze they hear about some kind of that offers beautiful naked women and no attachments they go off in search for this place but instead find a torture house soon they are finding themselves in a heap of troubleeli roth is being hailed as the new face of horror as of right now with the current features under his belt i must ask myself why does this guy have this title granted i liked cabin fever with its homages left right and centre to the genre but was it good enough to have its director considered horror master after watching i still sit here dumbfoundedupon this films release and after it as well the only thing i kept hearing was how sick and twisted it was how there was no real story and that a film like this should not be in print being the horror fanatic that i am i was hoping to see something that i and the fans of the genre can enjoy while everyone else trashed it now after seeing i sit here on the fence as to whether or not i liked it its not the vile porntorture disgust of a film that i thought it was but it wasnt a horrible piece of trash eitherroth knows the genre well which is evident in how he presents the film and the style throughout this is its high and low points the film looks beautiful in the second half but roth overexposes the viewer to what makes horror movies horror movies for example an action film usually has gun fire and car chases horror films usually have blood sex and violence in we get overexposed with an obscene amount of nudity then the second half is an obscene amount of sadistic violence the film plays like two different movies the first half is soft core porn and is shot like a teen slasher film while the second is considered a snuff film shot with a grittier lookmy problems with the film are scattered throughout its running time for everything good in the film there is something bad horror films are suppose to make you feel a certain number of things one is to be scared yet this film is not scary instead roth relies on graphic violence to scare his audience people claim that the film is a gory trip through hell and back did i miss the train to sum up in one sentence does not live up to the hype i dont know if its the sick films ive seen prior cannibal holocaust deadalive evil dead but is not what it seems the film tries to go for shock but fails to deliver any in its poor attempti appreciate the acknowledgement of other horror films roth shows us any horror fan can point out certain places and things roth homages one that i liked was seeing takishi miike walk out of the warehouse here is a person roth admires greatly and by the time youre reading this has probably already directed 3 more films while i am not a total fan of takishi yet i can respect his films you can see a touch of his style here nobody should be fooled by the title tarantino presents other then promoting a friends film he has no touch here its a shame cause this film could have used a touch upit is suspenseful in some scenes but the way roth constructs them is horrible we are suppose to believe that the main character will go back to save a life simply because of one line of dialogue earlier to explain our so called hero says that he once saw someone die and he could have done something to save her later on in the film he hears the screaming of a woman and goes to try and save her despite this never happening in real lifeunless the person is someone you knowlove the fact that the only suspense in the film comes from this poor explanation it taints the rest of the filmso in the end i cant recommend this to any real horror fan or even people looking for a good film instead watch it if youre a fan of the stuff if your favourite movies include saw wolf creek then may be the film for you i found myself wanting to enjoy it but simply couldnt ill have to wait and see what roth can deliver to us later then maybe he can earn his horror title,cruel
but still manages to entertain the movie starts slow with 3 guys getting some advice to visit this in eastern europe because the girls are so hot and will have plenty of sex with americans so they go there and along the way meet a creepy man on the train who touches one of the guys they get to the and find their roommates are very hot girls who are more than willing to party take drugs and partake in bedroom games after a wild night the guy from iceland has disappeared the other 2 roommates look for him but no luck the next night paxton wakes up and josh is gone paxton is suspicious by now but still goes with the hot girls when they say they will take him to josh what paxton discovers is sick beyond belief gruesome torture body parts everywhere it turns out he has been targeted by a group of people who find victims for very rich people to kill and torture for kicks will he escape will he get revenge if you can stomach it you will find outfinal verdict lots of sex and blood horror fans should definitely check this out,cruel
im not fond of this kind of movies a movie with sex and gore as the main theme definitely not my favorite kind of movie and has worsened my hatred for this kind of movie i mean whats the general idea of this movie is there any morale in this movie the answer is no if youre talking about dont talk to stranger its a kid talk its not a morale anymore at one side just show us how a bunch of kids like to jk off and have sex while the other side just a bunch of people who are hungry for gore and tortures show what happened when the both side met is what you gotif is trying to stand out for being the goriest movie perhaps it will stand out but not if want to stand out as the good movie no wayits really nothing compared to saw trilogydont put up too much hope on this movie believe me you want a genius and gory movie watch saw trilogy at least saw doesnt just exploit gore and blood but also a message of morale but in a rather bizarre way,cruel
this is your worst freakin nightmare take three typical young men on a trip to europe for pot and sex and let them think they are having the time of their lives then when they least expect it  bam they are caught up in a torture operation that is so unbelievable that it shakes you to the core of your beingwell i take that back in this age of overpaid corporate assholes i can believe that they soon are bored with spending money on 400 cigars and expensive liquor and seek out perversions such as thisthe actual torture wasnt as bad as i expected it to be but the horror was absolutely brilliant eli roth has established himself as a director of horror the last 30 minutes was so carefully crafted that it stand well above anything i have ever seenand wow a cameo by takashi miike the director of ichi the killer and graveyard of honorthe only person i recognized was rick hoffman i guess ill have to wait and see what jay hernandez does in part ii it should be interesting,cruel
rated r for strong graphic violencegorenuditydrug use and language quebec rating18 canadian home video rating18ashould be ris one of the goriest horror films of recent yearsrecently a lot of horror films have pushed the limits of violence in horror filmsso i saw when it played on the movie networkwell i wasnt really expecting much so it didnt disappoint but those who are expecting great storytelling dont look herebasically relies on gore to entertain the audience and while the story is original there is not much of itif you watch this film just to see gore you will not be disappointed however because it has a lot anyway is about three backpacking friends who are travelling in europeon their way they visit a filled with beautiful womenso they have sex with some of the women but what they dont know is that they are part of this organization where they kidnap people such as tourists then rich people come and pay money to torture them in horrific waysis in my opinion a decent film filled with tons of gore,cruel
is awesomebut why have i given it only 7 stars welllet me go into detail the idea for perverted people pay to torture and kill helpless victims in a giant factoryis interesting and while pessimists thought that director eli roth would be tamed by the studio he spares none of his actors and leads the viewer into a no holes barred violence freak out to all those with a weak stomach or the light hearted onesdont watch cause it gets gross and downright sadistic and violent roth shows everything and has some pretty evil ideaswhich obviously makes him together with alexandre aja one of the greatest hopes for genre that many already laid to rest but what breaks the films neck is its first hour while roth concludes with a very strong final and very impressive last 45 minutes the epilogue and the establishment of the characters is too flat and also quite boring its not as atmospheric as it could be and the dialogue fails to be memorable acting except the villains is quite low and you dont feel any sympathy for the characters films like the texas chainsaw massacre which gets quoted in one of the final torture scenes have shown that even young actors can be impressive and convincing but when the normal acting stops and the main characters are nuthin more than meat that can be tortured roth is in his element againand the last 45 minutes are what saves its 7 stars rating 2 got rid of all this flaws but for the horror fan the first installment is well worth the time if he can look over the weak beginning,cruel
a group of young and quite frankly rather moronic guys go to amsterdam to do the only thing as the clich goes that guys like them would and will do there theyre told they can get the exact same thing only cheaper in some lostintime country where girls are extremely hot and nymphomaniac and why of course they go there they are more than welcomed by a couple of stunning chicks and we get to spot a few perfect and serviceable female bodies in the nude once twice and so forth you know because because if you like girls take a look you know and go visitbut alas life is cruel it turns out paradise aint paradise after all and the girls are evil scouts for an evil organisation where guys are kidnapped tortured mutilated and ultimately killed you see one or two stomachchurning scenes which are okay yes it sounds remotely exciting yes the film actually has its moments and is overall amusing but its mainly more ridiculous than scary which is very disappointing because its gone great lenghts to prove its gory  ideological seriousness the evil bar with the commie memorabilia was a riot and the same can be said about the vegan vs meateater standpointthe idea was good postcommunist countries set up as amusement parks for unscrupulous hypocritical and nihilistic capitalists engulfed by an unsatisfactory and numbing life where freedom takes its toll who may buy female companionship and other forms of extreme entertainment and thus feel powerful again thats happening minus gory exaggerations however a good idea is quickly ruined the film takes the easy way out sex gore and pure entertainment which is nice but it doesnt even excel in that department characters are unsympathetic it might even be said that the psycho old guy they meet on the train is the only one that showed some real depth storyline is badly told the film runs out of ideas often and wastes precious time and as for the shocking scene i couldnt care less about the guy whos suffering it and shock is alleviated by indifferenceyet another lost chance,cruel
as many people would like to believe that was just a skin and torture exploitation film i have these things to say is the perfect horror movie not because of some sick twisted perverse and demented fantasy that is buried somewhere deep in my brain but because it actually sacred me to the point of wanting to cry many regard all horror films the same way they would regard most soft core porn as all the same a slight plot an inevitable ending and a sense that as the story closes that you knew everything that was going to happen before it did the ending is logical and everyone knew that someone was getting laid with most horror films there is a protagonist that has in some way a purpose ie a satanic ritual that needs to have ten blond virgins blood a crazy man has been infected by the soul of a long dead serial killer someone is going to kill torment or bring violence to someone in the movie based upon a set of criteria someone wants to kill someone else for some reason that is not true of and the reason it frightened me so muchin the movie three friends travel to the slovakian border and look for a good time filled with weed women and as much booze as they can drink they find such a place in an upscale and enjoy themselves this is the part many like to mention as the skin flick part where are unsuspecting trio offers themselves to a gaggle of exciting new women who they enjoy very much but all this dose is set up the remainder of the story when we sat down in the theater when we put in our dvd we all knew that each of the main characters or at least some were going to be tortured to death in some horrible and unimaginable way that would be shown to us in full color on our own tvs or brought in front by the miracle of cellulose photography it was intentional to set us up to remind us that each of these young people was going to meet some horrible end and to set us up for the remainder of the movie it takes a long time to get to the torture and i felt almost expectant every corner every turn having some unspeakable evil waiting around it hiding in the shadows waiting to strike the atmosphere ready we are invited to take pleasure in their deaths by their captors or to sympathize with their plight the thing i think that destroyed this movie for so many people was that there was no reason for killing them just because some sick old men wanted to people who kill others in the world dont necessarily do it with purpose in mind and the most brutal people on the planet are remembered as the ones who took the most pleasure out of others deaths simply because they were there if people would own up to the idea that this is not so far fetched as saw or as real as wolf creek i think more people would enjoy this movie for its suspense its tension and its horrific premise that there are those willing to do anything for a good time,cruel
i recently saw the unrated dvd version and the main difference seems to be that the dvd has an excessive use of the f word which is rather distracting and unnecessary generally this is just as good as cabin fever roths initial film and very similar in style not subject the nice thing about roths films is the time he spends with what seem fairly ordinary or mundane activities of the characters behaving in mostly superficial fashion but there is actually more to this behavior within the development of the plot for one thing these mundane activities are later shown to be paramount to the scenes of horror that are to come also they allow the characters to behave as most people actually do which is to maintain a fairly superficial persona except amongst the closest of friends and family until in here when faced with their impending death the sex in the film is always nonpersonal and this is a precursor for the murderclub within this framework is a horror film that is grisly and gory enough to satisfy most of the gorefans who dont care about plot though obviously not all judging from the comments stating that the film took too long to get to the scenes of terror this is actually a nice combination of american styled horror films and european giallo terror just as cabin fever was and has a satisfying revengetype ending i will not divulge the 1973 texas chainsaw massacre homage but it will be obvious to those who know the original tcm and is quite enjoyable,cruel
i was meaning to get round to watching for a while and yesterday on a boring sunday afternoon i took the chances of watching it and i was not disappointed it seem really apparent that anything that gets the quentin tarentinos seal of approval is worth a check out was a movie that satisfies the gore hound in me  of course if strip everything away it could still be classed as a teenslasher movie but it is different in the sense where it has these odds moments where one seems to genuinely care about the characters the plot focus is on 3 back packers trodding around amsterdame getting stonedlaid etc but then they are given an opportunity to take a ride in the wild side in slovakia and being dumb american teens they go through with the offer one thing that could say has a focus on is the dark nature of humans and how far one is willing to go for the ultimate thrill although it as i said earlier one could argue it could be treated as a basic formulaic slasher it just takes the blood and gore level to graphic which makes it all the more amusing i would recommend this as something different from europe and is worth a look at  you might be shocked and you might laugh and some bits but it was a ride  my only complaint was that the trailer just gave away a little bit too much so we knew what was coming however eli roth has done very well indeed i just hope that part 2 satisfies the hunger for my gore better than the hills hvae eyes part 2 which was just a let down89 out 10 there is a place  where for a price  you can scare  tortue and kill,cruel
three guys one icelandic and two americans visited slokavkia in order to look for chicks but little do they know the horror that awaits themthats the premise of this brilliantly shocking film from director eli roth roth who previously directed his horrorcomedy debut cabin fever has come up with an excellent gorefest which took his name by stormproduced by quentin tarantino this film is an exploitative tribute to films like cannibal holocaust i spit on your grave friday the 13th and several italian gore fests including reazione a catenaaka chain reaction and so forththe acting is ok but the coolest thing about is the character oli and natalya oli is a wonderful icelander having knew that icelanders are cool people he makes one hell of a character natalya is also a great character being a damn hottie the film is kinda easy to follow especially when it doesnt have those stupid flashy sequences that has conquered almost every pg13 horror filmsone thing that bugs me is that the film kinda acts as a social commentary eli roth says that this film deals with the ignorance surrounding touristsespecially americans who visited a certain country without knowing whats surrounding them that kinda bugs me because im a traveler and me being a tourist i dont feel ignorant about that country perhaps he was talking about western tourists in general i might saystill this film is great this aint a chick flick but if your girlfriend is a freak or loves horror films then you must bring her on a date bring her back home watch this film on dvd with her and get laid its simple and fun,cruel
is definitely not a film for everyone with intense depictions of torture and camera shots that force the viewer to observe every gory detail pushes the r rating to its limit produced by quentin tarantino and written and directed by new comer eli roth this film gives the horror movie genre a wake up call that it desperately neededthe film begins with three friends paxton jay hernandez josh derek richardson and their new found friend oli eythor gudjonsson who are backpacking through europe paxton is the typical college guy who encourages all of the bad behavior that they participate in josh on the other hand is the shy type and has to be forced to do anything then there is the laid back icelander oli who josh and paxton met on their travels and has now joined their groupof course they partake in the activities of drug use and other debauchery that characters in horror movies usually do but what they are really looking for are beautiful women this is when the three bump into a local in amsterdam who tells them of a secret in slovakia where the most gorgeous women are located unable to resist the three jump on the next train to slovakia at the things start to take turn for the worse when after the first night oli is missing after worrying a bit paxton and josh brush it off and decide to continue partying with the girls they have met naturally the next morning josh cannot be found paxton then becomes desperate to find his missing friends interrogating the girls they were with paxton is lead to a place where people are violently tortured as a way of fulfilling peoples fantasies and reaching a new emotional rush the horror movie genre has become extremely formulaic recently with movies that are either remakes of older films or use every clich possible fortunately roth being a fan of horror movies knows what has become tiresome and tries breaks away from the sameness that has corrupted the genre although he does resort to using characters that are the typical young rule breakers they are given some characterization that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for their situation not to mention when the characters do something that might seem stupid he gives ample reason for their actionswhat roth does well is he understands exactly how to build tension throughout the film recent horror films have relied on the use of quick cuts and cheap scares in order to frighten the viewer roth though utilizes the atmosphere of the scene by using close up shots that allude to the painful acts that will soon occur do not worry though because when those acts do occur the camera does not switch over to something else roth instead decides to show the whole gruesome act this gives the film an intensity that other horror films have begun to lackrealism is a key element that roth emphasizes throughout the film the premise for the movie originated when roth stumbled upon a website that said one could kill someone for 10000 thus the movie advertised that it was based on true events here he uses ordinary people in a plausible situation in order to cause fear this strays away from the typical plot of an unkillable monster or a ghost that has been overdoneis a horror movie that is not only new but refreshing due to its original story and strong direction from eli roth be warned though that this movie is fairly intense at times but any fan of the genre will appreciate this fresh approach to horror film making,cruel
this movie other than all the sex in the beginning was terrific it was so real the blood looked real it all looked real and the acting wasnt that bad and believe me this is no saw spinoff there is no one murderer there are several not just one guy killing people off cause they did bad things in life no these guys are sick  that pay for it all they pay to cut people up they pay to torture people they pay to hear people scream and its really sadistic in some parts the guys they dont have any shame or guilt they just want their body parts they just want to cut them up for fun and burn their limbs afterwardthis movie was 10 times better than any saw sequels this movie will leave you wanting to see what the main character does after the credits roll will he get revenge and kill them all or will he die off in part 2 well have to wait and see but for now quintin tarrentino gives you this awesome filmi rate this a solid 8 out of 10enjoy the movie,cruel
when asking about several persons suggested i shouldnt waste timemoney on it when some friends bought it i asked whether i could borrow it about 120minutesof watching i realized why others thought it was a waste there wasnt enough there to complete the horror experience this movie couldve been that horrormoviegoers paid admissions to see however shouldve earned much more appreciation than what people were giving it the center idea around the movie was probably to be sickening with its gruesome torture and literally shock you in this highly succeeded keeping me looking over my shoulder at times throughout the night the whole of the movie is not nessecarly based on torture though accutaly its more of a pornographic movie focusing 34 of the movie on the hawt women which was disappointing when youre expecting scares rather than orgasms the language barrier between the americans germans iceland etc is another positive remark offers leaving moviegoers to focus on expressionsemotion to understand the basics of what someone is saying the characters were fantastic except there wasnt enough sympathy so while their being tortured youll not be saddened by the character but by the disturbing methods used to torture setsprops were always believable while sets never left you questioning overall an exhilarating experience thatll leave horror fans craving more 7510,cruel
this films advertising insisted on the fact that it was the sickest bloodiest movie youll ever see as opposed to all the tame pg13rated horror films most of them being remakes of japanese shockers that were being released at the time according to writerdirector eli roth it was time the horror genre got its guts back both metaphorically and literally as for that second statement theres no reason to argue is not a film teenagers or the weak of stomach should see when it comes to the sickest bloodiest part however its a whole different storyat first casual viewers might think theyre watching the wrong movie the film opens with three backpackers coming to amsterdam why they have chosen amsterdam is quite obvious what better place if youre looking for sex and drugs as one of the three the icelandic selfproclaimed king of the swing oli eythor gudjonsson would say its fcking awesome apparently though theres this village outside of bratislava in slovakia where the girls are even hotter and particularly willing to sleep with americans something that makes olis mates paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson very eager to try this new place what seemed to be another version of eurotrip however will soon become a nightmare as our three unsuspecting protagonists run into something so terrifying few people would be able to imagine it and this is where the massacre begins well not quite actuallyin fact despite what he promised roth doesnt exactly show us everything we rarely see the acts themselves which include severed limbs and eyeball torture as the director thinks the effects of those acts will be scary enough and as a matter of fact they are although it has got more to do with the context roth has come up with for all that violence on an entirely conceptual level is absolutely brilliant with a thirdact twist so nasty it will make the audience reevaluate the whole film a small clue for genre fans it kind of reminds of the wicker man which is referenced in a sex scene shame the director doesnt develop this great idea in a particularly original way using it merely as an excuse to show us flesh first half of the movie and blood second half and neither of them in the excessive amount the trailers and posters seemed to promise roth certainly knows where to place the camera when filming the most gruesome sequences but he lacks the genius of filmmakers like tarantino who is one of s executive producers or takashi miike who appears brieflyultimately deserves to be seen because of its original concept although the rest is fairly conventional and not as extreme and disgusting as they want to make you think,cruel
saw this movie yesterday and i was disappointed i must say id heard a lot about how good this movie was from friends and had built up some expectations that was not answered upon the idea of the movie is nice but personally i think it was too shallowly told the first part is no horror and the second part is gory but without the right feeling i didnt feel the pain going through my spine when people was tortured and even the nicest moments wasnt close to none of the sawmovies i think dont get me totally wrong now i think the movie is a nice piece of craftsmanship and the actors are doing a good job but theres something missing if youve seen movies containing torturescenes like in ichi the killer old boy or saw for example i tell you this movie is not close but if youre out for an entertaining and different horrormovie this is still way way better then all the collagehorrorfilms and other standard horrorfilms so as conclusion i would say that you definitely should see this movie but keep your high expectations at baypeace,cruel
just bought the dvd for this movie  i use it to get rid of girlfriends i am no longer interested in i am a horror junkie and this movie gave me my fill the true horror that this film shows is the dark side of humanity imagine yourself living in some poor forgotten eastern european country where every day is a struggle to survive and then some gangsters give you a few dollars a week to simply turn the other cheek as they lure unsuspecting tourists into their torture chamber for the pleasure of clients whove paid large amounts of cash for their pleasure of murdering the tourists in any way they choose the townspeople in this film are overjoyed when fresh cash and fresh meat show up at the train station because it means that they will make some money this week who gives a sht about what happens to the unsuspecting tourists because its not happening to you and if any one in the town went to the authorities and reported it then the towns major source of income is lost this film makes you question yourself what would i do for a dollar of course your answer depends upon your particular level of affluence or lack thereof as ones situation becomes increasingly desperate human selfpreservation takes over as the individual sinks to deeper and deeper lows an act is unspeakable only because your individual situation hasnt yet sunk that low think of any unspeakable act throw the right amount of cash in and now you not only speak of it you do it because it benefits you everyone has their price,cruel
this is a great and entertaining gore moviealthough i believe the idea is great you can expect some clichs and predictable scenesthe plot is simple two american young guys traveling through europe making friends having fun sex and problems they will be surprised when arrive in bratislava searching for lots of sexthe performances are down to earth and you can imagine yourself in a situation similar to theirs the basement where the slaughter occurs is perfect for those scenes and its really macabrebasically a pleasing movie to watch with your friends in the dark late at night,cruel
the magic of the movies is lost forever after this movie the same medium that brought us fred astaire dancing  so gracefully as now produced this messat best movies can take the human condition and say something important sadly does nothing of the kind we are spared no gruesome detail of mans inhumanity to manthere is a story of sorts that you can quite easily pick to pieces theres no real good guy to root for just someone who is less marginally unpleasant than everyone elsethe torture scenes are horrific staunch churning to say the leastmovie directors such as john ford or hitchcock could hold an audiences attention by telling us a story about people we cared for and building up suspense by not showing us everythingi dont object to violence when its making a necessary point and is in context with the subject matter as in saving private ryan but this is an orgy of torture and is the product of a sick mindthe saddest part of all is that some people on this site say its the best film they have ever seen i can only take that as meaning is the only movie they have seen,cruel
first of all i have to say that i come from slovakia so lets deal with the movie first its really hard for me write something original now because i read a few reports above and while at the beginning everyone was caring about the main characters and everything i have to say i was laughing my ass off on the first half of the movie lets ask some important questions first why do they talk czech on the train station when our heroes come to slovakia why do they talk czech in the tv at the why are every signs on the walls in the streets in czech i mean come on there aint an actual word spoken in slovak in the whole movie well maybe in the disco the music is slovak but thats already 20 years or more old songs my parents used to listen to that music at the beginning the dutch guy tells them that this place is near bratislava and it is true that slovakia is on the border with the czech republic but shouldnt they have explained in the movielike look theres a near bratislava the capital of slovakia but the is in the czech republic another thing obviously the movie was shot in the czech republic believe me i know my country and that just wasnt slovakia at all dont get me wrong im not trying to dis anybody and i am not saving my countries reputation its just good to have some things made clear the scenery gives us very raw images of central europe but thank god its imaginary the places dont actually look like this in reality nevermind these kind of things happen once in a while,cruel
is another perfect case of an overhyped horror movie in these past years made out to be a sick demented disturbing horror movie its far from it the trailer was brilliant and i couldnt wait to see it boy was i annoyed considering it got the dreaded r18 rating here in australia i thought it had to be pretty darn bad the first 45 minutes of the movie is boobs swearing drugs and sex which is poorly done the second half is blood and body parts galore which is very well done the only problem there is there is barely any of it and if there is any its mainly offscreen so for you gorehounds out there this isnt gonna pleasethe special effects were really well done and the dull dirty look of the underground torture place is really creepy ultimately though this was a disappointment and i wouldnt really recommend it to anyone eli roths first film cabin fever was far superior to this in my opinion25,cruel
2005 is the latest film by cabin fever director eli roth one thing i can say about this film is the gore gore gore theres a lot of it so this movie isnt for the squeamish along with lots of ta this film is a horror fans treat taking place in exotic amsterdam the film takes time to get going about 30 minutes to get to the gore but once there its one helluva ride though the dialogue doesnt really hold merit and the script is also somewhat predictable jay hernandez of world trade center fame does a great job in the lead role as paxton one of two friends from america in amsterdam on vacation what happens to him and his friend is so frightening and sickening you have to see the film to believe it a shocker of a film  at 7 out 10,cruel
after seeing cabin fever and falling into a healing coma afterwards i was quite skeptical of this much hyped eli roth movie while not perfect is still better than cabin fevertwo american 20something males are on a backpacking tour of europe on the way they pick up an icelandic male these are not sympathetic characters you could be quite happy taking care of them yourself think of the typical ams heineken tour group the triumvirate is fully stocked with clichd characters  the crazy and wild foreigner the uptight guy aka  mike the rrated guy youre not so sure about trent the movie starts out with all three of them arriving in amsterdam with their quest being the search for weeddrugs and sex after doing the standard amsterdam thing smoke lots of weed go to clubs smoke more weed go to red light district smoke more weed they resolve to get to the final quest on the same night they are kicked out of a club they are locked out of their it is there that they are introduced to another traveler a young russian he shows and tells about a outside of bratislava slovakia that boasts the hottest women willing to do anything especially foreigners this mind you is not located on any map and can be found only with a broken compass im sorry wrong moviethey predictably detour their next destination from barcelona to bratislava on the train they meet a creepy edward saladhands arriving at the they discover truth in advertising the next morning the icelander disappears while out and about creepy salad hands shows up again this is when things take a turn i would time this about 40 minutes into the movie the remainder of the movie is a veritable butchers shop filled with graphic mutilations but little reason to the carnage eli uses a few techniques to keep us off balanced and uncomfortable initially he distracts us by showing us lots of breasts and skin and a general light fare he then turns to techniques such as  creepy whistling think daryll hannah from kill bill the first person eyehole view scenes of utter darkness the foreigners with their respective languages nonsubtitles yellow puss and lots and lots of blood he seems to be feeding off our fears the fear of not being on your home turf of not knowing the language and customs of foreigners and the fear of being hunted some of the scenes are reminiscent of pet cemetery aka  the death of herman munster the end of wonderland house of 1000 corpses the hills have eyes 2006 and ichi the killer for a little genre flavor takashi miike makes a cameo appearance and even has a few words to sayultimately once the plot is revealed i felt somewhat disappointed it wasnt enough to ruin the movie but i couldnt get the image of rutger hauer hunting icet out of my head i think i was enjoying the devastation of really annoying and obnoxious characters ie  like seeing a politician being tortured the plot seems to be a modern gruesome adaptation of the most dangerous game minus any noble reasoning i would definitely recommend this movie for fans of the horror genre please skip cabin fever hopefully part two explains a bit more of the background without delving into the realm of saw 2 or reverting to cabin fever quality btw i am not holding out hope it will probably suck it really is too bad that the slovakian tourism had to take a hit for this movie to be made but i guess its worth it,cruel
i was really bothered by this movie and wasted 89 minutes of my evening luckily the dvd was cheap enoughfirst of all being from amsterdam it bothered me greatly that in amsterdam every dutch person was actually speaking german for some reason scenes were definitely not shot in amsterdam eitherit started out as a poor imitation of a b sexmovie for over 40 minutes boobs are nice to watch but the dvd cover promised me a horror flick had to wait for over an hour for the first frightening and bloody scenes by that time i had already lost interestedbut more importantly did not care for the main characters at all couldnt care less if they lived or died including the chinese girl who threw herself in front of the train actors performance was very poor basically rick hoffman was the only decent actor in the entire movie but he only appeared for two minutesabout the plot  plotwhat luck that the two girls who had screwed paxton just happen to pop up in front of the car so he could run over them not to mention the german speaking dutch businessman who just happen to be on the same train as paxtonthere were no plot twists to speak of i rate this a 310,cruel
2006 510 4th best of 2006 out of 4 total movies 241st of 2000s 708th all time im gonna be honest with you i really dont know why so many people say this movie is so great granted the movie is based on an interesting concept some americans in europe end up at a place where people pay others to torture and murder people fairly clever right but the movie just isnt that interesting to watch while i love horror movies the reason i love watching them is that i can choose witch characters im rooting for deciding who i would want to live or die while watching this movie i really never for a moment cared which characters good and bad lived or died the movie did nothing to draw me in i never felt like i was watching real people just a very violent occasionally silly movie granted if i was 12 or 13 years old i might have enjoyed the movie simply for the fact that their were boobs in it but by now those days are behind me its not that this movie is bad its just that i cant see a single thing that makes it stand out from other horror movies i guess i just dont get what all the fuss was about,cruel
i though that will be scary movie but my thoughts was mistake its very uncanny i cant watched a cut scenes because it was sickness from then i though  what is my price how much i cost and that was creeps me outacting was fair eli roth thinked that hot bodies are movies engines but he was wrong thats not very bad but watchable some emotions was missed script was good to this movie after watched it you will think about it all week i wanted to go to this movie premiere with my aunt but we change mind and we were right because my aunt will be pass dvd release just for me only was much better choiceso i give a 8 because i cant wait for the sequel it was creepy but entertaining for real horror movie fan,cruel
i love horror movies and in the time i have been alive have seen hundreds if not thousands of them my question is why do people always expect them to have oscar winning acting and writing its horror just enjoy it for what it is and stop complaining about what it is not horror is mostly made up of movies that are dumb but fun the point is to get scared or grossed out doesnt this movie accomplish that some of the scenes even freaked me out and i am not one to bite my knuckle or cringe in horror honestly this movie is disturbing but in a funny very ridiculous way it wasnt the best movie ever but if that is what you are looking for then horror isnt for you,cruel
let me say that when i heard about this film i thought it would be pretty good but unfortunately for me it was just too tame the main problem here is that it claims to be so gory you will be hiding under your chair or covering your eyes with fear but the fact is it just does not deliver just when it gets to the crucial point the camera pans away and you wonder what is the point the story is not that great or believable either even though it is based on true events i think maybe this one needed more time and money spent or maybe just better editing if you are a true horror lover it will not cut it for you and you are better off watching house of 1000 corpses or pulling out a dario argento classic sorry guys,cruel
gore but no scarethe movie started off as nothing more than animal house in europe bordering on soft porn at timesnot saying thats a bad thing but i was waiting for the horror part of this horror film to start it is predictable most of the time and the plot was weak if you want a gory movie with tons of blood and parts being cut off people this is the movie for you i love slasher films so i was entertained but to call this movie a horror film is false advertising it doesnt really keep you on the edge of you seat but the sfx work is pretty good overall i would give it a 5 on a 110 scale,cruel
this is disturbing i did not feel entertained afterward just sick and melancholyspoilers belowthe build up is fun and somewhat realistic for those having traveled on trains in europe but then torture gore death and murder in a warehouse seems like nothing new for this genre except for the level of violencethen around the time when we could enjoy someone escaping the madness we get a girl committing suicide due to her shame of disfigurement  and sadder still it was predictablethen the guy escapes but not before the revenge murders in the same torturous fashion you expect him to kill the guy knowing this will possibly end the torture club etc but by showing the violence you feel he is just like the sick killers maybe thats this movies depressing purpose to show our  eye for an eye  sense of justicei dont want moralizing and certainly dont expect a disney ending but this movie focuses on the worst of human nature and i dont recommend it,cruel
my sister and i rented this movie hoping to see a film scarier and more gory than saw and saw ii sorely disappointed i was expecting myself to get scared and queasy while watching it but instead i laughed during most of the torture scenes and rolled my eyes at the majority of the clich scenarios like the dance clubluckily for me i didnt have to sit through the beginning of the movie my sister had watched it before i had and told me that at least twenty minutes of the start of the film was basically porn and drug use i didnt get the movie to watch that kind of stuff and the fact that i had to fastforward through it just annoyed meone of the girls i go to school with is an exchange student from slovakia we started talking about during one of our classes and it was easy to see that the movie offended her she said shed talked to some of her friends back home and that they werent pleased with it either and who can blame them i know ive never really wanted to go slovakia and didnt exactly helpthis was a basic waste of a movie to me the best part was watching josh try to run out of his torture chamber with a severed achilles tendon or whatever its called not worth the time,cruel
i went to go watch this film with a few friends of mine to me i thought this was going to be one of those commercial garbage films when in fact it wasnthalf way through the film the three back packers were so annoying especially with their fowl language and being so sex active towards womenand sounded just like kids who had just come out of high school and took a trip to europe the film however did display how europe appears for example the dutch are allowed to smoke and in slovakia there are some real dangerous street kids it was what anyone person would discover traveling with a few random peopleand after that this was what truly scared me ever it is a known fact that you could get attacked or you could be secretly being monitored  watched by someone and before you know it you are his  her victim ooh very disturbingan uneasy feeling echoed through my body as i watched every death scene that i didnt want to do an allover overseas tripi feared that and i still do todayover all this film was a good warning as it warns you not to go blundering about take the advice which displays in this film when watching it watch out,cruel
i never had such a problem to decide if i rather recommend a movie or not never before there has been a mainstreammovie which went this far depicting this kind of gore never before ive seen a goremovie that was this little fun and entertaining its true that this movie really made me feel terrible and sick not in a way like peter jacksons braindead did to me when i entered a whole new level of horrormovies watching it long time ago rather in a way documentaries can make you feel i couldnt say this is a bad movie or that its not made pretty well still i wouldnt recommend it id even recommend avoiding those who simply can enjoy a movie like this for me there needs to be a a clear line between fiction and reality doesnt have this gap so i couldnt enjoy the gore i still give a 7 because i believe that its a milestone for the genre i just cannot tell if its a good or a bad step ,cruel
i expected a nonstop gorefest but thankfully the gore was reasonably limited and confined to a small portion of the movieon the other hand roth seems to have given in to his producersor paid too much attention to the results of the advance screenings its hard to tell which the film is much too tidy and works too hard to dull the effects of the gore by tempering it with a sense of poetic justicethe skanky addicts who lure the victims towards their horrible and lingering deaths dont worrywell run them all three over on the way home through townthe sadistic dutch businessman no problemwell have a chance to slit his throat during a chance encounter in a public restroomoffended and sickened by the twisted american businessman never fearhell be in he first torture chamber you escape to after hes thoughtfully turned his handgun over to youand so forth and so onall in all the exact opposite of the saw movies,cruel
unfortunately it didnt live up to its potential unsatisfactory predictable im not a major fan of gore although i need not have worried about there being too much gore in this film its mostly implied there are buckets of stage blood but not necessarily more than was used in seed of chucky i saw where someone suggested that might be better classified as an actionthriller and i would say thats probably true it just doesnt measure up as a horror flick not that the potential wasnt there still though its better than plan 9 or manos i guess id have to say its worth watching if the only other options are degrassi on nick or oprah after the show yawn,cruel
ive only now seen and although i know many people who have seen the movie i was never able to get some real critique about iti have to say that in the first half hour i was really enjoying it but then i started asking where was the place the movie was suppose to focus onwe follow three kids two americans and one from iceland in an europe i have never seen and want to keep it that way they are looking to have sex with european girls and some guy recommends a just outside bratislava the whole twist of the movie was that all these people they meet in their trip were part of an association that sells the opportunity to torture people for a high quantity of money twist that i had figured out in the middle of the moviethen the obvious happens people start disappearing one is luckily safe he is led to the torture place hes able to fleethis is what i didnt like about the movie so much stuff about the torture when in truth is the smallest part of the movie his actions and reactions are nothing like what i think a person would do in that situation he gets so quickly out of that place that we have 20 minutes top of the movie there his escape with the chinese girl is the stupidest think ive seen in a movie for a long time not even commenting on the last scenecongratz for turning what could be a good movie in a complete waste of time my advice see the first 45 minutes of the movie and then let your imagination do the rest im sure it will be a lot better than what they have to offer,cruel
i was disappointed by the commercials made it seem like it really was the scariest movie of all time stating that paramedics had to be called on scene to take the movies screeners to the hospital it really didnt scare me at all like house of 1000 corpses did it was very cheesy and the element of imagination in horror movies didnt really exist because i didnt care about the characters they were college kids who wanted to get laid and instead got mutilated thats not too original im not saying house of 1000 corpses is original im just saying that it scared me more especially because of dr satan and its spiritual aspects i couldnt wait for the blood and guts in but then when it happened all i could do was laugh my ass off at how fake it looked when the girls eye popped out i was laughing so hard if you must see this horrible film rent it do not buy it the ending was especially craptacular,cruel
this is like the worst movie ever first off all that violence you see is 20 minutes of the movie the movie is about them trying to get pussy however without giving you vast detail why this film sucks let me just say the main character changes in the middle of the movie after they kill the main character off from josh the writer to paxton the character people know little aboutand that should never happen if you disagree you are wrongand supposedly i need 10 lines of text for this comment to be valid and posted up which is god d a m n f u c k i n b u l l s h i ti hate everything and i hate you too,cruel
yes i said thrillerthe word of mouth about this flick from the man who made our stomachs turn in cabin fever was that it was all about the goresure this movie has its gory moments but really this movie is a classic thriller starting off as your typical buddy buddy road movie the film takes a horrific turn when members of the group start disappearing the audience knows what is happening to them ofcourse as that part has been well advertised the interesting twist is when paxton escapes and makes his way out of the torture fun park this is where the movie takes off and keeps running the uncomfortableness of the previous torture scenes make the getting away sequences all the more never racking and enjoyablewho is not on their seat screaming at paxton to just get the heck out of there when he goes back in to save kana you can hardly watchthis movie reminded me in many ways of mute witness also shot in a bleak eastern europe it starts off as a horror slasher film and before you know it gets you caught up in a suspense filled thrilleri have never been a big fan of the just straight out gore movies carpenter did not need excessive blood to make halloween frightening craven did not turn the screen red to create masterpieces such as the hills have eyes or nightmare on elm street still somewhere along the way directors made the equation that blood and gore equaled suspense unfortunately it seldom doesis a great movie because it scares the crap out of you and keeps you on the edge of your seat eli successfully uses the gore to make you feel uncomfortable once off balance he takes you on a roller coaster ride,cruel
i give this movie a one out ten only because i am not able to choose a zero there was no character progression i felt no connection to the main characters in fact i was hoping that they all could have died much much sooner so the movie would just end the only thing that sticks out in my mind is when the main characters got kicked out of a night club and one yelled back at the bouncer who threw them out i am an american i have rights that is all well and good but they were in amsterdam and do you think anyone cares possibly the worst line and delivery in any movie ever the idea was half decent but executed very very poorly bad script bad characters bad acting the special effects were also pretty lame and though it was a gory movie i did not find it that disturbing mostly just boring dont waste your time,cruel
i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am feeling something that i have not felt from a movie in a long time i am very uneasy and nervoustexas chainsaw nervous this film makes you want to hold your love ones close and never let them go because trust me some of the images that this film plants in your brain are going to stay there forevermy advice for all that love this genre is to watch this movie alone in the dark in your bed because what happens in this film will make you very grateful that you are where you are and not where they are seriously i am never leaving the country againthe film gets off to a bit of a slow but necessary start annoying and teeny  too many f words and i cant believe im saying this too many boobs seriously i love boobs but theres only only so many you can take but that creates more of a shock when the real premise of the film begins it was excellently directed shot written and surprisingly acted those guys were awesome the one thing that i love the most about this is just as the saw series this stuff could happen and probably does somewhere in the world and the director depicts this by making your imagination run as wild as the special effects team it is more psychological than you would expect its greatits hard to talk about it without mentioning any spoilers so i will stop talking now just trust me and watch this film in my opinion it is one of the best horrorgoresuspenseteenthriller movies for decades enjoymy dreams are going to be nasty tonight hold me,cruel
is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time but in a good way the torture in the movie is really disturbing with much gore and dismemberment the violence is really kicked up a notch in this movie too unlike other popular horror movies this movie pulls no punches if you are under 18 i strongly recommend you not see this movie due to the violence and disturbing brutal behavior if you overlook some minor flaws with the film such as limited plot development and very few characters that enrich the plot you will find a very good horror movie with something original to offer the viewer just be prepared to be shocked and maybe disturbed after the movie i give it a 910,cruel
the movie does change half way through but thats not a bad thing not for me at least there are other movies who did that too think mr rodriguez  mr tarantino the latter is also a producer of this movie coincidence o the first half of the movie shows us three men two americans who are on a eurotrip searching for  girlswoman what is shown here must have been a shock for the american rating board but after all this fun the violence starts to kick in now it might not have been that explicit but that wasnt the point although im pretty sure that for some people it wasnt violent enough and for others it was too violent but you cant please everyoneand its not only about what is shown and there is quite a bit of gore to see here but you caring about the characters ive heard that people said that the main characters where not sympathetic but i beg to differ youve got a cool gut shy guy and a crazy guy in the group so eli roth director has good variety of guys thrown in the mix and i did care for them in fact it might be that i cared too muchone thing is for sure ill never see east european girls like i saw them before o seriously though if you dont have a problem with female nudity and violence than this can be a pretty cool fun ride delivers the goods in every sense,cruel
if you are after a nerve jangling horror movie laced with suspense and well placed jumps then this isnt the movie for you eli roth does not make that kind of horror film think of softcore pornography and saw and youll get the idea his films are for the sadist expect intense gore horrific deaths and sex lots of sexthat is not necessarily a bad thing because if you like that kinda thing and i know many do then you cant go far wrong than a film about two americans paxton and josh who go on a european sex holiday with their icelandic friend oli and are led to slovakia where the real women are found the that awaits them is fantastic and it gets even better when they discover they are sharing their room with three gorgeous women yet these femme fatales have more than sex in store for them seducing them before delivering them to the surgeons vicious tortuous killers who earn money depending on the nationality of their victimroth knows how to cut the right limbs the small dirty eastern european town used to great success in the latest resident evil video game is a perfect location for the twisted world our protagonists find themselves in with the police beating the residents the children ruling the streets and drugs freely passed amongst the characters we are presented with a suitably anarchic feel for such a lawless moviethere are flaws of course the sex obsessed opening lasts way too long it takes nearly 45 minutes before the shagging stops and the brutal torture scenes kick in you wont feel overly sympathetic for any of the stars either a few times youll even be begging for their gory end and the vengeful coincidences that occur for paxton at the end are nearly laughablenevertheless you may not feel sorry for our stars but youll still cringe at every knife slice drill hole and toe removal and youll still lust for some brutal vengeance against the many that have led them to their fate and the revenge does come and youll cheer regardless of how ridiculously convenient it all isjay hernandez paxton derek richardson josh and eythor gudjonsson oli put in solid performances their lad behaviour is easy to scorn but even easier to laugh at and they play their roles to throat slitting perfection and thats not to mention the beautiful seductive performances of jana kaderabkova and vanessa jungovaeli roth has come a long way since cabin fever you wont find any true scares here this is a true vomit inducing shock movie quentin tarantino recommends and so do i,cruel
in the same vein as gritty horror films such as seven and saw is less challenging but more believable in an interview i saw with eli roth the writer and director he explained that his passion in film making was rooted in horror films of the 70s and 80s anyone whos seen cabin fever will know what type of films eli roth has set out to make by setting out to scare the pants off viewers eli roth has created a film that is not pretentious or proud of itself its just a really scary well executed story whereas cabin fever contains the energy and enthusiasm of someone new to feature length film making is a more polished example of what is essentially a shockingly graphic horror film i loved this movie and was almost wetting myself while watching it i highly recommend this to anyone but be warned this is extremely graphic,cruel
this is definitely worth a watch if you like disturbing movies i thought this would be another teen horror flick when i first saw the actors turns out that there are some original ideas and looks going for this film i could have done without the senseless eye removal scene it looked like the special effects guys were having way too much fun therei was impressed with the way they went an extra inch towards making the characters seem real they failed but still you dont normally see this good of an attempt in mainstream horror the locationssets helped tremendously as this film is actually pretty submersing which isnt always a good thing for the weakheartedand yes you heard right nudity nudity and even more nudity  tacky but i was ahem able to handle iti picked up this and wolf creek this was definitely the better of the two in my cruddy opinion,cruel
so much better then cabin fever but still a far away from being an overall enjoyable filmit can also be classed as exploitive but werent all those video nasties in 80s also thatis it really needed well unless you want such questions like this answeredwhat does a japanese woman look like with her eye ball hanging outcan man really walk after his tendons have been slicedhow painful is it to have you fingers sliced off in a german train station toiletoverall while the film has little worth and less importance the final thrilling chase at the end had me on the edge of my chairand made me appreciate the film a bit morebut only a bit more,cruel
i went into expecting a realistic graphic gorefest i didnt quite get what i was looking forthe first 23 of the film can be written off as softcore porn plenty of nudity in the film if that is what you want in your horror by all means see this moviethe big draw of the film was the supposed horrifying graphic and realistic sequences of torture this the film does not deliver all in all you get maybe 3 whole scenes of torture none of them are done realisticallynot noticeable unless you know a thing or two about this sorta thing or in a very gory fashion you got a guy get drilled and his achilles tendon cut a guy get mentally torturedwho then kills his torturer and you have a girl get her face burned that is about it for the torture scenesthe story for is pretty meh supposedly it is based on true events but i doubt itall in all it is a decent way to kill time ill be picking up the unrated dvd if anything just to see if it is as graphic as it was hyped to be710,cruel
i had high expectations for this movie the idea sounded good three backpackers get kidnapped and are tortured and killed for the pleasure of bored rich people that alone is scary to mebut instead the film is a let down yes it is gory very gory in places but by no means as horrible as the hype led me to believe eli roth makes one terrible crucial mistake  he doesnt develop his characters we spend the first half of the film following these three guys as they take drugs have sex with whores and just generally behave bad by the time the torture came about i couldnt have cared less if they lived or died if roth had spent that time building the characters up and making us care then this would have been a far superior filmthe torture scenes are a disappointment too this sounds perverse but we spend half the film getting to this point and the torture is very limited yes bad things happen to them but i was expecting far more graphic scenes of violence i would have liked this film to really explore the dark side of humanity i mean what does drive someone to torture someone for fun unfortunately this is denied usplus it is totally unrealistic in particular one of the characters gets part of his hand chopped off by a chainsaw this guy should have bled to death within minutes but he doesnt i can suspend my disbelief in films but this was too silly even for mein short fails to be the nerve racking horror film we were led to expect yes there are some disturbing scenes the eyeball scene for example and if youre a fan of gore yes it doesnt totally disappoint but i feel this had so much potential and it was wasted it could have ranked up there with silence of the lambs or even seven but instead it went to a writerdirector who has no idea of how to create characters this film deserved to be good it deserved to go to a better personwatchable but no where near as good as it should have been,cruel
cabin fever was ok  good fun in places but no more now we have handily championed by tarantino smart use of your new friend there is nothing special either ive nothing whatsoever against eli roth except jealousy maybe coz he seems to be getting away it but is it me or is his output a bit average and uninspiring all the magazines i see are proclaiming roth as the new chosen one when it comes to horror but i see nothing special here theres stereotypes aplenty and i found myself wondering if this was all tongueincheek but if it is the humour doesnt come through and it just feels like clichcity roth has an undoubted talent for making your toes curl and thats great but it cant sustain a full film especially when the gore is limited to 10 minutes or so the gore itself is good but nothing amazing or revolutionary bringing up comparisons with pet sematary of all films if someone can tell me what all the fuss is about i would be very grateful,cruel
the thing about that separates it from movies such as saw and other gross out films is it is built on a premise that could be very real knowing the fall of the ussr it is an original idea i recently saw a law and order episode where whole blocks of a city in russia catered to child prostitution so this is not much of a stretch the gloomy look of the worn out city captures much of the fallen society it is portraying and its medieval atmosphere those two aspects work greathowever what it does wrong is it doesnt take time to make us like the characters headed into the lions den i didnt feel anything for any of the suffering characters except for likable oli but we dont really experience his pain pot smoking partying teenagers is too much of a clich and we kind of know where they are headed from square one because of that it loses much of its impact the ending escape scene just seemed rushed contrived and resorts to gross out tactics this is where wolf creek becomes a better film wolf creek went for an unprotected jugular and never let go although it resorted to unabashed torture and cringing acts of dominance torture is never something that should ever be portrayed lightly this is where should have went with its real and horrible subject matter to make it a real classic shockerstill i recommend this to anyone except those with no aptitude for watching graphic violence depicted on the screen its premise could very well be real and the look of the old city of bratislava is the stuff horror movies are made of,cruel
ok so the tarantino reference is somewhat misleading but what do you expect its a trailer its designed to get you into the cinemathat aside any mainlining horror fan wont complain and lets be honest your average horror fan by demographic is a teenage hormonally challenged male mentally or otherwise and on this basic level the film surely delivers additionally the film has so many cinematic references the wicker man being one example its obvious that it comes from the hands of someone whos steeped in horror lorethe plot is simple backpackers two american and one european seek fun and adventure in a dangerous europe they head eastwards on the promise of promiscuity and more besidesthe characters are not complex but the plot for those familiar with horror film morality does not follow an obvious trajectory and the gore is unsparing as is the nudity it plays with clichs and chews them up then spits them out big stylethis is grown up modern horror proud of its roots but revelling in modern shock value,cruel
well i had a feeling this would be a terrible film  but it is actually quite watchable it had all my fave elementsabit of blood and goresuspense and some really dodgy dialogue  ha ha but still it kept moving and the story was easy to follow hey it aint rocket science but its just as gruesome as youd expect not a bad film at allnot the best but not the worst by a long shotthe story was alittle predictable but it didnt matter and the deaths were not the most gruesome  though the chainsaw was fab but you still came away thinking about it all no expense spared on the toilet scene  no spoiler but u know the one so all in all you cant knock it a good true to form horror  though nothing to have nightmares over,cruel
this is the new breed of horror film which has become increasingly popular in the past few years following in the popularity of saw is another chapter in the psychological chopemup pretty simple story about 3 young tourists who are lured to a youth in an obscure eastern europe town typical teen dangers arise  sex drugs and strangers that always result in troublethe movie does have moments of inspired tension with its ghostly town residentsa concrete killing fieldand its redemptive finale it even tried to make the characters 3 dimensional  could the virginal friend be gay what fuels our hero and we have a promiscuousfather  but it seemed there wasnt enough time to care about those shadings and instead of a paint brush here comes the axe or chainsaw or blow torch or machete or hammer at one point its like shopping in aisle 5 at your local home depotsome of the scenes are disgusting but ive seen more inspired horror scenes i think some of the most horrific things that happen in the film actually dont involve the aforementioned utensils but how people care so little about a fellow human being is it groundbreaking no but is it entertaining  yeah its a horror film that serves its purpose it didnt make me screambut it made a good attempt,cruel
i walked in to the cinema thinking wow this is gonna be terrifying i hear there were walk outs in america because of the blood content however its not it has more than reservoir dogs and possibly saw but its not like the kind that makes you feel all that queasy and wanna vomit i felt that they could have made more of the torture scenes and fully flaunt it to a higher level if they were going to go all out i have to admit i did like the tension it builds up in certain scenes and even though it may not be as gory as i hyped myself up for it has a fair amount of blood to justify its genre as a horror i would leave more comment on how it made me feel after but i dont wanna spoil the ending,cruel
the first 30 minutes are teenage male wet dreams come true then the mystery  horror sets in there is a little of a guessing game of how big the killings are or is it a lone serial killergranted some of the movie is for pure shock factor however i think many people do not see the underlining fact humans are hunting animals or for others think about this way why would you kill someone else now we need a part two to see how the lone backpacker gets revenge on othersor like in rob zombie second flick will the dead backpackers family come for vengeance,cruel
good easy going movie with a good story line not like any of the other tarantino films i have watched as i am not a fan if you like blood and guts this is a great film to watch if your squeamish i wouldnt bother its pretty obvious from the start that the guy eating the salad on the train on the way there is going to be something to do with it and how gullible are these 3 backpackers if its sex they are after they are in amsterdam for christs sake you couldnt get a better place for it they are just being greedy if you ask me whats with the weirdo kids who are after bubblegum too hmm puts me off going to europe and backpacking thats for sure becks x,cruel
this is a really entertaining horror movie specially for nowadays horror films it uses the same repetitive elements of most horror movies teens doing teenage stuff sex gorecar chases etc but it uses in the right way for example all gore and torture are there because they have to be the script needs them they are not for just make an impression to spectatorsit has no comparison to other horror movies u may be thinking like scream i know what u did the ring and so on this movie is original despite using a known formula visually its excellent the actors perform fineand the chicks are really beautiful not the constant playboy alike blonde cheerleaders from typical horror moviesso i honestly recommend this movie and i think itll be consider another classical horror film,cruel
having been pleasantly surprised by eli roths cabin fever and falling for the sucker puncher that was tarantinos involvement albeit minimal i eagerly awaited this filmthe film borrows ideas from across the board but is certainly original in its shock value whilst i have seen many many horror films from the comparatively tame but classic hammer films to the more extreme films like takashi miikes audition miike actually has a brief cameo in and the total grossout films such as cannibal holocaust and zombie flesh eaters left me feeling extremely uneasy unlike a lot of its predecessorsit would be hard not to be lured into the jaws of doom by the absolutely beautiful natalya  svetlana and indeed thats when things begin to go horribly wrong for our 3 young hedonistic travellersjan vlasak should be applauded for his portrayal of the particularly unnerving failed surgeon the reason he didnt make the grade as a surgeon is revealed much to the terror of young joshthe group of infant thieves is a nice touch and added a somewhat morbid comedy factor to but not as to the detriment of the overall themeextreme brutal stylish and aesthetically grand well not for poor yuki but i still cant decide whether i really liked it or i was repulsed by it perhaps it was both some censorship is avoided i presume by not mixing the sex with the violence or vice versa i think that means mission accomplished by eli roth  his mate quentinit will be interesting to see whether 2 can maintain the tension and evolve at all or just sink into awful sequel oblivion,cruel
there is only one type of person that could possibly love this film and that is the typical male myself if you must know yes i am that typical male this film has just about everything that a man could want even if they are not that keen on what this film has to offer it has foul language naked women and there are a lot sex foreign girls drugs clubs drunk people and of course the mass amount of pure gore the gory scenes are extremely graphic and if you have yet to see this film then i must warn you now this film is not for the faint hearted quintin tarentino has definitely captured the moment and has pointed out exactly what to do and what not to do if you decide to invade europe fantastic,cruel
okay yes it does have some sexual content  nudity but what horror film these days doesnt include something of that nature just to gain entertainment value points i mean look at your target audience teens and young adults and tell me you dont need those scenes to get people in the cinema seats especially when you have no a list and really not even any b list actors also if you pay attention to who wrote  directed the film youd notice its the same guy as cabin fever this film far surpasses its predecessor which has the same sort of american pie meets saw type feel to it so some sex is necessary for the story linethe plot is just brilliant its terrifying because its very realistic im not sure if any of you have ever visited any of these eastern european countries but something of this nature could actually happen and no one would be the wiser to it i dont want to give away too much but suffice to say that the plot definitely thickens and runs deeper than you expectthe gore factor is absolutely full blown i have seen saw and saw ii and i would say that along the visual basis they are equal but the key difference is that you really feel the torment and pain the characters are experiencing its not just some colored corn syrup and latex intestinesits horrific screaming and desperate pleas that you really believe the acting i have to say was superb by these new comersall in all a great horror flick its original well filmed and acted very realistically but i do warn you that some of the gruesome scenes from this film will stay with you for a few days watch at your own risk,cruel
theres a sickness pervading roths promo for the youth ing association having said that its hard to dislike a movie which features attractive eastern european women in permissive sexual mode  prone to large bouts of unnecessary but welcomed nudity and not too concerned about changing in view of male roommates such cynical devices are employed to get round the critical sensibilities of horror hating people like me who think this stuff is terminally devoid of merit invention or wit and roths pulled a blinder for 45 minutes i was putty in his sick gelatin covered hands and then having got to the crux of it with those ignorant hormonally retarded backpackers getting horrifically tortured for the pleasure of maladjusted 13 year olds and manchild fanboy mastabators throughout the world i strangely found myself drawn into roths dirty little web  the vincent price like fly to his predatory house spider not in any way what you should be doing with your free time but nevertheless far better than you might dare to hope  may be a good advert for hotels as well as 90 minutes of well tooled disturbance hard to hate  especially when watched backwards,cruel
anyone who goes to see without first reading a review or at least knowing the content is in for a bloody ride i am still ambivalent as to its worth as a bloodfest video nasty it works  as an metaphor for the torture and cruelty that goes on in the world it falls well short of the markthe film builds no sense of suspense it is just relentless it is slow paced and choppy it has no sense of structure beyond the set up and closure we feel little for the characters beyond a mild sense of empathy and a desire not to be them the only twist it has is a happy ending  something i was hoping for but not really expecting the last man standing does indeed stand  and no bogeyman comes out of the wood work to foul up our sense of closurewhat works well its a horror film  but unlike say the evil dead that was bloody gruesome and nasty when first viewed this is just laughably horrible but it does draw you in and make you crave revenge almost palpably for the victims even though we neither know for or really care for them so for all its faults i liked it  im a sucker for horror  but why tarantino put his name to it i dont know there are a few homages to him peppered throughout  like the ear cutting scene in reservoir dogs but it does nothing to enhance his reputation,cruel
let me start by saying that i thought eli roths last major effort cabin fever was badly scripted and directed although it had some merit on some levels this film therefore managed to surprise me as its very well done the finish character was a nonstarter though which could have been done to make you glad when he was the first to die the ending doesnt really work either although its the alternate ending really as the original ending has jay fernandezs character kidnapping the edward salad hands characters daughter and ending with the ambiguous does he save her or kill her endingrealistically at the end there is no way he would have gone back for the chinese girl he would have got out to report it and try to stop it happening to thousands of others rather than a very unlikely go back for one person who is probably already dead i know the story about the kid in the lake is meant to explain this but it doesnt wash with me then the bit where the chinese woman jumps in front of the train because of the way she looks and possibly to distract the men i am sorry but it was all so obviously for shock effecti would have much preferred some closure on the for this it is obvious that the character would have gone to the authorities i would have liked to have seen thisapart from those minor points it is very realistically claustrophobically done and they successfully make you believe the dorky guy from dumb and dumberer is going to be the hero who survives its quite a surprise when they kill him,cruel
i cant help feeling that is going to become the clockwork orange of my generation what i mean by that is a movie that provides a genuinely original narrative told in a daring fashion thats seen as a cheap sex and violence flick by everyone who either didnt have the balls to see it or had the balls to get in the cinema but didnt have the stomach for it once they were infirstly some cold hard facts there is less nudity in than there is in shredder detour or bloody murder or any 80s or 70s horror you care to mention there is also far less violence than there is in high tension creep or dog soldiers also the nudity and the violence are part and parcel of the continuation of the plot line not gratuitous and pointless as some have continuously harped on about the nudity in the first halfhour is a used as a device to display the differences between the three main characters and to set up paxon as a character who steadily becomes more aware of where his bachelor habits have got him b initiated by unscrupulous characters in order to manipulate the three weakwilled males into a false sense of securityin a similar fashion the violence of which there is at a stretch about five minutes of onscreen not exactly a lot when you consider that friday the 13th part 6 has a total of 21 on screen deaths in its 80 or so minutes is used sparingly to flesh out the initially unseen horror you can feel creeping up on the cast and to provide those allimportant scares that a horror requires to be honest the most frightening thing is that eli roth manages to make the killers both worryingly real and believable as people these are not knifewielding zombies with vendettas theyre accountants doctorslawyers lol scary stuffthat said is intense uncomfortable viewing i would never make the ridiculous claim that this is an easy film to watch generates an atmosphere of dread and tension that you could cut with a knife taking the morbid and inescapable feel of roths earlier cabin fever all the way up to 11 its a hard tough watch thatll leave you gasping for air afterwards and i have to honestly say ive never been this on edge during a movie since sevenreally this is a movie that needs to be watched with an open mind and preferably an understanding of the horror genre its a morbid downbeat and disturbing terrorride and it wont be for everyone but i implore people not to make their mind up before you see it it is shocking it is violent but its also intelligent and cultured a film made by a filmmaker not a film made by committee and it needs recognition as suchon a final note everyone who says this movie is sexist can shove that where the sun does not shed light you need to look at the first act again and get it through your dumb skull that the two russian girls are in the pay of the extreme hunters to entice backpackers to their death you also must have missed the fact that paxton goes back to save his japanese friend instead of leaving her also true fact i went to see this with my friend who isnt particularly big on gore films or indie horror preferring things like team america matrix and the like and she really dug it oh and the theatre was 5050 girls and boys so shove it really get off your damn high horse,cruel
if youre looking for a horror masterpiece youre gonna be disappointed the story has so much potential and could have been such a psychological horror right up there with the likes of saw but nothe story revolves around three stoner dudes who go travelling a lot getting stoned and getting laid they end up in slovakia where they are set up as guinea pigs for demented people who pay to satisfy their cravings for mutilation and murderyou can barely understand anything anyone is saying because apart from two of the characters everyone else has a weird accent the acting is mediocre nudity is rife although if youre looking for a turn on in this film youll be bitterly disappointed  this aint no porno suspense na nowhere near as suspenseful as classics like halloween but there is quite a bit of gore not as much as i expected though all in all i wouldnt recommend this film unless you are just looking for a mindless night in with a mindless horror filmi give it 5 points because it was an alright effort and did have a few cringe worthy moments however it just annoys me that it could have had so much potentialbut alas another big screen let downspoilerone reason to watch this movie is to see this hilarious part the main dude rescues a japanese girl he couldve had the easy way out or rescued her he rescues her and they go on a huge trek escaping the weird people and then they get to the train station  they can finally go home free but no the japanese girl throws herself into the path of a train muahahahahahahahaha,cruel
the main thing i knew about this movie was the hypea lot of hype the most gruesome movie ever will make you sick etc but in honesty there have been worse netherless this movie still has a heart to it it has characters who are genuine and feel real emotionsthe fact that scares me most about this movie is that places like this torture chamber probably exist in a lot of places maybe not to such a big extent but its the next step up from a snuff movie anyhow to be honest it did not seem the right sort of movie for tarantino as the film on a whole was not up there with the rest of his collection but fair play to him for giving another director a push and helping him achieve mainstream successi liked the fact the lead character has a conscience wondered why he bought up that story about a little girl drowning half way through and he risked it all to try save her which was pointless to a degree however her killing herself in front of the train allowed him to get on the other train i also liked the fact the movie never went the way you imagined it ie you expected him to be recaught when he reentered the chamber for the girlall in all a decent movie not a must see but worthwhile710,cruel
with a firm eye on the boxoffice is a mixed bag of gore goodies with plenty of inspiration but a shortage of creative originalitylike a nobrainer version of saw starts off in a dark torture room there then follows 45 minutes of nonviolent action with three male backpackers as they wend there way through a tedious sequence of bouncing bosoms and hashish bongs starting in amsterdam portrayed none too realistically with a marked absence of dutch they follow a trail given them by dodgy fellow travellers to find a in bratislavia promising to be brimfull with sexstarved women and a postwar shortage of men when they get there they are lured one by one to a neglected building that shows art exhibits such exhibits being people gratuitously tortured and killed by perverts paying a high feealthough much blood is used to drench the set writerdirector eli roth cabin fever makes the mistake of descending into black humour and then winding up with a suitably crowdpleasing goodguywins ending one rather wishes he had learnt from his brief brush with antihollywood studio troma where he had small acting parts in the lowbudget but very effective toxic avenger iv and terror firmer and chosen either seriously nasty horror or gruesome tromastyle camp although there is no shortage of nauseating images from chainsaws to surgical instruments rather looks as if it used the british board of film censors guidelines as its handbook the camera jumps away at the crucial moment except when violence is perpetrated by the hero and roth fails to stylise the brutality with either slow motion detailed closeups or snappy editing the pedestrian acting is competent for the limited demands placed on it but the script is trite and full of the sort of macho posturing american cinema would sadly have us associate with us undergraduatessuch amateurishness of technique fails on two counts firstly horror is defined in terms of emotional impact such lightweight treatment means the shock value of the ideas and images themselves have to take the full burden since is no better or worse than any reasonable gore flick yet was well marketed it at least might succeed simply by attracting audiences that are either undemanding of the genre or are shocked because of lack of exposure to good horror filmssecondly given the story line there are ample opportunities for creative effectiveness missed largely because as the film has low artistic merit it must conform to the lowest criteria of the censors for instance modern cgi is capable of very realistic simulation of violence as evidenced in the scene in irreversible where a mans head is caved in with a fire extinguisher but without the camera flinching away good editing can also extend the emotional effect of violence to a very uncomfortable level in audition the build up is so subtle and the first movement of a person tied up in a bag so sudden that the audience skips a collective heartbeat  and later in the same film sadism is extended in time until it is difficult to watch the screen both irreversible and audition are such cinematic masterpieces that the censor treats the violence more leniently  is trapped by its own mediocrity into the level of shocks it can deliverironically roth had plenty of talent to hand including the director of audition and quentin tarantino both of whom have cameo parts yet the most artistic moments are those derived from better films as a sadist surgeon approaches his victim and gasps for air beneath his mask it recalls the similar scene in blue velvet when hopper struggles for breath in his asthma mask as he is about to attack another highpoint when a torturer loses control is effectively emphasised by the identical discordant bursts of background music that were used by bernard herrmann in the famous psycho shower scene where the short stabbing bursts were even more appropriate many other scenes such as the partly dissected asian girl are glimpsed only briefly and not used to their full dramatic potentialin its favour there is some genuine tension in the car chase sequences and the marauding gangs of children seem not only authentic but realistically threatening a girls suicide borrows effectively from japanese horror as she is frozen momentarily in the camera before death for all its superficiality the main story is almost like a modern day vampire movie with buxom eastern european wenches luring westerners to their doom before the main hero nails the bad guy its token believability there are no mutants ghouls supernatural forces  heavily supported in the official website by oblique references to horrific happenings  gives it a slightly darker twist than the modern monster movie hills have eyes or the overworked and so less believable slasher seriesshot in a few months for just over four million covered its cost more than fourfold in its first weekend that it will shock quite a few large audiences and entertain others makes it unfair to categorise the film as worthless but also makes it likely to be overratedthe three thrillseeking homophobic racist backpackers two american one notably icelandic are so unlovable that one really doesnt care whether they are tortured and killed or not  it might make for better movies if such characters were permanently exterminated rather than going on to repopulate the more standard fare teenslasher movie or umpteenth american pie in an interview roth claims he apologised jokingly to the icelandic president for the irreparable damage he was doing to iceland maybe he should just have apologised for making a bad film,cruel
what was most surprising was i was there in cesky kromlov yeah the story is supposed to end up in slovakia but was actually in the czeck rep for one who has traveled through europe this movie crept me out ill be watching who buys me drink but seriously the only sick sadistic person in this world has a ranch in crawford texas what started as a crazy backpacking journey through europe descends into the worst kind of sadistic depravity suckered into a slaughterhouse not found in any frommers book the vacationers find themselves at the mercy of twisted clients who pay big money to hunt torture and kill humans,cruel
first of all eli roth absolutely loves takashi miike and the japanese horror hype  so to say the prime idea for this movie was inspired by miikes odishon these two movies are absolutely not comparable with each other because odishon is very deep dark and traumatic piece of cinema but can we really say that roth has done a bad job when doing this movie i say no this movie does exactly to the viewer what it should do relaxes him completely to the state of being just an ordinary movie and then bam shock the last 2030 minutes of the film is great great fx  great disgusting ideas and environment gloomy atmosphere etc i thought americans would love this movie best but it seems i was very very wrong to finish this review id like to say that roth has some really great ideas and hopefully will convert them to the big screen maybe slightly better by seeing a lot of junk a long way back primarily american cinema this can never be treated as a bad movie no way,cruel
just saw this for the first time and was massively surprised the characters albeit paper thin were wellperformed and the suspensegore was effective what actually got me though wasspoiler alert that the protagonist wasnt some idiotic cutout that almost makes it out and gets killersrecaptured at the end to add to that equation the kid actually exacts much needed revenge on his torturers including the trio that initially conned him and his buddies into the torture chambers running her over twice caused massive cheersits this element thats sorely missing from some horrorslasher flicks as of late the concept of karmic response even in cabin fever we were given a severely down endingand in crap like house of 1000 corpses the evil characters are not only annoying for 2 hours straight they never get a taste of their own medicine a theme i tend to agree withdont get me wrongif your main baddie is someone like freddy krueger i dont mind if the guy lives on and continues the smartass quips and creative killing but if your antagonists are a bunch of retarded rednecks corpses or vapid torturers they deserve some comeuppance at the endeven after paxton slices edward saladhands throat i feared roth would go the traditional route and have a twistending that would sour the guys deserved vengeance a twist ending concept btw that ruined a slasher flick that could have been amazing high tensionsuch as paxton coming back the next year to become a torturer because he enjoyed killing his attackers so much instead roth did th smart thinghe faded out once the scales had been balanced leaving us all to wonder what wed do in such a situationend spoiler thanks mr rothfor showing us that not all horror has to shove a pessimistic taste down our throats as the lights come back on,cruel
im quite surprised this movie actually lived upto the hype imo it wasnt as shocking as i had expected a lot happened offscreen and some of the gore that was shown looked ridiculous that eyeball effectspoiler my main praise for this movie is the fact that it ends without worrying about a potential sequel the good guy wins and the bad guys get what they deserve with todays horror movies you can take it for granted that the outcome will be bleak so i was quite happy that eli roth decided to break this trend as it makes for a more enjoyable movie that i could happily rewatch,cruel
this film is a mixture of saw and seven i think this was a very good film but i think there could have been more bits shown in the film as there was a lot that you dont get to see i must say when i first started watch the film i did think it was an adult movie as it is a typical horror movie if you know what i mean the actors were actors i had never seen before i must say this film isnt for a the people with bad stomach or any one that doesnt like blood it made my stomach turn on a few parts of the film but then again so did seven this is silmiar to seven as the scenes were like it but differenta must see film if you like horror filmsbut apart from that a very good film hence the 9 rating,cruel
im so disappointed after seeing the movie i was very exciting because it was considered  mostly by tarentino as the most impressive movie of the last decadeyeah right impressive in many points such as the way us movies considered east european countries populations and ways of life after an hour i was bored then i was angryit s a shame how can you endure it the scene takes place in a different country for change but the rest of the story is still usual the nice guy will stay alive and kill the bad peopledefinitely it s a total new conceptah ah besides the bad guy is not russian from china or even french but slovakian however i wont promote the movie cause of the actors but only because there was a huge potential that hasnt been used open your mouth and make some noise only if it s worth it,cruel
now this was a horror movie you all probably know what its about so i wont elaborate about it here director eli roth cabin fever has made one hell of a horror movie finally an original horror movie im so sick of the redundant slashers remakes sans a few and crap that they throw out nowadays this was quite a refreshing moviewhat made this movie great first off a solid cast jay hernandez does an excellent job in his role he stands out among the rest in my opinion but thats not to say that the others were bad they were good as well jan vlasak who played a business man on a trip to the same place took the role of the main villain even though he might not quite be the real bad guy and he was great as well really creepy i know the one question for those who havent seen it as youre reading this is it really that gorydisturbingbloody the answer is no its not as bad as you think it will be sure theres blood sure theres torture but not to the extent that its played out to be a lot of it is suggested of course thats not to say that its a slouch in the gore department there are plenty of dismemberments and moments thatll make you cringe the movie gets off to a fairly slow start theres lots of nudity roth even gets away with a full frontal for the first half and throughout that first half there isnt really any horror aspects i think roth put so much nudity in to take the mpaas attention from the torture it worked too i cant believe this movie didnt get slapped with an nc17 its a dark toned movie with blood and torture and nudity once we get to the second half the parts that everyone really came to see we get a hell of a show though one problem though is that at some points the movie is so dark contrastwise that you cant see whats going on most notably during the eye scene there was a clip posted on the internet dunno if anyone caught it anyways it actually looked much better and much more convincing on the screen than it did during that clip on the internet it also doesnt fade to black when hes cutting the eye out either like it did in the clip the camera stays right on the face and damn is it great i dont think that was done on purpose to make you think youre seeing something and make it more intense its just too dark they should really think about lighting it up for the dvd release now im going to compare these two movies now it was more intense than last octobers release of saw ii much more i guess the one major flaw is that it takes so long to really get going that it seems over a little quickly call me sick but i came for some gore and torture and i think that they couldve shown more torture and really gotten to the audience dont get me wrong though what they did show was freaking awesome now im not saying that movie need a ton of gore thats not what makes a movie not at all a horror flick needs suspense and this movie has suspense and lots of it dont let the slow start sway you though its not boring the first half it does set you up for the rest of the movie and makes you feel like the friends are really connected so no this movie is not perfect but its a great one certainly one ill pick up on dvd when it hits around mayjune in the inevitable unrated release the score was pretty good nothing over the top but that may have been a good thing oh and another problem that just came to me was that roth uses the fbomb way too much i understand in some parts hell if that was me getting tortured or in those situations id be yelling it out too but he used it at such awkward times its like he just said hey lets use that here after this movie i vowed to never ever hit a slovokian city check that one off the list not that it was ever onso yeah this was a good horror movie i didnt really touch on everything i dont think so i may go back and edit this later if i think of something else to say so if youre a horror fan then do yourself a favor and see eli roths ,cruel
i live in slovakia i live in bratislava and i consider this movie being one of the funniest horror comedies ever i couldnt stop laughing when those guys arrived just outside bratislava police beating up citizens for no apparent reason gypsy teen gang terrorizing the city 80s hits playing at the local disco tatra 613 as the best car around here this alternate reality ruined any promise of terror and fear i could feel from this movie and it ended up with only one scary setpeople say this is twisted depraved and sick movie our local posters have tagline try not to vomit watching this but to be honest its not that gory as one would think almost everything takes place just outside frame or someone blocks the view or the movie is cut away just before it happens after cabin fever i would expect more but lets wait for unrated directors cut and see what happenstheres been a lot of fuss about this movie around here saying it reflects bad image on slovakia but people do not get its just a movie in my opinion eli roth simply wanted to show different locations and props if he would have shown slovakia as it really is he wouldnt get this image of scary european backwoods where everything is possible and i believe the movie would be a lot less scary for non central european folks we do have the newest cars we do have skyscrapers we dont have gypsies gangs terrorizing towns but hell we have the most beautiful girls in the world,cruel
having seen the trash that was cabin fever i was quite worried that would be a disappointment im glad to say that on the contrary it wasntthe film starts off innocent enough 3 backpackers touring europe looking for some hedonistic fun and lots of sex and who wouldnt being an exbackpacker myself i can relate to their early experience entirely one night they meet a dark and mysterious character in amsterdam who tells them that if they are looking for beautiful girls and lots of them they should head out to a near bratislava which is in slovakia if you dont knowso they do and after a strange incident with a man on the train they go to the and start having lots of the kind of fun you might expectsoon though things begin to take on a more sinister and very gory turnjust to warn you i have seen some very gory films and i actually felt physically sick watching this onei am impressed with the quality of roths filmmaking here as in cabin fever he uses a slightly skewed take on the horror genre going for real suspense instead of the usual bad guy hunting down the teenagers there is a real mystery about this film right up until the last few actsbut dont worry i hear slovakia really is a lovely place,cruel
people here seem split on this movie but let me tell you its pretty damn good people who did not like it weakstomached girls and a few people from slovakia claiming its not like that in their country we know that its a movie most reviews are right about the fact the movie starts off like euro vacation its very sexy and filled with hot nubile european women thats why when the actually horror starts its pretty jolting and done on purpose the eastern european country and its people were created with extreme professionalism very convincing sets and language down to the discos and rundown buildings people also had a problem with the acting i for one thought it was very wellacted especially the european parts like the 2 girls that dragged the americans into their situation i dont know what some here expect from a horror movie oscarcaliber acting as for the horror parts of the movie it lives up to its name as the torture is pretty hard to watch and hear and makes you feel sorry for these guys the villain in the movie just so happens to be some peoples perverse affliction for seeing others in pain and causing it there are real people like this on our planet so this is no made up freddy kreuger villain this movie is actually 3 types of movies a sex movie in the beginning a horror in the middle and a pure vengeance flick towards and end and boy does the victim get his never has vengeance been so satisfying this guy pretty much gets anybody who harmed him and in some creative ways this movie also features some of the baddest most most vile children you have ever seen these streetwise eurokids actually kill 2 people by stoning them then smashing their heads to mush for a bag of chewing gum some of the kids are pretty cute and the site of one asking the other for a piece of gum while their cohorts kill 2 grown men is hilarious anyway dont listen to anybody else check this movie out as it is surprisingly good,cruel
if you look at it from a horrormoviemakers point of view or even from a horrormovielovers point of view it is one of the best movies in the genre to hit the big screen yet the actual horror story is set in an eastern european country and i cant help thinking how the movie can very easily tarnish the image of that country and how it can deter tourists wanting to visit the country especially when the story isnt based on actual events apart from that it is a horror movie and you will be horrified the only positive message i took away from the movie is the message that we need to be extra careful when visiting a foreign country as tourists and recognize that things are done differently in different countries what looks and sounds friendly where we live might not be so in a different country,cruel
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and why from the very beginning to the end its about nothing and less than that there are many violent movies but this one is on the top of them and maybe beyond the frontier of disguise furthermore things are completely wrong presented in this movie and slovakia is shown as the country where live only prostitutes there are many mistakes that could be intended i have no idea why but it disgusted me so much example pragues main station is shown as some german train station it is done in many movies but this is so obvious that the station is in prague and bratislava capital of slovakia is shown as some town with 10000 inhabitants so please dont expect it to be good because it is not good save your evening and have a bottle of wine instead of watching this movie,cruel
nothing in my review that no one else hasnt said already this movie was awful i was so disappointed to see what was a fantastic idea turned into total rubbish some good gore slipped in there pretty lazy though and nowhere near enough because lets face it youre not going to this film to see high art youre here for the gore but not enough and nothing was actually shown in short this movie was crap too much time spent on titties the characters were lousy the violencegore was lazy but the effects were decent script crap characters crap directingediting obvious and here i want to point out a scene where a womans toe is cut off but is tightly cut to some trimming their nails come on that shot is sooooo old there is no saving this movie it is truly truly awful,cruel
at the start of the movie my first impression was another corny teen movie i was right to an extent some parts are corny however some are extremely suspenseful it starts out with a group of three pot smoking friends on a vacation in amsterdam hoping to get stoned out of their minds and sleep with lots of european girls typical and overused yes but it worked unfortunately this scenario plays out for almost half the movie my friend told me about this movie and summarized it as lots of boobs and lots of gore and he was dead on dont get me wrong i enjoy seeing a boob here and there but come on lets do it in moderation ok the nudity was excessive and it felt like it was only there for the ratings they could left out 95 of the nudity and still kept the viewers perfectly happy as for the gore  wouldnt be without it theres no problem there this is a movie that will make you cringe and its a movie that will make you fold up into the fetus position but it wont scare you was much more of a thriller than a horroras for the acting everyone did a good job with the exception of a few scenes everyone was convincing for the most part even the only hired because they were hot european girls since i compared this movie to saw in my summary let me just say the acting was a thousand times better than in saw dont worry about thatall in all i enjoyed this movie but it definitely isnt something id buy it kept my attention it was very suspenseful at times and the story was straight forward and believable it just didnt have the spark metaphorically speaking this is just another notch in the belt in terms of recent horrorthrillersi give it a generous 7 out of 10 starsdont take your kids to this movie,cruel
i think i enjoyed not because of the gore which this movie has loads of or even the sex scenes which are pretty shallow and take up the first part of the movie what i liked about this movie was the story and the point that director eli roth was trying to get across that point is that most people outside of america do not like americans very much in their opinion americans are rude inconsiderate selfish and think they are better than everyone not only are they all these things they are also naive and it is this last point that leads our young protagonists into doing something they are never quite ready for but how could they beeli roth pulls no punches with this movie it is in fact gorier and probably more disturbing then saw he sets the movie up as a soft porn flick which soon changes into a terrific horror movie involving torture and other nasty thingswhat really makes this film work is that deep down we as viewers know that things like this are possible we assume that we are so safe in our own country and believe that we will be just as safe going into other countries all we have to do is think about whats happening over in iraq to see that security is not always possible when you are so far away from your own country and exploring cultures that you really know nothing aboutis not a great film the acting was pretty weak and i found it hard to even care for the characters but then i believe this is part of what eli roth was trying to say after all how can you care for such obnoxious people who care only about themselves and show nothing for others however at the end of the film i do believe that one of the main characters finally understands this and looks as if hes going to change his ways i think maybe a lot of us should,cruel
i was watching the tv when i saw a broadcast about a famous movie named i thought wow that could be really really good then a friend told me that the movie was a terrible crap fair enough lets watch itok this movie is terrible not because its gore or something but because its really really long its really really boring and there is no story the movie starts after 45 minutes which we dont get an interesting thing in then we follow the story of jay hernandez dreadful one and terribly inconceivable murders torture pain etc but without images course there is no blood no real murder anything actually the end is bad too especially with the kids oh my hell what was that for ahahahahahaha jay can escape blablabla he has lost all this friends blablabla ok quentin tarantino please dont make it next time,cruel
basically in the us if filmmakers are having a hard time getting a movie released one strategy is to slap quentin tarantino presents at the beginning because if quentin tarantino likes it then by golly i know ill love it sarcasm anyway this movie was killed by the hype i believe everybody everywhere was calling this the scariest movie of all time it really is notthe first half of the movie is just a couple people getting drunk and having sex eventually they get tortured by some freaks for no apparent reasonthis movie is basically a poor mans saw with more sex sex sells everybody doesnt nearly live up to the hype,cruel
i must admit roth has redeemed himself with after an abysmal outing with cabin fever in that film i could not care less if these characters lived or died because they were so unlikeable it is so important in horror or thriller movies to make the characters so relateable that you could imagine that it is actually you in their situation i am pleased to say that works very well in this area three guys backpacking through europe together get a tipoff that there is a bevy of beautiful women in a town in bratislava who are ready and willing for anything it happens that the guys arent having too much luck in the peoplesaturated amsterdam so they decide to trek over to this town and so the mystery and terror begins one of the things i was shocked by was the polish of this film  not often do people describe horror movies as beautiful  from the cinematography to the score a good example is the intro with the credits snapshots of a dank place somewhere with someone whistling cleaning up a room of some sort from many different angles often blurred or out of focus  but never actually knowing what the heck is going on now for a supposedly gory and ultraviolent movie i found these sensoral moments very rewarding for me buckets of bloods splattering the screen is not scary  more often what you dont see will terrify the viewer much more effectively so the actual goriness of the movie only accounts for roughly 20 but because of the other 80 involved the 20 becomes crucial to the telling of the story yes an intriguing story in a horror movie after an intro of getting to know the characters once events happen to take them away from the main action you feel for them and their fate even beyond this movie it leaves you with a sense of what happens next and not just a sequel for sequels sake jay hernandez is excellent in his role showing a great vulnerability for a male lead when it was possible for him to become all die hard on us  that said he knows when to bring out the big guns when required the other two includes hernandezs friend who began the journey with him and tries to summon the courage to approach the very forward women in amsterdam and an icelandic backpacker who is the complete opposite joined them along the way who bringing a lot of humour to the tale the terror in the movie is excellent and the psychology of the characters intriguing to say the least albeit disturbing as with most horror movies the overall message is the same regarding our human ability to trust others and when it is misplaced i am hoping with the sequel they can build on and enhance the atmosphere created in this movie and continue to chill the pants right off us ,cruel
on behalf of the cast eli roth  the rest of the crew i would like to apologize to the people who were not satisfied with the intellectual content of this movie but i would also like to extend sincere condolences for those peoples lifes if you find yourselves without it get one fasti honestly hate the kind of people who say that a movie is bad  has no intellectual stimulae just for the sake of it does it make you feel better about yourselves do you think youre smarter just for saying stuff like that wake up  smell the bs next to you on your pillows my friendsyou dont have to hate the blairwitch project to love memento despise saw to enjoy the game or loathe reservoir dogs to crave for gigli just kiddin anyway hope you critics out there get the general ideathis is a great bloody movie literally its the kind of a movie that makes you twitch and also puts in perspective just how much life is valued nowadays a moral core inside a violent  vulgar nutshellits true that it doesnt have the most complex storyline but the unfolding of events compensates that editing  image is great cool soundtrack and a surprisingly good performance from the lead jay hernandez one to look out for in the futureall in all i really recommend this movie to all of you out there with an open mind  strong stomach ps also makes you think twice about visiting easterneurope doesnt it psii please slovakians  phony i give a crp about ethics kind of people stop wining people with a few neurons wont get the wrong idea about slovakia  stop making such a big deal out of nothing,cruel
has been unfairly criticize for being too gory and sadistic as people ignore what the movie is trying to say on human nature s basic tone and plot is this the exploration of humanitys nature for finding the pleasures of life and always seeking more ways to fulfill its cardinal sins the three victims in the movie are all seeking pleasure through sex and drugs but those who go to the business in slovakia no longer can get fulfillment from casual sex and drug use so they seek their pleasures in sadistic torture and blood these people will pay large amounts of money and conduct the most horrendous acts just to fulfill their desires in some sad way this is so true as everyone has that deep deep desire to hurt or watch someone die whether one tries to see if theres dead bodies after an accident or killing virtual soldiers or people in video games to me explores this secret desire upfront in graphic details yes the film is dark yes the movie is gory and sadistic i was surprised it got an r rating but so can human nature all you need to do is watch the evening news and know its true it is a horror classic in the making in the likeness of last house on the left  the hills have eyes,cruel
some critics with delusions of philosophical grandeur have gone the old cautionary tale route in justifying the excesses of eli roths tediously grueling sophomore effort and while i would be inclined to agree that it is a cautionary tale it is certainly not in the same context by my count we learn 3 important lessons over the course of 90 minutes 1 quentin tarantino will attach his name to any hot piece of crap that purports to push the boundaries of genre cinema 2 harry knowles and his ilk are clearly commissioned by companies like miramax and lions gate to provide laudatory blurbs in order to help boost box office and 3 the hype surrounding eli roth and his craft is still seriously unfoundedin spite of the praises of a drunken peter jackson and recommendations from several friends i found roths debut feature cabin fever to be a maddeningly obnoxious romp lacking in script redeemable characters and any sense of style you might argue that im being overly analytical that i cant enjoy a movie for what it is but you would be wrongthe worst offense of cabin fever is a total lack of joy in its execution of horrific events and gushing goreso is a homonym that becomes less clever the more you hear it an improvement over roths previous effort not really while more technically proficient and a bit more developed in story which isnt saying much it ultimately remains an experience that is more exhausting and tedious than horrifying and suspenseful despite the grisly subject matterthe story such as it is follows 2 american fratboy types and their icelandic buddy on a backpacking trip across europe that none of these guys are ever clearly defined as characters leaves us to view them as a trio of sexist homophobic jocks who would be getting pounded in the pit at ozzfest while on a train to slovakia our heroes encounter a foreign businessman who eats salad with his fingers har har insisting that man has lost his relationship with food an apparent double meaning is at work here but ill be damned if i know how it ties into this movie once in slovakia our zeroes check into a posh where they are accosted by a duo of eurobimbettes ta ensues thus signing away whatever life insurance policy these idiots have as our fellows gradually and vaguely disappear it becomes apparent that an underground syndicate of traveling businessmen are paying hefty fees to torture and murder youths in an ugly abandoned warehouse or somethingwhile the setup promises great things for an overachieving gorehound the reality of is very disappointing that we care nothing for the characters is the first problem the clunky uneven pace that provokes frustration when events should be jetting along is another and the incredibly awkward attempts at humor including a gang of renegade slovak children are distracting and throw the movie even further from the base of realism it so desperately wants to captureif roth has improved his craft on a technical level it is ironic that this is another factor that works against in a movie going for gritty horror the settings certainly smack of a bowelsofhell squalor but the orchestral score combined with acting that is too deliberate and studied to convey a mood of real consequence sinks the intended effect whereas the recent wolf creekwith its unrefined acting souldeadening night sequences and no effort made to explain its madness heightened the experience to terrifying effect is constantly reminding us its only a movieonly a movieonly a movie does have its gory moments though theyre set against such stark lighting or encapsulated in momentary edits that theyre sometimes hard to make out while the violence is plentiful and done in grand guignol fashion it left me feeling cold and indifferent compared to say saw ii which has a justificationno matter how contrivedfor its madness is simply a shock show that condenses its confused point in a speech given by a nattering businessman before he applies a blowtorch to his victims eye one can almost imagine roth emphatically saying this is the kind of awful stuff that goes on in the world see its all justified which of course is like saying the devils rejects was justifiedperhaps the most savage and nihilistic moment comes at the very end where our lone surviving hero minus dos dedos murders the foreign businessman from earlier in the film thus giving a hollow rush of vengeance that doesnt blur the line between tormentor and tormented but instead shows the films hypocritical standpoint on human rights as if by killing one of the sadists the blackmarket torture trade will magically come to a screeching halt the resulting conclusion i drew from this is that were pretty much all scum and have lost our relationship with what makes a quality horror film anymoreis a testament to that25 out of 10,cruel
not bad i will admit right up to par with saw 2 please it takes you to the face of horror and does not back down every time it got good they would cut away or change scenes this movie could have been good with a different director granted roth is a good writer but not such a fine director the last scene was the best and most horror filled i actually think it looked like a different style of directing if you ask me just because you throw fake blood and fake body parts around does not make it a horror film this movie did not scare me it was not the best of horror it was barley better than the devils rejects which really sucked i gave this movie a chance and no it did not suck but it was not even worth the discount ticket price i paid not very cinematic at all i could have watched it on a six inch screen with the same effect the ending when he remembers the girl drowning and runs to save the girl i mean the story of his childhood memories never fit the movie at all it was out of nowhere they could have played that whole series of events and emotions out better but thats just me,cruel
dont you think the location of the movie to slovakia is rather ridiculous since there is nothing what should remind this country except for a few background songs the native language used in the movie sounds rather czech only for those who could recognize it all scenes are situated in czech republic this fact degrades the authenticity the authors selected slovakia  they should have made it there no worth to travel around the world to get something not authentic dont you agree with me there is enough such creepy places all around the world to get the same result the opinion on this movie in slovakia varies but tends to be mostly negative if the icelanders were described as a drunken sex maniacs then the country was pictured as a sick place in the middle of nowhere,cruel
in regards to the violence of the film i must say i was somewhat surprised based on the reviews and the online buzz surrounding the movie i assumed i was in for a blood bath with the camera lingering on each painful and graphic torture i planned on watching people leave the theater in disgust but in my theater anyways no such thing happened after all quentin tarantino did help roth evolve his idea for the movie as well as with the script and he must have been given a chance to lend assistancehis ideas to the torture scenes after viewing the movie however i thought that while the violence was grisly and gruesome it was not as bad as it was made out to be because the camera did not linger on all of the violence and torture actually occurring instead we are left with the aftermath i am not someone obsessed with violence whatsoever but i could easily name 5 movies that contain more graphic and brutal violence than i was also disappointed that the scene with the toe in the bolt cutters cutaway before we are allowed to see what happens although it is obvious yet a severed chillies tendon is given a close up i was disappointed with the chainsaw scene and had planned for it to be used more and for it to have cut more up so to speak than it did again im not a psychopath obsessed with violence but i thought that could have been much more bloody and graphic than what it was a new and refreshing idea for a horror movie nonetheless and i look forward to roths next horror installment710 comments,cruel
in a group of three friends are touring europe and are looking for a good time they get burnt out by the antiamerican sentiment in amsterdam and decide to go to slovakia where they are told the best woman are but things are not what they seemthis movie is a lot like urban legend meets hellraiser with lots of gruesome blood and guts it is not really that scary and there is not very much that is unique about it i am a bit surprised that quentin tarantino would put his name on this film there is nothing all that clever about the plot or storyin its defense there are a lot intense gruesome scenes if you like that sort of thing it is not for everyone the cinematography was really good and it has a lot of naked girls running around,cruel
i was quite disappointed by the time i got to the end of this movie i agree with the user who commented before me todd koerner from hermosa beach with his analogy it certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge but at the conclusion it just felt like eating cotton candy  no real nutritional value just a sense that i had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoffi agree to a point i almost think that after all the hype there would have been more to it a quirk or a twist would have been good but it turned from a somewhat creepy horror movie into an actually laughable ending the movie wasnt even scary i dont get quote scared unquote at movies but i appreciate the horror of it but this one was off the deep end no explanation no reason think of it along the same lines as jeepers creepers only with a bit more nudity and gore i wouldnt say dont watch this movie but i wouldnt advise going to the theater and spending too much on itthis movie is a rental for sure of course with the mostly brain dead young adults in this day and age im sure it will be classified as incredibly horrific and the such but frankly im disappointed that quentin tarantino would put his name on it just to make money to be frank i only paid money to go see it because i was and am a big fan of tarantino and of his mentor robert rodriguez hope to hear some more comments and reviews of this movie,cruel
what a disappointmentwell go ahead and lay this out  this movie had a truly sick disgusting premise you would think that with a theme as out there and true to life as this that a filmmaker could really say somethingthis movie could have pushed the limits of filmmaking this movie could have been a commentary on human nature the desire for blood how money can buy anything the inherent evil nature of humanity something this movie could have been so many things but it ended up just being a typical big screen horror film same stupid formulaic plot weve been seeing since we started watching horror its a shame nobody can seem to make horror with a solid plot lineill give it some credit  it had something going for it until the end then it tried to wrap itself up too fast and lost any and all plot credibilitylong story shorti didnt see anything i hadnt already seen done better in saw over a year ago,cruel
tarrantino has gone insane this film was a bloodfest that offered no clever plot or witty dialogue that we have come to expect from the producer is one of the worst films i have ever seen aside from severed limbs impressively depicted with cuttingedge effects is devoid of anything more than gore the predictable plot is exacerbated by highly improbable chance encounters that serve simply to allow tarrantino to kill someone else in he hopes a more shocking fashion than the last oscillates between sex and torture two aesthetically intriguing subjects when integrated into an interesting plot however these subjects as implemented in contribute to the shallow and disappointing nature of the production i left the movie feeling nauseated and envious of those exiting from the chronicles of narnia even the family stonegoers appeared more enlightened following their movie than myself having retained no capacity for intelligent thought after having the life sucked out of me by ,cruel
this movie was not at all what i thought it was going to be i was expecting a sawlike psychological thriller type movie instead i was handed this piece of crap the trailers made it look all cool but as you sit down in the theatre you get a hard slap on the face it is basically a eurotrip ripoff as some other people have said then for like the last halfhour or so you get to see a little bit of goreviolence mostly off screen it is ridiculous to me that someone would need the paramedics called in for them during this movie i have seen worse things on the tv show csi so it is my advice that you avoid this movie for its sure stupidity but if you happen to get sucked in to going to see this garbage of a film do yourself a favor bring a pillow and take a little nap honestly the worst movie i have ever seen well maybe not the worst at least ties with peter jacksons king kong though,cruel
i just saw the premiere at toronto this afternoon eli roth was presenting as a work in progress let me say this you could hardly tell the look of the film was excellentnow on to film is story about some guys back packing through europe looking for drugs and girls they hear about a that is supposed to have the best girls around so they decided to go check it out in slovakia surprise surprise its not quite what they expectedthis movie made me want to throw up at times and that is a compliment some scenes were just so unsettling and disturbing fans of the genre will not be disappointed if you want to see a great horror film that doesnt hold back the punches or try to sell you any watered down pg13 crap then this is the movie for you eli roth knows how to make the audience squirm in their seats and doesnt hold back on the gore there should be more films like this out there,cruel
i had no expectations whatsoever when i went to see all i knew was that it was a socalled horror movie what i did not know was that i was about to sit through equal parts of porn and slaughter it seems as if the makers tried to put together all the ingredients that they thought made teenagers and some adults watch films drugs hot nude women road trips and sickening horror for me was a failureit is not that i do not like horror horror is great as long as it is done properly in there were none or very few surprise moments and no moments of hes coming hes coming if you dont count the sex personally i dont think that human beings have come to such a low level that they need to see bodies being mutilated in the worst kind of ways in order to get satisfied with a horror movie and i can not understand why the makers of would think so eitherif you like a good scare dont watch this,cruel
well lets say i didnt hear a word about when i popped the dvd in i thought this was one of those teenage standard movies teenagers go somewhere they meet some strange individual and he butchers them lots of screaming and short skirts blood everywhere and so on blah blahwhat i got instead was something primal something infiltrated the walls of my flat that i really havent felt since i was attacked by a dog at the age of three it crept inside my stomach and it made it crunch for a very very very long time and it made me feel sick for a long time after the movie was overi didnt realize what happened at first but then i got it the greatest introspection lets be clever with words the greatest vivisection of fear in this movie is done by portraying a human like a piece of meat and even worse portraying a human being as a helpless piece of meatthe whistling of the torturer the atmosphere uh its very hard to be indifferent its very hard to see it as a comedy it doesnt try to be a comedy because is a true horrifying experience i guess it is one of those movies where reality clashes with fiction and makes your deepest fears blossom into this crunch this movie successfully attempts to brutally destroy every single attempt to view it in a more comedylike way because it doesnt allow you to laugh there is nothing in this movie that can take your concentration away from the suffering victims and their demonic torturers the great achievement of this movie is that it doesnt try to obfuscate the nature of horror but tries constantly to amplify it it constantly tries to push the fear inside of you to the point you cannot take it anymore and you look away but hey you are already shivering and feeling awful and thats why a 10 is far less than this movie deservesthis is a cult movie its so great that in a sense is a true snuff movie because it makes you sick just like it would make you sick if you saw torture live in your flat garage and thats far more than i was willing to experience when i popped the dvd inlots of other viewers tried to diminish the importance of the movie because of the sexual content calling it porn well i understood since watching scream that every good horror movie needs to have sexual elements  but i guess that is not the only thing the director and writer tried to achievesex and death are relatedthere is a sense in all of this young teenagers go to slovakia to get laid because teenagers are obsessed by sex while on the other hand the old adult men are obsessed by death and the state of arousal having sex and killing people are just two sides of the same coin thats why the sex in this movie has logic as it needs to balance the pleasure of sex with the pleasure of torture and killingthats why i mentioned the brett easton eliss book american psycho which balanced the sexual arousal with killing and torture in a similar yet even more disturbing way when you read the book with graphic depictions of sex it makes your level of arousal so high that you just dont care if bateman kills and dismembers them two seconds after well while bee american psycho has a good effect this movies has exactly the opposite effect it makes you sick but in a way like eliss book this movie succeeds in transforming fiction into real sickness of the viewer and thats something very very very extreme and unprecedented in my personal experiencehowever some viewers wrote about the social criticism of the movie noting that it shows the degrade in postcommunist countries well as i am a citizen of a post realsocialist country i see this movie in a perhaps biased waythe price tags on people 50000 for 1 american 20000 for a european and 10000 for a local shows that the east europeans see in americans a special enemywhy would eastern mafia enjoy so much torturing americans that it is willing to pay 5 times the price of a local the movie alludes to the arrogant behavior of americans which act so bluntly superior to everybody else 2500 people dead in the wtc attack are far more important than 500000 killed iraquis or 1 million killed vietnamese the other reason why the eastern wealthy are so eager to torture americans is because its the americans that destroyed the communist utopiatorture can mean two things in a social context as the west is torturing the new europe nations so the mafia tortures westerners as an act of revenge it is important to notice that the mafia members are buying americans communism had the ambition to make everybody equal while in this movie capitalism money empowers the mafia members by offering them chances to buy western touriststhe moral degradation that capitalism brought to eastern nations in a metaphorical way is in this movie portrayed as a pay back time with the same methods that the west used to destroy the east  by offering money by buying people with the american dreami think this movie has some pretty sound pillars  aesthetically and fundamentally it is not a simple horror movie because it tries hard to have a background and all said and done this is probably one of the best horror movies i have seen in 20 yearsenjoy it and nevermind the low ratings id give it a 12,cruel
an avid fan of horror i have got to say that this is by far the scariest movie ive ever seen im never travelling far from home thats for sure i could see this happening i really could billionaires getting bored with all the things they can buy or just a little nuts i almost think it could be trueas far as effective horror goes this was more than adequately effective it starts a little slow and then scares the bejesus out of you the gore was necessary and i dont think it was excessive at all it was the perfect horror movie it did what moves are meant to do scare the hell out of you,cruel
everything has been told in previous comment is really awful movie it doesnt scare peoples it make them feel sick and vomit instead its really shameless to publish such movie why first slovakia is middleeurope here is also located geographical middle of europei live in slovakia bratislava its city with about 500 000 inhabitants skyscrapers airport huge shopping centers cinemas churches theaters schools offices corporations producing highend products traffic jams and many others like any other ordinary city and it absolutely doesnt look like barelyelectrified medieval settlement full of blood dirt sluts and robbinghungrythiefchildrens btw when you look closer on the scene when guys are getting of the train and looking around dirty train station you should notice the name of the station praha poricany i think it testifies about something btw2 it was really hard to find such exemplar of an ancient tv from lobby it can be rarely located in few museums the problem is that if someone who has never been here see such movie it will persuade him that this is the way people live there and he will pray not ever end up in here or he came here with hundred dollars in pocket in belief that he will find here the movie and when he leaves plane he will be many more than surprised btw3 bratislava belongs between first 50 most expensive cities worldwide thanks for your time,cruel
i am open to pretty much any type of film but this quite easily ranks as the worst film i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few stinkers  whats worse is that it was made in 2005 with a relatively large budget and tarantino as a producer  how is crap like this even allowed to leave the studio i wont go into spoilers but this film pretty much fails on every single level and it is not even remotely scary i cant believe that this film has been compared to saw for goriness  it doesnt even compared and the storyline in this makes saw look like citizen kanerarely do i ever regret watching a film no matter how bad but i certainly regret wasting 94 odd minutes of my life on this crudi can hardly believe that a sequel is being made for this,cruel
as you can see by my title i ran across quite a lot of complaints about this movie before i watched it it had a bad plot people said it was porn for the first 40 minutes and its transition into gore was really sudden the acting was bad the directing was terrible the story sucked etc etcwhen i watched it i was very pleasantly surprised to find that all these complaints were wrong sure some of them were based on truths but i think people distorted them simply because they didnt like the premise yes the first 2030 not 40 minutes of the film had quite a lot of nudity in it but it was by no means porn and though im not a great fan of mindless sex at least it wasnt pointless the sex is what lured the main characters into the in the first place and the transition into the gore was not sudden but quite easily handledin fact im surprised at the wonderful job that eli roth did at transforming the mood from light and flippant into dark and unfathomably disturbingthe acting was by no means bad jay hernandez i believe did a spectacular job as paxton it is fascinating to watch paxtons character change from a carefree college student obsessed with sex and girls to a troubled man that delights in vengeance against his torturers the other actors did their job well though derek richardson as josh while mostly skillful needed to work on his whimperingnow for the story as you all should know its about three collegeage men that backpack across europe looking for sex and theyre recommended to a which turns out to be a place that people get tortured seriously the plot is better than i made it sound eli roth didnt add many fancy or unexpected twists into his screenplay you wont see the kind of surprise endings that the saw franchise is famous for but everything eli roth does have in here he made sense of he uses very little unnecessary material and he does a great job at subtle foreshadowing so that in the end everything makes sense please pay attention to the scene where paxton tells josh about a childhood memory of watching a girl die because it foreshadows what would have otherwise been a really dumb er i mean gryffindorish moment in the scripti also loved the fact that eli roth and the sound editors didnt splurge on the screams in fact when the screams get particularly loud the editors actually turned them down and instead increased the other noises such as the chainsaws or most memorably the snapping of sharp scissors you cant know just how pleased i was that they didnt blast me from my seat with 100000 decibels of pure soundi also loved the score which moved away from the overlycreepy style of horror films and more towards the dramatic form it suited the film better because this film was really not scary however it was truly disturbing and horrific hence the term horror film it is dumbfounding to witness this appalling display of human brutality and its marked effect on the characters namely paxtonhe has an absolutely haunting terror in his eyes during the last halfhour of the movie this brutality is made all the more effective by roths refusal to use the safer less inciting cuttoblack techniques found in cheap horror films no he shows us everything in great bloody detail and it is grossthe trailer said the movie was based off true events im guessing it probably meant the premise as opposed to the actual characters but either way its entirely believable humans are cruel creatures and they go to insane lengths to continue in their destructive depravity it was roths effectiveness in conveying this theme that made me give this movie a 9 instead of an 8this movie is a mustsee for horror fans or for mature viewers if you cannot see past the gore you should probably not watch this movie if you can however you need to watch this at least once more if you can stomach it despite the side effects of a churned stomach and a severe jolting of the emotions and senses,cruel
you can determine when a film is worth viewing when it has 120 comments half of which are doing everything possible to convince others not to see ityou can tell its worth viewing when people spout absurd statements referring to the iraq war as an argument not to see ityou can tell its worth viewing when people lie to convince others not to see ityou can tell its worth seeing when fanatics on both the left and the right claim it is the sign of the apocalypseyou can tell this this horror film is horrifying the people who have written passionate negative reviews are those who are unable to handle this film they try to negate its horror with all sorts of devices to dissuade others from seeing it from saying its boring to homophobic xenophobic misogyny proviolence etc etcthe controversy this film has created speaks for itself it is far from boring its nauseatingshockingdisgustinghorrificboring movies dont have 120 wildly diverse comments on imdbanyone who can honestly say they werent affected by the eye torture scene is a liarthis film hark ens back to the days when horror films did just that,cruel
one of the worst movies ive ever seen it really has no point a complete waste of time a group travels to slovakia from holland and passes through a hotel named and cant even get into it so searches for another place to stay and the name of comes from there great and then they go after a bunch of horny girls to slovakia just to get laid they have fun and everything is perfect etc etc and then girls sells them to a butcher simplifying and they die one by one pffft only thing is that they die horribly so basically the movie is about minor sex scenes and horrible deaths it could be a successful movie if the director would make it a porn movie or a teenage scary movie i bet so anyway they die and one friend manages to escape without two fingers losing fingers seems like no big deal in the movie but in fact its pretty much traumatic he would pass out or die from blood loss but instead of that he just walks away with two fingers in his pocket then he decides to rescue a japanese stranger from the hotel that he was staying in and she manages to escape with his help but this time without an eye also he cuts her eye himself she loses a lot of blood and that mustardlike liquid and all then she joins him in the great escape they run away like two wounded heroes from that place and in the end she commits suicide which she couldve done sooner and he decides to kill a psycho he met in the train at the first time also he kills him the same way as that doctor tortured him and the way this guy killed his friend by slitting his neck which he has no idea about so my point is this is a regular american guy and decides to play hero after a massacre out of nowhere that makes not much sense the whole movie makes no sense its just great to kill time and turn you into psychos also i couldnt stop thinking that is slovakia like this beggarmurderer children hot girls around who are ready to sell your body people doing everything for money i cant imagine how come they let the movie soil the whole country or a part of it thats not the point though the point is this movie sucks and thats it,cruel
i am partly a fan of horror movies especially admire the basis of alfred h and how he developed the idea of suspension the untold and unseeni have none complains about this movie as a masterpiece direction good act special effects even a great story  but i really have to wonder  is it ok to make and play films this sort in cinemas what is the main reason to produce such stuff who can enjoy it what questions does it answer where is the beauty and art of the idea i heard people complain about nudity  who can complain about nudity and sex in this movie its the last thing to complain aboutall stories are probably told in this world what count is how they are told are we really on the final frontier,cruel
very briefly seeing this film if youre not from slovakiaczech republic is a waste of timei am from slovakia and for me this film was poor and sarcastic comedy about eastern europe to this moment im really confused about how the director managed to get so many old cars like tatra 613 or where in slovakia is po345269any slovakian girls are not horny sluts and our country is not run by mafia yes we have internet and refrigerators no the gypsy kids wont kill anyone for a bag of candies and the police dont beat people without any reasonif this film was meant to be horror its a bclass one too much blood senseless killing etc the environment is not scary eitheri still dont understand why was this film made by eli roth  unskilled pathetic director with typically american sight on world,cruel
dear people you may want to know what i think about this movie tell me what is so exciting on a bunch of guys that travel across the europe just for getting high and having sex with european girls hehe  it was announced to be one of the most brutal and scariest movie ever but the result was embarrassing when they come to bratislava there is a sign of city poricany that is in czech rep the place this crap was filmed there are no children gangs that would kill you for a candy roth made himself a lot of enemies there nothing happens during the first half they just have a sex party and suddenly they starts to disappear in that than some logical looking after them finding out whats the matter few dead people two cut off fingers and quite really good escaping scene in the endsummary once you get dvd of this so called film you can easily use it as a very expensive beer trayzero points would suit this film disaster betterby the way this review is strongly influenced by the fact that im from czech rep and i find director of this crap as a very untalented person even my 11 years old would make it better seriously,cruel
of time trashy and stupid i have no idea how the one person who wrote the review about it being fabulous even came to that conclusion other then the fact that they dont know good movies if youre looking for something with a plot line good acting and a good cast to go with it unpredictability realistic gore and quite frankly what i am waiting for is stuff like rottencomdo not see this i thought it was pretty funny that that one person said it basically made them sick their stomach was still in a knot are you kidding if you have a real stomach for such things this is childs play lets just say all in all i was majorly disappointed,cruel
from a technical standpoint its done pretty well but from a plot storyline and artistic standpoint its basically a piece of crapeli roth was quoted as saying the reason the movie is full of false representations and lies about slovak history and who they are is that he was trying to make a statement about how americans are ignorant about slovakia now for that statement eli must take the cake as one of the biggest jerks hollywood has ever producedso let me get this straight  is actually a practical joke that this boston native is playing on americans im not sure anyone got the joke including europeans so eli is going to make a movie in which he makes loads of money from americans that is actually a practical joke on americans not sure i get iti can think of better ways to make the sort of statement that eli made  i dont think that this is the real statement he made  its clear that this is a jack back stepping after making a film that has no clear artistic pointi think there are plenty of educated americans who know where and what slovakia is  but i also think there are americans who do not know a thing about slovakia  but one thing is for sure  the only thing roth proved with this movie is that he is the latteri love great horror movies and i think violence and gore are justified in a great piece of art  the exorcist is a great example of that this is no more than a modern day slasher movie  not sure why roth cant just admit that,cruel
i was in the mood for a clever horror movie akin to saw and was sorely disappointed with the unrated version wasted nearly an hour of my life with gratuitous female nudity irresponsible use of the word retard faggot and gay by jay hernadezs character and allinall pointless scenes the horror part didnt even start until well into the movie and the plot development left much to be desired unfortunately i watched the movie to the end hoping quentin tarantino would redeem himself with some wit some twist or for heavens sake some plotaside from a lot of bloodgore nudity and swearing this movie had no substance unlike saw which was a smart and scary enough movie to leave out the unnecessary tits that pad any bad movie i found to be insulting and an absolute waste of time for anyone other than a horny 12yearold boy with an iq of 80,cruel
does anyone seriously believe eli roths claim that this exercise in gloating sadism is a commentary on the war in iraq he has said in interviews that was inspired by viewing websites where one could arrange to kill human victims in thirdworld countries apparently he originally intended to make a documentary about this for whatever reason legal perhaps this proved impossible never mind  the movie clearly appeals to the same crowd as would roll up to see an actual snuff moviethe only connection with iraq that i can see is that unashamed celebrations of cruelty such as this have no doubt contributed to the culture that spawned the sniggering torturers of abu ghraib,cruel
all the reviewers missed the whole point of this movie they say it is misogynistic and degrading to woman however after i read an interview of the director it became clear that the movie is the complete opposite of that our tourists in this movie are drawn to the because they want to exploit the poor women who are desperate now a lot of people say could not sympathize with the characters well thats the whole point they are not sympathetic characters as barbara says now you are my bitch now its like all the woman in the world who have been exploited are getting their just revenge on our characters in a way thats why a lot of guys dont like it its a little too close for comfort i see some people complain that they used a real european country as the setting of course imo that just makes it more creepy since although slovakia is a remote country that many americans have never visited it does exist its just like a haunted house that you remember when you were a kid if it was some imaginary country you could dismiss as not really existing now the same people are complaining about the unreal plot here when they believe perfectly in the chucky doll or freddy appearing in your dreamsi would say this is more like a european movie since the characters are not acting over the top like robert denero or joe peschi additionally i like the use of foreign languages in movies god knows ive seen too many american movies with all the actors speaking english with bad german accents,cruel
is the best movie ive seen in a long long time probably everalthough the surplus amount of tits and ass in the first half hour is quite entertaining the story line alone is what stands out to be the movies best feature if you are a fairly intelligent movie watcher this movie will leave you with the regretful thoughts of why didnt i think of that first the idea of what goes down in slovakia and how there are so many people involved completely fascinates me so in closing if you have seen and not utterly enjoyed it you are retarded long live the sneepur patrol,cruel
i am so sorry that i spent time watching this movie good thing is that i decided to leave before it was too muchbut what i saw can be described in two words awful and bizarre looking from any perspective thats the movie that says nothing means nothing and worths nothing i would like to hear if anybody found something in it i found it offending for a normal human bean with a passion for good storyif you are thinking about watching this movie please dont you will regret trust meand for me this is the last time to trust tarantino and expect something from him,cruel
calling this a scary movie is like calling a hard core porn movie a tender love story if you saw tarantinos reservoir dogs and enjoyed the scene where the cop gets his ear cut off well think of that scene times 10the actual movie could have been a good thriller without even showing one torture scene it could have shown torture tools and sounds that would had left the rest to your imagination but like a hard core porn movie nothing had to be left to your imagination thanks to upclose graphic material i had no problems with the sex  drug scenes in the movie i dont want to compare this to porn because if the goal of porn is to get your sexually stimulated then this movies goal is to turn your stomach not in a horror movie way but in a perverted sadistic wayi can deal with the multiple what are the odds of that happening events through out the movie especially the revenge killings and escape scenes if the movie offered some type of artistic angles that made you overlook the perverse sadistic violence then you got something for sitting through it all instead it left me feeling like i just watched some type of snuff film off some twisted sm web site or somethingjeffrey dahmer would have loved this film if he was still alive but i didnt,cruel
its just beyond everything man does what is imaginable just shocking if you let the movie convince you something like this could really happen somewhere ok lets say somewhere without war background  because we already know such things happen there i just dont like why slovakia has to pay for it and the city supposed to be bratislava is just shown to be some kind of farming village and everybody whos been there knows what a lovely city it really is8 points because this is the most shocking film i can imagine having seen for all those claiming just gore youre just afraid of whatever it is that youre afraid of and if you dont let a film like this get close  why bother even watching movies at all,cruel
this movie very well sums up what america has turned into a thoughtless and careless place this movie had so much gratuitous blood and effects that the overall plot was lost weve become so desensitized as a country that filmmakers have to try harder and harder to shock us well roth did it but not in a good way the original idea for the movie was good but the goriness and blood of it all made me not only ever want to see this movie but none of roths movies the fact that tarantino put his stamp of approval on this shows us what a sick and twisted man he really is this movie left me feeling like i need to take a shower with a wire bristle brush right after vomiting if you like crap watch this movie,cruel
to all those of you who have commented negatively on due to its gore i can only say what else did you expect this movie is all out horror like back in the 70s and 80s over the past few years horror has been weak and watered down even receiving 15 age ratings most of the so called horror movies with 15 age ratings are really just psychological thrillers for example the film hide and seek if you dont want to watch horror fine just rent teeny bopper mtv crap but if you real horror how its meant to be then roth is the guy see and cabin fever thanks to roth and films such as we may now start seeing more real horror movies back in mainstream cinema,cruel
sorry for any spelling issues  english is a foreign languageat first i must say that im totally disappointed of quentin tarantino i liked his movies and how brutality was used but totally shook this opinion i cant understand how tarantino could engage his self in a movie like thisthe story bores from the minute the film starts the 3 main characters have no depth and somehow their stupidity makes the viewer lack any feelings for them the first 45 min you see them smoke weed f anything that comes across them and thats totally it  sounds already boring their play is also more sort of a bmovie  except there is no point to laugh then slowly the story unfolds  which is easy to get behind  there is no suspense to compensate this lack of suspense splatter of the worst kind is used i mean in general im a fan of splatter  chainsawing zombie exploding heads weve already seen anything like this  but always in the right place and packed into a story dont expect this to happen in drilling holes into legs and cutting of achilles heels is not cool its cruel and this film shows things like that in close up dont get me wrong im not a sissy ive seen worse in the hospital where i worked but in you dont even care if the 3 boys get killed you dont have a relationship to them this film celebrates the cruel killing as its only content this is not cool this is boring splatter films with zombies are cool splatter films from japan are cool bmovies are cool but is plain cruel and boring  because it doesnt involve you youre just disgusted by the things shownanother major issue are the stupid stereotypes pot smoking netherlands poor ugly and criminal former soviet people simple characters is the most friendliest term that comes to my minddont get fooled of the trailers and the tarantino thing this movie sucks and is not worth your time watch from dusk till dawn instead and see some nice splatter1 point for a film thats ending is as surprising as sand in the desert,cruel
at first i was a little nervous about watching this movie because i thought it was going to haunt my dreams but unfortunately it was all hype every single thing that happened in this movie ive seen before in other movies there is nothing new or groundbreaking in this film at allon the plus side it certainly becomes more frightening when you consider that is it base on actual events but i really feel this film was its own worst enemy the hype that surrounded this film was impossible to live up tothis film left me with none of the emotions i was expecting i was expecting to constantly be thinking what i would do if i were in that position however for the most part all i could think of was how unrealistic certain parts of the film were ie when paxton with half his hand missing was moving around like a superherobefore i saw this film i was trying to compare it to the saw movies however after seeing this film there is simply no comparison at all saw and saw ii blow it away in originality and terrori must say though in defence of this movie that the acting was excellent the dialogue was was fast and crisp and kept you intrigued,cruel
this movie is not scary it is a joke the super fake scenes are even that gory my girlfriend and i were very let down i cant believe the director made such a horrible movie if you want to see something scary see the remake of texas chainsaw massacre that was actually scary i dont get scared easily so that is a problem for scary movies but this one was just sad the first 45 minutes of the movie are a waste of time take way to long to get to any kind of action this movie is nothing compared to duck til dawn even that was better than this luckily i had a coupon to rent this from blockbuster otherwise i would have returned it and asked for my money back,cruel
how can a magnificent director like tarrantino let his name be associated with this crapi have seen many bad movies in my life but this is probably the worst ever and i am sad to see tarantinos name on the front cover i got screwed crap actors crap effects ok plot but the way its portrayed here just simply sucksim amazed that he would ever find himself associated with low rate entertainment like thismy advice to tarantino fans is let this movie pass or you will have to find a new idol,cruel
when i pop in a movie and sit down in my seat i expect to be entertained by the genrecomedy i should be laughing drama i should be interested horror i should be scaredthis movie failed to even appear to be a film this movie directed by eli roth whom i feel has no grasp on how to make a movie reeks of uwe boll stench from start to finishthe beginning starts out with nothing more than unneeded nudity a scene directly ripped out of eurotrip trying to be scary and an attempt to scare us psychologically with a haunted museum so for an hour you sit twiddling your thumbs in anticipation for something to bounce up on the screen other than breastthen the horror the horroroh no wait theres no horror in this film rather its a shameless attempt to gross us out with torture that isnt scary but painful to watch this pain will come in two levels if you havent seen many films you will wrench in pain as these tortures start if you have seen a few films youll wrench at how bad the effects are they are elementrythen finish up with an ending that makes no sense but still gives a halfdone conclusion and fake sense of closure with its poorly written scripti had heard nothing but great things about this film i can honestly say working in a video store there are much better films out there and after seeing this film i have to say i can see how this was written by the same guy who gave us cabin fever3 out of 10,cruel
i didnt expect a groundbreaking revolutionary masterpiece of cinema i just wanted to watch something entertaining there is no story so i thought it will be a style over substance movie  and it wasntthe creators tried desperately to convince me that there is a story 3 idiots going to slovakia and getting lost one by one i wouldnt call this a story the filmmakers couldnt come up anything better in terms of plot so they filled the movie with nudity and violence but none of them could redeem this film stupidity is everywhere in this movie the way they depicted slovakia  stupid and onesided the story  stupid the characters  all stupid the atmosphere  stupid the dialogue  stupid the viewer well you get the ideaif i want to see human stupidity i just walk out of my house dont watch this movie its not even entertaining and about slovakia ive been there recently and im still alive blah its just stupid to say something like this right its exactly as stupid as to watch i warned you,cruel
firstly what kind of 90 minute horror film takes 30 mins to start getting to the point the first thirty mins of this film are dedicated to some useless soft porn which makes no sense but seems like satisfying the directors own carnal leaningsi think he will make millions making films for vividone has seen enough use of pliers and drills to inflict torture on kidnap victims to pass it off as horror is sheer horror by itself directors need to scare the audiences not repulse them if you do have to watch a gory film then saw and saw 2 beats this film hands down splashing pots of blood around the frame is not horror even the thrill element in the film was missingi think mrquentin tarantino and co should think about there reputation before endorsing a senseless film like this there is far more talent out there apart from the saw films devils rejects is another film that one can invest valuable time in rather than this stupid apology of a film,cruel
i went to the cinema to watch what i thought would be a gritty gruesome and shocking horror thriller with a depressingly raw feel like saw or somethingwhat i got was a stupid teeny porn film with ten or fifteen minutes of blood at the very endi was so disappointed i didnt want to see a remake of road trip i wanted a gory horror like the trailers had implied the trailers and write ups are very very misleading this is no way anything like a horror film until the last say 15 minuteswatch it if you want but i wouldnt recommend it if you are after viewing a thriller or a horror movie,cruel
i dont know how to describe how awful this film was to me as i live in the east europe i can also notice some inaccuracies in picturing slovakia for example childrens gangs moreover slovakian girls hardly could have names natalia and svetlana  there are russian names as for the perverts who torture people it is not clear why there are so many people who are fond of this if i was slovakian i would not like this portrayal of my country and as far as i understood the only survivor hernandez and the director of the movie are of the same or of the similar nationality though in my opinion that boy whos name josh the shy one should survive in summary there is little really psychological tension in this movie and too much disgust,cruel
i saw a couple of days ago with my boyfriend if he hadnt been there i would have left the moment i heard the drilling soundwhat irritates me in this film most is the view of slovakia i am aware that roths aim wasnt to give the people a geographical course on this country but from my point of view he misused it he took a not well known country and presented it in a way he thought that would be attractive for an average american viewer i dont think it is unnatural if i watch a film where my country is described as a land of no younger than 40 yearold men and 20 yearold moneyhunting prostitutes choose an exciting plot place the story into a country no one knows and modify it according to ur imagination tell everyone u worked on it with tarantino claim that true events inspired u put as many naked women and sex scenes as it gets and find a guy who can do a pretty cool whistlingthis is what i call roths recipe for a horrorand it workedeli roth is currently the most unpopular american in sk ok sorry the second most unpopular  after bush but on the other hand what he achieved was brilliant  he made a fortune by making a movie which people love or hate and thats what it is all about  it is discussed  people go and see it even those whod like to see roth being cut with a chainsawif eli roths goal was to make me keep my eyes closed for the half of the movie and make my stomach twist in my body he succeeded anyway a really good horror movie is not about rivers of blood and hanging eyeballs for me a horror scares u quietly gets into your brain makes your imagination work this film wasnt scary it was just gross,cruel
please dont waist your hard earned money by going to see this very poor film the best thing about this production is the hype that has been created around it and as public enemy said dont believe it to a certain extent it is a massive disappointment as the idea on an organisation who offer bored and frustrated business types the chance to torture and kill various nationalities for a fee could have been both fascinating and terrifying however the execution no pun intended of the film is really bad it starts in amesterdam with the three main characters behaving incredibly obnoxiously in a bad teen comedy style which in itself is cringe worthy to the extent of you really hoping they come to a grizzly end for this reason alone the film has already failed it is hard to feel scared or terrified for characters who you feel no empathy for and youre actually hoping they get bumped off quickly so you can leave as for the claims that its the goriest or sickest film ever i find this must be the work of the hype machine theres nothing here that hasnt been seen before many times before once again spoiling perhaps the only thing this film had going for it another disappointing aspect of the film was the american finale to the film with the lone hero escaping but not before conveniently avenging his friends deaths with no fear of retribution from the law go team america in short dont see this and dont believe anyone who says this is the first scary film theyve seen since aliens because it isnt good idea badly done god knows how tarantino is involved but he should be ashamed if i could give it zero i would two hours of my life ill never get back,cruel
frequent viewers of us american movieproductions are aware of the fact that most american citizens live in constant fear of the fact that there are foreign countries on their globe those of them who are bold enough to travel those dangerous territories have the wildest stories to tell is one of them its the kind of yarn thats presented from little boys with a lifetime experience of tv an videowatching for those who are eager to be told the same boring crap over and over again if only their regularly dish is spiced with some extra gory details the idea of is as simple as its protagonists somewhere outside of the united states of america there is a very strange area its called europe most of the time its like a mixture of las vegas and disney world but if you stretch it too hard there are dangers waiting there for you beyond your lamest imaginationthe two heroes of are backpackers who want to get laid they want to have sex with european women so they travel to slowenia because someone in amsterdam told them that they will find those women there so they travel there you wonder why its taking me so long to tell this hey im talking about 60  of the story on their way to slowenia they discover that some natives eat with their hands creepy isnt it after that and after the audience is watching a real bad porkysrip off for about an eternity they finally reach the destination of their dreams a that is managed like a swinger club they are seduced by beautiful slovenian women dressed like prostitutes these women are not only vile they are evil they lure our innocent heroes to a place where rich people can live out their sadistic fantasies by torturing people for a fee  i bet if such a place would really exist the people whod go there would have a lot more fantasies than elli roth the directorwriter of that movie i think im not spoiling anyones viewing pleasure by telling that our heroes will find themselves captured in this torture themepark ready to be well tortured when you watch this movie in a cinema like i did you sense a change in the audience at this point finally after one hour of lame sex jokes and stupid dialog the movie seems to be going somewhere behind me i could hear some heavy breathing so i was getting a little curious myself because i really like violent disturbing movies well it takes at least a little fantasy and visual imagination to make a torture scene in a cheap movie work roth likes to brag about pleasing even hardcore horrorfans or breaking boundaries with his fairy tale and hes not ashamed to name masters like chanwook park as a reference but believe me does not deliver its not even worth a laugh after some really boring torture scenes there are some badly staged escapescenes and some totally illogical revengescenes thrown in for good measure so a movie that in the hands of a more talented young director fe alexandre aja  could have been at least cheap fun turns out to be justcheap and stupid and just for your information college boys the official language in slowenia the czech republik and the netherlands isnt german if it would be the germans would have won world war ii and that is in opposite of a real terrifying ideawatch the much more terrifying wolf creek or the brilliant the descent instead of wasting precious time with juvenile babble,cruel
i was hyped for this movie after all tarantino was hyping it but unfortunately the movie was horrible this movie started off fairly well the story starts with two american  one male from iceland are backpacking across europe they meet up with a shady guy who tells them to travel to eastern europe for amazing women well soon the entire movie has clips that will remind people of another movie eurotrip the movie falls apart as soon as the third of our main characters gets captured the storyline goes out the window as it just becomes insulting to the viewer events happen for no reason  just adds to the confusion of the movie throughout the movie youll be asking what is that tattoo about who is that guy who are these people well all these questions  more never get answered the final insult comes at the end when after our last main character saves a japanese tourist while she is being tortured she jumps in front of a train after seeing the torture done to her face and about the torture there is actually more nudity than torture in this movie save your money,cruel
starts out with great nudity and the hint of suspense but then devolves into a hamfisted attempt at horrorturns out there is no suspense only wonder at how this piece of poop got made at where the friends went and then brutality i do admit that the blood and guts were goodother than the mammaries blood and violence there is very little reason to pay 10us for this crapthe acting was mediocre i still cant figure out how tarantino got attached to this piece of video garbagegood rental though,cruel
ok quentins movies were always violent but they had a story to go with it is nothing but a cheap excuse for a gore movie nothing like quentins movies very disappointing i had higher expectation coming from an association between eli roth and quentin tarantino especially after cabin fever that showed elis talent at horror movies the prelude is way too long and there is no story at all the characters fall in every clich possible and are just plain dumb it wasnt even entertaining saw and saw ii was entertaining that was just boring and gross we can clearly see the asian influence on this film but it lacks the depth that you can normally see in those kind of movies ive seen a lot of movies and a lot of horror and gore movies but sadly i dont recommend this one spend your time and money to see something else you wont be disappointed,cruel
i went to see this movie today and lets just say that i am glad that i did not pay full price it was predictable slow moving etc actually if you like horror movies the story line alone will insult your intelligence also if you guys out there heard any previews on the radio about it has hot girls and think thats a reason to see it its a waste of time in that direction as well the girls only seem hot because you usually will not see that kind in america just walking around the only bright spot in the movie is the terror you see in the victims faces the movie showed that well but that is the only reason that you will not fall asleep,cruel
this is a genuinely evil movie that glories in torture while pretending to be horrified tarantino loves pushing boundaries but this just adds another layer of justification to all the sick s out there who really want to do this stuff themselves and are just trying to work up the nerve its like opening the door for the devil cant we just decide that this whole genre has gone too far and pull back from the brink this isnt horror its just a snuff film made by special effect torture experts vile stuff that should have an nc17 rating and that in a sane world would have decent people shunning the director and everyone involved,cruel
i was looking forward to a great scary movie the previews had me intrigued and excited about the creepiness and gore that i should expectalas the first hour was nothing but a soft porn moviethe last 30 minutes were good but after waiting an hour for the story to pick up it was a lackluster ending that just never had meit was predictable and the previews already showed you most of the good stuffthere could have been so much more to this film but maybe when the unedited version comes out it will add what it is so desperately missingthe scare factor,cruel
after waiting for some time with much anticipation for the tarantinoroth horror film finally made its way to my local cinema after an assembly of ridiculously bad horror previews the film finally came up and i eased back in my chair the films first half or so was albeit not horror in any way shape or form and more so was a closer relative to a national lampoon sex romp the three main actors were thankfully enough good at who and what they were trying to emulate horny college grads who want sex and drugsbut they were funny and occasionally kind of down to earth eli roth did a fair job of setting up the story though i felt it took a little long for a horror film as great a storyteller miike is and as much as roth adores him i wouldve figured the film to have an overall creepy quality but alas no the music was well done especially when the horror comes crashing in and the direction was pretty good showing us a good amount of gore and then a good amount for us to leave to our sick imaginations my only complaint about the film was the tiresome nudity and sex teens will love it as will college students but it gets old fast i never knew roth relied on such frivolities to make a film move along then again cabin fever did the exact same thing the latter half of the film was very good and occasionally bordered on the awesome i wish there was more gore though there was some and i was hoping to get more glimpses into the other rooms that lined the slaughterhouse the best scenes were easily inside this factory and if the whole movie was set up faster for more time inside the farm this movie wouldve been great and not just good,cruel
for all the hype and promises of gore that surrounded this movie i have to say that it was all blown way out of proportion four of us attended this movie and four of us left disappointed thankfully we chose a matine because this flick was definitely not worth full price admission the tagline the scariest american movie in a decade is way out in left field too i can think of at least a dozen scarier and anyone who goes to see should be able to do the same the gore is okay at best and the story is pitiful as is the acting if you are looking for cheap ta then by all means shell out the cash or pull out the plastic but dont plan on leaving with a good taste in your mouth unless the theater has exceptionally great popcorn,cruel
the first hour and five minutes of this movie are straight up porn generated to hook the male audience the last fortyfive minutes are gore that goes past the extreme of saw causing many patrons of theaters viewing this film to lose their lunch similar to the nausea caused by blair witch project quentin tarantino truly did not make the film and his name is solely listed on the poster and advertisements to make people actually attend this picture there are snuff films that do not take it to this level and probably have better dialogue the main influence from this film came from internet spam and idea of torture flicks so they stuck to main influence without making much of a storyline or point at least the violence of munich is backedup with actual historical facts rather than a fictional waste of garbage overall i wouldnt recommend it for anyone any age,cruel
this movie is a waste of film cabin fever was a steaming pile and so is this first off it is ratedr because the first twenty minutes is just breasts and smoking weed and even that is cheesy that you can not even enjoy some good nudity to take you mind off how horrible the movie is the blood and gore do not come into play until the last half hour of the movie and even that is so lame that it does not make up for the hour of time that you wasted trying to get to that point if you are bored and there is nothing else at the movie theater go home and knit or build a model maybe talk to your relatives but do not see this movie it is not worth the 7 8 9 10 dollars that a ticket costs,cruel
this movie was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the whole first half of the movie was so irrelevant to the last half the story could have been so much better than it was they did not spend enough time talking about the main point of the or show what went on what was the point of him saving the asian chick she saw her eye was messed up and committed suicide it would have been way less clich if he heard her scream and just kept on driving i know that i would never go back into that hell hole there was a lot of comic relief in a movie that was supposed to be scary like the gang of kids who took that seriously who saw them bash in that guys head without laughing who didnt laugh when that guy was so psyched while asking should i do it quick or slow a lot of the gore was really stupid the asian chicks eye looked so fake i really dont think that if you cut your eye by the tube that puss would shoot out,cruel
i have high expectations for any film that has tarantinos name on it as all of his films that i had seen previous to this one were very good however he did not write or direct this film he was simply the producer and it is this fact that i will pardon him from this train wreck of a moviei can see how the hedonistic nature of the protagonists comes back to haunt them but it is a weak irony at best this movie was grotesque for the sake of being grotesque i cannot recall the last time where i was more disappointed in a movie that i paid money to see 6 was not worth the torment that was watching this movie i know that the horrible nature of the film is a point in itself but i believe that the film makers forgot crucial elements of the film such as character development and a good  solid plot when they were thinking of horrendous ways to disgust the audience also in one scene the lens filter inexplicably changes between angles this is a poorly done film by almost all accounts,cruel
i have to say i was pretty disappointed with this movie even though i though cabin fever sucked i figured maybe it was just a mess up by eli roth and that hed redeem himself and ive learned a lesson eli roth sucks at making horror movies this movie was basically a less funny rehash of euro trip for the first half or more complete with nudity sex drug use and weird locals then it got really gory which is the only reason im giving it a 5 out of 10 i love gore and this movie definitely didnt lack in that department but where after seeing the previews i expected a gory suspenseful frightening horror movie i got a crappy comedy with a whole lot of gore this really could have been a good horror movie if it was scary in the least but it wasnt and dont get me started on the ending once again eli dropped the ball it felt like eli just took every character in the movie that had done paxton wrong throughout and just dropped them straight in his path as easy an quickly as possible and how convenient he finds his friends killer cuts off exactly the same fingers he lost off the guy and kills him the same way the guy killed his friend stupid stupid stupid props on the gore and the nudity the rest of the movie sucked,cruel
what a let down this film was i really felt ripped off because i thought this would be at least a somewhat satisfying fast food fun flick and hey i didnt have high expectations in the least eitherin summary the first hour felt like it was written by a horned 18 year old taste testing his own fantasy traveling europe hooking up with some hot foreigner babes with ease for some romper stomper free reign frolic i dont mind some fun but come on have some debt or story or  just something here no worry no suspense no creepiness nothingthen finally when the ball gets rollin and only for a few minutes at that even the supposed gross or stomach churning points were like a warm flat opened can of coke no fizzle nothing the effects of the well lets just say the eye ball sequence were blatantly fake taking any fizzle of creepiness from it not to mention our injured parties were running around like nothing had been done to them hardly a squint of pain to help you remember theyd been well worked onif at all anything good the lead actor has a certain something and i believe he could show up in something more worthy of a chance the camera work and even the basics of the direction were satisfactory however the script was just crap they went out for a lil t  a to entice the youths while jumping the i wanna be like cool like saw bandwagon hey lets put out a scary movie that sucks and hopefully make some money the first weekend with a bunch of hype before everyone actually realizesthis sucksnot to mention quentin tarantinos power meter dropping a couple of notches for putting his name on such a let down piece of shiteso if your a 17 year old guy whos middle name is hormone and you dont care about a film being smart enough to take you away to a good experience then this might be your jar of vaseline other than that skip it ps no wonder the box office was down a record 8 this year keep putting out this kind of adolescent crap and well be seeing drive in movies making a come back,cruel
for the first 45 minutes of this film i thought i was watching a porno flick this has got to be a last ditch effort by eli roth and quintin tarantino to rank a film next to plan 9 from outer space this film is sure running a real close 2nd if there was a place i could go or write to get my money returned i would have gone there last night after the movie folks dont waste your money i say this will be out on dvd within about 6 months the payroll for this film couldnt have gone over 100000 the acting was awful if quintin and other producers want to throw their money away contact me i have a couple of film ideas ps i am a tarantino fan this is in no way a bash on him because i dont like his films but was done in very poor taste,cruel
i have to say that its been quite a while since ive fallen for the hype surrounding a movie like this one unfortunately i got caught up in the promises made by hostle and was let down in the most disappointing waya perfect way to illustrate just how this film manages to fall so short of the mark is to compare it to the lame publicity stunt i had to bear witness to on opening nightduring the first remotely scary scene in the film an audience member simply leaned forward and fell to the floor leaving his girlfriend to scream out for help was he so scared by the graphic violence on the screen that he passed out in horror were we witnessing what we had all heard was true would paramedics actually have to be called to the theater no not at allthe act was so transparent that it simply annoyed anyone who cared to notice and the same thing can be said of the film itself its just another safe horror movie done by the numbers dull and unoriginal that simply pretends to be more than it ishostle is no more shocking scary or disturbing than anything youve seen before and much like its failed publicity stunt this film deserves to be ignored,cruel
i saw all these trailers that were promising gore and blood and horrible unspeakable acts that were going to happen in this movie i was excited thinking if they put a decent story behind what they are promising than who knows this could turn into a great movie i eagerly awaited s release and i went to see it opening day after all was said and done i wondered is that it its over was there blood yes and there were several scenes of torture also as promised however fell short in my mind for several reasons first off my biggest problem was the entire hook that this movie was wrapped around its gore yes it was present but the commercials made this movie out to be so graphic that if youre a tad bit squeamish dont go see it i know that the type of people that the premise of this movie appeals toi am the type of people and the commercials did a good job to really build up that type of persons interest but when push came to shove frankly i wasnt impressed it was just too little from a filmed that promised too much there are things in movies that make me cringe its not like it is a hard task or anything but didnt make me want to cringe or feel queasy or any of that my second problem was eli roths laughable directing style roth really needs to decide whether he wants to direct horrors or comedies as he falls into the same problem that he got into with cabin fever in that he tries to mix the genres the problem is that at some parts of the movie youre not sure if you should scream or laugh since you cant decide you dont do either and you arent terrified or amused and the scene is wasted roth has great directing ability but he needs to focus on a genre the movie does have its good points the women are very very beautiful in this movie also the storyline while thin could be worse i suppose it was frighting because in theory it could happen and thats about the only terror had as it was hardly suspenseful eli roth does throw in some good laughs as well as a couple brutally graphic scenes albeit far from what the film was told to deliver in the end just doesnt satisfy i left the theater wishing i would have either had a richer plot or more gore either would have sufficed to describe it best is much like an amateur sniper the beginning take a long time aiming up for a perfect shot such a long time that one gets impatient and when that shot finally comes it seems rushed and as a result misses its mark entirely if you want to see gore then save your money and rent or buy saw 2 when its released on dvd saw 2 is far superior in every way ie gore plot ending acting directing where as falls just short on every single promise it made and every thing a horror movie should include if youre expecting to see buckets of blood youll see it but you wont see how it got there and to me thats the main point dont see if you want to see a gory movie or a good horror movie or high hopes if you dont go into it with any of these desires you may leave happy otherwise youll just leave unfulfilled,cruel
there was nothing impressive about this movie i think that people had heart attacks because they were shocked at how stupid this movie really was sure the gore was good and it had an interesting concept but the first hour totally ruins thati do not go to see a horror movie to see sex that kind of ruins it i do realize that the only reason they were in this town was for sex but it wasnt necessary to show itlike i said the gore was good thats what bumped my vote up to a 2 i was a little upset that they cut away half the time they will probably show this on an unrated dvd but theres no telling how much sex will be in that version that fact also hurt my votei was just soo let down i mean tarantino was attached what went wrong i didnt expect it to be perfect because ive seen cabin fever and didnt expect much from eli roth but tarantino was there too my guess is that the first half of the film was roth and the second half was tarantinomy recommendation is to wait until the unrated version is out on dvd,cruel
this movie starts out as dracula but ends up as magnum forcethe protagonists were so poorlydefined that 1 i didnt even know their names until looking on imdbcom 2 i didnt know enough about them to form an opinion on whether or not i liked themthe blondehaired kid wants to be a writer and has asthma the darkhaired kid is doing some law school thing i think and apparently speaks german the other guy is taller and older and from iceland and has a kidall this is is a suspense thriller which turns into a revenge movie and is packaged as a horror moviethe plot is largely stolen from that mutilated bride urban legend httpwwwsnopescomweddingshorrorsshanghaiasp there were a couple stupid movie clichs used like 1 shock doesnt exist if you have two fingers amputated the blood loss will just make you act like you have a beer hangover2 a guy whos just had his fingers amputated can defeat several larger men who probably have had prior military training because he gets the drop on thembut all faults aside this movie could have been a lot worse with the slow start and the scene where the girls toe is cut off offcamera i was expecting most of the film to have that lame movie copout violence and it didntso yeah i think it was worth the ticket price,cruel
i thought this movie was really awesome i know people are going to think is she fking crazy but i liked it a lot good torture scenes that actually looked real jay hernanadez and derek richardsonwell i love them both to pieces and think theyre both adorable and really great acting i love the twists and turns eli roth and quentin tarantino are geniuses i heard critics say this movie is the scariest thing since the ring i thought the ring was kind of lamei really hadnt seen a good horror flick until this one and im glad it had good actorsgorgeous actors but yeah if youre squeamish about bloody tortuous moviesi warn you nowsarah irishdreams88hotmailcom,cruel
i went to see this movie with a few friends last nightand well it was not as good as i hopedactually it was really bad i went in wishing for a movie like sawwith a sweet storyline and stuffand the movie ended up having really nothing in it except tortureand they didnt even torture that muchthe movie carried on for awhile until the crazy stuff actually started happening while all the gory stuff was happening i was wondering to myselfwhy is this happening the stuff just comes out of nowhere and hits you and well theres no point reallyif you looking for a movie like saw then dont see this alsoif your looking for a movie with a pointdont see this either,cruel
and this one was hard for me to put into words exactly what disturbed me the most about this in terms of positives this is a survival movie if you want to call it that and the payback scenes had me and the rest of the audience cheering for the evil bastards comeuppance having said that though the shock value of this movie is especially for an r movie off the charts this really should have been nc17 but i think tarantinos involvement with this got it changed to an r and this is a hard r probably the hardest r ive ever seen and i see all the violent movies im pretty jaded when it comes to this stuff but this was gruesome in a way that has not been shown in american movie theaters yet if this had come out in 1993 before anyone other than cult followers of taratino knowledge of reservoir dogs this movie would probably have been nc17 or straight to video if this movie had come out 20 years ago it probably would not have been made in this country or it would be considered borderline snuffim sure most other reviews will either be shocked and revolted by it or will be the hardcore blood marks who loved it im leaning more toward the shocked and possibly revolted i thought something like pulp fiction or rd though having its moments of ultraviolence had an artistic redemptive quality about it i admit that this movie once you can recover your stomach from the butchery not an easy taskdoes a good job of getting you to root for the primary protagonistthe use of female lures for these deathtraps was especially notable as natalyas mocking laugh as paxon gets captured is replayed at the very end of the credits  it presses a lot of buttons there it certainly makes you think twice about visiting any former warsaw pact countries for fear you might wake up if youre lucky in a bathtub filled with ice leaving you reading a sign that said your kidneys have been removed because the hottie you were flirting with is paid by the russian mob to slip you a mickey this movie is an urban legend on crack steroids and every other drug used in a tarantino filmi am still struggling to adequately describe this movie i shall probably edit this at some point but for now i will close by saying the following this movie does not push the envelope it obliterates it,cruel
starts in amsterdam where three friends two americans named paxton jay hernandez  josh derek richardson plus an icelandic guy named oli eythor gudjonsson are backpacking looking to travel across europe getting laid by pretty girls to party  to smoke some drugs at the where they are staying they meet alex lubomir bukovy who tells them of a youth in bratislava in slovakia where there are plenty of young beautiful girls who love americans the next day  the three friends travel there by train they meet two girls natayla barbara nedelijakova  svetlana jana kaderabkova who show them all a good time at a disco the next morning  oli has disappeared without leaving a message then soon after josh disappears leaving just paxton to figure things out he eventually discovers the gruesome truthwritten coproduced  directed by eli roth i wasnt sure what to expect going into i mean i hated his previous film the horror comedy cabin fever 2002  it seems to get a lot of criticism from people saying its a pointless film filled with nudity  gore but never let it be said i dont give a film a chance  i went into with an open mind in the end im glad i spent the time watching because i have to say i really rather liked it the script by roth takes its time to get going in fact the first hour is almost total exposition with roth setting the situation up  fleshing out the characters which makes the final 30 blood soaked minutes of carnage even more satisfying  actually have some meaning the final third of is really intense  gory filmmaking with bags of tension that the films critics seem to overlook in fact i think the pc brigade dislike  attack so much because it is so effective  is a downright decent if admittedly brutal  gory horror film some of the twists  turns are a little hard to swallow but that only serves to reinforce the fact that is pure fantasy which is also something the idiotic pc brigade conveniently seem to forget i liked it  im not ashamed to admit it i liked all the nudity  sex i liked the drug taking i liked the brutality i loved the gore  all those frigid members of the pc brigade can stick that in their pipe  smoke it interestingly noone is actually shown being killed on screen in the slaughterhouse torture scenes yet whenever paxton is shown to kill someone it is seendirector roth was apparently heavily influenced by executive producer quentin tarantino  thats no bad thing there are some truly horrific scenes in i loved the atmosphere as well the scene when josh wakes up in the room almost naked tied to a chair  he can only make out a light  two tables full of scissors scalpels medical equipment  knifes is very chilling  unsettling imagine being in joshs position there is some heavy duty gore but surprisingly not that much actual on screen violence someone tries to walk with the backs of their ankles cut open someone gets a drill poked into their body fingers are graphically severed legs are sliced off with chainsaws someone commits suicide by jumping in front of a train a really juicy sound effect as well there are shots of someone with their chest cut open theres loads of blood with over 150 gallons of the stuff being used to make the film severed heads  limbs strewn about the place someone is shot through the head theres a couple of slashed throats  my favourite scene when a girl is seen with her eyeball hanging out of its socket by some veins  paxton cuts it off with a pair of scissors the special makeup effects by knb are top notch very gory  very impressivewith a supposed budget of about 4500000  making over 20 million on its opening weekend is well made with great special effects  great production values although not set there was filmed mostly in the czech republic apparently was written made  released theatrically all within 12 months which is very quick the acting is alright from an unknown cast extreme japanese director takashi miike has a small cameo as a japanese businessman who paxton asks what its like insideis a great film in my opinion i liked it a lot i liked it excessiveness  gore  gratuitous nudity despite a slow first half when it gets going this is a great horror flick that is pretty intense at times its also nice to see a horror film cause some debate controversy  extreme opinion again followed by part ii 2007,cruel
ok maybe i shouldnt have given it a 1 rating but considering the fact that we walked out of the theater after an hour into the film should say something perhaps the next 30 minutes were some of the most amazing horror sequences ever recorded but i doubt it this movie got so much hype about being scary gruesome the paramedics were called for test audiences blah blah blah hype all made up hype a bunch of bs to promote a movie within the hour that we watched there was only one small torture sequence which involved them showing a drill being picked up then hearing a man screaming then showing a bloody drill ohhhh scary the audience actually laughed it was pathetic my friends who actually stayed for the movie called me after to tell me that i was smart for leaving dont waste your time or money oh and any of you tarantino fans who want to see this because of him well he actually had nothing to do with the making of this film wait until video youll thank me later,cruel
if youre one of the morons who said this movie is good you should be embarrassed and ashamed of yourself for being a pathetic loser there was nothing good about this film theres nothing interesting in this movie no story no unique filmmakingabsolutely nothing redeeming it wasnt even scaryjust disgusting for the sake of being disgustingi will never see another tarantino project regardless of how much or little he has to do with it this film gets my vote as the worst piece of trash ever shown at a cinemawhat bothers me most of all is all the metoo lemmings whove convinced themselves that this somehow represents the horror genre this film cant hold a candle to true horror filmsthis garbage is nothing but an excuse for sick idiots to get together and pretend theyre not worthless wastes of humanity,cruel
saw this film at the toronto international film festival and got what i expected eli roth has the ability to agitate a viewer and evoke a turnaway response with some of the anticipated visuals the premise behind the movie was also very disturbing and it is too bad mr roth could not elaborate on this more in the film all in all i thought this film was well done for what it is a bmovie my only criticism was the ending of the film which mr roth did so well with cabin fever this film is not for everyone nor should it be it is for people who like to have their senses twinged a bit from the other disturbing films such as herbie the love bug as remarked by the beautiful costar of the film during the qa rothon,cruel
i didnt like cabin fever much too jokey too many half wit characters and a really uneven tone is a real improvement roth has learned how to pace things better seems a little too slowly for some of the posters here and he pitches a tone of dread that slowly works into menace that then gets into hysterical terror also a better story not super original but not too derivative and a solid cast the first act sets up the characters nicely without over explaining or weighing them down with irrelevant back story when it comes the gore is intense but you could say not gratuitous if someone paid 25k to kill me id imagine theyd want to savour it and make it as painful as possible roth actually deserves props for holding back  he teased us with the toe severing of the 1st asian woman but restrained himself then when its appropriate the splatter brakes are removed and anything goes tarantinoesquire paxton going back to rescue the japanese woman is straight out of zeds pawnshop but that crazy gungho american torturer was in a league of his own one false note you can justify the 2 evil women being perfectly placed for vengeance but throwing in alexei was a bit much,cruel
there is no good movie without a good story and a story cannot be good without characters this film lacked just that the first entire part of the movie was nothing it left me with more questions than an interest in the plot i did not know who to feel for who if i should be cheering for their death or nothowever once the movie rolled along it rolled well the parts that were gory were done well i commend the director for not turning the camera on queasy moments and instead allowing his audience to see the damagei will not give away the end but it was satisfying overall it was alright would have had some wonderful potential had the beginning been more developed,cruel
only just got released and its already a bit overrated welloverhyped might be a better term to use as eli roths followup to the crappy cabin fever is an overall intense horror flick and it definitely reaches its basic goal which is to disgust and even shock younger audiences eli roth and producer quinten tarantino arent exactly known for their subtlety and thus is quite a sick and unhinged movie that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination not even during the bloodless first half hour when numerous beautiful girls go topless and the film looks an awful lot like vulgar teencomedies such as american pie or road trip two americans and an icelander all driven by their hormones travel through europe with only sex and soft drugs on their minds after a disappointing party in amsterdam a fellow stoner advises them to travel further east where the girls are stunningly beautifully and  oh yes  very willing the in slovakia starts out as a dream location but soon after the horny boys one by one get kidnapped and gruesomely tortured in a ramshackle old factory the idea and structure behind the torturenetwork isnt particularly original or innovating but since its the only form of depth and plotting in the films entire script i wont be the one ruining it for you already although other reviewers obviously have no problem with that admittedly you have to be a little sick in the head but i really enjoyed the extended and genuinely sadistic torture sequences and the devices looked creepy eli roth will probably never be a great filmmaker but his directing skills have seemly improved since cabin fever as there are some stylish camera angles and a nifty use of locations the almighty tarantinos influence is clearly detectable in smaller aspects like twisted gags and clever references towards other movies like his own masterpiece pulp fiction the ending is really good and the film once more proves that ordinary children are the most petrifying creatures on the planet worth seeing,cruel
me and my friends agreed that when someone ask us what was the last movie that we saw we would say it was harry potter and the goblet of fire simply because cant be considered a movie it lacks the originality it lacks the script and it lacks the desire to be a good horror movie the sound is just fatal you cant compare it to hitchcocks development of the plot in any manner i am a male and of course i enjoyed the female mammary parts exposure which averaged 5 pairs a minute of course the movie is grotesque but that is not nearly close to be a horror movie the grotesque element is one the director may use in the movie but not rely to actually be the movie as one of the early post says if you want grotesque go to an emergency room saw i  ii are pieces of art compared to so if you are looking forward to to go over your expectations it is not going to please save your money if you havent already waste it and if you already did it like me say the last movie you actually saw wasnt please say you saw another movie not this one youll make a fool out of yourself be aware you are already advised,cruel
with eli roth quentin tarantino and takashi miike all taking part in this film i was pretty sure going in to it that it would be worth the price of admission not only was it worth the price of admission but it will be worth the price of the unrated dvd with commentary when that comes out in several monthsthe movie is technically appealing to watch for any students of film qt thankfully is a student of film and he no doubt had a big hand in helping roth shoot and edit his film and the editing choices sound effects and homages from suicide club to a clockwork orange films made the film that much more enjoyablethe movie is simplistically suspenseful using the old adage of nothing you can show on screen with compete with what is in the audiences imagination that has been used in horror films for several decades while there is gore some of the most graphic ive seen in a us film to date jhorror still tops it the most graphic scenes are the ones left up to your imagination the film cuts away at the perfect moment several times in the film especially early on letting the audiences suspense growthen whats even more suspenseful is how long it takes for some of the torture scenes to be completed you keep waiting for it to be over and it doesnt stop culminating in what will forever be known as the eyeball scene which puts tremendous strain on your nerves and when over is libel to make anyone with buttered popcorn bolt for the bathrooms to vomitbut all the editing choices cinematography and horror homages aside is most importantly a movie with a message yes the movie does have a message and this is why the film is and should be loved by critics the film explains in the best way possible through example and a walk a mile in their shoes mentality to show the ironic reciprocity of how americans can objectify stereotypical europeans especially women and how those same stereotypes can fall on americans and come back to bite them in the assas odd as it sounds this film will have an effect on audiences that is very similar to the one that crash did this film will make you question not only your sense of sanity or your preconceptions of what is too much but it shines a light on the dark underbelly not only of eastern europe but shows that the ugly american label is appropriate now more than everif you are planning on seeing this movie and read this review do me a favor and when you leave this film stop and with what you just watched fresh in your memory think about this if you think the bad guys and girls in the film are bad what does that say about someone who paid to watch a movie about torture for 95 minutes hm great movie great film great messagekudos to you eli roth kudos,cruel
the wait is over was it worth the wait yes and i enjoyed myself a lot at this movie first off the movie is not nearly as brutal as the previews and other people make it out to be for a brutal twisted american torture flick watch strangeland as a horror film this movie does stand alone everything else you heard about the movie you already heard its not scary but disturbing and yes scary to think that yes there are people like this the long torture sequences are pretty tame while the brutal ones are extremely quick but trust me you probably saw enoughhighly recommended,cruel
i went to this film expecting to see a horror flick about a sadistic person as someone who enjoys horror films this one anything but enjoyable the fact that some of things happening in the film are plausible is the only that is scary about it there is gore but nothing that would make viewers of the passion of the christ or either saw or saw ii cringe the attraction that this film has is horror but that is not the focus of the movie until a good hour into it three males go to europe to have fun and that is exactly what they do mr roth the director has been generous with shots of halfnaked women and rectums not to mentioned people smoking weed a content of sex the sexual references and horrible language this film is definitely not for young children the focus of the first half of the film is sex i for one did not go to the theater to see a porno parents beware,cruel
i had been dying to see this movie and was excited to be able to see a screening of it in dc last night thanks eli for going all out and producing a really great dark movie the plot works well and all of the characters are very true to life i especially appreciate all the local casting in the filmof course i used to stay in s and meet people in clubs and had planned on spending a month in europe next summer  there is no chance of that happening now people let me assure you that this was an actual scary horror moviei highly recommend this to all the sick depraved people of the world,cruel
saw this film at the tiff last weekend what an amazing film even if the final polishing is yet to happen i found myself drawn into the story and caring about the characters the fates of some of these characters is pretty brutal and made worse by the fact that you care unlike other films in this genre despite my commitment to watch the whole film there is still a five second scene where my eyes shut all on their own but i could imagine thanks to the audience what had been on the screen i am glad i attended this during the day as i was drained disturbed and shaken by this film as another reviewer said the scary thing about this movie is that it is not about ravenous aliens from space but a scenario that could believably happen if not now in the near future my hat is off to the director once this movie hits theaterspossibly in november according to eli run dont walk to see this film and remember take two friends,cruel
this movie was a wave of emotions which i cant fully describe i can only say that although im not a gay if i hopefully meet eli roth someday im going to give him a french kiss for making this movie because its probably the toughest and the most original horror movie that will never be forgotten because it graphically exposes something thats not at all far from beingbecoming true i mean we have already heard the stories about some rich people arranging manhunts just for fun right so its quite possible this movie prevented some much worse things from happening since the plot is very plausible and therefore captivating it makes the gruesome scenes even more realistic a very intellectual horror movie that has a great depth of meaning truly a masterpiece that praises the genre,cruel
this movie should win hands down for most exploitative degrading offensive over the top unnecessary female nudity can i have my knockers with a side of movie please this should have been nc17 or considered soft porn i mean really can you seriously sit in the same room with friends or god forbidfamily watching this and not feel dirty it would be about the same as sitting back watching a porn and flipping through playboys what substance the movie after the abundant amount of tits and sex was actually done ok but i lost any liking for it cause the beginning and some parts throughout were so polluted with garbage and way too much sex nudity drugs etc how much can a movie seriously push the envelope before its considered a porn unless a women was a lesbian or an exhibitionist who enjoyed women being humiliated for no other than the reason to see them naked i dont see why a woman would actually sit through this movie unless of course she wanted to torture herself with sexism the producer must be a real pervert and have absolutely zero respect for women a movie can be good without all that crap its called imagination and suspense there was a lot that was not left to the imagination if you want to see a hustler magazine gone movie this is it to have to use the female body at such a sexual extreme shows to me that the director is pretty insecure with his ability to make a good movie so needs a lot of eye candydistraction complete asinine crazy ass sex and nudity borderline soft porn flick for the boys this one if your teenage boy has a big grin on his face a boner and just watched a moviei would guess it was this one,cruel
well first off eli roth is an inspirational director and will closely follow in the footsteps of his codirector in this movie quintion tarintino this movie was rely rely good not to mention the best part jay henderez is so freiken hot any who it is kind of racy and awkward at parts aka the sex scenes not bc there bad just if ur with other people your like ugh  laugh out loud any who its rely good and if u wanna be amused for 2 hours and freaked out all at once watch this movie this movie is both scary and fascinating its based on true events except the events really happened in japan eli roth was going to do a documentary on the subject but knew he wouldnt be able to find out much since the whole killing business is hush hushunder wrapson the down low  the extras and special features are really funny watching them film the movie so funny check that out for sure eli roth also makes an appearance in the movie see if you can spot his part its really small only 1 line but hes there  clue red sox the bottom line watch this freiken movie itll rock your socks,cruel
this film is the most entertain that i have ever see and its my favorite genre horror the whole thing leading up to there torture is excellentgood story all they want is drugs and to have sex there is a lots ofblood and gore in this film the torture scenes rule in this film this film is a dark twisted gore fest horror film this is my favorite film of all time and eli roth does a great job directing this film i love his work and i will always love his work i am a eli roth fan he is the next generation of horror directors and he is doing a good job at it the actors do alright job but that jay does an awesome job of screaming in pain this movie can scare the hell out of you if your not a horror fan but didnt scare me,cruel
as far as new age horror movies go this really is a good one horror movies are a totally different beast then regular movies you must expect poor lines gratuitous nudity and crazy death scenes this movie has that the fact also that the killers are nothing but everyday people makes it ever scarier the movie effects are pretty good and the make is awesome compare the makeup in this to most modern horror films and this one is almost as realistic looking as some italian horror films if you are looking for some movie with a deep meaning you are looking in the wrong area if you want a good horror movie in a day and age where there are none this is pretty good anyone who thought this was a bad movie must not like horror in general and there fore should not be taken seriously,cruel
this has to be one of the sickest most depraved movies i have ever seenthe violence and goreand there is a lot of itwere absolutely gratuitous and did not serve to further the storythere was no logical reason for this much goredespite what people might thinkusually in a horror movieat least a good one there are other elements contained within such as suspense and atmospherethis movie has none of thatit seems to revel in its depravitythe characters were much too stupid and i could not muster any concern for any of themi have seen many horror movies and have a strong stomachbut this was beyond my limits as far as taste goesim not against violence and gore if there is a purpose behind itof course there will be sequel which will likely offer more of the sameif all youre into is blood and guts and arent concerned with little things such as plot suspenseand sympathetic characters who are more than one dimensional cardboard cutouts then this movie is for youotherwise avoid it like the plagueand maybe if enough people stay away from the sequelthere will be less crap like this produced the preceding comment refers to the unrated dvd version not the theatrical version,cruel
i just wonder how the japanese girls were lured into that trap goodlooking slovakian men i dont think any tourist is stupid enough to travel to a dump like that just for some girls the story was very farfetched and not very believable there is no real depth to the story and the guy who manages to escape how come he can think so rationally considering the circumstances he is under becoming an expert at gun shots and murdering overnight i think the film is very gory and portrays european women as being cheap and tarty which is a stereotype as any other if you want to see a real horror film targeting tourists go and see wolf creek,cruel
embarrassingly lame  you could make a better horror movie with a bottle of ketchup and a packet of sausagesprobably the most overhyped film ive ever seen and thats saying something hopefully this will hammer the last nail in the coffin of tarantinos ability to recommend a film by association the man clearly has no shame i can only imagine that the critics who found this film vile and gratuitously violent had never seen a horror movie beforeor an episode of ersave yourself the money and stare at the wall for an hour and a half,cruel
im not certain at the beginning of this review if i am going to pop out a spoiler or two so the spoiler warning is just in casefirst off let me begin by saying the only reason i gave this movie one star is because i was unable to give it no starsthe idea behind the movie as mentioned in several of the reviews here is quite terrifying and would made for a thrilling novel the idea that someone would pay for the sick pleasure of torturing a random or sometimes randomly picked from a series of preferences listed by the tortureer to be person is truly horrific and a serious offense to the humane not to mention dealing a massive blow to the psyche you are chosen drugged chained to a chair and are forced to endure hideous and abominable tortures agonizing pain and a prolonged longedfor death id be longing for death too after an ordeal like that its a psychiatrists worst nightmarebecause of the premise and the idea i had actually wanted to see this movie and i fought for days to rent itunfortunately when i saw this movie i was completely disappointed and more than a little disgusted the entire first half of the movie is basically a poorlydone porn flick pretending to be horror while the second half is nothing but an unintelligent splatterfest of gore it makes a body sick rather than terrifying the mind in fact at one point i was truly forced to leave the living room and vomit thank god i didnt see this on the big screen id have spewed my dinner on all unsuspecting moviegoers on my marathon run to the restroom and im a horror buff i love horror this movie this isnt horror its just sick on all counts of human decencythe characters themselves are shallow twodimensional unbelievable and nothing but a bunch of horny sexmongers who apparently dont care if they get an std from any of the many prostitutes they bang in the process of their eurotrip i found myself hoping theyd die from a disease or a virus before the gross bit of the movie was even hinted at had it not been for the title at the beginning of the film if it can be called such i found myself wondering if i had gone into the wrong theaterthe only likable character is the poor japanese girl who gets her eye pulled out and dies by jumping in front of a train i actually felt sorry for her but not for anyone else in this disgusting excuse for a movie,cruel
i literally just saw this film and im puzzled as to how i feel about itusually the whole point of watching people being tortured is that the horror stems from not only the visceral horror but the sympathy for the victim without this necessary factor the thrill of the scene is all but losthowever in the beginning of the film when paxton a rude american with his rude american friend and a stereotypically horny european male shouts man i hope bestiality is legal in this country cause that girl is a fkin pig at a prostitute who is nowhere near fat i found myself muttering god just kill him now we have already lost sympathy for the characters all we have left is the violencethe rest of the film is overextended sex scenes that cut into valuable film time that could be used to explain why we should care about these men perhaps thats roth and tarantinos intentionto view the victims as the murderers would as arrogant rude oversexed and boorish americans that are only good for tourism and death if anythingblah blah blah death death death shame shame shame i expected better from tarantino master of kill bill and helping hand in the amazing sin cityeven the prize cow needs to deliver sour milk once in a while,cruel
tarrintino has yet again brought another mindless bile flowing and puke fest of a movie i did not know what i was thinking to go and see this movie perhaps it was a well rounded horror flick that will have the gore and compelling mystery in a theater of all things seven dollars down the drain i must say i am glad i went all alone or the effect would be much worse if i had opted to take one of my friends from the opposite sex 14 dollars down the drain are you kidding me the movie did start out randomly with a trio making a pleasure cruise in slovakia and it seemed like a porno flick more than anything else and then after the first 20 mins the gore and killing starts everything is explicit and you can throw the story out of the window by now it seemed to me that the director pachl in conjunction with tarrentino wanted to make this movie a real scare but somehow lost their nerves after drinking a couple of vodka shots and decided to make it a splat in your face kind of movie that was refreshing change but thats as far as it goes of you still want to keep your guts in your stomach do not watch this on a full stomach,cruel
i have used imdb for a number of years and this is the first time i have been moved by a film so much that i actually registeredthis film is an insult to intelligence we only hired it because of the tarantino tag and quite frankly i cannot understand why the man would degrade himself to allow his name to be used to promote such a poorly acted poorly scripted and poorly directed film it is at best boring and predictable the premise behind the is apparent to anyone over the age of 2there is only one part of the film that makes you wince and that is totally expected but of such a manner that you cant help but wince the plot is laughable the media hype surrounding this film is totally unwarranted it is not scary it is not horrific it is not even well made or even worth wasting 90 minutes of your life watching i feel like demanding my rental money back but obviously it is not their fault do yourself a favour and only watch this film if it is for free or you have nothing else to do liketrimming nose hair or watching planes go by in the sky it is rubbish,cruel
this movie was absolute garbage a crash course in trashy filmmaking for vacuous idiots hey dude that was like one awesome movie    yeah right get a life dickbrain tarantino is a shite filmmaker his whole career is 75 rippedoff asian movies and littleseen us heistnoir movies plus 25 vanity projects that have been hyped on the strength of his name that he gives this celluloid tripe his mark of quality says it all if you want roth tarantino and any other upandcoming tarantinoesque filmmakers ha ha  what an oxymoron that is to stop churning out moronic dross like this theres only one course of action avoid it like the plague,cruel
i saw this movie because my friend told me that it was so scary she couldnt sleep for a monthwhen she talked to me about it she could barely make up a sentence without gasping for air im serious the movie started out really slowfor about 40 minutes nothing particularly interesting happenedi almost fell asleepthen at almost the end of the movie all the scary stuff happens which i thought that it must be very scary to freak my friend out like thati seriously started laughing for how ridiculous the special effects were and just for the story ploti got very disappointedbut at least some humor woke me up i really thought this was one of the worst horror movies ever,cruel
im glad paxton was the only survivor because he was the best out off all of them i cant wait until the second one is made it was kinda rude in parts and for the second one maybe it could be better if there was less rude bits the plot for the second one is about 3 girls and not lads who find out in the worse way about the i hope paxton does to come out off the second one alive and is the hero in it because he totally rocked in the first one maybe to make it even better they could have cast higher known actors and actresses not just ones that have just started their careers in the second one they could cast such stars as sarah michelle gellar and brad pitt lol 1010 it rocks,cruel
the author of this movie is a very sick person and needs jesus immediately the lord needs to come down and put a blessing in your life this does not make any sense at least in final destination the actors died a quick death but the whole eye dripping and fingers chopping and ankle chopping makes no sense if you are gonna kill someone just do it and get it over with the whole torturing thing was very disturbing i had to walk out many times just to get myself togethereveryone in this movie needs jesus the author the director who accepted it the actors and the producers everyone involved needs jesussincerely regina c,cruel
from the first time this movie was announced i was so excited about it and finally the day came i was finally about to watch it when the movie was over the only thought in my head was is this for real bad acting very bad makeup bad lightning very bad gore effects no good story not scary at all and did i mention bad acting so after hearing several film and horror enthusiasts saying this was the best horror movie in years all i could think was is this for real i was so disappointed of this movie the only reason i did watch the whole movie was that i really hoped it would get better at the end but it never got any better at all but this is just my opinion and many others too,cruel
if eli roth is scared of slovakia all the betterwhy dont people just abandon hollywood movies 99 of them are at least as bad as eli roth who by setting this film in bratislava and filming it in prague demonstrates in 4 ways why so many people hate americans 1he went to a faroff country czech republic to tell an american story  a particularly retrograde horror film with the fear of travel motif the moral of the story is not lost on americans who widely and falsely believe europe is far more dangerous than the us 2by going to another country and writing a script for foreigners to perform  for money  he is basically saying clearly they  whoever they might be  are better off letting us present them the way we want them to be seen why is it you wont see slvoaks representing themselves at your local googleplex 3he affirms to the slovak people that they are only as useful as their labor is cheap and 4 he comes back to an absurd level of press accolades absurd meaning more than zerowhere else but in hollywood could someone be so publicly rewarded for being so antisocial mediocre and selfglorifying washingtonheres the articlemovie news director scared of slovakia director eli roth claims he is scared to visit slovakia after the government responded angrily to his controversial new horror movie the film portrays the story of several backpackers who meet a nasty end in bratislava when they are lured into bed by beautiful women before being tied up and tortured to death by bored businessmenand roth reckons the slovakian authorities are not too happy with his portrayal of their capital cityhe said the head of the tourist board got pretty angry and invited me to slovakia to show they dont just murder and torture people for funi have a feeling that now ive made the film i will get beaten and tortured in slovakia roth also explained he decided to shoot the movie on a small budget in eastern europe after a conversation with cult director quentin tarantinohe added when i told him about he went oh man that is the sickest idea for a horror film ive ever heard youve got to make it and then he was saying dont do it for 20m do it for three million bucks go to eastern europe use local crews sometimes you need that validation from someone you can trust,cruel
if it was possible i would have given this movie a 0 out of 10 since it was so so bad it actually made me and my friends i watched it with laugh hysterically none of us were ever scared in the movie and none of us ever understood the plot since it was so full of gaps and illogical behavior for example when the surviving guy wants to help the burnt asian girl he cuts her eye of with a scissor  and some greenyellow goo comes out of the eyeman it suddenly felt like the worst scifi movie ever createdsure enough the gore was in parts well done but i cant for the love of god understand why that should in any ways save this awful terrible piece of moviecrapdo yourself a favor and dont ever see this movie youll wind up wanting those hours lost of your life back,cruel
this is an incredible horror film expertly directed by eli roth and quentin tarantino it is true to life with no scifi bullshit furthermore it is based on a true story a couple young adults are doing a eurotrip when they get lured to slovakia the world they arrive in seems a bit strange at first but all is brushed aside until it is very graphic and at times disgusting but the scariest part is that they get put in such a helpless situation without any hope of escapeawaiting a most horrifying death good elements of suspense and horror combined with a decent realistic storyline this film is the best horror film i have seen even better than wolf creek a definite mustsee for thrillerhorror lovers 10 out of 10,cruel
when i saw for the first time in theaters i had deemed it one of the best horror movies ive seen in a while if you liked audition cabin fever the wicker man or maybe even the crazies youll love this movie if not well then theres probably no point in watching this movielet me also say f wolf creek by that i mean that unlike wolf creek in you actually have a sense of care for the characters in the movie theyre believable and theyre not stupid by any means the acting is great jay hernandez is awesome they did a great job making these characters believable and realistic they never make stupid decisions aside from one point in the movie with hernandez but when you watch the movie you understand and you can actually see yourself doing pretty much exactly what the characters do ive heard arguments that the characters are aholes and not believable but i pretty much saw myself fitting exactly in jay hernandezs shoes so i guess that makes me an unbelievable aholewhat was so great about this movie was that i had so many emotions watching this movie it was suspenseful frightening hilarious and just overall entertaining i spent a great deal of the movie either with a huge grin on my face or clinching to my seat hoping that the characters would get out alright its something you just rarely see in horror flicks and gets it rightadd on to the fact that there is so much nudity and gore and hell you got a horror masterpiece the women are extremely hot too i generally dont give a s about nudity in movies but these women were so good looking its pretty bloody as well but it felt like it was missing they said they didnt cut out much like 15 seconds or something but it seemed like a lot wasnt shown that should have been no biggy though even if this movie contained no blood or nudity it would still be greati highly recommend this movie especially to fans of horror if you are not a fan of horror or have an appreciation for all of its subgenres you may not enjoy this as much as i did be warned the 10 out of 10 i give it is based on a scale of horror movies its a movie that 20 years from now i feel will be one of the top names representing this period of time in horror movies much like night of the living dead for its time and evil dead 2 during the 80s it has its fair share of hate but almost every horror classic goes through it,cruel
i love this movie more than the others that ive seen i collect a lot of dvds and im into gory movies as well comparing this movie to say saw i and ii or wolf creek or venom id say this is the bloodies and most original gore movie ive seen to date highly recommended for people who loves seeing a lot of blood in a realistic way some gore movies are just not realistic unlike this one i especially like the scene where the dutch surgeon severed joshs achilles heel wow for those who felt offended by this movie eg people of slovakia and bratislava dont be i mean if you know better about your country you shouldnt be offended at all if this movie was set in the philippines i would be exhilarated i mean hey at least people get to know that my country existed going back to the movie i highly recommend you see it the first time i saw it i felt i had to see it again and again i simply love this movie go out and see it now,cruel
i watched not knowing really what to expecti think the filmmakers now are simply pushing the envelope to far to get salesthe problem with this type of film is it can give sick people even sicker ideas by giving them a visual of what the situation would be like in real lifethe movie has no story line no good acting and to make up for it they have tried to get ratings with a massive shock factorthis film does stick in your mind like a few of the other people commenting have said but not like a good movie that makes you go wow for days after this one simply makes you sick and hope that this doesnt go on somewhere in the worldi regreat watching it simply because its not a well writern horror its just a sick movie created by people with sick minds trying to create something that sellsi really cant see many people after watching this going out to own a copy,cruel
boring yawni need a nap i cannot believe this junk scored over 5 stars on the ratings i wish there was a way i could give it a zero because this did not even deserve a 1 rating if you enjoy watching a bunch of mindless guys wandering around europe with no direction getting high and a few token nudie scenes then this is a movie for you acting was poor script was terrible story line pathetic plot less and pointless it did not keep me interested at all as a matter of fact i fell asleep when it finally picked up somewhat at the end with the socalled gory scenes they were laughable what a joke ive seen better story lines and more gore on little house on the prairie,cruel
this movie was ok but it was really disgusting it was way to much for me to handle and i think that it sucked the acting was good but it was just incredibly shocking and i think it was more gruesome than the exorcist if you cant handle gore dont see it the part where that girl is getting her eye drilled out and hes laughing gave me chills i mean you might as well be watching a gory porno because thats pretty much what it was i almost barfed i mean come on the ending is really gross but i think that he deserved it i just didnt understand why everyone was in on that stuff thats sick the whistling affect made me think of the texas chainsaw massacre and jeepers creepers,cruel
most people i have talked to told me not to see this movie because t had no point and was nothing but violence and gore i should have listened i thought this movie was going to make me jump at least once but all it did was make me wince at the mindblowing level of gratuitous violence turned out to be a movie more about revenge than a horror flick some parts of the movie actually had me laughing such as when kana jumps in front of the train after seeing her burned in a reflection i am also saddened to say that the great people in hollywood have decide to make a sequel out of this piece of trash gorefest the weird thing about it though is that eythor gudjonsson the man who played oli is in it even though he was killed in the first one needless to say i think the sequel will be even worse than the previous,cruel
is a low budget horror film that has a gimmick the film messes with your mind and the effect is sadness and anger is this what truly happens to people who are denied their wants there is torture in the viewing experience the film makes you want to go out and plant daisies and attend church right away its effect is brutally painful if is trying to state something it is how we fall victim to desire and dwell in it damaging those we seek for temporary fulfillment be careful for todays pleasure can be tomorrows sufferingthe film is a cess pool of lust and torture a sadomasochists twisted fantasy and director roth places you right in it no thanksyet it had a big opening weekend and has developed a semi cult following with the bush generation what every horror film should strive to be so i give it 1 for that achievement,cruel
i think anyone who says this movie has too much nudity and gore is missing the point nudity and gore is why we watch horror films plus the fact that the female cast members are smoking hot adds to the appealif only they chopped their little nubile bodies up as well as the dudes it would have been a 10 keep the vaseline in the drawer thoughthis is not hackable material in any case just at the point when you think this movie is breaching the soft core porn line it switches into a very disturbing torture flick where bodies are sliced in all the most painful waysbut thats ok is it not this is a horror film not a love story we need more blood and nudity,cruel
once i saw the trailers for it looked like the perfect horror gory movie to go see so it starts off very slowly tell anything considered scary happensonce it starts it doesnt even look real and doesnt even gross me out one bit i just sat there staring at the screen thinking wow i really wasted my money this time by the way dont even rent it its just a waste of timein the end it doesnt even explain anything and youre just left confused and mad because it was such a huge disappointment seriously this has been the worst horror movie that ive ever seen in life,cruel
there is a lot of controversy over this film people find it to be sick and twisted and if you are among the people who enjoy it then you must be sick and twisted as well i think if you take a step back no matter if you loved the film or hated it you must admit it got your attention and thats what its all about i dont think eli roth went into this film wanting everyone to love it he wanted it to disturb you and make you sick and maybe even hate it i think he did a fabulous job of that and thats why i appreciate this film so much it taps into that place in your mind that makes you uncomfortable some people enjoy feeling that and others cannot handle it so i say give the film credit because it is in no way a mediocre film no matter which way you look at it,cruel
i thought i would really like this movie and from everything i heard about it i thought i would i was wrong where oh where to begin 1 the main characters are so unlikeable i was rooting for their death 2 it was completely predictable and im really bad at predicting movies 3 total incompetency on the part of the actors director and pretty much anyone involved in the movie 4 the stuff with the kids was just hilarious 5 the torture scenes were offensive not in their graphic nature but because they looked so fake and the audience is expected to buy it 6 my girlfriend and i were making joke comments about what the characters would do and they did them 7 the goofs page should list revealing mistakes too numerous to list here 8 the first half of the movie is completely irrelevant and is nothing more than a boob fest when i want breasts i go to porn when i want a movie i watch a movie not that i have a problem with nudity in movies just so long as it has a point here it just ads to the what the bleep nature of the moviei cant believe quentin tarantino put his name on this this is by far one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time i suggest you save your hour and a half there are so many better things you can do with your time than watch movies like this im writing this so you dont have to make the mistake i did 110,cruel
its sad to me that great talent would be wasted on an exercise as vile as this i mean this is a wellmade movie the craft is great the filming the actors the effects but this amounts to a snuff film and nothing more an exercise in pure sadism and blood lust there is no redeeming value of any kind i was told that this is based on a realworld situation from thailand ok so for those of you who dont have the time or money to go to thailand heres the next best thing and maybe if you save up your dollars you can be there in the flesh some day im starting to think that tarentino is a twisted perv given that his thumbprints on a movie always means a new height in graphic violence sadly is that what it takes for him to have any kind of human emotionbut as long as we keep voting with our dollars this kind of crap will continue to pollute the world sadly i accompanied a nephew to this film and wasnt prepared for the extreme level of graphic violence,cruel
i rented this movie hoping for a gruesome horror flick unfortunately it is nothing but a low budget porn film to start with we my husband brother inlaw and i forwarded through the naked girl stuff of which there was lots it got so silly that the guys arrived at a to find out there were no private rooms wouldnt you know it they had to share rooms with naked girls that wanted to have sex with them whenever they wanted every teenage boys wet dream i suppose once through that we were hoping for some entertainment  wrong i found myself hoping that the killing would begin just to get through the terrible acting directing and plot development sadly we never came across anything worth watching and popped in a different movie we didnt even bother watching the whole movieim going to have to do more research before renting movies for sure if i had read some of the reviews on this site i wouldnt have rented this movie,cruel
i really wish i could give 0 out of 10 stars but i cant the acting was horrible and the plot was pretty crappy the cutting and editing was ok on a few parts but for the most part the movie was just not well put together ive seen better things made by people with home camcorders the horror factor in this movie was zero and the entertainment factor was also zero i dont even think this movie deserves even to be downloaded off the internet this was a movie that was supposed to be about torture when the movie just was torture ive seen bad movies and then ive seen the only movie that i could say was worse than this movie was the rockville slayer that was a horribly made movie the only difference between this and rockville was that rockville had terrible sound editing and mastering save yourself the time and the money dont see this movie no matter what your friends or anyone else says i am really disappointed that quentin terintino or however you spell his name as a respected director would put his name along side this piece of trash,cruel
just rented and it very well may be one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen a cross between porkys and some off the wall b horror flick from 1982 what is the deal does he think that because hes quentin tarantino he can just put together any stupid series of events and call it art of film his name will sell it how insulting pulp fiction was fantastic reservoir dogs was excellent jackie brown was almost good sorta kinda ok from dusk till dawn was pretty dumb as a whole but had a few redeeming qualities decent cast visually interesting enough but this this is just plain crap,cruel
i dont know what people have against this movie after allthe acting is well donethe storyline is good and has a very interesting twistthe movie as a whole is convincing enough for its events to be plausiblethree young backpackers touring europe on a quest to get stoned and have sex which is not a very uncommon thing the movie sets up a downtoearth atmosphere surrounding this quest bringing you in showing you an appreciable funny and most importantly normal world from the perspective of the main characters you get a sliceoflife of backpackers letting themselves go and it is all so that you can understand their motives later when suspicious things start to occur and understand how horribly horribly wrong things goi say nothing more except that it is most definitely not for children respect the rating on this one and for you that are about to watch the movie put yourself into the mindset of the main characters and you will truly enjoy this movie i havent seen such a grotesque movie in a long time  i was overly amused,cruel
i have seen hundreds and thousands of scary films i have been kept on the edge of my seat on a lot of them but this film is one of a kind from the producer of kill bill comes this horrific tale of 3 backpackers touring europe the film starts off as a hard sex and drug film later turns into a blood bath full of horrific torture and gore this is the only film i have had to look away in this is a film that you will never forget or regret in this film you really feel the pain of the characters fear and pain quentin tarrantino gives us again another bloody tale if you thought kill bill volume 1 was bloody youll need to think again after watching this film a must see film for all horror fans and prepare to watch one of the best films of the century,cruel
to appreciate this movie youll have to look past all of the blood  boobs i can see how it can be difficult to keep such offensive materials from clouding your judgment but if you succeed youll see and appreciate this movie for what it really is the struggle of a man to overcome all odds this basic theme is present in plenty of modern movies galdiator patriot etc most of which receive much praise one might argue ok so the movie had a great basic idea but why portray this idea through such graphic means well i think it added an extra element to the film not only is this movie the bold tale about the struggle of a man but now it is an eye opener to the harsh realities of the world around us there are places in the world the events of the film are as real as night or day having seen this movie i am more aware of the world i live in no just life within my small worldthe bottom line if you are not easily offended or weak stomached i highly recommend you watch this movie with an open mind im willing to bet you will like what you find,cruel
umm boobs and gore my friends and i rented this hoping for a really good psychological horror kind of thing something that would mess with your mind and creep you out for days well what we got was something that probably could be considered mild porn in fact the entire first half of the movie seems devoted to naked busty women i found myself wondering when the actual plot was going to be set in motion then the plot was set in motion and i kept waiting for some kind of grand finale some wrapping up of events something to signal that the movie was over and the last two hours of my life had not been wasted alas my waiting was in vain there was no tying up of loose ends maybe i should be glad for that because as bad as the rest of it was even a great ending wouldnt have made up for it on an up note the effects were good the gore while almost amusingly overthetop was realistic enough to make me want to vomit there really isnt any horror involved though more of its more of a shock value kind of thing almost as if the director was saying hey lets see how many times i can catch the audience without their faces covered just when they think the nasties are over bam,cruel
this movie was simple awful i cant believe that people like this for a horror film it wasnt at all scarymy experience with this film ended half way through when someone had a seizure in our cinema which i might add i was very grateful for grateful for the fact i could leave not grateful for the fact the guy had a seizure all the violence and sex in this film really does detract from it it could have been done in a way which added some much more to the film as some else said it is an interesting concept for a movie but the implementation of that idea got lost dont waste your money like i did its simply no worth 2 hours of your life,cruel
will someone please stop eli roth the director of this stupid and dull excuse for a movie from ever making any other films his cabin fever was bad enough but is way way worse this wretched excuse for a movie takes half its running time to get down to business squandering any intelligence or plot in favor of lowgrade porn and the misadventures of three characters that no one could remotely even care about throw in a lot of barely concealed homophobia eli roth apparently has issues hes trying to work out and watch this impotent brew put the audience to sleep by the time the supposedly scary stuff starts happening this movie is so far off the tracks that it crashes and burns into one ridiculous scene after another film buffs might get a laugh or two picking out parts of other better horror films that eli roth ripped off and used in in exactly the same way he did for cabin fever this movie actually put me to sleep during its first half and then gave me a whopper of a headache during the second half primarily due to aggravation based on the fact that i couldnt punch eli roths face off the only really frightening thing on the dvd is in the featurettes listening to mr roth talk about how european toilets flush i told you he had issues pass this movie by and save a couple of aspirins total garbage,cruel
this movie doesnt even count as horror its a porn film for murder fetishists the ideas in the movie come out in maybe one scene and it gets buried under mounds and mounds of gore someone managed to take a dying genre and try to revitalize it by removing any semblance of real plot and reaching right for the saw blades the result makes you yearn for repeat viewings of jason x i refuse to even call this a film and it has as much artistic quality as girls gone wild volume 3 i imagine eli roth took a trip to the holocaust museum and his first thought was hey this would make a great movie if i slip in enough tits and gore no one will notice that my characters are nothing but puppets that exist to be chopped up by maniacs brilliant,cruel
very boring really a waste of movie rental money the movie takes forever to even get started and by then i had enough not going to spoil it for others however i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone the plot could have been something but getting to that point was slow torture for the viewers i actually walked out of the room came back a few minutes later and the same scene was dragging along theres some gore but overall its not a movie thats going to make you scared or jump or create fear it didnt stir any emotion but boredom and disappointment i suppose its a matter of personal taste as for me waste of time,cruel
if you want to see a lot of naked girls gore and a terrible story this movie is great for you i think roth missed the mark when shooting for a horror movie if you remotely pay attention to the movie you realize that basically everything is predictable is it just me or doesnt that defeat the purpose of a horror flick to make things worse the first half of the movie is nothing but a softcore porn that has very little to do with the plot or lack thereof all in all i feel that this movie was a combination of two ideas sex and gore haphazardly thrown together into a 90 minute presentation i challenge anyone out there to watch this movie and tell me that they didnt see how things were going to turn out scene after scene roth may have accomplished his goal but his goal is a terrible film,cruel
i was one of those who didnt like cabin fever but i must say i was pleasantly surprised about i all ready knew the plot spoiler alert which is travel sex porn torture escape revenge it is a bad plot but one does not view such movies for the plot but for the effect and the suspense this movie is one of the most suspenseful i have ever seen its true that the acting is lacking at places and also that there is no realism in the plot spoiler alert again these people have no motive to torture no one would pay to do this its true people torture each other for all sorts of reasons but not for the reasons in this movie it is very persuasive but still not realistic moreover more spoiler alerts the notion that the last surviving guy just whacks off all his victimizers in a single sweep sort of meeting all of them on his way home is not realistic at all the way he escapes from the tortures is also pretty dumb why not just walk out he had a gun surely it would not be easier to hide among the corpses and hope for the best while he was being transported somewhere anyway this is surely a great movie about how rough europe maybe especially eastern europe can be,cruel
i am not a big horror film fan i simply wanted to see this because the hype surrounding this movie claims that it is truly disturbing and disgusting what i got was one of the funniest movies of all time however a movie should not be laughed at it should be laughed with i shouldnt be laughing because the script is completely moronic i shouldnt be laughing because the actors are ridiculous i mean seriously i am sure this movie had enough of a budget to hire a few decent actors well i guess if i could act i wouldnt go near this script either i am certain a bunch of foul mouthed 5 year old kids penned it under the name eli roth seriously every character is off the shelf stock young potheaded hedonistic horny and above all stupid kids go on massive road trip throughout europe and end up in an area which lures tourists in and has people pay to slaughter them whoa that is a good one let me tell you now i find it funny that soft core porn is distributed throughout in effort to convince you that there was something in the film that was worthwhile it is a paradox that anyone who watches this film will be violated far worse than any of the stupid characters in the film,cruel
this is worth seeing if you can get past the arrogant punk college kids in europe beginning the main character turns into something of a hero which is a good surprise this movie gives new meaning to the expression street urchin great scene nice to see the bad guys get theirs for a change i sincerely hope this movie is total fiction and not based on some dark truth somewhere there is some very good foreshadowing as well conversation about drowing victim the initial meeting with one of the elite hunting customers one of the more chilling moments is when the main character is going into the exhibit and the guy leaving says best money youll ever spend nice job quentin,cruel
please dont waste your time with this movie being a horror movie and qt fan i was pleased when i saw his name associated with a potentially interesting concept i was painstakingly let downtrust every negative comment you have read about this movie its not worth the timethe story lacks substance the dialogue lacks good writing the actors lack direction the scares are not scary and the twists are nothing more than poor attempts by a below average filmmakerperhaps eli should attempt another genre because this and cabin fever just dont make the cut,cruel
ive seen porn with a stronger plot you have josh that you want dead to put an end to his constant sniveling and mamasboyishness and then there is paxton who shows the cockiness and dumbheaded adventurousness that makes foreign countries want americans dead the one thing that the film does get right is that sometimes people get what they are looking for the main characters wanted life experience to take back to college with them and by god they got it the writers have even thrown in a stereotypical americanized view of the netherland wonderland of amsterdam a terrible movie full of terrible characters ends up being another cabin fever sized failure for eli roth,cruel
this movie was nothing but gore and sex for the entire thing introduced just like any other movie about kids and sex and then all of a sudden people are being torn apart there was not enough of a story line for this to be considered a great all round movie stupid people making stupid lousy choices and ending up being tortured is no basis for a movie there was no build up around most of the characters aside from the main character so no sympathy or feelings are felt for any of them the doctor from the beginning ending up on the train in the end and the girls that originally seduced the main character being in the street were just two really stupid coincidences basically overall it was a waste of time and not even worth my thoughts if i wanted to see boobs and sex i would have rented a porno and if i wanted gore i wouldve watched a real horror film do not purchase this movie by any means if you must watch it borrow it from a friend even for someone who enjoys gory movies i found this one lacking and moronic not even scary in the least bit,cruel
i love horror films yet this is one of the worst ive seen a shot glass has more dept than the plot of this one between the cheesy special effects the gore in this movie looks too fake for the shock value to set in and by the way dont buy into that inspired by true events all they did was clump a few urban legends together which make this film about as real as hellraiser if you want to see a good horror film thats gory go watch saw ii and least that film has a good plot to go with it i can simply not find a reason to tell anyone to watch this movie i want the hour and a half of my life back i spent watching this trash so i can do something more productive like slamming my fingers in a car door do yourself a favor and stay clear of it let your friends know its a complete waste of time after all friends dont let friends watch bad movies,cruel
when i first learned of and the impact it had on audiences i couldnt wait to see what all the fuss was aboutand after watching this clichd and boring movie i still do not know what the fuss is all abouthow was this movie scary how was this movie sickening how was this movie ever heralded as the scariest movie in a decade perhaps my growing up with splatter and horror films gives me a heavily biased opinion but nothing in this movie was brand newat allthe exorcist is scarythe shining is scarynightmare on elm st is scaryand so on and so onis not scary its just saw all over again,cruel
i wonder why quentin tarantino will even think of spending a dime to fund this crap bad execution lousy plot and stupid way to end dont waste your time even you are bored to death youll rather have bed sores than to be torture by this piece of crapquote from repeater123 this movie was absolutely terrible i didnt see it in the theaters and had been waiting for it to come out on dvd what a letdown scariest movie in a decade not by a long shot the plot sucked the characters sucked the torture scenes sucked character development was nowhere to be found i didnt care when they died theyre was nothing likable about them there was nothing scary about this movie gore does not scare me it might make me wince but it aint scary eli roth is a hack this movie went straight from my dvd player to the trash can i have no use for it ill never watch it again and i cant see any reason to hold on to it what a waste of 15,cruel
i hate to say it but fits in line of many of its fellow lions gate filmsit was extremely overhyped and fell very short of all expectationsfor the first half of the movie there were countless unnecessary scenes with topless women one really fat one too there were so many naked women it actually took away from the movie i expected to see a scary movie with some plot development but i was very wrong apparently they lost the original footage for the first half of the movie and decided to use an old girls gone wild video and hoped nobody noticed with an absolutely horrible transition the movie switches to complete gore the gore wasnt shockingly horrible either contrary to advertisements there was just lots of it i honestly believe that eli roth decided to try to fit as many naked women and gory scenes in one film and this was the product the writing was sub par the acting wasnt much better and the movie theater didnt allow refundsif you have any taste in movies steer very clear of ,cruel
this movie was well filmed and the acting is worthy of note however this is the kind of project that should never have been produced the rating of r was appropriate but there should have been a requirement for a content warning on the coveri viewed this movie with an open mind and enjoyed the plot until the evil unfolds i now wish i had not seen this through its images burnt into my brain and left me traumatizeddo not ever let your children see this and protest the display of rentals without a content warning which should read as followswarning disturbing images of sexual content torture and brutal killing,cruel
this movie is perhaps the dumbest movie i have ever seen a complete waste of 20 and 2 and a half hours of my life if u havent seen it yet i warn you not to its not gruesome its pathetic and stupid at points laughably dumb seeing rubber dolls being mutilated as if they were people is not convincing and the 2 hours of porno that you have to sit through is the only thing that sells this movie once you get to the gore at the end of the movie about 30 minutes your thrown right into it without any plot or importance to the characters can someone tell me how a chainsaw is going to cut through someone when nobody is holding it then it magically stops once he is almost dead but yet this guy who has his torso almost completely severed from his waste is still alive trying to move to the chainsaw like he could actually get up and use it its so horribly dumb i feel i have lost most of my brain cells by watching it it says its the scariest movie of the decade the only scary part is realizing u paid 20 for a really bad movie,cruel
i only sat threw about the first 40 minutes to 45 minutes before i had to turn it off i rented the unrated and uncut version and found it to beless than terrible i hated cabin fever and i didnt know the guy that wrote that movie wrote this movie as well it was advertised a quinton t movie more than anything else if i had known that the cabin fever dude was involved i never would have rented it there was no story in the beginning just guys getting high and wanting to get laidthats pretty much it the entire 40 minutes i think the target audience is young people i am 24 so i am talking like 18 or so sometimes some movies lag in the beginning but get better in the middle this one had nothing interesting in itat all for 4045 minutes maybe it got better i dunno but it was unbearable enough for me to say screw waiting and shut it off,cruel
i hate to say any of this i really like eli roth and this is one of my favorite genres but i have tothis is probably the worst movie ive seen in quite some time i think the main reason i hated it so much was that i got excited from all the hype i know i should not have been pulled in but i did this movie was tagged as being the scariest movie in a long time the goriest the most graphic the most realistic blah blah blah was none of those the few gore scenes there were the effects sucked there were no aspects of the movie that were close to being scary also im a man and i do enjoy seeing some nudity in movies but the amount in this movie was crazy i kept on thinking was there going to be anything else but nakedness and sex i really thought this movie was going to be something but it was a flop in my book,cruel
in short i was very annoyed at the stupidity of this film besides much of what was said already this is a piece of film making where the production money would have been better spent saving some sick patient in the hospital or something tarrantino et all have finally shown their last gasp attempt they are baron now and any film he makes from now on will have the shadow of the all over it tarrantino  you are finished with many people and you have finally achieved your goal to be despised  feels good i hope lame  ignorant and downright pathetic are the first words that i find for this excuse of a picture my last statement and a comment that i hope will resound in your empty little soul is that if you had any grace at all then you would have used the english workaround for theatrical countries and said the action took place in lets say ruritania rather than slovakia the very beautiful slovakia which is filled with a very nice population who is just trying to regain its stature after years of communist oppression the fact that it seems a popular hollywood manner to place evil in eastern european countries is the height of ignorance and total disrespect for these nations who were established and flourishing a long time before the pathetic usa was a wet dream in washingtons trousers keep your filth in california and just shut the puck up  make no more films,cruel
i am not a fan of gore movies and usually they are simply a dumb excuse to use gore instead of plot to shock people while the plot of this movie is not extremely intricate the realization pushed by the movie is something i havent considered very thoroughly before the terrifying thing about the movie isnt the torture itself but the people inflicting it the torture sequences are appalling enough but the true horror comes when you discover that the people performing the horribly savage acts arent insane psychopaths but those who are rich and obviously of highly esteemed positions in society that is the true horror of this movie it makes you realize something that isnt thought about much every day the filthy rich satisfy their every whim and fleshly desire new cars drugs sex wasteful frivolity but what about those people who have hidden desires for power control blood the evil delight of inflicting hideous suffering on others what do they do to get their foul needs satisfied i believe that this is the true horror of this film and what really disturbs me the most about it is that i am more than ready to believe such things happen regularly there are a lot of missing persons cases around the world every year in america alone approximately 2300 new missing persons are reported every day that doesnt even include the ones that are not reported children and adults disappear never to be seen or heard from again does anyone really stop to think of the things that are more than likely happening i know this movie has messed me up for a long time to come i dont think ill ever be able to shake the ideas and i dont know if they should be shaken because i strongly feel that this may be more reality than fiction and i think people would be wise to keep things like this in mind during day to day life,cruel
i was lucky to get tickets for the premier of the very first half hour of the movie is just for warming up things the 3 guys are in amsterdam and what do you do in amsterdam you smoke pot visit the red light district have sex so thats whats all about lots of free tit shots for the males out there in amsterdam they meet a guy that tells them that the hot girls are all in bratislava and they head it there once they arrive they check in at this where they have to share the room the roomies are girls and they are gorgeous they began to disappear and they end up at the gallery well im not telling you anymore p go watch the movie its based on real facts so its pretty shocking knowing that people actually pay to torture people its sick but hey this is only and movie and the master tarantino does it again its really gory so its only for those who really like that kinda moviesother may actually throw up in some parts so hope my comment was useful now go watch the damn movie,cruel
was everything i wanted it was like combining eurotrip with chainsaw massacre what they thought was a stoners trip to europe turned out to be a nightmare and yes there was blood the losers died and so did the enemy if you like torture and people dieing this is the movie for you this is for everyone who wanted to see what really happens when you go to europe this movie had the best torture scenes out of any movie it made me feel a little nauseas which the only thing that disturbed me besides that movie was the faces of death this is by far one of the better horror movies and you should see it this movie was definitely worth seeing,cruel

when i initially saw previews for hostle i was totally turned off it looked too much like saw and it was produced by quentin tarantino which to me usually says that the movie isnt good enough to stand on its own so advertisers use a good name to draw crowds into theaters however i later realized that it was written and directed by eli roth and i absolutely loved cabin fever so this revived my hopes proved to be everything that i expect in a good horror it had humor and gore the gore was very well done the movie didnt rely on lame cgi effects all special effects were old school ie makeup prosthetics etc and it left you feeling good what i mean by feeling good is that it wasnt weighed down by the whole psychological thriller thing it was a feel good horrorgore film sort of like peter jacksons bad taste or dead alive but with a bigger budgetwhat i love the most about eli roths films is the way he quotes great classic horror whether it be with a character or with a particular kill or the way something is filmed something always rings true and familiar and at the same time he ironically makes fun of new hollywood blockbusters by always having a lame character from like euro trip or something terrible anyway a lot of people may find this combination of old school horror and sellout hollywood to be lame or whatever but i think it is brilliant and totally intentional and i am anticipating many more great films from eli roth,cruel
i think that the idea of the film is not interestingi thing it is stupid i think there is only a lot of bloodonly this nothing else i dont think i had to comment the first half of the film it is absolutely a disgusting it could be only 10 minutes just to introduce the viewer in the other partstupid part the first part of the movie is just an erotic filmit dont have any link whit the other part only the actors there is only one good think and it is the part with the torment there is some interesting things but it is only 5 minutes of about 90 minutes for the whole film ps and of course again very brief american who is invisible,cruel
so i wanted to see basic instinct 2 my friends said no we want and i said okthat exactly was my mistakei went through 2 hours approx of the worst movie ever to see a projectorim sorry but drills through peoples legs is not cinema especially when its american tourists in slovakia where do you get these idea mr roth maybe for 2 you could have cheerleaders in armenia where someone evil sends them claiming that everyone there owns an escalade and rocks i am not actually that surprised that was that bad it could be worse if it was a sequel i know this isnt going to get posted but i really have to speak my anger goodnight now,cruel
this was truly one of the worst films i think i have ever seen although i do take my hate off to mr roth and mr tarantino for pulling one of the greatest con jobs of all time this film sold itself on its sickening god awful violence and for my money it just wasnt there i am extremely squeamish  i actually passed out at hannibal but i didnt even have to look away at any point in this film the violent bits were actually few and far between and there was only one short scene that was pretty bad half of it doesnt look real and the rest is just crapthe reason i went to see it is because i thought the way it was done might make it an atmospheric solid genre piece it is not mr roth has been insulting films like the grudge saying they are pg13 horror films with no real bite well i disagree completely watching people slice each other up does not scare me it just makes me feel sick the grudge and the blair witch project were scary because of the atmosphere they created the texas chainsaw massacre and wolf creek were both gory and scary as they created a scary atmosphere made you identify with the characters and then chopped them up is not scary because it does not make any effort with storyline or character development i did not care about these characters so when they had their tendons slashed etc etc i could not care less and there simply is no storyline whatsoever also the tag line to the film says there is a place where all your sickest fantasies can be indulged well if people really do fantasise about doing this sort of thing to people we are living in a sad world and to be honest i dont think anyone does fantasise about this sort of thing i have friends that have gone to jail for violent offences and they would absolutely never fantasise about this sort of thing so right away there is a huge plot flawawful awful awful film and not scary in the slightest well done to roth and tarantino again though im off to write a script about a theme park where everyone gets the worst most horrific things happening to them as long as they can pay for it its gonna be well gory expect to see it at the top of the us box office,cruel
this is an edit of my previous review i wrote that review when i first came back from seeing the film i thought it was brilliant apart from its slow start however i have since returned to see it and i want to take back my one negative commentspoilerthe film starts with the three friends josh oli and paxton touring europe in an attempt to get josh laid before being directed to the i suppose in my first viewing i was too prepared for instant gore violence and torture and therefore didnt truly appreciate the necessity of thisend of spoiler the need for this slow start is to introduce our characters we find out who they are what they like and the fact they are funloving young guys who are just out for a good time and this makes what happens to them in the future so much more scary we feel as paxton does when he sees what has happened to his friend utterly destroyed and we think how can this happen to such a nice guy without that slow start the scenes of torture would not be as shocking as they werefor anyone who has seen the film compare how you felt for josh and paxton as they were tortured and then for the chinese girl as she was you felt squeamish but because you had no relationship with her you felt almost passive at her sufferingoverall the film is about human nature but is a bit more complicated than good and bad roth isnt saying that we have good and bad people in this worldspoiler what he is saying is that everyone has the ability to be good and bad just some people exercise more of the other the hunter who tortures paxton is hesitant at first he still attempts to torture paxton but for a split second we feel he may change his mind because the good is coming out in himonce paxton has escaped he gets a chance to kill the dutch businessman and he does paxton becomes bad and whether roth wants us to we ultimately end up thinking is it rightend of spoiler so do i recommend the answer yes but watch it and all the time ask yourself why has roth done this like this and what does he want us to think dont dismiss it because of the graphic violence it depictsa brilliant film,cruel
this movie is just another horror teen movie and this time even more stupid it presents a wrong stereotype of europe and europeans with geographical and language mistakeslike in praga every signal is in german most of characters are just stereotypes so you can picture how much time the writer took to develop them the way the story connects the characters its quite silly and sometimes makes no sense plus the script seems to have some very big holes in it and some of them are quite remarkable i dont want to spoil them so youll laugh when you see it if you havent seen it yetof course thats just my opinion it sucks,cruel
this comment will contain spoilers please take heed thanks and dont feel too cut up about itwhat a load of old rubbishafter all the media hype that i never fell for for a minute did you no i did not go to this showing to see just gore as sold itself on but to see a new and refreshing movie of interest at leastthis completely unoriginal and extremely predictable bore fest has been seen too many times before ie the oozing eye from the japanese girl this being the money shot no doubt such as in the evil dead come on could there not be any other way for this movie to develop to evolve yeah kids on the journey of their lifetime fair enough but it approached a brick wall and never turned into anything but a pointless sorry excuse of celluloidwho or what even is this movie aimed at what was the story again its a rhetorical question do me a favour and come back with something with an idea and content that is worthy of my time and money at least we know there wont i hope be a squeal as all the lose ends were so very conveniently tied up at the end wow now that was easy wasnt it im impressedeven to the point of seeing a girl with only one eye the other was on the floor you see she seemed to take it very well you know in the car getting away from the baddies see was ever so quiet and calm the question of how high was her pain threshold was for her to be able to walk around with half her face ripped open and not be screaming her excuse the pun face off and yes youve guessed it she helps the good guy in the end by amazing its not that hard to figure outeven in the torture scenes we are more than often only guessing at what is being done to the poor victims as these were out of shot please dont say  well less is more and we had to image what was being done to them for better effect i just thought that it was because this movie lacked another pun guts guts to carry off what the media hype had us except me and yourself to believethis was full there was simply no more room at this inn unfortunately there were no more rooms to let to creativity imagination plot and originalityim looking for another building story plotim checking out,cruel
eli roth what have you done the trailer made this film look like something that was onpar with or maybe even better than the delight that was saw 2 the full film however fails to deliver on every countwere given three lads who backpack and want to get laid  cue loads of naked women and sex as the dudes party on theyre one by one drugged and dragged off to a place where theyre tortured and then killed by people who have paid to do so the third guy is taken by other means and ends up escaping whereupon he enacts a revenge not unlike the torture his tormentors have dished outthis is very much a film of three parts the first part is the getting to know the characters part where we see the three lads drink dance and smoke pot a lot after around 45 mins of this half the film we get to the action cough part where the torture kicks in this is the gore section of the film it is meant to be full of suspense but well it isnt the horror isnt very horrific  gore filled but nothing is on the same level as saw 2 the gore is justified well enough it just doesnt seem to be the right gore if that makes any sense and while this may sound odd there isnt enough gore too much is left to the imagination and then ruined by letting you see the aftermath which is so tame compared to what you imagined one scene with a drill makes you wince as you imagine the guy being drilled to have large chunks of flesh removed when in fact he was about three small holes which leak a little bloodi think the main reason this film doesnt compare to saw 2 is that the victims are just that they are victims they apart from the last guy just lay down and take their punishment in saw 2 the victims had a chance if they were quick witted calm and in some cases brave enough most of the torture sequences in saw 2 had the victims fighting for their lives which made for compelling viewing in the only survivor makes it out alive by luck more than judgement the sad thing is what he does next is just patheticthe third part of the film is the escape  revenge part which plays out for the last 20 minutes or so this involves the survivor rescuing a girl whos having her face burnt off by a welding torch not as horrific in the film as it sounds here in text and killing the heavies who run the place mostly by shooting them or hacking them up with things again it sounds more entertaining than it actually is he ends up stealing a car and running over some more people involved with the torture farm for lack of better words before finally ending the life of a torturer he met earlier on the film albeit not knowing he was involved then in the toilet on a railway station the revenge is played out more like a comedy with the final death being more amusing than disturbingthe events in this film hit all the popular clichs too lets see slaughter of main characters who are male and in early 20s  check characters whom you felt no connection to  check setting mood using dimly lit corridors  check lots of sex naked woman and drug use  check lone survivor  check main evil doers killed  check needless car chase sequence  check complete and utter lack of plot  check jump moments  che no wait i cant remember any there might have been one somewhere very bad music strings to heighten tensionsuspense  checkall in all a complete waste of time if you want a good horror flick go see saw 2  or revisit any classic horror movie from times past you will have a much better time doing that than watching  fact,cruel
i cant believe some people how you can actually doubt movies like this yet praise crap like jeepers creepers wrong turn star wars lotr all the killers in them movies are like some creepy monsters its not even real lotr  star wars its all animated its all a matter of opinion people should stop hating on this movie because its class i think its definitely one of those hate it or love it onesi personally loved it as i love these types of movies but i always critisice film makers for not making films more real life like i mean having killers than can fly monsters etc like the descenti mean how unreal is that there are rumours flying about that it was based on true events i dont believe that but it just goes to show it can happen in real lifedont believe the bad reviews about this and trust me the imdb rating does not reflect the true genius of this film if you like edge of your seat thrillers this is the one for you its got everythingplot storyline actionwatch it i kinda lost faith in hollywood recently after all the movies they produced but this one surely puts it back on the map well done eli roth  qt the acting wasnt all that but none the less a great movie get it now,cruel
an excellent film which delivers on horror by its sense of realism i disliked cabin fever which was far too silly but this was a far cry from that a little slow to begin with but this was clearly to build on character so that what occurs later in the film has more impact a film of this kind has been a long time coming and takes the mythology of the snuff movie to its apex certainly not for the squeamish and although there are films out there with more gore it is rare that it is portrayed on such a believable basis and one leaves the cinema with the feeling that there really are people out there willing and capable of committing the atrocities shown in the film roth clearly nods to the asian horror genre along with elements of films like 9mm and texas chainsaw massacre but the film itself is original enough to stand out on its own the acting was very good with strong believable performances from all characters the intriguing nature of the atrocities which makes the viewer a voyeur also adds to the horrific and sickening nature of the film my two criticisms are first that there werent more clientsof the human hunting service shown in the film as there could clearly have been a wealth of examples of depraved individuals which would have added to the films horrific revelations secondly that we never discover who started and organizes the service as this could have added to the plot a must see for horror fans although normal cinema goers may find this too shocking and disturbing but then that is what horror is supposed to be,cruel
had i tried to make a bad horror flick id never have come close to this its probably the most disturbingly violent and graphic horror ive seen so far and utterly pointless to that full of stupid stereotypes and typical american ignorance yeah theres no guys in slovakia because of the waryou want to stay away from this bucket of pus at any price there is no money or any other reward that will redeem sitting through the 90 minutes of stupidity from the silly adam opening sequence through all the unimaginable gore right down to the dull ending nowhere near closureeli roth deserves to endure all the pain the victims in this flick experience and there would still be room for stuffing his left nut in his gouged eye socket,cruel
i have just watched and as a result my mind is filled with a vast amount of anger and disgust at the content of this film i am not the worlds biggest horror fan but will certainly watch mainstream movies in this genre the devils rejects wasnt to my taste athough i loved its prequel but the film had many praise worth qualities and proved rob zombie to be a director worthy of much bigger and better projects saw was great saw 2 hohumhowever doesnt even pretend to be a horror film it is instead nothing more than a plea for the reacceptance of the use of torture in the real worldthe film is cheaply made with useless acting and a cheap nasty use of untouched abandoned industrial locations however it is in this that the film is totally honest for the film is concerned only with scenes of torture and sadism devoid of any context or dramatic purpose the film only comes to life when a torture scene is showing the rest of the time is like a very very inferior copy of a plotfree version of an american werewolf in parisin the opening scene of the evil that men do a low rent charles bronson thriller we witness a bunch of wouldbe torturers receive a practical classroom lesson in the art of inflicting pain and humiliation on a reallife male and female victim was made as a pure piece of desensitisation for such an audienceim sure the renamed school of the americas the main facility in the us for training the leaders of death squads that operate in various latin america nations has already placed a giant order for dvd copies of to use as a teaching aidthere is no black humour in no dark subversive comment no plot to speak of no irony and no invention no decent editing and no decent cinematography the east european landscape is cheaply and artlessly shot the sexual nudity is tedious in the extreme all these negatives allow the filmmakers to purify the central purpose of their film an act of pure worship at the temple dedicated to the worst of human crimes murder by torturehas but one message that torture is now to be accepted as a normal part of the human experience when the use of torture by the west became commonplace in us facilities in afghanistan iraq cuba and many exsovietcontrolled nations eg us military bases in poland and romania we had a choice to howl our outrage and return western civilisation back to the values previously in place for at least the last two hundred years or to quietly submit and embrace the new age of depravity the makers of believe that we have voted for depravity and wish to cheer that result as loudly as possibleas a side observation why was the film giving slovakia such a kicking is this rivalry between the successful czech republic and the other part of the former nation of czechoslovakia torture and racism what a lovely combinationi cant score this movie for obvious reasons however if i could score for evil intent like john wayne gacy would score a perfect 10for those of you that would seek to misunderstand my position i would explain that i am too squeamish to watch the whole of even the cut version of hellraiser 2 but i would never dream of describing that film as evil the often stupid and tasteless italian exploitation horror movies of the 70s and 80s likewise always have some merit and would never be described by myself as evil for me is a first,cruel
my god what happened to tarantino to be involved in such crap kill bill was already not as good as the critics claimed it to be be honest nothing new after pulp fiction just some chicks swinging blades with socalled style well i guess we wont get any more excellence and style after movies like pf and reservoir dogs from mr tarantino especially if he teams up with eli roth on the other hand sin city really kicked ass but that is only due to rodriguez and millerabout  what the fk is going on people speaking german in the netherlands czech in slowakia three main characters with the summed iq of 3 a dozen of chicks adding maybe a few more every scene makes it more unbelievable and the shocking part of the movie is replaced with numbness and disgust while i really think it could be much better with good actors good storyline and at least some style but then you would have a completely different movie i think the psychos were quite stupid paying so much money getting dressed like butchers whistling a song and then kill your victim quickly sorry its just styleless and then i wont talk about the silly scene with the motor saw please better watch texas chainsaw massacre again this movie does not deserve to be hyped like it has been already so far its just pathetic for me it ranks in the worst movies bottom 10 together with a movie called pleasure island i watched in south africa once and i think the people in eastern europe will not like it either because it is projected as some sort of third world were only retards and maffia live it simply is totally not like that even a retard can see  the real retards gave this movie over 2 points what can i say never seen any movie before,cruel
since i saw the trailer and the pictures i said i have to see this movie it looks so scary and so disturbingthe first part of the film can be a little bit slow but when the action starts it never ends the movie shows the worst and darkest part of the human men catching menits so real the suffering is so extreme disturbing the movie in one word is great its not a typicall movie not predictable at all this can happen in real life and its a way to show how pathetic can be humansthe gore scenes are great youll never seen a drill with the same eyes,cruel
hello everybody i am from slovakia i saw movie and i was very surprise and sad what a stupid film it is it is bullshit that this movie is true story only thing what is true that eli roth saw an advertisement on internet page from thailand to kill american for 10 000 he never checked if it was true or not he got great idea to do this movie and he need some country to realize it i have no idea why he chooses slovakia but i almost nothing about slovakia in this movie is not true we are member of european union member of natooecdit is true that economic is better than our but we have really great growth of economics and bratislava is as reach as a average of european union i am accepting that a lot of american dont know nothing about slovakiaas many european dont know about idaho but dont write stupid things as it is true story slovakia is really nice and safe countryi felt more dangerous in nyc as in bratislavaof course we have few murders per year as in any other country i can recommend to anybody visit it you cannot be blind and think that what you see in movie is trueplease read more wwwslovakiacom,cruel
i did not see more stupidity in one movie for a long time obviously writer had never been in europe people do not speak german in holland and russian in slovakia internet domain for russia is ru and not rus in movie bratislava looks like a worst place on earth by the way bratislava has population of 428672 slovakia is in european union and police is more serious than shown in movie police shown in movie act like they are in south korea also there are people with cars other than lada russian car children shown in movie act like lunatics you know there are parents in slovakia too all who voted positively for this movie should search internet for slovakia little bit more or any other country shown like hollandi do not know what tarantino saw in this movieps i am not from slovakia,cruel
it is great to see a new film return to the roots of this slasher  guts and gore genre but with style and finesse rather than the usual sex kill sex kill i cant really say i can think of a film made in the last twenty years that pays so much homage to the days of the video nasty apart from house of wax but that was a remakesuperb acting directing and casting and the location gave the film a truly creepy feelthe main problem with this type of film is that they relies to heavily on fx namely blood at the expense of story this film proves to be an exception i look forward to more of the same and hope this heralds the birth of intelligent splatter  gore film,cruel
run run as fast as your spindly american legs will take you to the nearest movie theater playing i understand this is going to be hard since the film was released in early january and most theaters dont hold a film of this nature for more than a couple of weeks but find itlike so many jaded horror fans of yesteryear i approach the modern slasher flick with very low expectations even when theyre the followups to films that i like in this case i was a pretty big fan of writerdirector eli roths debut feature cabin fever not so much for its outstanding achievements in horror since it was after all just a cleverly crafted retread of many other horror movies no more because it reflected roths obvious enthusiasm for a thendead genre and gave us plenty to laugh and marvel at when i learned of i wondered if eli could deliver a superior horror movie in a market flooded with bad japanese remakes the grudge dark water etc and bad american horror sequels saw 2 the ring 2 but his name was on it and i am nothing if not loyal so i went to see it with my lovely and loyal assistant figuring it would be a good way of getting her to cling to me for two hours in a darkened room as fate would have it i ended up being the one squeezing her arm until it turned blue and proved to be one of the most queasy enervating emotional experiences in cinema the music was overlydramatic at moments that were unnecessary and served only to dumb down the first and most tiresome act the first 2535 minutes of the film seem to crawl by as the two sightseeing friends and their drifter companion go to every arbitrary disco orgy and hash bar from here to bratislava not that im judging after all these are a group of horny guys let loose in the sexually and chemically liberated streets of amsterdam it just gets a little oldbut even at its less thrilling points the film kept our eyes open with color and frat boy humor examples of this can be found in the casting of the tweaked out european kid with the mole lip who tells our main characters about the in slovakia if corey feldman and dov tiefenbach see jason x smoked a bunch of crack and had a love child this guy would be it the silhouette scene a moving shot through a bluishhued corridor of sexual abandon was not just artfully done but served as a sharp foreshadowing contrast to what awaits the young men at the art exhibit another highlight that keeps the film moving when it sputters out is the bubblegum gang a group of impoverished little kids who roam the town mugging touriststhere are only a scant few places in this world that share the architectural beauty and weirdness that slovakia possesses in the film at first glance before the bodily fluids are spraying everything within arms length it looks like something out of babes in toyland or march of the wooden soldiers when the film gets going and the torture begins thats when you remember why you paid full price to see it on the big screen the torrent of bloody extremities and highpitched screams are just a fraction of what roth and co have concocted here in each of the major torture sequencesparticularly in the case of a character choking out globs of vomit and tears through his ball gagthe anguish and fear are so unrelenting and real that you almost feel like you are watching the introduction to a snuff filmaccompanied by a motion picture score the film is a massive achievement for filmmaker roth even if he never makes another film like this again some would say especially if he doesnt alas well never know since eli has already signed up for the sequel the visceral terror the sheer realism of each of these scenes is mindboggling and when you think about it it must be a lot harder as a filmmaker to provoke these sorts of emotions in your actors than it is to tell jake gyllenhaal and heath ledger to act gay its a far cry from the exaggerated i made it i expletive deleted made it bang bangbang of cabin fever no sophomore slump here in fact is proof positive that real talent can only grow as it goes alongfrom the creepy whistling of the dutch dissector to the heavy excited breathing of the german surgeon there is nary a moment for one to catch their own breath once the horror begins the desperation how tight youll cling to your life is what really grinds the nerves into pixie dust when we see a potential victim pleading with his wouldbe killer in the killers native tongue a language the victim doesnt he speak fluently we realize that we will stop at nothing to keep our hearts beatingand if you were afraid the film wouldnt have any time for memorable lines amid all the bloodshed just wait until you meet the american businessman who is so fired up about killing somebody that he nearly bludgeons himself to death with his own gun this role is played with expert wannabe macho energy by rick hoffman is easily the most deliciously disturbing and formidably real horror film of the 21st century and what it lacks in subtle buildup to harrowing events it makes up for in the very events in question,cruel
this is an amazingly believable movie for those not blinded by naivetwhile graphic in its depiction of nudity and violence all of this is both relevant and necessary to the plot as the characters and story develop from a hedonistic heaven to a hell beyond imaginingi saw this movie in a cinema in the toronto area ignorant of the plot or genre of the movie and came out surprised impressed and somewhat shocked which is the goal of the genre my companion suggested this movie as she thought she had heard about it afterwards she admitted it was not what she thought it was i am not normally a fan of horror movies mostly turned off by the likes of freddy kruger et al had i known we likely would have picked something else that being said i must rate this in a category of believable horror with movies like silence of the lambsdefinitely not recommended for the squeamishthe actors are largely unknowns but deliver good performances that are in line with the characters they portray the setting and premise which some might find incredible as compared to safe and civilized western society was all too credible to my companion who is from eastern europe and i spoiler  the central characters 2 american males and one icelander searching for hormone induced entertainment at its most basic human read male level find themselves in an eastern european backwater city in a where their disappointment at having to share a room turns to joy as they discover their roommates are beautiful young women but as first one then another disappear without reason the remaining one searches for his friend and answers to the mystery and is horrified to find both in a human slaughterhouse where clients pay for the privilege of killing peoplecharacters introduced early in the film reappear when you least expect them which is somewhat reminiscent of the typical hollywood happy ending as they get no less than they deserve but this device is not overdone and serves to advance the story at the end of the story there is little in the way of happy endings for most of the charactersat the end the remaining survivor descends to deliver a little horror of his own to one who deserves no less end spoiler  highly recommended if you like horror,cruel
wow not for the faint of heart at all if you are a young man thinking of leaving the country to go party with your friends stop and see this before you go this movie was fantastic if you have a twisted sense of reality and a love for gore is exactly what you have been waiting for i cannot recall one moment during this movie where i was thinking to myself theres no way that could happen as with so many films of this genre it was 100 believable from beginning to end i wont spoil it for anyone only warn you that it is extremely sick and graphic and an absolute thrill to see on a movie screen i cannot wait to purchase it on dvd hopefully unrated and view any deleted scenes or extra footage that may have been left out,cruel
well all i can say is wow i waited in anticipation to see this movie for so long and it did not let me downis without doubt the coolest most sickening and believe it or not almost genuinely believable horror flick that perhaps i have seen this film kicks so much ass it is actually quite painfuland all this from a film that is cut so heavily its almost criminal to watch it in this very shadow like statethe one thing i cant understand is why people have commented when they say they hate it how can you hate a movie like this it has everything a good horror movie should have it has good acting it moves at a good pace there is nice humour likable characters sexy ladies and the gore oh the goreand i couldnt help but notice that someone actually had the nerve to claim that white noise and house of wax actually done horror movies a favour what a joke that is i mean where do you get the idea that some guy using ept to look for people to kill or a town where people go to and get turn into wax works is actually better than this are you insane take it from me horror movies are not movies i dont want to go and see a horror movie and leave saying hey that was a good story man i want to leave a horror movie with an overwhelming feeling to deposit the popcorn i foolishly ate back out onto the carpet and does it like no other movie that is out therefactif you are someone who appreciates a good horror movie and not thriller crap like the ones above stated then you are going to love this movie you wont be disappointedand to everyone else who sees quentin tarantino on the poster this isnt an ultra cool gangster or revenge flick its an all out attack of everything that makes you cringe and question the very morale fibre of human existence in the 21st century its sick its nasty and basically its downright in your face so my advice would be to forget the tarantino element and think more cabin fever gore multiplied by 10the film i have to say is very well made there are lots of laughs and some nice settings also its very well directed and there does seem to be a major improvement in roths ability to make a proper movie and not just an excuse to make you feel sick much like cabin fever wasi also liked the fact there was no subtitles as at some parts in the film it really added a nice touch as you didnt have an idea what was being said much like the american characters in the film didnt either it added to the general confusion of the situation they found themselves inthis film is class pure class and the truth is your not going to see a film in the horror genre that is so raw original and emotionally challenging as this until eli roth makes another one,cruel
cabin fever was the first film to get me laughing out loud in a movie theater i absolutely worshiped the sick humor however i did not find it scary on the other hand was even funnier and much more intense the first half of the film is all set up and the scariest images for these 45 minutes are all nasty fake boobies but when the ball gets rolling it plows everything in its path faster and harder than all the whores in amsterdam combined i must say by the time i saw it i was kind of desensitized to a lot of the graphic imagery because of all the preemptive hype yes it gets nasty the eyeball scene is gross but i really didnt think that much of the film was any more graphic than an episode of niptuck i debated for a long time as to whetherornot i wanted to see this because im really squeamish but im soooo glad i did it was an absolute blast one of the most satisfying movies ive sat through all year,cruel
i thought this movie was one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time too much sex and not enough real gore and there was no real point to what gore you did see the story concept was good but executed very poorly made what little respect i had for quinton that much less i think that most of what happened could have been accomplished and portrayed without all the sexual visuals that is my main beef with this film when half the movie is based on sex which really didnt have much to do with the gore part before you even get to the gory part then there is a problem when the movie is supposed to be a horror flick about the gore the sex scenes werent in the previews which makes the previews misleading if it wasnt in the preview even a little then it really didnt seem that important they wanted to concentrate on the gore and scare tactics instead which wasnt all that scary or gory but it does take a lot for me to get grossed out keep in mind this is my personal opinion and you can make up you own minds but i wouldnt see or recommend this to anyone,cruel
this movie has made it to the top of my most hated movies list the overabundance of nudity in this movie is really what made me want to get up and walk out a little nudity in a movie is okay but the entire first part of the movie focuses on nothing more than lots and i do mean lots of nudity which i dont enjoy at all the plot is extremely weak and you definitely dont have any sympathy for the main characters in the movie nothing in this movie scared me at all i was more grossed out than anything and to me the movie was just a sick twist of softcore pornography and lots of fake blood mixed with bad acting i will never see this movie again and hope everyone saves their time and money,cruel
if youre thinking about going to see this moviedont its so crappy it has like no point if they decide to make another one of these crappy movies im going to slap someone the people who wrote directed and produced it must be sick in the head if you want my advicewait til it comes out on video to see it dont waste your money like i did its so crappy i went with four of my friends and every singleone of them thought it was absolutely stupid they said it was supposeto be scary it wasnt scary it was just gross the only thing scaryabout it was the fact that somebody thought to make a movie like thisso ill say once more this movie is sooooooooo stupid,cruel
starring beats me i was tricked into seeing this film by a friendthank the good lord above i did not waste my own money i think this movie was horrible and if this is what entertainment is coming to it may very well be the last time i head out to the pictures i understood the whole money can buy you anything and the world is a horrible place to be in kind of underlying story to a film that had no story i think it was gross i for one do not want to see people tortured on a big screen i was sitting beside some dudes who were actually laughing i was wondering to myself if i had in fact sat beside a serial killer i didnt find an ounce of humor in the whole film i also didnt find a point to it yeah the lead gets his revenge in the end but the story was lagging in so many aspects i wonder what mr tarantino will come up with next i am ashamed at supporting his future endeavors i am the first to admit i loved natural born killers and pulp fiction and even four rooms the violence within those films was an appropriate fit but they werent made soley for the gorefactor so do yourself a favor save your time and money and see a movie where you might actually learn something at this point i recommend just about anything else as i am sure it would receive eight more stars than this pile of garbage,cruel
yes is definitely not one of the better films of the year but i still felt it was just kick ass entertaining to the max and enough thrills to keep you on the edge of ur seatokay so there wasnt much of a point to it other than to shock and disgust us but i think eli roth did that and more the film is in a sense believable for the most part and the killings were so powerful and graphic that you can almost feel this happeninga strong stomach is required if you are to enjoy this film but i assure you it is one cool movie none the less i was entertained all the way through i enjoy a good ol gory horror film once in a while and this one wasnt too cheesy it actually had a few surprises for us and coul often be pretty funny at times so go check it out,cruel
i have to say that i am an aspiring film maker and i think eli roth is awesome as much as i adore dario argento quentin tarintino lucio fulci and others as of right now you are my favorite i thought was brilliant everyone including myself was expecting extreme gore and the sickest stuff imaginable but i thought it was better the way you made it because it left so much to the imagination and i thought it was full of suspicion and loneliness and the thought of ever enduring that kind of pain and torture to me it is so realistic because the stuff does happen at first i was like this is okay but the more i thought about it the more i liked it and to me that is the kind of reaction i would want for my films something to think about after the film is over and let me say i also adore takashi miike and to have in your film even for 15 seconds was beautiful i was the only one in the theater who knew who he was meeting the japanese master of horror for you would be like me meeting you keep up the good work and ill keep being inspired thank you for listening kelly from west virginia,cruel
horrible waste of anyones time yes its true a person knows what this is all about b4 they walk n only reason i went was to see the cheap euro chix to do the violence once they showed up  i walked out  its that simple how sad eli had to sell out once he went bigtime  cabin fever was so well done on all levels it just worked great from the well cast actors to the fresh script and storyline to the production values it was smart and original like a good movie should bi got hooked on cerina vincent after cabin fever  who didnt  haha but its truly sad how the garbage movie saw has badly influenced a lot young directors i only went to see saw 2 to catch lovely canadian actress emannuelle vaugier when all the dumb  and thats what senseless violence without any rationale is  came up i shut my eyes and turned off  tuned out same reason the old movie fight club sucked so bad glad i got my money back from the nice ticket girl at the counter  i wasnt the only one doing this not by a long shot  there was a younger couple in front of me i left and rented the well done cabin fever with gorgeous cerina vincent and i also austin powers to cheer me up from the nasty horrible taste of todd ohio univ,cruel
when i initially saw the trailer for as a trailer for saw2 which sucked worse i had very high hopes for this movie imagining a place where total depravity could be bought in eastern europe was extremely enticing and given that roth put out a movie like cabin fever with classic gross out scenes like the girl being finger banged and discovering that the bloke was fingering a hole in her leg made me think that this movie could hold some promise sadly i was seriously mistaken though this movie did sort of put out in terms of gore as well as t and a the plot story and acting sucked so hard i could hear it give me a box cutter a blowtorch some rope a baseball bat and a dv cam and i could put together a 15 minute short that would really freak you out lions gate needs to stop putting out horror movies aside from the original saw and the devils rejects and stick to making movies like crash which seems more their speed do not waste your time with this film if i could have i would have given it a 5 instead of a 1 go out and rent something like last house on the left if you want something from the horror genre that doesnt totally suck for starters,cruel
excellent as far as finally a true horror movie with a real plot and a great excitement filled edge of the seat ending but this was one movie that did not just gross me out it literally haunted me for days and days it made me think that this might actually be going on in the world somewhere and i had horrific nightmares of my family members suffering like these people did and i could not help them no movie has ever stayed with me like this one did so not a date movie or for kids under twenty five  you will never travel alone or even with one friend and you will so definitely never stay in a travel to a foreign country you will probably never do after seeing this movie all s everywhere will be bankrupt by the summer because of this movie,cruel
this movie is by far and away the worst movie i have ever seen without ever significantly developing any of the characters this movie fails to generate an atmosphere consistent with a movie about torture the film clearly lacked not just the monetary capital necessary to complete such an adventurous endeavor it lacked the intellectual capital to pull off a meaningful or even mildly entertaining film about torture moreover this abomination of a flick is too scared to actually show torture despite being marketed in such a way as to sell itself on this horrid human behavior at least such an experience would have generated some emotion in its audience the film however fails to provoke any thought capture any interest or generate any emotion in its audience overall and in all of the specifics this movie is simply awful,cruel
after the shockingly inept cabin fever nobody could have been as stunned as i was to find that is actually a very good moviefirstly roth manages to bring a surprising sense of authenticity to the story anybody who has spent anytime backpacking around europe will recognize the seemingly insane risktaking the unlikely friendships the coed dorm rooms the intensity of shortlived friendships and the very real sense of poverty resentment and depression lying just under the surface of quaint picture postcard villages in postcommunist eastern europe by hiring local actors and choosing to film on location rather than on the generic eurobacklot at universal studios roth is able to give the whole film an unusual degree of realism that lifts the film above its generic genre foundationssecondly roth purposefully avoids the usual vaguely racist clich of portraying every american as attractive funny and likable and every european as either mildly inbred or wildly pompous in the american backpackers are depicted as the arrogant and patronizing teenagers that so many of them are when paxton complains that slovakian television should carry english subtitles so visiting americans can understand it we are invited not to laugh along with him but to shake our heads at his stupidity its rare and refreshing for a mainstream teenorientated horror flick to be so derogatory against its own audiencethirdly roths screenplay isnt afraid to take its time in an age when horror films are expected to start piling up the corpses well before the end of the first reel it seems almost revolutionary to see a script harking back to the genres 1970s heyday characters are actually introduced and developed and the plot slowly and believably evolves at a refreshingly leisurely pace even the climax has an oldschool simplicity about it logical and satisfying without feeling the need for some tired twist endingperformances are universally sound but jan vlasak is brilliant as the deeply disturbed businessman traveling half a continent to secretly give expression to his sociopathic fantasies he gives us a fascinating character generating a subtlety and depth that deserved more screen timeis an excellent horror movie one of the best of recent years in grounding his story in a believable postcommunist landscape in which the villains are simply pursuing the capitalist dream of making money at any cost roth manages to make a political statement whilst cutting off toes with boltcutters and thats no small feat,cruel
there i am waiting in the theatre by my friends who i didnt really want to sit next to but am now glad for i got to see their hands hide their faces from the screen i was watching these great looking horror trailers and saw one movie preview that looked rather interesting called pulse i was getting bored with the waiting and asked my friend how many dang previews are they gonna play the movie starts then all is quiet i wasnt really expecting a good film but as it went along i began to think wow boobs boobs everywhere boobs boobs boobs and hey look more boobs and being the male i am i rather liked what i saw but i also thought well eli you sure do know how to show naked girls but do you know how to freak me out well after a few laughs from insults the characters were throwing back and forth we begin to see terror and yes the film did get somewhat scary especially if the thought of torture is something that freaks you out like ghosts or zombies there is chainsaw realtime action shots head pounding flesh sizzling drill poking eye ball snipping love for everyone so if your a kitty kat stay home but if you are gonna decide to take your head of the fluffy pink pillow with heart your crying on and start a new life as being a man going to see this film might be a good way to start you off,cruel
is one of the most genuinely horrifying films i have seen it begins by introducing us to a couple of likable open and friendly young men backpacking through europe with all the confidence and unawareness of well to do students from the center of the earth exploring the quaint folks who arent like them but they are basically decent occasionally reflective guys out for an experience they cant get or wouldnt indulge in at home they want to have a good time before committing to the proverbial gray flannel suits of careers grad school etc and so they begin in amsterdams center of sex drugs and rocknroll sex is really the major object of their quest and the first part of the film documents it all with a sort of boys eye view that keeps it interesting even alluring without quite going to porn then we have a nicely paced transformation using the odd creepy or awkward incident and the excitement of beauty and mild debauchery gradually beauty turns to ugliness and piquant exotic pleasures become dangerous until we enter a relentless hell that is pretty scary there are several neat developments that arent cheating but are nonetheless entirely unexpected the whole thing is subtly done with real acting character development and dialogue so that when bad things happen to people you care about it the backpackers are relatively little known and very talented players as are the women they meet who behave like student tourists and mysterious libertines rather than horror movie bimbos its interesting that there have been some protests about the gore because it is actually fairly limited very well contextualized and has none of the campy excess that we have come to expect from horror films in fact it is really quite unpleasant and not at all titillating or amusing moreover there is no reliance on supernatural effects or monstrous people rising for one last slashing after we thought they were dead the enemy in this one is definitely us or at least some of us and thats what makes it terrifying,cruel
way too graphic for my taste and yes it was disturbing distressing and upsetting i arrived and sat next to a couple of kids and their mom first thing on the screen were the 3 young men out looking for a good time in amsterdam smoking pot followed by scenes with strong sexual content wondering what these kids are doing here my guess the boys were less then 10years old way too young for this moviei will say i dont normal go to horror flicks i see why now dont get me wrong i think some are done very well the shining is a great example and more recent the exorcism of emily rose another good example i do go to movies every week so i figure i paid for this better sit through it in some ways the plot and acting were well done the scenes were very real in some ways to real the torture scenes were especially brutal and violent and not the things i would want any kids to see to tell the truth i didnt want to see them being that graphic its hard for me to believe that so many people are this desensitized that there is such a demand for this kind of crueltytorture its also a little untimely with us in the news bringing detainees to eastern block countries to be torturedafter leaving i found it tough to shake the brutal scenes and felt violated in some ways for sitting through it not sure why i stayed its been a long time since i walked out on a movie should have trusted my instincts and walked out,cruel
having heard that was one of the most successfully frightening and atmospheric additions to the new wave of horrorgrindhouse influenced movies i was excited to see this reading reviews online which noted people vomiting and being unable to sit through the movie comfortably only added to my expectation for a satisfying filmthe movie did not deliver on any this no cringes save for a thirdact artistic decision where the protagonist cowboys up with a gun and exacts revenge no real connection to the story and honestly two moments where i felt even a frisson of fearspoiler the first moment that worked for me was when josh comes to in the factory hooded and the viewer is provided a pov shot very atmospheric and well done the subsequent torture scene gave me hopes that the movie was going to commit to the premise and pay off after a slow build roth cuts away from moments and allows the audience to imagine the torture instead of seeing all of it a smart move if the audience is later rewarded with a scene that is truly horrific sadly we dont get to see this only flashes of other nameless characters being tortured and flogged as paxton is being taken into the factorythe second bit of business that worked was the severing of the optic nerve a nice bit of old fashioned gore where the camera doesnt back off end spoileroverall didnt engage me granted part of the fun of these movies is seeing the characters picked off and waiting for it to happen these characters with the exclusion of josh are so unlikeable you end up waiting for them to die so that the story will progress and the movie will finally be over apologists might argue that roth is taking the staples of the genre and reworking themif this is indeed the case its a tactic that does not pay offthroughout the movie the are moments where i thought the film might gain some momentum and really deliver this never happens during the opening credits i was excited to see that greg nicotero was in charge of effects makeup having recently watched land of the dead i was anticipating the possibilities of what he might deliver the makeup effects are overall ineffective and in the third act there is a remarkably unrealistic facial effect what works in a dimly lit environment in daylight reads as grotesque as a kid playing with ketchup or maybe dyed kayro syrupfor me is a fascinating failure youre presented a wellmade movie that has potential to be disturbing sadly the movie never delivers on this,cruel
the first third is porn  no lies  and the rest is sickening mindnumbing pointless tasteless trash my two friends and i all considered asking each other if the others wanted to walk out  and we love movies and i personally have never walked out or considered walking out of a movie before until this little gem we were all sick to our stomachs our day was ruined and i asked for and received my money back from the box office do not go to this movie unless you have a vendetta against all things good there was no plot motive point moral or even a remote message to take away from it if a shred of decency existed in this movie id show a fingernail of a thumbs up but alas none there was i would rather experience childbirth chronic diarrhea migraines ulcers and an album of simple plan than ever see this movie again for the rest of my days,cruel
i went and saw on the night of january 12th i thought that the movie was interesting drugs sex gratuitous blood and gore not my personal cup of tea but for a horror flick it wasnt what could be called bad but was i entertained no i went in expecting a few jumps a little blood and some flying body parts which is all standard when you consider horror film  quentin tarentino what i got was a gorefest wrapped around a thin but plausible storyline and 25 minuets of sex i personally didnt blow 20 to go see a movie that would make me nearly throw up 6 times and have me question my travel destinations for the next few years the main thing that bugged me about this movie was the fact that they used such visual depictions of the torture acts instead of using the standard panoffscreenandlistentothescreams technique to convey the message of holy crap that guy just got drilledthe whole point of this is to say it may have just been a horror film but was it entertaining in my opinion no i hope the next time that someone decides to make a film like this they keep in mind that its not the amount of blood on the screen its how many people you make scream that decides if a horror flick is good or notthe two worst parts of this whole film are as follows first is the ending where you see a great protagonist degenerate into a killer even if it is to kill the guy that killed his best friend the second is poor poor kana after seeing her torched face in a plexiglass poster cover then throwing herself infront of a train not a good thing to see this is not a movie for the weak of stomach or the faint of heart but if gratuitous blood sex and gore is your cup of tea then i say go for it,cruel
i was expecting to not be able to sleep for a week after seeing this i was expecting a blood and guts filled horror movie and what i got was basically a softcore porno with a slow moving plot no one even bothered to make sure that the movie line was followed all the way through having some of the characters do things that are against their personalitiesthen again i do tend to notice the small details so i guess some of the things that bothered me wouldnt bother everyone ellsthough if you are going to see this movie because your wanting to go see a gory horror flick you will be very disappointed and that scene thats been all over the trailers you know the one ware the toe is about to be chopped off they didnt even bother to show the actual toe coming off honestly scream three was probably better than this movie and that isnt saying muchon the upside the movie was pretty funny only problem was that it wasnt meant to be so basically if you want to waste 8 to go see an accidental comedy then go for it but if not dont worry your not missing anything,cruel
i was so excited to see i had seen previews for the past month and had read reviews saying that it was one of the most terrifying and sick movies ever made after about 45 minutes into the movie i started to wonder if i had gone into the right theater because it seemed more like i was watching a softcore porn than a horror movie even when the torturing scenes started it seemed like they kept leading you up to really gruesome scenes only to cut to a different scene as soon as it started to get good overall i very dissatisfied with this movie and disappointed in quentin tarrantinos stellar review of such a anticlimactic film,cruel
this movie was good it hit the pit of your stomach so fast once the gore began that it it doesnt need to whoa twists because the plot itself is so baffling in itself that your completely engulfed in this movie yeah the acting isnt great all though with all the nudity who would notice the sets are amazing especially the torture chambers whew they were great frightening to the core if only the classic halloween haunted house could resemble these sets i would stand in line for 2 hours for every house every year this movie was definitely worthy my money and the fact that the theater was filled with screaming 17 year olds well it just added to the scream factor,cruel
i recently saw the film hoping for some terrifying film that lived up to both the hype and appearance of the trailers and the publicity i am sad to say it does not accomplish either of these things the gore that is so over the top is for the most part off screen and only implied the plot is simply a device to put people is situations of terror which simply arent terrifying enough to make this movie worth watching id even like to say that this movie is so bad its worth the laugh but it simply is not the first half runs with the plot depth of an average dirty movie the second half seems to only be the setting for the torture of the stars of the film this film is truly awful cabin fever was enjoyable and i had hoped that this directors follow up would be worth the watch but sadly it just seems to fall somewhere below what saw and saw ii have presented in recent years which really isnt saying much,cruel
i was born in the 70s i began watching horror films at about the age of 8 of course horror films are scary when you are that young no matter what they are but then i grew up and began watching those same films over again and to an extent they were still scary those were the films from the 70s and early 80s leatherface will always incite that incessant trepidation in me how can he not texas chainsaw massacre is one of the all time greats and i dont really think another film can duplicate the raw intensity of that film there were others of course and anyone who knows me even slightly knows that last house on the left is what i consider to be the most disturbing film ever made horror films the good ones that is can affect you in ways that other films cant they get inside you does that it is a nightmarish film that takes a grim look at the underbelly of society there is no other way to put it this film is scary because of what happens in it but it is even scarier because what happens could be truelike any typical horror film everything is great in the beginning josh and paxton and their icelandic nomad are in europe seeking out all the best parties and the best women they are in heaven at first as the women and drugs and parties are as abundant as they first heard and then they meet another man their age who tells about a city in slovakia where the women are better than you could imagine our three adventure seekers are off the slovakia and upon entering the they meet two half naked women in their shared quarters clubs drinking drugs and sex ensues this is paradise what could be better up until now the pacing of the film is fast and furious there is enough character development and eye candy to please those waiting for the horror and the horror is never far off the interesting thing about a film like this is that even though the naked women and the bongs and the festive atmosphere is abundant to the viewer there is always that pernicious overtone that feeling that something isnt quite right you can attribute that to knowing whats coming up or to the fact that the marketing for this film including the trailer is very effective for me i knew this happy atmosphere that the boys were a part of was going to end and that scared me one friend goes missing and then the plot gets twisted he doesnt leave them a message as to where hes going who hes with or an explanation as to why he left the two boys are leery of this but decide to stay in the one more night to have a bit more fun big mistakeby now the film had me intrigued and when the torture scenes finally happen although the gore wasnt as graphic as i expected the situations that are presented and how everything transpires is enough to scare the hell out of you what is bothersome is that these situations while ostensibly fictional are in fact completely realistic and utterly possible just like last house on the left had three would be regular people doing heinous things to two innocent teenage girls this film is almost more macabre in the sense that it explores an element to the human psyche that enjoys the kill it seeks the thrill of inflicting pain the scariest thing about this is the notion there are people that are so sick so depraved and so inhumane that they actually have to pay to inflict bodily harm to others far fetched hardly look at the news from any given city in the world and youll see the heinous and disgusting things that people do to one another this film is disturbing because it is a reflection of society no an aberration im not saying that the majority of people want to be able to pay to murder someone but what i am saying is the realm of possibility is there that in itself is about as scary as you can geteli roth is imaginative he is a visionary and he is adept at exploring the darker side of humanity cabin fever was a great horror film a little off the wall but quite disturbing is a work of art it is as close to the 70s style of guts on the wall horror as you can get in todays horror climate i was terrified watching the film and at the end by the end of the film when you are screaming for revenge roth even gives you what you want is a brilliant film as much as i love movies like scream and sixth sense the true gusto of horror has also been omnipotent in recent months with films like saw 2 wolf creek and high tension is better than the rest it builds the tension and then boils to the point where the horror is almost too real this is a very effective horror film and i look forward to the sequel1010 a truly terrifying masterpiece,cruel
i liked for the most part i expected a saw ripoff but i was glad that they altered the plot to not make it into another serial killer movie with that said it is pretty violent however amazingly i still think it wasnt too gory afterwards probably because ive seen my fair share of movies like these audition cat iiiyes its predictable silly in some parts but in horror movies that goes with the territory in this day and age after a million horror movies have been released over the past thirty years its hard to be shocking or original anymore the acting was ok the plot good the twists ok as well for me the second half of the film saves it they even managed to add some humor to it i have to admit as well when the american tourists who is still alive goes on his revenge spreed the audience i saw it with loved itespecially well youll see spoilerswell the plot gives a lot away a couple of horny american guys go aboard to europe and find the hotel where they think theyre fantasies will come trueenter natalya and svetland the local sluts who in fact are part of the torture ring in which they get paid for their servicespaxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson are too naive to see whats going and when they get drunk they fall for the trapjosh is tortured brutally as with all the other victims in the slaughterhousethere were some memorable images paxtons tour of sorts inside this asylum is very creepy especially when he sees that this bastards clearly are getting a sick satisfaction of doing thishe escape by sheer luck  and thus his revenge takes place hernandez is good in this although theres not too much character development his revenge is pretty well played out thoughiam sure we might see more blood and mayhem on a dvd cut but for now is a pretty entertaining but perverse little flickit was as quentin and roth admit filmed on a low budget and it shows but they do manage to use that to an advantage setting up some creepy shots and delivering the goods when the movie calls for itit aint that bad of a movie quentin did produce it so it aint too bad now theres word of a possible 2 interesting stuff i would recommend but be warned of the content,cruel
i saw this movie and it was fun to watch now people complain about the acting i didnt expect great acting because based on the trailer i was anticipating a slashersurvival type film so what mindset do you go with why friday the 13th elm street or texas chainsaw massacre of course the character development was decent at best sure there is still lots to be desired as to why the elite hunting was formed and the background behind that theres also the mystery of what happened to the dutch businessman who wanted to be a surgeon however the story is still solid the torture wasnt as intense in the scenes like i was hoping but the psychological impact definitely can be felt when watching this proof how bout on some parts i actually had some chills that tells you something the kids attacking the car was sort of cool because it reminds you of the classic film children of the corn the kids are their own posse and will do anything to satisfy themselves its almost like a parallel to the elite hunting the people that work there want money to torture people the kids want simple bubblegum or coins and they are willing to jump the elite hunters sorry had that reaction about that scene after reading a comment by someone who felt that scene didnt make sense the pay off for the whole thing was great too it all comes full circle in the end this film did a solid job at pointing out how society is today many people love sex and drugs and arent responsible enough for their wellbeing then there are some people who are responsible but get belittled by partyanimals because they arent as hardcore as them there was some great symbolism of the old saying nice guys finish last the proof here was josh not making it the greed in society was portrayed here as people were willing to do anything for money those people were the ones who didnt care about the lives of the others in the torture chamber so to speak it shows that bribery in society can work and people can be easily brainwashedi think usage of flashbacks for the elite hunting and the dutch businessman wouldve helped this movie more other than that no complaints here as this was a fun little roller coaster ride once everyone got to slovakia,cruel
for the record i am a fan of cabin fever you can say what you will but i felt the film was funny and gory as hell so of course my anticipation was pretty high for the release of considering all the crap people were talking about his debut i was hoping eli would silence all of the naysayers once and for all man was i wrong this film wasnt anything i was expecting i was hoping for some sick sadistic demented film and what i got was the exact opposite the first hour was nothing but the word fuq and copious amounts of boobsnot that there is anything wrong with either it just felt as if some kid was in charge of the entire first act of the film and he was showcasing his immaturity then people start to disappearing and waking up handcuffed to a chair in some dingy looking dungeon while a stranger starts hacking away at them not a bad premise for a film at all but the film was poorly executed and the gore was held to a bare minimum the fulciesquire eye scene was the only cool part of this so called horror film good luck next time eli,cruel
i just got back from watching couple of friends and i went on the premise that it would be along the lines of saw and saw 2 i actually enjoy gore movies a good portion of my movie collection has some level of gore in it psycho thrillers are definitely a favorite so why on earth did i hate this movie because it has no plot and serves to satisfy only two cravings that for gratuitous nudity and copious amounts of blood gore and psycho guys doing the blooding and goring the feeble attempts at creating a plot are strung along with these weak characters that i have no connection withindeed it does make one want to vomit or at the very least turn your stomach for that alone i give this 2 stars i am sadly disappointed that quentin tarantino had anything to do with this movie it is not his caliber of film hopefully this is an anomaly that will never happen againmy recommendation skip this film let fall into the annals of time as nothing more than a stain,cruel
not going to give the movie away but this had everything i wanted to see in a gory  scary type of movie if you have seen saw had everything saw didnt saw fooled you into thinking it was going to be shocking and it was not this movie  is going to be hard to beat the movie coming out see no evil looks like it could be good but only time will tell if makes 40 or 50 million i hope eli roth puts out something else like its about time somebody had the balls to put out a great movie like this rob zombie had something going with his movie house of a 1000 corpse but then he failed with the devils rejects eli dont make a devils reject for your follow up movie you need to take to the next levelsh,cruel
first of all some people that have given this movie bad reviews on this site are people that like to see visual gore like in braindead which is extremely laughable by the wayis more psychological than visual in order to feel the terror you have to imagine that you are part of it for example imagine if you are paxton strapped in that chair with that german man revving the chainsaw right in front of your face now that is complete terror especially because of the stuff that paxton sees when he is being dragged to the roommany people complain about the nudity and there is a good amount however that is what makes this realistic i know many people that want to go to europe to look for women and smoke it is something many adolescents want to do and i thought that these characters were extremely realistic in that aspect the nudity sets the tone and makes the torture even more horrifying because of the humorous tone during the first halfi read a review with the writer not knowing why paxton went back to save the japanese girl well if you paid attention during the movie you would have heard paxton talk to josh and telling him about a traumatizing experience he had when he was kid with another kid drowning and him not doing anything about itand constantly waking up with screaming sounds of the mother of the drowning childanother person did not know how paxton knew that the dutch businessman was part of it at the end well that man was the first room he saw when he entered the art exhibit and he saw the dutch man clearly dissecting another body josh i believeanyway this movie was amazing and had me very excited at the end the movie theater i was in started clapping when it ended and the movie deserved it you really feel for the characters because you can relate to them josh reminded me of my friend eric and oli was the hilarious horny dude everyone knowsoverall the art exhibit is very creepy and the killers are even creepier once again is movie is more psychological than visual and i think that makes it even scarier braindead was a comedy with a bunch of cheesy gore if you want to see a very good horror movie with enough gore go see you will not be disappointed kb,cruel
oh how excited i was to see the promise of a good nasty throwback to the 70s exploitation flicks of yesteryear the promise of terror and brutality up there on the big screen clawing the audiences eyes out while we keep a nice safe distance free to shield ourselves and whimper in fearoh and quentin tarantino was involved so you know it has to be edgy and unique apparently and landie dearie me folks the biggest reaction the film got from the audience was when  in one scene  pulp fiction happened to be on television i dont think anyone would have bothered with this movie if the title hadnt been under tarantinos name in the previews going in to see id already seen cabin fever eli roths first outing into gorehorrorslapstickwhatever cinema and i loved it absolutely loved it i loved it in that way that any movie that is so damn weird and entertaining deserves to be lovedcoming out of i wish i had stayed home and rented cabin feveri went with two friends meg and alan alan is a huge fan of movies in general and cabin fever specifically meg hails from hiroshima and after a lifetime of japanese horror flicks she has developed quite an appetite for scary movies i just like to have a good timewe were all pretty disappointedthe first half of was absurd for anyone under the age of 14 who really really really likes to masturbate the first hour of will be bliss i assure you i have never seen so much nudity in one sitting outside of a porno flick at least and i cringe to think that i may ever ever encounter a naked woman ever again in my entire life because has pretty much broken me of ever wanting to see that so dare i say it but way too many boobies kidswe are handed a few characters and by virtue of the fact that theyre on the screen were expected to care about them unfortunately that doesnt really work and so all we have to get us through this movie are some people on the screen with whom we cant relate and for whom we feel no real attachment the absurdity of these people and how little it was that we cared about them pretty much boils down to the fact that alan was far more interested in the loud guy sitting behind him as was i and meg kept asking me what the japanese characters in the film were saying because they were speaking gibberish with incredibly phony and  meg informed us  incredibly offensive accents tlain we go to tlain station indeed the japanese people on the screen didnt sound anything like the japanese person sitting next to me i find myself wondering now how many european cultures roth was able to alienate through similar ignorance there are a lot of accents in so after all the sex and boobies and drinking are out of the way some of the characters get killed we see some good special effects and some terrible special effects but we really dont care in the least we sit through a few scenes that are supposed to be tense or humorous or both but theyre just dull and then the movie endsherein lie the spoilersthings i have learned from watching 1 women are there for one reason and one reason only sex this includes your mothers and sisters if you cant bang em theyre useless to you dont forget that 2 homosexuality is evil and easily equivocated with brutal torture much like haute tension in that respect 3 if you give children gum they will mercilessly kill for you even though you cant explain to them what you want because you dont speak their language 4 people really really really like to text message during movies a lot 5 it is necessary to operate in absolute secret to seduce and kidnap people to sell them to an underground snuff club even though every single person for miles around including the police are perfectly aware of said underground snuff club and it really isnt all that secret in the least 6 if you lose an eye escape certain death and are on your way to freedom you will commit suicide because at the last moment you discover that youve lost an eye and are  we can only assume  ugly and unfit to live so you might as well dive in front of the nearest locomotive this only applies to women who are only good for sex disfigured men can go about their lives as usual 7 you can sucker audiences into watching anything so long as you hype it enoughand with regards to number 7 this seems to be the perfect perfect example of a movie being overhyped i have never seen such a packed theater and at the same time i have never seen so many bored viewers nothing captivating happens during its impossible to care about the characters and after the first hour of nudity and debauchery theres no room left to tell a real story the concept is spectacular but it wasnt given any room to movei was hoping to feel upset or disturbed by or to at least have something to think about after seeing the movie the only lingering thought that quickly faded was yeah europeans hate americans and water is wet what else you got all that i felt even the next day was that i better write to the distributor and demand my money back so that i can give it to the guy who was sitting behind alan now that guy was the real entertainment,cruel
let me preface this post by saying that i was really really excited to see this movie a gorefilled horror movie stamped with quentin tarantinos approval as a presenter sounded pretty good opening weekend 930 show sold out 1030 footballfieldlongline we waited anyway ill cut to the chase i thought the film was poorly written poorly acted for the most part and just poorly done in general it left nothing to the imagination and there was simply nothing interesting about it as far as gore is concerned if thats all your looking for saw and saw ii blow out of the water if it wasnt for the pair of gorgeous russian girls that rarely have clothes on this would have been a total bust the first words out of my roommates mouth upon exiting the theater were why the hell did you want to see that i spent the rest of the night explaining why i thought it sounded like it would be a great movie and buying them beers to compensate for the disappointment was a huge let down sorry folks,cruel
i dont even know where to begin is in short a great idea that is revealed slowly with a lot of nudity and humor along the way eli roth knows how to film breasts just as well as he does gore and horror but is this a horror movie it reminded me of the wicker man in that the first half and the second half were so radically different and instead of being scared i was more physiologically invested in the characters and scenarios than anything else the 3 males are all likable and your standard frat guys which is important to make this a universal this could be you situation for all the this should be nc17 talk i was hearing it really wasnt that bad  and the torture scenes werent as gratuitous as i had been led to believe the 95 minutes felt much more full and structured than recent outings like saw ii and i like most the audience clapped when it came time for the movie to end on a note of revenge  the american way i came to get shocked and i left shocked at how good the film actually was very respectable to its genre while paving new way for the future,cruel
i can say this muchif i was given the chance to take the script and rewrite most of itthis would be an amazing movie but im sorry to say it was so bad i have so many thoughts about the movie that can make it goodthey just did it halfass i was expecting to see something more amazing than saw and saw ii which i thought were brilliantly made moviesthe plots of those movies were incredible acting wasnt really good but that really didnt matter on the other hand was just not goodany time theres humor in the movie thats supposed to have gore and blood then its not good i love movies and i know moviesand this was not a good movie and for me to not like a movie then it must be bad,cruel
let me start by saying that i love quentin tarantino i feel that everything he has made or put his name to has been outstanding however eli roth has never impressed me at all cabin fever had to have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen with that said does not do much of a better jobthis movie was not only boring but it took crude sex scenes to a new level i can understand your standard b horror having an obligatory ta shot along with the local tramp being had in a random place but this was ridiculous there was sex and no violence for a very large percentage of the movie nothing exciting happened at all until the last 20 minutes and even that was done in a way that was annoying i have seen it before and am not really interested in seeing again come up with something new if your going to promote a movie this wellmy short and sweet recommendation is to wait till this comes out on cable so you can do something else until the excitement happens i have never left a movie theatre before a movie ended but i was very temped this time,cruel
i love horror films i love thrillers as this film had a little of both it didnt have much of anything else well other than breastsi went into this film not expecting much especially after cabin fever but i was even less impressed than i expected eli seems to go for nudity drugs and shock value as his methods of entertaining and story telling he doesnt seem to have much depth to his stories the two main actors of the film did a fantastic job with what they were given but i just wish they were given morei found the movie to be very predictable with knowing who would turn out to be who and what some one would do but there was no real twist or point to the story and as much as i was wishing it to end i felt it did not have much of one when it finally camei know eli has a few projects in the works including comedy i just hope that he begins making smarter films or he may face a direct to video career his direction is great but his writing is lacking,cruel
dont believe the hype but that aside this was a great scary grotesque sexy film the direction was awesome and the acting superb yes there was about a half hour of nice then the hell begins the next step is for someone to do a film almost beginning to end pure scary horror and suspense like a roller coaster ride thru a haunted house there is a lot of sex and loads of bloody violence eli roth is a very sick in a good way dynamic and insightful director the premise is very haunting yet very realistic makes you wonder what became of europe after the fall of communism the level of human cruelty is explored to the extreme beginning with the lure of sex and independence great film good bloody rip roaring screaming ectasy,cruel
this movie is a terribly painful disappointment i am not a tarantino fan at all but i gave this movie the benefit of the doubt considering the fact that i thoroughly enjoyed saw i and ii and eli roth is rumored to direct the third one i think the only reason tarantino tied himself to this movie is due to the fact that it is ridiculously gorythe first half of the movie was terrible its just a bunch of stupid kids doing drugs and screwing chicks in europe on top of the lack of story the acting was so horrible my friends and i could not stop laughing surethe acting in saw wasnt great either but this was just far too ridiculous to take seriously then came the gore i thought the gore was not only sadistic but pointless and fake i was waiting for this movie to redeem itself just a little bit but it never happened my friends and i were tempted to ask for our money backso when it comes down to it see if you only care about the glorification of excess but if youre looking for a gory movie thats not mindless and involves true suspense and has a point stick to saw and avoid this movie like the plague,cruel
tarantinos name holds a lot of power this is because he is an incredible filmmaker whose taste in movies is clearly shown through his works based on this people can easily tell if they enjoy the same types of things as he does mainly violent sadistic ones he obviously loves classic horror with this in mind putting his stamp of approval on by cocreating the concept and using his own money on distribution is making a bold claim when he paid for hero to be released in the states he became a force to be reckoned with no one will argue tarantinos taste is a horror movie i mean this in the most straightforward way after an admittedly intentionally bland and typical opening half hour the film is horrific and hyperrealistic you are terrified and exhilarated realizing that the movie is not just commenting on torture but about us  the audience who pays to watch this torture on the screen and get so much enjoyment out of it even if it is purely from the endorphins and adrenaline however it does not condescend no cheap one liners no uwe boll action sequences torture death and a boatload of fear thank you eli roth for reminding us why we go to horror movies i enjoyed cabin fever but now i respect you as one of the great horror directors of this time,cruel
alright so i went into with high expectations the clips that have surfaced took my want and need factor up about 10 notches and i was fully prepared for opening night the movie started and didnt go directly into anything the story was there the fleshed out characters were and the eventual gore i wont go into it spoiling anything but i loved it the shots were great good music good camera movements and great acting you really feel bad for all of them i recommend it but not for the weak four people left separately during the movie and a lot of ewwwn came from the audience excellent job eli you did it again people just dont see your films for what they are,cruel
when i went to this movie i had seen the trailer and knew pretty much what i was getting into i knew that this movie would be disgustingit starts off slowly introducing the characters and i must sayas an icelander the character of li is so like any other typical icelandic male that age that i have a hard time believing that the character was written by eli rothi dont want to spoil anything but what i love about this movie is how raw it is there are no twists or anything like thatthis is just plain and simple which is what makes this movie so disgusting and so coolso i recommend that you see this movie if you have the guts,cruel
writerdirector eli roth  cabin fever  and producer quentin tarantino  reservoir dogs  pulp fiction  team up to create a sick fetish from underground and deliver more disturbing images then saw and audition combined  although the film had potential i feel as if the director focused more on blood and vicious violence then a complete story  the main characters played there role as they were intended to but the plot fell downwards half way through i can honestly say that the blood and gore saved the movie if it wasnt for the madness beyond the walls of terror this film would have been nothing more then another 8 dollars down the drain eli roth does very well know how to get people to squirm in there seats but needs to improve on developing a storyline more then blood and guts thrown in your face ,cruel
eli roths film has been hyped as the scariest movie in a decade with tarantino attached seemingly only for marketingpromotional reasons and rave expectations since his previous cabin fever its not the directors fault that this film has been pumped to the nth degree with the success of the saw films and the jhorror flicks in the past several years we eagerly awaited this fresh concept based on true eventspaxtor hernandex and josh richardson are two young americans backpacking through europe focusing less on the culture and more on the booze drugs and women predictably the characters are foils paxton as the brash egotistical type a and josh as the more quiet reflective justbrokeupwiththegirlfriend sidekick they meet oli gudjonsson an easygoing partyanimal from iceland together they enjoy the sights scene and sex of amsterdamone night they meet alex silhavecky who tells them of a city in slovenia that is filled with women if thats what they want alex shows them digital photos of him and gorgeous naked beautiesthe bait has been shown and the fish are hookedpaxton josh and oli go to the recommended by alex but the trip is initially depressing and they are somewhat hesitant seemingly their luck changes when they arrive at the a charming building which houses the three with two buxom flirts natalya and svetlana who invite them to the spa and out dancingthe next morning after a night of bliss is when things start to go awryroth manages to get us to this point in the film about twenty minutes in without much effort the characters are stale and one dimensional and the americanasignoranttourist is overplayed later paxtons ability to speak german is misused to give this idealogical conflict some meat unfortunately roth is too methodical during the gruesome torture scenes and continues to try and use the characters to send a message about americanscapitalismwhile the concept is strong the story plays out a bit amateurish the tension is fleeting and we only wish the torture scenes could be longer not for the blood but to push the envelope of what these people are doing its unfortunate that we know very little from the torturers sides they are just masks theres no twists as to whos good and whos bad its fairly obvious as each character is introduced as who will end up being a friend or foeas a second film for roth its a good start as for the hype forget about it and just enjoy it for what it is a pretty good horror flick hopefully roth will forget about the hitchcocklike directing and just focus on the inyourface scare next time,cruel
i didnt enjoy this movie much  everything for me seemd unrealistic and so false evem how they played for example one that butchers who wanted to kill paxton what the hack was that part  he dont wanted that guy to choke from his vomit but he wanted to cut him yeah really makes sense and everything around even looks so much false what is the point to kill by nationality  even if you are working for the black market  okey i understand that they are hunting and butchering all of them like animals but and searching for russians europians or americans but why took then japanese girls  what for  there was no point for me to understand the logic of that horrible actionsif you are in black market and you are butchering them for selling there organs you need to cut them carefully not to damage all organs and make so much blood because you will need every part of it even that blood so for me this movie was very unrealistic,cruel
this movie is soooo gross the eye scene puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it blech so much excessive horror nastiness sick as heck but just hard not to watch throw in the gorgeous women and youve got a disgustingly beautiful horror flicki loved the oli character  the king of swing  of course my horse and the gang of young boys that want gum so weird i also liked the whole europeaness of the film  the location language and overall feel of it lent a big piece of realism to it allmy negative rant is that i wanted to know more about the town and the people and the why of it all i know money is partmost of it but i wanted to know why,cruel
is a mystery horror movie in which we watch a group of friends traveling around europe with their backpacks while they are in amsterdam they meet a person who tells them about a somewhere in eastern europe close to bratislava where all the girls are crazy about tourists and especially for american men so they are going there but everything is too good to be true and soon everything will change for themi liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and many scenes with suspense which kept me alert for the most duration of it i also liked the direction of eli roths and i believe he did a great job on it i also liked the interpretations of jay hernandez who played paxton and jan vlask who played as a dutch businessman i believe that either you watch this movie alone or with company you are going to have a great time since the suspense is in the most out finally i have to say that surprised me in a good way because it is a horror movie that combines very well horror scenes with mystery its an interesting movie with many twists and i believe that you arent going to waste your time watching it i believe that if you are a fan of horror movies you are going to love it but if you are not then its good to reconsider watching this movie,cruel
eli roth is a frontrunner in horrors underground the only reason he is not as big or as admired as wes craven or john carpenter is because roth relies only on blood the story is a last minute thing and the addition of nudity is immature fun but his number one thing is blood three years before this he did the horrorcomedy bloodbath cabin fever i used to like cabin fever when i was a teenager but then i grew up is not much of a step upor downthe year before was released the brilliant horror movie saw was released saw like is a tortureporn gorefest difference is saw has good acting and brains s goal was not to capitalize on the success of saw thats just roths style capitalizing on its success is just something that happenedthe storyline is heavily cliched two american friends backpack across europe with their icelandic friend in amsterdam the trio get involved in tons of sex and drugs the acting by everyone is bad and the orgies are not enjoyable these people delivered their lines awfully or if there was no spark of originality or fun usually explicit sex and drugs amp things up not herethen the movie switches gears the icelandic one goes missing then the movie turns to a thriller this gear switching gives some hope we find out theres a crew of people that snatch up tourists and torture them the torture is what the trilogy is known for unfortunately it does not work here the question that lingers in everyones mind is why what on earth in the point of these people kidnapping the tourists and dissecting them in saw it was a game and jigsaw was basically a monster but there is really no point in why these people perform these grotesque acts providing a clear answer instantly would have made this a betterliked film and its really too bad because roth does not dive into the horror right away remember in halloween when carpenter waited before michael myers was clearly seen roth does the same thing but too much negatives around it diminished this good qualitythe final act makes this movie worth watching do yourselves a favour and just skip to when jay hernandez gets kidnapped he tries to make an escape and its pretty exciting not perfect but still much better than the rest of itin a movie with no point and really bad acting an enjoyable final act prevents from being a piece of trash24,cruel
it wasnt the worst horror movie ive ever seen but but very far from good most of the movie is just porn with some stupid clueless characters that make you even care less about the movie then the story itself the idea of rich paying to kill other people just for entertainment wasnt bad for a movie but it wasnt really new either the horror scenes were exaggerated like in any other slasher movie they were even disgusting besides the fact that the movie doesnt really have any story but they dont explain anything and how can this business work without any missing reports etcbut the thing that really bothered me about this movie was what americans think about eastern europe they think that europe is just a playground for them they think they can do whatever they want if they pay for it they think that womens are just falling out of the sky for them doing whatever to please them and the idea that slovakia is this country with no laws where people go missing are killed for no reason and that the authorities dont do anything about it is just revolting they show us that people in slovakia would do anything for money and that they have no morals but thats not how it works slovakia like other eastern europe countries is an excommunist one but that doesnt make them prostitutes pimps thieves etc iam very dissapointed about how racist this movie isagain not the worst horror movie it has the killings it has the terror it has blood sex and the survivior guy but thats pretty much everything that the movie has yes some people may be crazy enough to pay to kill other people and that is very upsetting but the movie didnt focus on what could have been good but they only exploited nudity how medieval eastern europes people are are exaggerated gore,cruel
ive watched vacancy 2007 recently it was really an amazing movie after that i did some researches for movies such as vacancy so i found 2005 as a recommendation but unfortunately it was entirely as a porn movie full up with nudity sex drugs nonsense in fact after 30 minutes i couldnt continue so i just gave up and played another one if you looking for a horror movie even a real movie youre in the wrong spot,cruel
there was a partial joy considering that man like quentin tarantino offered some help around the movie but that was not enough to save eli roths movie from a disaster that it is journey around the europe is going really good but one bad decision will change it all and that decision is next place that they will visit paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson came all the way from usa to see europe and pick up a friend alongside on journey oli eybor gudionsson after having ton of fun in amsterdam they are persuaded to travel to town near bratislava and there will horror for them and horror for audience start there was a constant growth of tension and seeing them party and enjoy themselves it started to fell a little boring considering we are watching 130 horror movie with 45 minutes of story telling without horror on sight then after oli disappears it was obvious something is wrong and he are flashed with his head on stick giving us sense of what might come actually there was some hope for the movie until horror came on sight and it was the funniest and the lousiest horror from a minimal budget movies without real horror and without any anticipation at all every scene inside old factory building is badly placed horribly shot and directed that it looks like some comedy that that turned bad but is still funny nice try to make an horror movie with some story behind but considering how ridiculous it looks and even something like this that was put to people to see is offending to horror genre because of its bad and not scary or terrifying or horrible or at least fearfulness scenes it looks like a homemade badly written movie and it was supposed to end even before it started 154,cruel
i sat through this movie with a guy after i stupidly suggested we watch something scary i meant paranormal not entirely predictable but anyways so basically the plot is these guys go on a trip and then decide to go to this random ass little town that looks sketchy as hell because some skinny drugged up looking scary kid tells them of all the beautiful women who are pretty much sex starved for american men it sounds like the beginning of porn right wellits a trap so anyways the men pay to murder guys at this place and the women are just the way to lure the stupid men in to their death and then almost all the characters die if you like gore you might like this movie though you can put all deeper meanings behind it as well i guess i meanit wasnt my cup of tea,cruel
i saw this movie a few years ago but its one of those movies that you can hardly forget i love horror movies but im more afraid of what is cleverly suggested than with what i see explicitly so this movie is not the kind of movie i prefer the action revolves around a group of three north american travelers who are making the traditional backpacking trip to europe that immense teenagers or preuniversity students do the recipe is the usual drink testosterone little brain and huge desire for sex and light drugs they go to slovakia where they are looking for a advertised as the ideal place to find all this but they end up wrapping themselves in a criminal and dangerous web where they are the flies from here the film is basically a torture session capable of making the spanish inquisitors want to take notes in a notepadwe can then understand that the most serious problem of this film is the absence of a credible and wellconstructed story behind the horror scenes the script is built on gore graphic violence is an end in itself another problem a direct consequence of this is the poor construction of the characters who are just stupid teenagers who deserve to die in the film because the public does not care about them never mind the names of the actors there are no sounding names they would not risk their career in such a movie they are meat to the slaughter eli roth the director  screenwriter must have a distorted conception of what horror movies are but in any case the film has a specific audience and roth was entirely capable of meeting their expectations special and visual effects are a fundamental part of the most soulless scenes and were done with great attention to detailthis is a movie inappropriate for popcorn as i say for joke it is sadistic and shocking arresting public attention for explicit violence it is not a movie that is suitable for most people they would think it is too visual too disgusting to bear but fans of gore and pure and tough violence will love it,cruel
this was an excellent movie with highest points for its realism re eastern europe other than the obviously contrived horror premise  to some who have reviewed it though i saylighten up geeeez louise its a freaking horror flick not a social commentary men are horny everywhere and are successful with women if they are rich  good looking or successful when women are poor those willing to pay get a pass its not un pc its a facttwo americans and one icelander travel to europe  their plans of fun and frolic go a rye when they run into some eastern euro beauties who seem too good to be true turns out they are they are hanging out in the nude in a sauna with them laughing at their corny jokes and being way too friendly every guy knows though from experience  chicks this hot who are this easy  itll cost yathe chicks turn out to be more than they bargain for escapades include a tour of a scary burnt out old factory a euro disco with techno zak and a local bar with torture on the menu of course the film includes the required rich guys who are greedy and evil but their lust goes beyond material things was it john waters divine who asked who wants to die for the sake of art for the artsy crowd there is an actual performance art show to delight i wont be a spoiler but suffices to say that the hot chicks turn the tables on the dudes most horror movies are too cheesy and too predictable this one is not cheesy its high end filming in addition it has some good twists it is not a 10 because it languishes a bit toward the end a little heavy on the gore light on story line but all guys know we pay one way or another maybe we dont have it so bad,cruel
in europe to party several us backpackers and a local guide get wind a special club where theyll get more than theyve ever bargained for when they realize the disturbing and terrifying secret behind the clubs operation and try to find of getting away alivethis was a massively disappointing effort one of the films main flaws is that theres way too much time spent away from its actual destination in the titular torture room and as a result its pacing is just way too problematic in the first half its at least twenty minutes before they even get wind of the idea of going to the country theres a big search through the city to find the place and takes another halfhour after that before any sort of onscreen torture occurs leaving its torture scenes which are the main body of the film until almost an hour in thats way too long for the film to get to its big spot and its beginning is just boring and really hard to sit through the few attempts at suspense with the disappearing members dont have much in them as nothing is played up there and that theres way too much wandering around with obviously shady characters is just eating up time that could be better spent on the real reason to see the film theres even several problems with the torture scenes in this one is that theres hardly any of them in the film theres three that amount to a total of five minutes of screentime which is really infuriating and with the exception of one sequence none of the violence is done onscreen and theres just aftereffects which really narrows the violence down significantly the last huge flaw in the torture scenes is that theres more kills and violence away from them than there are in the scenes the three torture scenes amount to one death and two escapes yet theres a halfdozen away from them and that really devalues the mystique and aura this has when one sequence easily tops anything done in the titular these here are what really holds this one back though theres a really great sequence from timetotime that here is mainly due to the final half in the torture buildings as the main torture scene does have a really chilling quality to it due to the unexpected in a dark unknown location and the sight of watching them get tortured with being prodded poked and sliced up or even showing fingers getting sliced off with a chainsaw isnt that bad what happens to the third torture victim is easily the best which looks great and doesnt feel fake at all which is a great scene in itself which helps to really make it quite the gruesome moment likewise the last part of the film is its best as its where theres a couple of big action scenes in some fine chases to get out of the facility and generates some more bloody deaths the last big plus is that theres a nice helping of nudity from the cast which is never a bad thing to behold this though is a massively disappointing and boring filmrated r extreme graphic language extreme graphic violence full nudity several sex scenes and heavy drug use,cruel

a bloodandguts horror film made by a horror fan for horror fans thats probably the most fitting description i can come up with for this movie which i had low expectations for surprisingly it turned out to be a very hardhitting horrorcumthriller with plenty to recommend it eli roth who first bloodied himself with cabin fever works with a low budget but brings style verve and atmosphere to his film which benefits from some excellent eastern european locations to add to the authenticity yep this film is shot in the same places that van damme and seagal now shoot all of their filmsthe film starts off in euro trip territory as two american jocks and an insane icelander eythor gudjonsson playing oli who is excellent and steals all his scenes go around boozing doing drugs and having sex with lots of beautiful women indeed the first half of this film is chockfull of attractive beauties who are willing to bare all for the camera roth builds up the tension with some eerie location shooting this is a place with rundown streets and buildings and packs of kids going around mugging people the music is oldfashioned but extremely suspenseful really adding to the sense of isolated horror when the torture scenes come in the films second half i was pleased to see that they were short and more powerful because of that roth shows plenty without giving too much away and youll really be wincing when a guy gets his legs drilled there is one particular sequence involving an eyeball that goes way beyond the bounds of good taste into pure grossout territory and i could have done without that one but but everywhere else the violence has a point and is deeply unsettlingthe acting is pretty strong from the cast with the exception of the annoying derek richardson jay hernandez starts off as a typical jock character but he grows on you throughout the film and it turns out hes actually a damn fine actor i hope to see him go far the rest of the cast are authentic foreigners and standouts include the pair of beautiful girls the american businessman the german surgeon weirdo and of course jan vlasak as the dutch businessman who is extremely psychoticthe latter third of this film gets really good turning into your typical revengestyle thriller with lots of chasing and violent death roth pumps up the adrenaline so that you end up cheering the hero on willing him to escape from the bad guys seriously when i came out of the cinema i was so pumped up i was ready to beat anyone who looked at me funny its that kind of film roth certainly knows how to please the crowd after making them wince so when the good guys turn the tables on the bad the film becomes sheer perfection all in all its uneven but strong realistic quite disturbing and unpleasant throughandthrough i recommend it for those with strong enough stomachs,cruel
one of my friends talked about shed want to watch movies by eli roth but they are so full of gore she couldnt stand it then another friend mention she liked i was torn between two options id watch with the chance i might throw up or worse or not watch it and feel like i missed out on something i took the chance of throwing up but i didntfirst of all it takes quite a while before all the torturing starts and thats magnificent because the opening credits hint of violence so even if youd watch this movie without knowing anything about it you know something horrible is about to happen but it doesnt happen right away and you just have to follow these three guys being gross and annoying and youre just wondering when the torturing is going to start and the longer it goes on the more frustrating it is you want the violence to start so you can get it over with the waiting is the most frustrating part about it and eli roth handles that wonderfully the characters of this movie are annoying they are very gross and to be honest during the start of the movie i was hoping theyd all die and i didnt like them at any point of the movie they were the typical characters in a horror movie you want to yell at them because they dont see the imminent danger ahead of them still i didnt want them to be tortured to death so during the most suspenseful part i was on the edge of my seat hoping theyd survive all that about the suspenseful parts wow they were so thrilling i dont think ive ever been that thrilled while watching a horror movie the suspense was killing me it was so excellently written and shot wowi will always praise horror movies for their dialogue especially in the beginning the dialogue is so ordinary because nothing horrible is happening yet its real its the kind of dialogue you hear every day and i love it because while all the torture is going down how realistic or amazing can dialogue be anyhowis the first movie of this type that ive seen but i love it of course these kind of movies dont have much substance or themes or anything like that but thats not what they are for,cruel

this film starts out with 2 good looking college age guys and a drifter they picked up while backpacking we see them wondering around in amsterdam doing drugs drinking ya know typical college kid antics they then talk to one guy who informs them about a in slovakia where there are unbelievably hot girls now of course they get excited and decide to go to this place first of all i would like to compliment jay hernandez and his costar on their acting they were very convincing in the lead roles of this movie i enjoyed them here the sexual content was just a little too much for my taste i didnt care to see so much nudity and the nudity was all female too no male nudity so sorry ladies and gay guys but to be serious the female nudity got to be a little overwhelming the violence in this film is very graphic and will disturb some viewers it is important to go ahead and be aware of that when u go in to watch this film also the two main characters in the film really are good guys i mean yes they did a little drugs and drank and had some sex but that doesnt make then bad guys necessarily this movie really made me care about the 2 main guys one of the guys really does have a big heart and is sweet and nice now the violence includes an image of a severed head it shows a girl about to get her toe chopped off it doesnt actually show everything but you know what is about to happen there is also an offscreen showing of a guy getting drilled and more stuff similar to those type of things just wanted to let you know all this because if you are faint of heart then this movie is definitely one to skip over now i enjoyed the script for this movie the script and dialogue worked very well and nothing was cheesy and clich about it i really loved the atmosphere in this movie the building in which things go on was very creepy and very atmospherically creepy this premise of this movie is very interesting i liked how they executed the plot now is the movies violence too brutal i think it is a little too graphic for my own personal taste i was expecting it to be brutal but they took the torture scenes just a little too far in my opinion but hey it couldve been much worse movies like saw and others of that kind have been much worse so i am thankful that it wasnt any worse than it was at least some things occurred offscreen and just showed screaming and the victims reaction there is some justice served here one of the torturers does in fact get what he deserves so its not like evil triumphs in this movie a couple victims do in fact vomit while in the torture room from fear and just sheer shock i suppose that wasnt really pleasant but i guess it was realistic the movie shows very graphic images of carnage severed hands legs rooms with cut open bodies and blood on the floor yes some of this aftermath and carnage was an overload and was too grain graphic and unnecessary and there is one scene in particular that was just nasty i mean it was very disturbing that was the scene where one of the victims is shown hiding and sees a guy just sawing severed limbs with a chainsaw and other instruments too graphic for my taste oh and also the eye scene was wayyyyy too nasty and disturbing that was just unnecessary although i am glad that the characters in this movie werent like bad people the main characters were good guys that was refreshing to see this movie was not the best in the world but it certainly was not a bad movie it was a 710 i have to take off points for the overwhelming gross out imagery that didnt improve the movie but in fact made it worse and in my opinion dumbed it down but it gets points for being well written that includes script and characters and being well acted and i assure you that the bad guys do not go unpunished ended on a good and a bad note a partially happy ending i wont go any further about how it ends youll have to see for yourself that is if you are in fact brave enough enter at your own risk,cruel

eli roth hasnt quite hit a home run with many of his original movies his directing has been subject to a lot of criticism but i wont let that get in the way of my review personally i love eli roths acting he bring a relatively fresh persona to the screen but this being the first movie i watched created by roth i heard a lot of hype and downplay so i didnt know what to expecti cant and will not criticize the acting in the movie because a lot of it seemed suitable for the target audience it wasnt bad in any way and it had its moments so i wont dive to deep into the actinghowever the plot was intriguing and seemed to be pretty creative the premise was enticing me to watch the movie though i didnt know a whole lot about it however i was pleasantly surprisedsince the movie is a thrillerhorror there is a lot of violent and graphic torture scenes since i have desensitized myself to some of the violence or i just have a higher tolerance to gore i found to be amusing i could see what he was trying to do with the torture scene and didnt think they fell short in any way i imagine it to be similar to many japanese gore flicks like guinea pig to a somewhat lesser extent and maybe more like audition in the veracity of the graphic torture scenesso i understand what he was trying to do and it was not necessarily a high budget movie by any means so with that in mind you do not get many of the dull high budget hollywood horror style gore it remains under the radar of these cheap hollywood gore flicks and rightfully so in that sense it seemed genuine to classic torture flicks unlike a saw 4 type thrilleri cannot say the same for the following flicks it seemed like later movies tried to capitalize on the legacy of the original that being said eli roth didnt direct the following which may be why he stepped back but that is besides the pointif you dont have the stomach for these gore flicks then it should be easily for you to decide just dont watch it if you like gore art then it would definitely be worth taking a look into if you like the movies audition or really many japanese thrillers it is similar and seems more sincere,cruel
heres a true horror film is a true horror masterpiece itself derived from not the sanest of minds roth has created something legendary here where 8 years later i still remember how terrifying the film was when seeing it on the big screen its probably the most terrifying horror ive seen in my life roth is great as how he gives us a taste of gore at the start blood and brain issuing down a drain from a tortured young victim snatched from an infamous whos become the violent prey of rich americans whatever getting their kicks killing and torturing for a price the idea is ingeniously sick amazingly inspired by a real life torture and kill website we follow three backpackers two are whom are american while the other stray is an extroverted icelanic guy who puts sparkle early into the affair before the high level gore and torture ensue like wolf creek we get to know the characters where were subjected to some nice nudity and some dangerously hot women who turn out to be shockingly evil even a swarm of little slovokian street kids are some of the dangerously underestimated theres a nice easeful flow of story here the torture scenes arent for the faint hearted and is a sick excursion into terror that demonstrates how life can be cheaply disposed of as in wolf creek by remorseless beings rick hoffman as a sick american client one of the most detestable revels in in his role that scene and the one with takeshi mike striding coolly back to his car while delivering a killer line of answer to suss jay hernandez who thinks hes about to look at some art are my favourite two scenes in this big old empty building are rooms are death from none of the survive the asian girl having her eye burned out with an oxi torch where the eyeball dangles out leaving frenetic hernandez forced to make a decision as to what to do was one of the films most intense moments later during their escape i noticed a fault with hernandez and lim evacuating a car in a line up conducted by some corrupt cops how they werent spotted with the cops on close approach i couldnt buy for gore lovers s violence has a heavy style and it rides high on bloodletting theres humour too where the whole story is structured brilliantly its finale just as violently shocking its a lot to take where a lot of viewers will turn off its a truly underestimated torture show of terror one which roth with his great story structure is one to be proud of but probably not for what hes doing for commercial backpacking a scarring psychological horror that will live on in memory for many years to come be prepared,cruel
is a 2005 horror movie directed by eli roth who also directed the films sequel this film is also said to be the first one to get labeled with the infamous subgenre torturepornbasic plot the film centers around several boys who travels to slovakia in order to visit a filled with a bunch of beautiful women but what they dont know is the fact they are soon to get lured into the world of torture and deathbeing a horror film this film has lots of nudity during the scenes it is when the gore comes into the screen it gets somewhat intense and might not be recommended for squeamish people great use of gore anyway even gorehounds might get to enjoy this flickthe imdb site says this film is rated 18 basically the highest rating in norway however on the dvd box the film is actually rated 20 which is a very unusual rating to be put into a norwegian dvd box even the sequel part ii got the ultra rare 20rating and my 2disc box set which contains the two films says the same in my opinion these movies should rather have gotten the 18rating because there are lots of worse movies having been made in the world when it comes to gore and intense scenesoverall i found this one and part 2 to be pretty enjoyable well to be honest some of the better modern horror films having been made in the us in the mid2000s this film is also not so clichd as most horror films made in the us tend to be way many times if you like watching topless women and especially scenes of intense gore which is one of the big points here and havent seen this yet i can recommend you to watch this at least once my rating is 810a few other movies which got the infamous genre tortureporn include martyrs 2005 wolf creek 2005 antichrist 2009 and the sawmovies,cruel
sinister it sure is and brutal absolute f brutal every time i watched it i have felt a dread a chill in my spine goosebumps at how men can stay cool doing things as mean and bloody and to realize that everything the movie shows was not entirely fictional should send you scurrying away from anywhere near that god damned place what rage and unfulfilled ambition can make humans do no other force on earth can replicate and this is the main theory the movie revolves around as many people get tortured to death very painfully and brutally as blood covers the screen and the haunting screams split up your ears and for this exact same thing that this movie has gained notoriety and also the fact that ukraine registered less tourists in 2006 i am amazed it got any if you have been living under a rock and missed this so sorry go watch this asapread more at httphightensionmoviesblogspotin,cruel
is a disturbing tale of the darkest side of humanity the fact that it may be based on a true story makes it that much more disturbing jay hernandez and derek richardson are perfectly cast as wellmeaning but flawed characters looking to have some fun before returning to school some people have found the first half hour to be hard to sit through but i thought it was interesting how the movie showed these characters fulfilling their desires  just like the wealthy businessmen attempt to fulfill their desires as i compared the two i wondered which desires were more sinister eli roths story is filled with social commentary not often found in horror films which alone makes worth a watch,cruel
this is a truly rotten movie with nothing to recommend it for example the first halfhour or so has a lot of ta all of which is ruined by the three male protagonists running around going oh oh naked women like a bunch of 8yearolds snapping towels in a girls locker room when they do get lucky its all pretty much so thats where it goes stupid instead of sexypersonally id tie em up the guys to a chair and pull out a scalpel which is precisely what happens to them and the rest of the movie turns into a very long very boring gorefest since these guys have already alienated the audience the long drawnout process of dismembering them has all the satisfaction and drama of a medical school dissectionspeaking of which the whole movie seems to have been stitched together in the worst possible way from teenage male virgin and teenage slasher filmslike most males once i hit puberty i knew what i had knew what it was for and very much looked forward to my first test drive making that teenage nerd virgin snickering at naked ladies seem just plain weird just pain offensive and just plain retarded can you really reach sexual maturity and retain the worldview of a dirtyminded yet clueless 8yearold for six eight or even ten years thereafter,cruel
i consider myself a devout horror fan and try to watch as many films of the genre as possible and of as many subgenres as i can however im not at all a gore fan and i dont appreciate what people describe as torture porn its simply not what i like to watchtherefore it took me a long while to bring myself to watching because of all thats been said about it theres been a lot of buzz around and saw here in israel and i absolutely adore the saw series so i thought it was about time to give a try and it actually wasnt all that badid divide into three parts first  the buildup three friends go backpacking in europe enjoying the drugs and ladies very eurotrip style without the comedy except for oli whos the comic relief the second  gore and torture some pretty disgusting gore shoots and very disturbing physical torture nothing more the third  the conclusion of the story along with the i spit on your grave style vengeance it might have been an attempt at a happy ending though it merely showed that the victim became as bad as the antagonistsall in all i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gore and torture films as these are the most powerful aspects of it personally as someone who doesnt like gore and torture have i said gore and torture yet well gore and torture plenty of it i could have easily managed without,cruel
this is the first review i have written for imdb honestly i find it strange that its for this film i felt compelled to do so since i feel it deserves a higher rating enough people have committed their time writing about the works of lynch jodorowsky spielberg haneke etc eli roth wrote and directed this 2006 horror film and it will probably go on to be one of the few american horror films people remember from that period so why is it worth remembering compared to the wavecrop of remakesrehashes pouring out of hollywood or the clinical ultragore impressively imported from asia this film stands apart with a well structured story and strong character development is a great horror film the characters are better thought out than in many other recent examples from this genre it takes its time rather building up tension and it pays off in well thought doses throughout the runtime we follow three young men traveling through europe having a carefree summer two americans who just graduated from high school and a slightly older icelandic guy theyve met on the road and has tagged along opening on their time in amsterdam they catch wind that they can have a better  cheaper time in slovakia from there the vacation turns into a nightmare roth has put this film together perfectly it is filmed beautifully apart from the faux amsterdam scenes he not only captures the settings well but the entire cast do their job and carry every scene i have to note jay hernandezs performance throughout the second half his characters anecdote about a girl drowning is integratedrecalled in a great and somewhatsubtle manner later on what is highly commendable is how reserved the film is it is not 100 gore apart from what might account for 3 instances of torture scenes the majority of the film is set on character development and stringing the three main characters along in a the wicker man style demisealso the soundtrack finally a director that did not employ a roster of rock bands to create a soundtrack or rely on studio musicians to crank out a halfassed set of music roth instead chose traditional instruments symphony orchestra whathaveyou etc as music to set the mood except how do by sneaker pimps coincidentally recalling it is their rendition of a song from the wicker man check out isobel campbells rendition willows song its quite good as wellanyway its a been a long day i should have written this with more energyfocussobriety but i thought id do my part and post something if you liked this 2 is a spectacular followup,cruel
this film actually could have been good if taken for a more serious route or even you know been recut id like to point out the first have half of the movie is naked woman scene after scene way to much i even wonder is this movie going to pick up an hour in it did a little a first they didnt show to much gore than they showed a bunch of it i cant help but feel this movie didnt even try to be serious or shocking i thought it would have but its done in a in your face and over the top manor i liked the story but it was executed poorly and seemed more for teenagers with all the elements of drugs and prolonged nudity eli roth could have done better but it just turned out the same as cabin fever maybe even lower the characters were forgettable at besti dont recommend it if your looking for a good time but if you want a explicit and hardcore film go for it,cruel
if you thought 2004s saw was a massive step into cinematic gore does a triple long jump and a pole vault into it is sadistic in parts but is a very intriguing film it is covered in blood but sometimes theres so much blood the story is washed away the dutch businessman played by jan vlask isnt an iconic horror villain but is one of the cleverest and deceiving villains from recent memory there are a lot of stereotypical traits smoking pot in amsterdam beautiful girls entrancing the backpackers but these play out well overall a gore fest that can get a bit too carried away at times but can hold itself together,cruel
i am amazed this film has been given a low rating by everyone most probably because there are no big stars i judge a film on its own merits rather than who is in it or who the director is etc this film is better than the saw series and other cut and slash films as you get to know the characters before the cutting and slashing begins three guys are out drinking looking for females and go to a where they are led to believe there are girls and more girls all willing to have sexthe honey trap is set looking back after watching the film the girls most probably did more than they had to but most guys will not complain about that the guys are then held captive and tortured by people who have paid to torturekill people as with any film there are unlikely events but who wants to watch boring real life it is a film i will watch again in the future,cruel
directorwriter eli roth should return to his old job guarding howard sterns trailer while the king of all media slept during breaks while making the film private parts he should have paid attention to betty thomas and ivan reitman and maybe he would have learned something about film makingis a poorly written and badly acted amateurish debut by the former trailer watcher who has not impressed me with this opening effortthree college students are traveling across europe and find a to stay at cheaply they meet two beautiful women who invite them out to dance one of the kids disappears and a photo of his severed head appears on a cell phone next up we are treated to handcuffs mutilations and every form of fun imaginable there was no need for a sequel one is quite enough,cruel
eli roths cabin fever was a fun yet flawed journey through the formula of the horror genre but still kept an even pacing with a few welldone sequences here comes a film that would continue the torture porn subgenre of the horror world like the neverending saw franchise its clear that roths intentions and expectations for this were high but it becomes tiresome and drab very quicklyto begin with we are presented with uninspired yet somewhat interesting characters they are backpackers named semismart paxton hernandez the intelligent leader josh richardson and the womanizer li gujnsson the men are touring europe and hitting every strip club or party house within radius they are informed there are more adventures in bratislava so its off to bratislava they gothere they drink and party it up fall asleep and realize their friend li is missing we the viewer find out that he was taken to a dungeonlike prison where people are beaten tortured and killed in gruesome and unforgivable waysmy first problem is the pacing its incredibly slow and not in the good way horror directors have become less aware that pacing is the key to a great kill or attack jump scares solely can not sustain a movie well a good movie for the first fifty minutes of we have to watch some of the lamest most redundant scenes of nudity and sex it is common for horror films to contain both of those but presents them gratuitously without rhyme or reasonwhen the torture comes its gory and harsh yet uninspired this might not be roths fault as much as it is the saw franchises weve seen so much stronger scenes of torture is makes have a moot presence but thats not to say the saw films are masterpieces in any way shape or form they are just more violent gruesome and unapologetic pails in comparisonstill its a very meanspirited film its bleak grisly ugly and dark in its appearance its a film of little positives and many negatives scary it is not but cringeinducing it is is the kind of horror film that comes out of the blue and gains notoriety from the depraved gorehounds that pretty much assures were in for some unimpressive sequelsstarring jay hernandez derek richardson eyr gujnsson barbara nedeljkov and rick hoffman directed by eli roth,cruel
i think many are taking this film far too seriously at the end of the day its a horror movie and in 90 of horror movies they are far fetched and otti agree with most in that the characters were lame and for me they ruined the film the concept as far as horrors go though was brilliant imo the location was perfect and it truly made you think would i not like to be in their boots right nowsex and naked east euro girls added into the mix as well remember these are young guys looking for a bit of action the girls are their to tempt them its part of the storyline otherwise how are you going to tempt anyone to come to that god forsaken townsorry but its underrated imo,cruel
i was forced into watching this disaster of a film by my brother and his friends who said itll be funhot womenblood what more could u want i agreed little did i know i was about to witness one of the worst films i have ever seen the first thirty minutes comprised of nothing but sex and drugsthen the director thought oh wait this isnt what the movie is about it then plunges into a gore festand the characters who u dont give a crap about start to die before they can leave an impression of any sort for me the best part of the movie was the first thirty minutesfor obvious reasons i expected way better from eli roth but i guess u cant count on anybody anymore just when u start feeling a little too let down  vincent vega and jules come to save the day not kiddingalright i admit these types of movies arent to be taken that seriously but stillpeople work hard to make moviesand why not just make a good one i mean u guys just wasted precious time look at sawnow that movie has a good story and an equal amount of gore and was worth my time and u might wanna keep this in mind before u watch the moviedont eat anything while u watch it,cruel
i remember when this movie first came out and i went to see it in thetres and i remember it creeping the hell out of me though this movie is somewhat low budget the acting is good and the special effects are awesome contrary to everybodys beliefs this movie is really not that gory it is brutal though but not anywhere as gory as people say i have definitely seen worsethis movie is about two american backpackers who plan on travelling across europe first they start off in amsterdam but one night while locked out of their hotel they meet a guy who tells them that slovakia has the best and most beautiful girls in the world so they catch the next train out to slovakia while there they stay at a youth that has a sinister plan for all backpackers passing throughi found this movie really good i really dont know why everyone hates these kinda of movies and quotes them toture porn there is not much toture even in this the scares are mostly set up through the creepy atmosphere of course there is some very few like maybe 15 mins of the movie brutal toture in the movie so if you have a weak stomach probably best stay away from thisoverall i think it was a good horror movie the acting was fair and it was very creepy it wasnt all just about the toture if you are a true horror fan you will like this if you cant stand gore or brutal scenes dont watch this,cruel
with six years under its belt one enters their first viewing of with a considerable amount of prejudice and preconceived notions about what the film will entail its one of those films that for one reason or another has gained a degree of notoriety and thusly you feel as though you know what youre getting yourself in for in a less than timely fashion then i sat down to see this movie in the comfort of my own home expecting what has been hyped as the most bloody bloodbath of all the bloodbaths ever the word sickening peers would have had me believe is not nearly dastardly nor emotive enough for what horrors i was about to witness as i whistled along to the mellow tune of the opening sequenceit was therefore with great disappointment that i reached forty minutes into the movie and absolutely nothing had happened i say nothing but credit where credit is due what actually happened was a bit of character backgrounding mixed in with scenes of dull and uninteresting exposition it is understandable for a horror movie to want to build up character profiles to allow for empathy and to want to set the scene to allow for a pseudorealistic plot however even with the gratuitous and vast introduction that employed and a fair amount of emotional lenience and suspended disbelief on my part it was halfway through the movie and i neither cared for any of the characters nor felt particularly engaged in what seemed to be a fairly placid and purposeless plotit was through this general cinematic ineptitude that we reached a point where one of the introductory trio an icelandic king of swing dont even ask was dead and the other was being tortured and then killed i make no apologies in saying that i have cared more for the toiletbowl bacteria i regularly slaughter than i did for these characters and their untimely demises considering the amount of time the director was given to make me care about the characters even slightly then this can only be construed as either lazy or amateurish perhaps bothdue to the overwhelming amount of discussion about the degree of gore in this movie i feel as though i should pay it some attention the scenes of torture however few and far between they may have been were relatively good at showing how people react in that type of situation thanks to very good acting from the victims i would like to point out however that although there were some nearlynailbiting moments most of the gore seemed to be there just for the sake of filling up time it is also worth noting that the body parts being cut up and cut off were at times very unconvincing which very much detracted from the seriousness of the sceneoverall it wasnt a terrible horror movie the plot did quicken towards the end providing a bit of a rush but nothing to write home about i think people would like this movie to be the big bad and ugly one that puts a defiant lock on the doors of gore but its not even close half of the movie is what appears to be a watereddown eurotrip and the other half a fastpaced yet emotionless bloodbath resulting in one andahalf hours of wasted time unless youre looking for short cheap thrills this is definitely one to avoid in fact id avoid it even if you are youd get more excitement and better storytelling from a trip to your local old folks home less than half a movie gives this less than half a score a resounding four out of ten,cruel
 out of isnt a historical landmark in cinema nor does it have the slightest chance of snagging an academy award instead its a film with an interesting concept but with incompetent directing and shoddy performances its middleoftheroad at best roth can show the most disgusting vile death that makes the hairs trickle on someones back but well still be left in the cold gore ta i think we know where this is goingrevolves around a group of backpackers that meet up some voluptuous twenty somethings and drink have sex and crash a night however their idea of fun turns into a living hell when they are succumbed to torture and miseryfirst of all with a premise such as that of i dont think youll hook your audience in with forty five minutes of pure filler theres no character development no purpose its not even entertaining booze sex boobs nightclubs all nighters its just not exciting or fascinating especially with characters as flat as these thanks to the direction which is very cheap you can tell the film was made for less than 5 million however all snarky comments aside i did enjoy the film to some extent i thought the last twenty minutes were exactly what this film shouldve been like gritty suspense and keeping you guessing on all accounts all the chaos and mayhem just seep through the cracks all in all roth can throw as much skin and red fluids as he wants at the audience but if you have an absence of character development and a nonexistent story the direction becomes corrupt roth i appreciate the effort because i know somewhere along the way a good film was made unfortunately roth didnt find that film,cruel
is a film that appealed to me for two reasons eli roth and quentin tarantino roth make a big hit with cabin fever and i was really interested to see what he would do next also i am a huge tarantino fan so if when i saw his name on the poster as the producer i knew i had to see it i expected there to be strong gore which there was the problem is thats all there wasthe first half of feels a bit like american pie abroad we have a group of male americans who are travelling across europe hoping to strike it lucky with the ladies along the way however one by one they disappear and end up in an abandoned warehouse where they end up being horrifically torturedeli roth is a fantastic director and whilst watching the film you can tell that he has put time and effort into the film he is a better director then a script writer as the script and story let the film down it is hard not to compare to the first saw film as that set the standard for the so called torture porn genre what made saw so great was the involvement with the characters we didnt know who the killer was we learnt more about the characters as the film continued the gore and horror was more suggestive then in your face and most importantly the twist all worked is all style and no substance which is a big disappointmentthe gore is very graphic and disgusting which is great but a good horror film needs more then just terrible images a good horror film needs to take the audience and put them through the struggles of the characters and feel the tension and suspense in the film in i found my self left out of the film and just a spectator to torture and gore eli roth you have a great talent as a horror film maker so please make a great horror film thats not just all style but some depth as well tarantino said in an interview that he thought roth was the future of horror well quenten i am not seeing any signs of that yet,cruel
the common mistake that horror movies usually make today is using too much blood and guts and relying on grossing out people instead of scaring them is one of them the story was decent and the thought of the story alone is quite a scary one the acting was mediocre there wasnt really anyone who stood out the main three characters are the stereotypical teenagers you normally see in horror movies the weedsmoking sexobsessed teenagers who dont care for nothing as long as they get laid they hardly had any personality throughout the entire movie which brought the movie down a little the scenes however were well executed and the violent torture scenes were scarily realistic the direction from eli roth is great and it makes you think what went on in the twisted minds of the creators while making even though the movie is quite a good movie i felt like it relied too much on grossing people out with the torturous scenes in the movie i didnt get scared throughout watching the movie but the idea and the thought of it is quite frightening i think it could have been a very memorable movie for the story but because it focused more on grossing out it will remain memorable for the blood and gore which is a shame however if you like being grossed out then theres no doubt youll probably like this too but if you want a movie that focuses entirely on the story and gives you a good scare dont see itread more reviews at wwwdudedazzmoviereviewswordpresscom,cruel
apparently director eli roth has a fetish for snuff if fact in a documentary i watched on the subject recently roth is interviewed and becomes visibly giddy when he comments on the realism of cannibal holocaust it is no small wonder that he developed the idea for and directed the two films i dont see that as an admirable quality but then i am old school and still believe the best horror isnt inyourfacegore i realize i am in the minority these daysi once staid in a in franfkurt wwwstayfrankfurtcom and i could not resist to be remembered the first was not a great film it was in fact not very good but what it did have was an intriguing premise a club whose wealthy members pay to torture and murder abducted people what worked was that such an idea was not entirely inconceivable i would argue that such clubs just like snuff films currently exist and that was what made the film interestingly creepy for me,cruel

the horror film is directed by eli roth and stars jay hernandez derek richardson and eythor gudjonsson the film takes place in modern day europethe film begins with a shot of a torture chamber and then cuts to two americans paxton and josh hernandez and richardson and an icelandic man oli gudjonsson in amsterdam after being locked out of the they are staying at they are brought in by a young man who claims that there is a much better in slovakia with all the best girls and no other americans so the three decide to travel to the by train and on the way they encounter a middle aged man who creeps josh out by touching his leg and at the time he seems to have no significance when they arrive at the they discover that everything they heard about it was true and their roommates are two beautiful women who they get to know quite well but little do they know everything is not what it seemsthe writing of this film was quite ingenious it reminded me a lot of a hitchcock film because it really focused on characterization for around the first thirty minutes before focusing on the plot by the time the plot actually came around i felt that i knew the two main characters paxton and josh very well and rooted for them when the film turned into horror the actual screenplay was quite original i have never seen anything quite like it and i enjoyed how realistic the film was at points there were noticeable coincidences but not so unrealistic that it ruined the whole film eli roth proves with this film that he is a great addition to the horror genrethe direction of the film was also very good along with the writing it really helped develop the characterization and it also kept the film interesting the whole way through roth created an extremely gory film and he succeeded in making me flinch at the screen by the brutality this is one of the goriest films of all time and roth did it all necessarily by necessarily i mean he never overdid it just for the scares this is roths second feature film his first being cabin fever and he proves with it that he is a director that is going to stay around for a whilethe acting in this film is quite good as well hernandez is the lead and starts off as an enjoyable relaxed guy as the film goes on he evolves due to the circumstances he is into a much darker person that is confused in pain and angry he plays his part very well and is very convincing richardson plays josh and is probably the most relatable character in the film he just got out of a serious relationship and is just looking for a good time he is a genuinely nice guy who gets into tragic circumstances and i rooted for him the whole time gudjonsson plays the part of oli he is basically just there for comic relief and he is pretty funny so good job to you this is a well acted filmoverall i give this film a strong 710 due to the fine acting direction and writing this film is definitely one of the best american horror films of the past decade along with saw and 28 days later i cant really think of any other ones at the moment another thing i really liked about this film is how it is divided into two parts and how they are separated the first part is the pretty part with all the girls and drugs you can tell this part by how the two roommate girls are very attractive and wearing makeup the second part is the not so pretty part and the two roommates are not wearing makeup during this part i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre,cruel
i am usually a big fan of gory films such as pulp fiction kill bill saw films however ive got to say this was bordering on the line of sick it was a very disturbing concept as well as the acting not being too great however i did enjoy this film it was well directed and made the chase scenes very intense the film had some good plot ideas and minor twists id say the worst thing about it was how you could predict everything in it pretty much and the plot was very cheesy and typical of a horror spoiler the film had some really disturbing moments in though such as the woman having her eye torched off the general disturbing basements full of hopelessness and people being gagged and tortured oh yeah i forgot to comment on the actual setting ive got to admit the dungeons etc were really well done it gave the feeling the director really wanted to give id say you should see this film if you love intense films disturbing films and gory films,cruel
i have decided to add a comment because i am so shocked and surprised by all the negative reviews that appear on this website is quite simply a great story in the classic tradition of horror movies  i can even draw parallels with hitchcock in the way the atmosphere is created and the story unfolds with the audience guessing all the time as a 45 year old mum i am still able to identify with the main characters and whilst i was never a sex tourist i certainly did the trip to amsterdam staying in a in the red light district as a teenager i visited the bars and clubs and got locked out of the one night  the guys are totally believable i know from my husbands experiences in amerstam in his youth that young guys definitely go there to experience sex and drugs and live it up before settling down to marriage or college or whatever the normal humdrum existence has in store for them  i was with them all the wayalmost every sex scene in this film is suggested not graphic apart from naked breasts and olis bare bottom you actually see very little and the fornication is all in the mind contrast this to the sex scenes in where the truth lies with kevin bacon and colin firth which i found so graphic  especially featuring actors with whom i am familiar  that i was unable to watch the torture scenes as well leave almost everything to the imagination  you see the instruments you see the blood but you dont really see anything happen the gore is artistic in the clive barker tradition and when the girls talk about an art show that is truly what the torture scenes amount to there is a definite parallel between the exhibits in the torture museum and the exhibits the characters become and in my view this kind violence constitutes the art form typified in barkers hellraiserthe pace of the film is breakneck you are gripped from beginning to end you cant look away for a second in case you miss an important lead the film actually feels longer than it is because so much is crammed into such a short space of time nothing unnecessary has been retained and everything you see is crucial to the outcome this is quite simply a beautifully structured wellacted artistic and atmospheric film with its roots firmly in a reality we may prefer to ignore in my view a lot of writers on these pages have completely missed the point,cruel
who ever gave this movie bad reviews are morons what did you expect from this movie masterpiece theater i never watched friday the 13th nightmare on elm street for its plot unlike most people i hated the texas chainsaw massacre this movie is great and meets all the requirements for a great slasher flick stupid young people sex nudity suspense bad guyguys a survivor gore and graphic violence all the haters of this movie will be the same people that in 15 years time will say this movie is a classichypocrites if you want a good escape guilty pleasure movie this is the movie to watch otherwise if youre looking for deep plot deep thought please turn to masterpiece theater but if youre looking for empty calories of guilty pleasure that will both entertain and fulfill all your pre pubescent memories this is the movie to watch,cruel
good movie bout time someone got it right eli roth has totally proved that he is here and will be thrown in the ring with wes craven sean cunningham and john carpenter anyone that disagrees with me check out last house on the left wes and sean made it right out of college perfect example of the only difference is that with cameras and production being better eli lost that scary home video feel but on the other hand he really got it right with everything else the irony in the movie is the fact that the boys buy the girls like objects but in the end they are bought like objectsthe die hard fans will get that,cruel
half silly sex farce and half gorefest is unworthy of the hype and controversy it received upon release it starts excellently mysteriously and impressively before descending into clichd americans in amsterdam looking for sex and drugs sure this does provide us with plenty of boob action but it does little to develop this characters beyond mere caricature this first section drags and its only when the gruesome moments start coming that springs to life sliced ankles severed fingers and pusoozing eyeballs are just some of the lovely images you can feast on eli roth intended to push audiences to their limit with this film tortureporn but theres not nearly enough gory or inventive moments to make overly memorable nor was i ever truly on the edge of my seat with my hands over my eyes that being said it is a great idea for a film and it does have it moments but i just wish roth had pushed it even further perhaps the sequel will impress me more your better off watching the first couple of saw films for a more inventive take on the tortureporn subgenre,cruel
i must admit what truly attracted me to eli roths second film was the rarelygranted quentin tarantino presentation as any diehard tarantino fan will say whatever the man presents the viewer must watch his stamp of approval means more  much much more  than any ebert review i am also a hardcore genre fan my ears become flushed with anticipation at the sound of anything even remotely associated with the exhilarating genre that is horror it is therefore understandable that i was quite excited about finally watching in all of its bloody violent bitsofbrainandskullsplatteredonthewall glory after all i had mostly heard that it was a step forward in the world of horror films continuing a tradition of unprecedented onscreen violence set off by japanese filmmakers long before american directors dared to risk receiving that naughty and now highly coveted nc17 rating so without further ado here are my postviewing good and unfortunately bad news for the good news the setting of the film mostly parts of slovakia is quite original particularly for audiences of previous american horror it does not have that generic and infuriating hollywood feel either  it looks sounds and feels like a real place now if this isnt the most crucial aspect of a successful horror film think audition think original texas chainsaw massacre i dont know what is roth scores more points in his cast selection jay hernandez truly takes the most realistically scared award in this film  he was so friggin terrified when he got to the elite hunting headquarters that i wanted to forgive his immmature and sexist behavior during the first 40 minutes of roth then scores some more points with his courageous and excessively gory scenes which i will not give away for those who havent watched the movie yet they were certainly enough to satisfy even the darkest cravings of decadesold horror fans finally roth scores bonus points by playing a dubbed version of pulp fiction at the actual in the movie and the miike takashi cameo was as gratifying as any cameo can ever be now for the bad news for the first 45 minutes of the film i felt as though i had mistakenly stumbled upon an unusually long porno with a poorly constructed storyline the naked chicks by the dozen the unnecessary sex the talking about sex the incessant search for sex and the overall ignorant sexism of the 3 main characters were unbearably annoying  and did i mention unnecessary i wanted to somehow remind roth that i am addicted to horror not sex and that wasting 40 minutes of perfectly good screen time on boobs and asses instead of chainsaws and kitchen knives just wont cut it i think any true horror fan will agree with me on this  unless of course roth was trying to make a connection between excessive sex and excessive violence which become sort of tangled in at any rate i wouldve been much happier if roth had spent those first 40 minutes setting a more frightening mood and teasing me about the cinematic gorefest that was to come i will say this however once the gore begins there is no turning back  and the villains are remarkably and terrifyingly realistic is perhaps a diamond in the very rough  with some refreshingly strong peaks and quite a few flaws that need to be polished i still admire roth for his daring nature and his obvious passion for horror  these two things at least came through loud and clear in the puzzling and controversial film that is ,cruel
first of all to all the negative critics of 1 stop the hating as far as critics go usually they only give an a rating for complex thoughtprovoking intelligent stories zzzzzz eli roth to me is over the top but that is his style i enjoy entertaining horror movies and that is exactly what is from watching a preview you know the kids are going to end up getting tortured we all know all the happiness was going to end at some point regarding the movie being pure entertainment i liked the script josh was awkwardly funny and the icelandish guy was hilarious the girls werent just hot because of their looks and the muchneeded nudity horror movies always used to have nudity the accents were great and brought creepiness to the movie sirious ameriken  my only issue with and all the other horror movie that comes out nowadays is that its just not scary at all i think eli roth wanted it gory more than scary but still i feel like the last scary movie i saw was candyman eli roth has been great but the fact that hes over the top at times turns people off i mean texas chainsaw massacre was kind of funny especially part 2 and i like funny but lets lean towards scary sometimes especially for a horror movie thats just an example of a classic horror movie that can be a bit comical was by far elis best because he kept it pretty morbid it is one of the most entertaining horror movies i have seen in a while 2 was also pure entertainment but he went eli roth on it and took it one step too far on the jokes goalllllllll so overall good script good acting good production good nudity and good torture 9 out of 10,cruel
okay so this is not really a spoiler perse im just addressing the sex scenesreading the other user comments i was a bit worried about the amount of sex that would be in here its really not as bad as it seems here is the basic gist of the beginning three guys are exploring the countries and are looking to get laid so they go to a sex club here you see the movements of couples in rooms behind white screens you see their shadows the most revealing part in this is a sm bondage room but even then you only see a woman straddling a man in black leather then theres a pair of boobs thats itthe guys go to this apartment and talk to a guy who will send them to a where there a very friendly girls meanwhile his two friends male and female are stoned and are having sex as the main characters and the guy talk you can see the girl on top of the guy in the background for the entire conversation but basically its just the two of them naked her sitting on him theres no moaning or frantic gyrationsthe last sex scene is of a guy and a girl in one bed and a guy and a girl in another the basic action is her taking her top off and him making moaning expressionsthats really the end of the sex however before this last sex scene the girls invite them to the spa where everyone the girls walk around naked they chat with the boys in the steam room with their tops off if anything that makes it less sexual you stop noticing their breasts because theyre not paying attention to it either im guessing this is what nude beaches are likeif youre in it for the gorehorror you might as well fast forehead to about 40 minutes into the movie really nothing and i do mean nothing happens before that,cruel
paxton josh and oli are backpacking across europe when they are told about a in slovakia once they hear that this is infested with beautiful european woman who only want tourists they quickly get on a train to the wonderful promise land as soon as they get there they start having the time of their lives soon after they arrive they slowly start to realize that this is hiding a terrible and dark secretone day i just decided to see ive seen turistas first and many people have said it was a complete ripoff out of this film well i can see the similarities but the whole feel for the two films is different and i actually like turistas because it was realistic more or less and the characters were smartcompared with the characters are dumb at least for the first hour honestly i found the first hour a let down not because theres not a lot of blood  i dont like that  but because it was basically a bunch of nudity and characters going around doing sex and drugs i do however found derek richardson performance really comedic in a good wayafter that hour is over it really gets good  no not because theres a lot of torture scenes  but because the film slowly turns to a black comedy and i mean it in a good way after a mediocre first hour i was quite entertained by the last half hour i was really cheery for the characters and laughing at the screen if only the first hour was like thatstill that last half hour boosted my likeness for this filmthe performances were decent i in my opinion think that it was worth the wait for the last half hour sure the first hour is just plain mediocre and unentertaining but what comes next is the fun part give this a rent if youre still unsure,cruel
unlike most recent horror films shows a genuine talent for scaring but it also shows that to make the most of this the director needs guidance from somebody probably somebody not quentin tarantino in particular this film needed a different scriptwriter ie other than the director a different cameraman and a focus on what it was about ie what kind of film it was the idea of it would have made a very scary short story and the film could have been as scary whereas at present only a few scenes scare and the bulk of it is waste motionthe writing and camerawork must be discussed together because both are to blame for the insufficiency of the buildup in the first part even granted the director is out to establish the protagonists lifestyle during their vacation as one long hedonistic binge this neednt have taken more than a few minutes where we needed to get to was where they were to end up took too long getting them there and once they were there it didnt do much about this we needed to see with them their first look at the country the city the street c and with them we should have seen things that unsettled us increasingly at first the kinds of things in other cultures you disapprove of but hesitate to condemn then things alien partly incomprehensible then in systematic progression things that were confusing sinister dangerous frightening almost none of this is written into the script and where it is the camerawork doesnt deliver it some movies are able to instill landscapes with a sense of dread sometimes you know how they do it sometimes you dont but find your stomach unaccountably in knots either way some such method was required here most obviously wanting is the atmosphere of the itself which id expected to be the center of horrific activity the movie would have been scarier if it had been but of course this has been done before the protagonists experiences there should have added up to more than a few conversations with the girls they and we should have come to wonder about the comings and goings of the guests especially the goings the behavior of the staff movements and conversations glimpsed or overheard in the hall through the windows at night when everyone should be in bed more significant is the same want of detail of life outside we see thieving children and a torture museum these are too obvious and not nearly enough we needed to see indications of a callous brutal environment where ordinary morals are eroded and everything is a commodity with survival the bottom line to see enough so when we get where the film is taking us we dont doubt for a second what we see because its a logical extension of what weve seen before of the very air in that places basic structure is the central horror film plot a character happens onto a place person situation c at first it seems innocent then suspect and finally when the character learns the truth horrible the basic problem with it here is the same as in almost every other film using it its just enough for a short subject or tv episode and so must be stretched out to three or four times its natural length if a film keeps to the confines of the structure the ending is in effect no ending thats it if it goes beyond the structure into a third act which almost has to be an account of escape or revenge it also goes beyond the horror that is its raison detre and since up to then it has been striving to convince us the horror is inexorable in effect its undoing what its done for examples of the two methods described cf the two versions of the vanishing takes the second path but the director seems to realize hes gone beyond his original story since he begins to exaggerate the horror and the action to hong konglike proportions dispelling the seeming seriousness with which he treated the harrowing scenes that preceded however in a story of this kind any attempt at a third act is a trap and falls into it the script might at the beginning have introduced a larger contextwar the economy antiamerican feelingand returned to it in the end but that implies a more serious film than i think this one meant to bein other respects also the script is probably most to blame for s faults padded as the story was bound to be what would have filled it out somewhat was a more rounded characterization of the protagonists the dialogue of the villains probably needed to remain elliptical to be disquieting in the way intended but we should have gotten well acquainted with the protagonists seen what each did uniquely and understood why scenes so informing us are absent and there are what i consider misjudgments in structure the scenes behind the credits are disturbing but telegraph something of where were heading and what goes on there both of which would have been scarier without a prior look for a firstact payoff the film introduces a horror shotits first i thinkand i think this was a mistake the shot preceding which would have planted the same suggestion but left us unsure and worried about it would actually have been scarier there are two secondact payoffs one too many they would have been more effective combined into a single one probably with the second preceding the first and finally there is some unintentional misdirection the credit scenes mislead us in a way and the horror climaxthe second payoffmisleads us more it implies a third level to the system shown that would have made it even scarier though less crediblein summary a wayward film from a wayward talent,cruel
is about three young men named paxton jay hernandez josh derek richardson and the sexcrazed oli eythor gudjonssonwho take a trip to amsterdam while there all their fantasies of sex and drugs are met but while on a train heading back to their they meet a strange dutch businessman he tells them that if they head to slovakia there is a spot where they can find anything they want promiscuous girls and drugs beyond their wildest expectations so the three of them head there and soon realize that the businessman did not lie slovakia is like a dream come true for the three of them however soon one of them goes missing after a night of partying neither one of the two understands where he went and are starting to worry until finally the tables turn on them and they are transported to a secret torture chamber this torture facility is an enormous place where as it turns out rich people can pay to act out there sickest murderous desires once the people pay they can do whatever kind of torture they want to these kidnapped people once the two realize what is happening to them they struggle to survive and elude recapture within the facilityhorror movies have become the epitome of crap lately in my opinion im writing this review in 2008 over 2 years after this film was released but the horror genre has stayed the same since this films 2006 release recently we have been getting boring pg13 horror flicks that are not scary in the least as for the r rated horror some of it is good but theres a little too much saw sequel for my liking but rises above it all because this is one of the most suspenseful horror films in years the director eli roth obviously knows horror like the back of his hand and it was also very evident with his first movie cabin fever which had a handful of homages to classic horror flicks that inspired him overflows with gripping suspense and a mostly constant impending tension that something bad is lurking right around the corner one scene id like to mention is where one of the three men is trying to elude capture in the torture facility but ends up being confronted by a psychotic demented businessman the businessman asks the guy what it was like to torture a person and if he got a real good rush from murdering a person the guy literally doesnt know how to respond to such a wacko and is frightened by how gungho and pumped up this businessman is getting knowing that in a few minutes hell be torturing and killing an innocent person this scene is absorbingly brilliant and is so well acted and quietly insane that i knew it would be a classic horror movie scene for years to come there are also a few scenes where the movie becomes halfhorror and halfthriller with finely shot suspensecharged chase sequencesthe movie is basically split into three sections the first section is basic pornography with gratuitous sex scenes the second section is purely twisted torture and terror and the third section is mostly suspense with just a twinge more torture the one section that works the least and actually detracts from is all the sex scenes they were laid on no pun intended a little too thick and were mostly just downright unnecessary another issue with is the underdevelopment of the three lead characters this defect detracted from the experience as well in my opinion they could have just cut out most of the sex scenes and put in scenes to develop the characters instead which was much more necessaryother than these weaknesses is a very strong movie with a potent message the torture scenes are very well done and interestingly shot they are also much more psychological than gory which only makes that much more disturbingly riveting whereas eli roths cabin fever was just an allout no holds barred gore fest is more mature and leaves far more to the imagination but thats not to say isnt gory because believe me it is there are many scenes in the movie that are audaciously violent and also very cynical and vile an example is that we see a mans achilles tendon snipped with a scissor and i actually just shivered writing that down there is also another graphic scene where a certain part of someones face is hanging off after being burned with a bunsen burner so if you ask if is violent or not now you know the answer is an indefinite yes however the fact that isnt an all out gore fest definitely adds to the films effectivenessas a thriller is good and as a horror movie is a cut above the rest of the junk that gets released the underlying message of is that many people do have a dark side to them and actually may desire murder and blood the parallel showing one mans fight for survival relays the message kill or be killed very well but of course the story had a few flaws just like any normal horror flick i give a 3 out of 4 it is original and rises above the common torture porn standards to deliver a good horror film with a few classic scenes,cruel
i think it is already pretty clear from the tremendous numbers of reviews that this is a pretty gory horror film i think it is also pretty clear from the ratings that people either give it a 1 or something around 8 i understand both people who hated it as well as people who enjoyed this moviefor starters if you the kind of person that likes to turn off the brain before watching a movie and just like to enjoy the ride then this movie is probably not for you if you have a weak stomach this movie is definitely not for youhowever if you want to see a real shocker and if you are a big horror fan the you simply must see this movie i liked this movie for a couple of reasons first being the fact this movie is so shocking you will remember it for a long time regardless if you loved it or hated it i personally think that the director did a good job since this movie has such a tremendous impact on the viewer the second thing that i liked about the movie is the idea behind it this movie is not meant to please the viewer with its cheesy story or a predictable happy ending this movie is meant to shock you this movie makes you think about how twisted a human mind can bein a nutshell this movie is a love it or a hate it experience if you seek some serious shocking horror then i recommend this to you if you seek something that hasnt been done before and you are a tarantino fan  i will recommend this to you as well whether you will love this movie  or will hate this movie i can guarantee you one thing you will remember this movie for a very long time9 out of 10,cruel
i enjoyed the movie a lot it has got all the elements needed to be a good rrated movie well this movie could have achieved an nc17 rating easily the story of th movie is so nice and realistic that at one point we start to imagine if people like these really exist in the worldthe movie starts off with a group of american friends on a tour to europe to enjoy life and to have some real fun they get introduced to a guy who sends them to the slovakian city assuring them that they get all the fun they ever want they go to that city and rest should be seen on screen well i guess this movie would have faced a ban in europe for showing such content in its citiessome people may not like this kind of movies and might say is this entertainment well my answer for themthese movies are just and only for entertainment and do not try these with your spouses movies are meant for showing something which is unusual to usdirection is very good all the characters are very well carried off by the actorsiespecially liked the scene with rick hoffman in it where he tells jay hernandez why he came to that placethe two girlsbarbara nedeljakova and one more in the movie are beautifulso guys if u need pure entertainment with gore and violence this movie sates your need,cruel
when i first heard or this film i was very excited to see it i like eli roth and enjoyed watching cabin fever i naturally couldnt wait to see this and thought that it would be a big hit even though i knew that it wouldnt be scary i knew it would be good and gory and it was the hit factor however was basically mixed with i hate it or i love it and this is basically peoples thoughts on eli roth a risky director in the torture genre with some good ideas and a good studio behind him but hes a director who needs to expand into the horror genre maybe he should get into some ghost films or something i dont no whatever he likes but he needs to steer away from the torture genre before this is the only movie he can do im not saying he cant go back but he should justtry other types of horror before this type or film is all anyone will remember him foris basically a film about some young adults who go one a backpacking trip to europe in search for girls beer and drugs but they dont get what they bargained for once the team head to a mysterious solvockian town things take a turn for the worse and they are soon brought into a world of blood carnage and greed the men become enraveled in an underground torture shop where rich men can go to torture victims in any way possible the events that follow are those of death hate loss and murder to try to get out of the hellish kill house alivei did enjoy the film and thought that it was an interesting way to pursue the horror genre with a worthy director of doing it however it was lacking some key details that are needed to direct a torture film1 the acting was not very good witch hurt the movie to a small extent2 the script was okay and in a torture film you need a good script to get buy in the theatersoverall was an interesting way to go forward in the torture genre with gore but actually not that much humor soso acting and tons of blood its a rent it if generally just like horror films but its a definite buy for the die hard torture cinema fan check it out its good,cruel
three young friends are backpacking through europe in the hopes that theyll have the vacation of a lifetime tipped off by the promise of sex and drugs they travel to a small town in slovakia but their idyllic adventure is cut short when they learn that the town is a front for grisly murder and sadistic torture intriguing at first with believable characters and a genuine atmosphere of tension and suspense then foolishly turns on overdrive with unrelenting violence gore and cruelty and little explanation for any of its repulsive occurrences you actually care about these characters but while viewing the horrid barrage around them you have to ask yourself whats the point not for the squeamish is a drastic understatement ,cruel
might be the most upsetting film ive ever seen the director was amazed when the film received an rrating instead of nc17 and i agree the film starts innocently enough with two american backpackers living it up in amsterdam with their icelandic traveling buddy but when their quest for sex and debauchery takes them to a mysterious in a quiet eastern european town the guys find themselves in a world more disturbing than anything they could have imagined the scenes of torture in this film are absolutely brutal and even fans of conventional horror may find themselves flinching and squirming at times but just when you begin to think youre watching nothing more than a 45 million snuff film the film changes direction and shifts into high gear eschews the modern thriller convention of the more plot twists the better and simply goes right for the jugular and the gut the film certainly hits both targets and it doesnt let go until the very end famed japanese horror director takashi miike makes a cameo appearance which is not surprising as all his movies are full of graphically horrible scenes as does this movie quentin tarantino is credited as an executive producer but i think a lot of up and coming new directors use his name as a springboard to get their movies noticed these days it seems that quentin tarantino presents everything anyway if you are a graphic horror movie fan and havent seen this you owe it to yourself to check it out i just hope this doesnt turn out to be a fluke on the part of eli roth if he can make more movies as well as this one hell be a superstar eventually this great movie doesnt end with just the credits either it is capped off by the line i get a lot of money for youand that make you my bitch,cruel
the central concept of 2005 is a familiar one with the stranger in a strangeland motif having been used in a number of great similarlyminded horror films of the last thirtyyears most notably in john landiss classic black comedy an american werewolf in london 1981 and again more recently in films such as wolf creek 2005 and them 2006 the concept is one that lends itself to ideas of paranoia unease uncertainty and helplessness as we realise that there is no one to turn to and no one to trustthe film isnt entirely successful with the usual drawbacks of director eli roths particular style resulting in the usual attempts at crude fratboy type humour wanton aggression vicious violence and knowing nods towards sexism misogyny and perhaps even xenophobia all getting in the way of the more important factors like tension terror and real believable characters like his mentor quentin tarantino you get the sense that roth has clearly seen a lot of films and can borrow reference and pastiche with the best of them but unlike tarantino you also get the sense that he doesnt really love films but rather is in awe of the violence that they present to him his first film cabin fever 2003 attempted to revive the splatter film genre with a combination of romeros zombie horror and raimis kids in a cabin theatrics with knowing references to films such as sleepaway camp dawn of the dead the crazies deliverance sothern comfort evil dead and the last house on the left sadly for all the clever references buckets of gore and sporadic bursts of ta the film was completely devoid of all sense of character or empathy giving us a film that failed to create any kind of emotional resonance with the audience or anything that made an impression after the final credits had rolledhowever roth has certainly rectified some of these problems with which overcomes the complete lack of anything approaching real character and his shallow attempts to pay lip service to more talented filmmakers such as tarantino and takashi miike whos work roth seems to completely misinterpret on almost every level by at least having an interesting concept an air of dramatic mystery and some truly imaginative death sequences the most successful scenes are obviously those closer to the end of the film in which we have an attempt to escape resulting in a pretty fraught chase sequence and finally we actually start to feel something for the characters some would say that its too little too late but i feel it ends the film on a high note and proves that roth just might be able to reign in his more adolescent tendencies to one day produce a truly great filmanother thing i liked about it was the scenes that hinted at a central mystery or conspiracy in particular when two of the central characters search the small eastern european village for their missing friend which for me conjured images of dario argentos early works such as the bird with the crystal plumage 1970 the cat o nine tails 1971 and deep red 1975 as well as that kind of uncertain mysterious slightly menacing atmosphere from nicholas roegs dont look now 1973 it also goes back to the idea presented in the aforementioned an american werewolf in london and its less successful parisian set sequel 1997 with the travelling companions straying off the beaten track and being punished for it again bringing to mind films like deliverance and sothern comfort as welli suppose you could argue that some of roths more immature touches make it impossible to feel anything for these characters mostly as a result of them being somewhat underwritten and underdeveloped its never quite as bad as part ii which is really about nothing other than upping the ante on gratuitous gore with the deaths and the suffering of that particular film used only as a means of titillating the blood lust of teenage boys not that i have anything against violence in cinema you understand but certainly the old adage that a little goes a long way is undoubtedly true for me the most memorable scenes of violence are the ones that hold the most dramatic weight the ones that feel real and very much believable where we can feel for the characters in that situation and apply our own various psychological fears and anxieties alongside it something that manages to pull off with those frantic final momentsadmittedly there is plenty here that audiences might find disgusting or maybe even offensive but there is also a decent story that manages to pull you in despite the overall lack of style and the childishness of some of roths lurid scenarios unlike its shallow unimaginative sequel offers more than mindless entertainment for a postpub friday night in with some genuinely inventive moments of violence and that great 20 minutes towards the end which points the way forward to the kind of high tension roth should be going for not a masterpiece by any stretch but regardless an inventive and original idea that holds our attention for the duration of the film,cruel
may contain spoilers im not sure who really benefits from these movies that are sponsored by a big name by which im talking about the quentin tarantino presents part of the title he did it with hero and the protector also and spielberg has also done it in the past with landis and dante movies they have nothing to do with the production of the movie so i assume its just a promotional thing for both the movie and the sponsor but if it gives a minor good movie a bigger profile then fine as long as its a good moviethis is speaking broadly an amalgam of american werewolf in london and saw two young male american backpackers are travelling around europe amsterdam in fact and are given the opportunity to stay at a particular where well lets say fun and women are abundant there is of course a catchthe movie then after a slow start i must say moves into the realms of what am i talking about the realms of it degenerates rapidly and graphically into butchery the guys are lured by gorgeous gals into basically what is a slaughtertorture house where sick people with lots of money can live out their macabre fantasies on the bodies of terrified individuals making use of bolt cutters chainsaws blow torches and well you name it theres dismemberment screams tendon cutting and gore galore which im sure is more than satisfying for those who like this kind of thingi did squirm a little at some of the renditions but in retrospect it wasnt the visual depiction that shocked me more the idea of it which unsettled me and for which i give due respect its nice to know that the power of suggestion is still being employed in this age where anything that can be imagined can be visually presented that little thing that creeps in behind your mind and lurks there and keeps you unsettled for days afterward is far more powerful and memorable and is what keeps you thinking and talking about itso like i said apart from the slow start i can recommend this but with the warning that it will claw at the back of brain for a while after viewingyou certainly wont look at an electric drill the same way again,cruel
had it not been that this film reminded me slightly of one of the films i myself had written i may have classed this as an massive pile of crapit takes absolutely ages to get the actual point of the film and if someone says that it was just building character before the gore because the gore isnt what the films about then youre wrongeli roth and quentin tarantino obviously have some seriously deranged mental issues that they really need to get sorted outthe reason the extreme violence and horrific torture is in this movie is because there is absolutely no other substance to iti kept on waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen but the entire second half of the movie is just completely filled with horrifyingly graphic and unnecessary mutilation the only point of which is to indicate how horrific it can be for an american to leave california for any kind of explorationit is essentially bigging up america and its citizens probably one of the reasons why mr roth bases the entire film in europe because the europeans of course are all off their nutsjust note i am not genuinely taking a swing and europeans because i am one myselfquite honestly the finale is also thoroughly disappointing because it was one part of the film that they could have done something really effective with and yet its just another damned gore festenough jabbing at the content of this turdfilled sludge of a movie i just have to mention how completely awful the sound mixing is on the audio track most of the movie its a perfect volume with good sound effects and a convincing sound scape but where the crew were really trying to make an impact in the gore sequences as im sure they were  because eli roths directorial incompetence sure as hell wasnt going to make an impact anywhere else this film fails miserablyi know that maybe im being a bit too critical of a piece thats simply supposed to make witless teenagers scream and jump and be generally terrified although me being a teenager myself this did none of the forementioned things for me i did not jump scream or feel at all scared at any time the only thing that i felt was severe nausea and a massive cringing sensationim glad to say that i managed not to throw up all over the place but i heard reports of people having to be helped out of cinemas when this film was released because they were passing out and throwing up i cant really admit that this could have been on any level a successful reaction to this movie because at the cinema people just want to either laugh cry or be really really scared what they dont want is a day of bed rest with regular aspirin and stomach crampsall this put together makes a hideous formula that somehow produced this travesty of cinema ,cruel
i gave this a five out of ten for the last 40 minutes of the film the first half is a bad imitation of a teen sex porno comedy with a lot of nudity the characters two americans and an icelander backpacking across europe are poorly developed and only one who is portrayed as possibly being a homosexual is even developed at all and oddly he gets one of the worst deaths in the movie after the bad porno crap and all that the movie starts getting good the last person one of the americans of course ha ha makes a desperate escape and the girl he humped is in the plot the whole time gasp he saves a japanese woman whose face has been blow torched off butshe kills herself then the last person brutally kills someone and the endit was an ok movie most of it was stupid but the last half hour or sois okay,cruel
this is an excellent example of the new torture porn horror whereas captivity and saw are poor movies with little plot or subtexts this film explores the american view of europe being a strange place with strange people it also displays three guys and their three hobbies sex drugs and being abusiveeli roth portrays amsterdam and slovakia as drug infused violent places but they are perfect for this movie the tension is intense i was hooked from the beginning its a bit different for the first half an hour its like a eurotrip with sex drugs and idiotic behaviour from the three main characters the remainder is very clever we have a wide variety of nationalities and the interesting treatment of the americans the insidiousness of the setup and intelligent use of ordinary looking men being so evil is brilliant the real villain was not who i expectedjay hernandez paxton was impressive and you really were behind him beating these sick peoplewhat i really liked was the constant uneasiness throughout the movie every scene has a sense of shadow darkness and that the character is going to find himself in trouble roths cabin fever was good but this is better i was mistaken before i saw this in thinking it is torture porn and consistent violence but it manages to combine a real storyline and gives depth to the characters rare in horror movies and when the violence did come it was not gratuitous but real and grim i particularly liked the setting the factory like building had a real sense of unease and the close attention to detail with the tools and grotty walls accentuated the premise if you like horror you will love this but even if you dont you will enjoy it manages to crossover a rarity in horror,cruel
ill start with the basic plot 3 teenage boys backpacking in europe head to a slovakian city to get laid they do so but they get butchered thats the story more or less if you like gory films but want a more interesting story the saw films should please youits not the bloodiest film one would see if you compare it to movies like braindead evil dead and nightmare on elm street however those movies used over the top amounts of blood for comic effect whereas has absolutely no comic tone and its very real looking so fans of gory makeup effects wont be disappointedas a scary movie its pretty scary and itll have you on the edge of your seatacting wise theres nothing special here but they can act like theyre genuinely scared or in pain unlike the cast of the friday the 13th filmsoverall the gory effects and scares dont really make up for the weak storyline,cruel
before was released it was announced as the most bloody and violent film ever showed this of course increased the expectations a lot but i must say that it is nowhere nearly as violent as it is cranked up to bedsure has it scenes but it has a general problem if you want to make the most bloody and disturbing film ever made then you need to show the graphic horror and not just make hints to it a few scenes made me chill  the scene where paxton is cutting kanas dangling eye with a scissor almost made me puke but this was almost it it is way too easy to let the dutch businessman grip a power drill and then remove the focus to other torture instruments while hearing josh screaming in pain in the background and then afterwards show him with holes in the body  the pain doesnt get to you it is way too easy to make a nasty sound of the businessman cutting joshs achilles tendons without showing the cut itself but just make a cutting sound and in the end it is all too easy just to cut his throat letting the camera go black with the sound of a cut without seeing it besides watching a decapitated head referring to olis death without showing the surgery isnt more disturbing than watching any other horror movie with torn limbs to be honest i expected a lot more graphic violence and i was a bit disappointed with the gore i got now that was supposed to be the most disturbing and violent film everthe cast works very well and especially eythor gudjonsson as oli is simply hilarious he makes a perfect performance jay hernandez and derek richardson are good as well and especially derek richardsons torture scene is one of the emotionally strongest in the entire movie  no wonder he was nominated to an mtv movie award for best frightened performancebut take a note a film doesnt need to have blood guts and violence to be good but when its announced as one of the most frightening films ever made it sets certain expectations is definitely not a bad movie oh no the premise is scary as hell and the film works really fine as both a funny an unpleasant thriller i still enjoy watching it but dont expect any more gore or torture than the average for these kind of films,cruel
directed by eli roth begins as a story of two young americans backpacking through europe looking for fun sex drugs and more fun this section of the film is quite sexually explicit which seems to suit the ora of the film and it does introduce the characters with some depthwhen the unsuspecting youths are lured into a secret murder for profit business as potential victims the movie does become a very graphic gorefest that is pretty disturbing despite the fairly obvious low budget effectsthere is slightly more here than some people have given credit for there is some reasonable acting on show some strong ideas and a pretty interesting story for the most part however by the end of the movie i was left wondering what was the point 610 its more than a just a gorefest but a classic it is not maybe a cult movie one day only time will tell,cruel
totally creepy but awesome at the same time i loved it i do appreciate horror movies and this one was absolutely tremendous well the story about those guys who only travel to get high and get girls is kinda ordinary nowadays so its the only thing i didnt like anyway what this guys went out to do is exactly the kind of thing that those mean men are waiting so i think the movie developed in very good way  at first it shows us the good side of life and traveling and then it shows us that it doesnt always finish the way we want it has a good moral  its true we have to live and have fun but we should never trust in everything that strangers tell us in this case a stranger tells them to go to bratislava but not to get girls the movie is well done all that torturing is quite scary but it really looks realnow i just cant wait to see the next one,cruel
warning the information contains spoilers to this movie do not read if you havent watched the film to everyone who hashasnt seen the film and want to know if its worth watching or not please do not read this form watch the movie first then read this bulletin thank you this movie was decent it has its ups and downs the storyline for example wasnt very strong and there was to much gore and little fright fright is the main quality to horror movies gore is just added to make it better in different ways by grossing out the viewers and making it realistic so that each time you see the gory part itll be easier to watch and that you can understand the movie better horror movies these days are very bad to be honest the story lines and screenplays are very hard to perform and perfect it out so that viewers can enjoy it and the acting is very important too otherwise you cant take the character seriously if they cant act the good things about this movie was that the acting was good it has its moments in both gore and fright but more of gore and its worth watching compared to other horror movies these days the ways in which the main character survivesescapes in this movie is very difficult to understand and a lot of viewers that watched this movie think its bull or he just got lucky but if you look on the bright side how else is the main character going to live if the main character died whats the point of watching this film it would be hard to make a sequel to live up to the original without knowing what really happened that is why when you saw how paxton escaped at first then heard the scream of the asian girl i think shes asian he went back to her and rescued her when he could have escaped without having the risk to get caught but he succeeded when 9 times out of 10 he would have died if it was real and not a movie the reason that the directors and script writers do that is to show the heroic side of the character and that heshe can show their true self in the movie to show that heshe is worth watching and worth living that is why in horror movies when viewers are watching the film they will say get out of the housedont open the door it basically creates a mood and gets you excited to see what happens because everyone is like that but when the survivor escapes they have to have a moment of heroic time people say so that its more interesting and that the main character escapes and leaves just like that that is not interesting it just shows that the writerdirecter rushed the film and that its not worth viewing i am basically saying that paxton did this and he was the hero of the film he avenged his friends at the end and escaped thanks to the asian girl because of her distraction to hope on the train please read this and think things over with this movie even if you hated it just look on the bright side and accept it for the way it is thank you all for reading this and hope that you all agree with meps i give 910 because horror movies are not perfect these days for a 10,cruel
the premise of the story bad people paining to see others suffer fine slow start up teen sex romp beginning it is what it is so fine roth says he is showing americans being idiots in europe i understand the point have lived in a few countries over here for 10 years and know the realities of the former occupied countries better then many of the native western european counter parts as i have been living and working and not just popping over for sex tripsso the point is this one is left particularly the american audience with a feel that slovakia is a near lawless society with gangs of rouge children waiting in the shadows to take their next victim if the person doesnt kick up some coin or gum roth is being arrogant if not racist in his little in sites to the society that said i find most american film that makes some attempt to put itself into a european back drop often missing the nuances but hey if your experience is rich hollywood person who visits europe in 5 star luxury or the occasional trips to cannes well all you have to fall back on is the superficial view you have outside your chauffeured limo,cruel
is a movie that revolves around two american men backpacking through europe as a life experience they meet a young man from iceland along the way and join up with him as they travel from to the basic idea of the movie is disturbed businessmen pay big money to torture and kill people what a concept right as does deliver many unpleasant scenes of blood guts and beyond i do feel this movie had one major flaw when you first start watching this movie you will slowly start to ask yourself and others in the room if you are really watching the right movie why thats because the first 30 minutes of the story seems more like a national lampoons movie than any horror i personally feel they took way too much time to get into the heart of the story with all that said it did a very good job at depicting a disturbed world of torture the idea of that even slightly being possible makes me sick many of the scenes are very graphic and are probably not recommended for the light of heart overall the concept and torture scenes accomplished the mission of great horror cinema the over stretched story packed with sex and partying was a bit much i would recommend saw over any time if someone asked my opinion i feel the original saw was a better movie in every aspect and had many good qualities but slacked in a smooth storyenjoy,cruel
despite this being a well directed and effective film i feel this like many other horror films has been overrated in terms of gore slogans like the sickest film youll ever see grace the front coverokay maybe if you only watch like 5 films a yeari found the gore only came later on in the film the first part of the film dealing more with the 3 carefree young travellers as they go exploring in amsterdam the unpleasant aspect of the film is not the actual on screen violence more the way in which the 3 travellers are lead astray promised beautiful women at this too good to be true place of pleasure all they have to do is catch a train and go there viewing becomes increasingly uncomfortable when you see just how wrong they were to go there it seems they are 3 decent people alone in a sea of scheming strangers and evil twists they are in unfamiliar territory everyone appears to be hostile you can feel the earlier energy in the film disappear as what was supposed to be a trip of a lifetime turns deadly serioushowever when the violence does come it is pulled of with precision and skill no tired clichs no overblown heroics just upfront depictions of one human being relentlessly sadistic to another it is the idea which is revoltingbusiness man paying big bucks just to be able to torture somebody for kicks the actual scenes of physical torture are brief but intensely graphic for their short periodif you want all out gore and violence is not what your after watch the remake of the hills have eyes for that under the talented direction of eli roth is an insight into the darker side of human will and deals with how far some people will go to try something new,cruel
is the second film by eli roth writer and director of cabin fever which i did not like personally i found that however was an improvement although i think roth is still warming up shows that roth can make a movie with smart intentions towards its structure but unfortunately it falls short of what it could so easily be a nearly unbearably intense horror film instead of being scary like the slowly paced mysteriously gleeful exposition seems to prepare us for it becomes a gorefest and a chase film that is all enjoyable but roth has yet to truly scare mewhat i especially love about is that roth demonstrates his complete lack of fear or hesitation in giving an audience complete satisfaction of their anger and frustration and yet at the same time he is very patient with his story roth lets his characters be human and whole in the most interesting avenues to employ realistic approaches to them one of them being to masquerade them as token fratboy slasher film stick figures and at the same time they are impatiently furiously monstrously vindictivethe films scenes of gore are range in effect and they are all good there are very brief yet extremely disturbing images and there are extensive scenes that are actually quite fun because of the suspense weaved by the clever situation that faces graphic violence at point blank rangesimply doesnt have the impact it needs to be what its supposed to be it doesnt pack a punch it packs more of a john cleese eye poke,cruel
i watched cabin fever eli roths first directorial effort and thought it was fantastic when came out though it was one of those movies that people talk about incessantly among these are saw and the silence of the lambs when i finally got around to seeing it only recently i certainly was not disappointedwhilst i believe that cabin fever is slightly superior though i thought the bowling alley massacre flashback was a bit unnecessary shows that eli has made improvements as both a writer and a director he writes some great characters like the wannabe surgeon and the crazy american torturer though none compare to the young police officer winston in cabin fever and the violencewell thats where a lot of the genius comesjust like texas chainsaw massacre before it people were saying that this is bloodiest most violent thing theyve ever seen but in fact a lot of the violence takes place off screen when you do see it though its never irrelevant and its always brief a lot of it is really evoked through sound as a result people leave the cinema thinking that they have witnessed a person getting things done to themeli also adds in a little political commentary for good measure the fact that americans are more expensive than other nationalities presumably because everyone wants to get their revenge on themi also really liked how jays character manages to get his revenge on just about everyone at the end of the film and how he decides to do it instead of getting into a situation where he has to do it my favourite scene is of course the bathroom scene at the endpeople who dont like this film either just plain dont like it or just dont look past the gore and violence to see all of these details overall this is a very good film which could have been much worse had it not been eli roth and quentin tarantino behind it cant wait for part 2 however im a little less optimistic about cabin fever 2 but well just have to see,cruel
perhaps because of all the hype and all this talk about how incredibly scary and disgusting this movie is i found this movie to be not scary at all yes the concept is disturbing but visually it didnt make my stomach turn once i was waiting and waiting and waiting for the scenes everyone was talking about and when they finally showed up they were almost comical ive seen way scarier flicks to be honest i even find the saw series to be scarier than not to say the movie was terrible its just not at the level of horror i imagined it to be i cant believe i was afraid to watch this flick maybe ive become way too desensitized now thats scary,cruel
im actually amazed that this film has made as much money as it did it had very bad acting and extremely cheesy gore that really isnt realistic and doesnt have an effect on anybody and if it did that person must be a weaklink the story is dumb and the movie itself is really only an hour of really dull sex and than twenty to thirty minutes of very cheesy gore this film should never have been made and eli roth needs to get a different job because making movies isnt his thing thats for damn sure and he should never ever ever ever write another film in his career this film is dumb dont waste your money or more importantly your time lifes short afterall,cruel
after have seen eli roths impressing cabin fever my expectations on was some what through the roof and yeah luckily i cant say that i was disappointed once i saw it i remember that when i bought it on dvd the girl at the register looking at the cover said something like oooh this looks disgusting and i said yeah thats kind of the pointbut i must confess that the movie was not quite what i expected in a good way as a fact i thought it was going to be much more stupid that roth would have let himself go after the success of cabin fever but despite its simplicity is really a pretty complex story ofcaurse the idea of teenagers getting sliced and diced is not new its whats happening between the torn off limbs and splattered guts thats interesting fresh and disturbingthe story anyway is about two americans backpacking through europe that wind up in a quiet slovakian town after hearing of all the easy girls residing at the local when their icelandic friend then suddenly disappears they start wondering what is really going on behind the polished facade and after that things get really uglynow what i thought was great about was not only how raw and uncompromising it was some scenes brought out thoughts like how can a studio release this it is absolutely gut twisting in its presentations of all different ways of hurting and killing people but then again not all are of a physical nature and that is what im getting at it is the very concept of the story that is more terrifying than the actual display of blood gore and violence hey its just a movie after all the idea of an enterprise making money on putting unaware tourists at the disposal of bored businessmen detached with their animal selves  that the movies villains are not the usual psycho killers but very ordinary people  is far more chilling than fake bloodyet is not entirely a story of evil to me its more a portrait of the backside of modern society where people are too busy making money love lies work plans and so on as the movies antagonist the dutch businessman puts it while eating his lunch with his hands i think that we have lost our relationship to food we are no longer in touch with the primal being living inside us and that can sometimes be a stressing thingand i think that maybe that is also part of the reason why we love horror movies,cruel
the first time you see youre in for a shock not the shock that sends you scuttling for the door more the kind of shock that gets you scratching your head puzzled sure european babes with ridiculously hot bodies no taste and ample generosity sounds good perhaps it was an promo ad for tourisim board of amsterdam     for a roadtrip movie perhaps this was directors eli roths method of settling the audience in a certain mood and then turning the tables on them instead of the usual whendoigottagripmychair wait if so it was carried wayway too farits when the horror starts that a hint of what all those awesome posters promised begins im not revealing anything but the idea and setting really taps well into those subtle unconscious fears the xenophobic fear of the unfathomable visage of east europeans the desolate industrial culturewhite slavery and the alienation of a tourist who realizes who perhaps stayed a bit too long and starts to see the postcard picture slip that and the core of the plot the frightening possibility of the hobby practiced being a contemporary reality when that thrill of power cant be sated enough its not that big a stretch of imagination to give the director his due the moral horror is slightly explored further in the scene with the gungho americanbut that aside for reasons unknown when it comes to the actual crunch the director pulls short perhaps it was the studios time limit  but there was a heck of a possibility of exploiting the idea further the character development was sketchy and ollies euro openess was ridiculous the only truly funny touch was the cameo by director takeshi miike the oriental dude in the shades outside the arthouse and man was that apt its worth giving a shot only if you dont know the plot and dont mind the money spent to really get the goods which this movie promised id recommend you watch takeshi miikes audition and ichi the killer a fair bit of warning  you wont be the same ever again ,cruel
i liked an earlier comment bad things happen to bad people if you would like to understand better why americans are not very welcome around the world unless their capture and pending torture jacks up the price ie value of them this is a great example send some creepy bratty american college boys on a europe tour have them cuss and swear and using the fword in every third sentence even when they are pleading for their very life have them treat anybody with disrespect and loathing including the girls they want to have sex with oh i forgot the absolutely boring fake teenage sex parties in a public youth you put all that into a movie and the result is predictable gigo garbage in  garbage outi wonder if anyone could show me what the point of such a movie would be it cant have been an interest in horror nothing in this movie was scary just plain repulsive because it was done so badly the builtup toward the gruesome scenes is plainly annoying these college boys are immature brats rude and anything but likable who cares what happens to themwe get a few hints of what lies ahead when they meet a strange meat lover in their train compartment whom they again meet later in the dungeons of some eastern country of course where unspeakable evil things can happen it would have been maybe an interesting horror movie if we had learned what really motivates those rich patrons failed  wannabe surgeons and other american cash paying thrill seekers but those characters are mere shells of types shallow and totally uninteresting we dont even get the feeling that they are really getting a kick out of the horrid stuff they are doing to their victims its all so mechanical and that hunchbacked dungeon clean up maid who incinerates the remains of victims what a sorry hoot no hannibal lecter silence of the lambs here anywhere no fear of looming danger like in aliens no identification with any of the characters just dull disgust with a wannabe horror movie movie making for two reasons gratuitous violence without a plot and box office revenues do they give out awards for that,cruel
i would warn anyone who cant take extreme drawnout torture scenes away from this film it sounds obvious but the bs i watched it with told me there were no torture scenes i dont want anyone else to go through the trauma unwillingly the horrific and unnecessary violence is a real pity in my opinion because there are some great storyline elements acting and twists the characters were original and the storyline developed in a very different way to what i expected which is often unusual with modern american horrori didnt think cabin fever was brilliant but at least it didnt leave me wishing like id never watched it as i said some great elements in are ruined for me by absolutely horrific violent torture,cruel
3 guys on holiday in europe check out the local hedonism to the point of what is no more than a pointless exercise in nudity and bonkingso far so bad after that lot is over the real horror began when they visited a place called the factorythe story had now become a case of living up to the blurb of the goriest sickest movie youll ever see which it began to do after the guys became separated and one by one were taken off to be tortured to death naturally there had to be plenty of artistic license taken herethe first guy and the one who ended up escaping after somehow finding he had a gun in his pockethad his leg prodded with a drill and it showed it going throughwhen he finally escaped the film seemed to have forgotten he was supposed to be chained to the chair but later he was able to function as if hed just tripped uphis shredded hand he covered with a glove he found in a cupboard in reality the first jab with the drill would have killed him and no way could he have removed himself from the chair or even moved his hands around to produce a gun but we live in an age where films can make anything happen like cartoons the special effects were very convincing and very sick but no way after that 50 minute waste of time in amsterdams red light district could this movie hope to be 100 horror,cruel
i just saw the picture of a clip from the movie in playboy magazine the shot was from the scene where two sexy girls and three boys were sitting in a spa i watched the movie for sex and nudity but as the movie progressed it started grabbing me by the balls the more i watched the more i got into it there was a time when i realized that i was not breathing at all and then i paused the movie walked around drank a little water and then resumed playback the story line is just absurd the director did not tell why the killings were being done i think there should have been some confrontation with the killer in the end before he was finally slaughtered by our hero terentino is a great director and his ideas are more like fascinations but they do glue you to your seat until the end the movie is not for weakhearted as it contains lots of blood and violentgruesome scenes it reminded me of texas chainsaw massacre wrongturn and many other movies based on the same theme but one thing sets this film apart from them all its a must watch its naked babes  action  thrill  adventure  blood  mystery,cruel
before i even saw this movie i was worried not that the movie would terrible but that the movie would be almost too successful the idea is that for the last half of this 95 minute movie you are watching guys getting tortured maimed and disfigured take away the makeup and the fact that this movie involves actors and you are basically watching a snuff film not really scary but shocking yucky too there werent any real plot twistscabin fever was better and had a real story tooi can hardly believe there is a part 2 in the making sick to say the leasti hope i dont have to watc h it with my boyfriendwhat input does tarantiono have i wonder is he just a nameholder or is he part of the creative teamthere are so many better films out thyere evedn in the horror genre,cruel
the general feeling i got after seeing this film was that it was split into three different segments or thirds the first third was something out of a teen comedy film resembling something such as american pie or eurotrip the second third was the gory part with the film relying on violence and shocking images to see it through with the final third solely guilty of resembling a gritty criminal revenge film although these things were done correctly and the director made the most of the material he had in mind was a disappointment overallsome things that went well early on included how the film represented women going into it in a first viewing you might feel a little disgusted at the way they are represented as loose and as absolute tramps in comparison to anybody else each female character seems to come onto the other male characters very easily and none of them have any problems with any of them seeing them naked despite the fact they dont even know each others names although this actually fools you as later on in the film when a twist involving two of the girls at the in revealed the general feeling throughout this opening segment is that girls are mere objects whom dont care who they pull or how they do so even if the representation is accurate in amsterdam you have to doubt whether or not a lot of the happenings in this film actually occurs on holidays or wheather its just a screenwriters wild imagination at an attempt to shock a filmgoing audienceanother clever piece of filmmaking was the sole character of josh although relatively unsure throughout the film nervous even i feel the audience maps onto him the most the character is not sure of his surroundings weary and rather tentative i feel that any member of the films target audience watching the film whom have not been to amsterdam might be represented through this character as the surroundings seem new and intimidating for him evidence of this can be seen when he is unsure about paying for sex at the brothel whilst his friends jump at the chance and even earlier on in the film when he tries to convince his two accomplices that maybe they should visit a museum or something instead this was quite clever and since the first proper deathtorture scene is him as the victim it made it all the more disturbing since the audience may have mapped onto him the mostwhere goes wrong apart from its three thirds structure flaw is suspense and horror yes the second third is horrible but is this really a horror film there are no jumps there is no real bad guy monstervillain character and there is nothing uncanny in the film at all just a bunch of european patrick batemans whom want to let off some steam on young adults in fact because of its realism its more of a comedy at first tragedy in the middle and then it ends with revenge action and drama we are shown the house of pain too early on when we learn what has happened to ollie spoiling the surprisesuspense and to be honest the film feels like a documentary for most of the opening thirty minutes as we follow these kids around as they smoke drugs and get laid its really quite disappointing as the film goes absolutely nowhere i realise that this was supposed to build up sympathy as we begin to relate to the characters but how can we relate to them the other two at least if we dislike them more and more due to their antics this is what happens when people think with their balls instead of their brains in fact an example of a better build up would be wolf creek which is a similar type of filmeven if the final third is a gripping revenge tale with a good mix of suspense as they try to escape disturbance as our hero has his conversation with an american torturer and gore as a girls eye falls out in the long run is a very disappointing and poorly structured film with too many incidences of content taking precedence over style,cruel
eli roths send up to sleaze aint bad it isnt just terribly good in its own right but i love the fact that hes making hardrrated horror for an exploitation film its tame youre not gonna get your frills here if you cut your teeth on stuff by deodato or even early peter jackson but you can still appreciate the fact that roth is making an effort to put the umph back into mainstream genre pictures is roth the wunderkind savior of horror no but hes tryingand you know what it is a decent little picture odes to suicide club takashi miikes cameo etc aside you can dig the film as an okay addition from roth lots of tna and a decent amount of gore and an okay story make it at least worth a watch,cruel
two americans and an icelander they meet en route are on a tour of europe theyre simultaneously taking the best drugs looking for the hottest women to shag and generally acting like complete jerks all the while in amsterdam a friend recommends they head to slovakia to check out all the smouldering single chicks there left behind by the war but as soon as they arrive on the train they get more than they bargained for what seems like paradise with unisex saunas and nightly sex games with two local sluts quickly turns into a nightmare when dum dum dum one of their number goes missing the only clue to his whereabouts is a mysterious phone message and picture from an asian girl guest in trying to track down their buddy our two remaining heroes get themselves embroiled in a bizarre slaughter house caper but the killing is not of animals but of humans and bloodthirsty rich folk pay thousands to get their kicks out of diy amputation and torturethe narrative arc of this movie can be split roughly down the middle part 1 ta part 2 gore what an accomplishment something for everyone as long as youre a teenage boy of course everybody else will probably quickly tire of the various irritating flaws that are sprinkled throughout take our three main characters for example if their sexist xenophobic cokesnorting behaviour doesnt make you feel intense hatred for them after 15 minutes than that tells me more about you than i care to know i hope the director didnt expect us to root for these losers because i for one couldnt wait for them to have their limbs severed and eyes gouged out fortunately my wishes were granted for the most partthe plot is simplistic to the point of once upon a time the acting is barely more than adequate but there is something strangely fascinating about it all which makes you watch till the end maybe youve heard a lot about from your friends about how shocking the violence is well sorry sunshine there isnt anything so graphic here you havent seen in the likes of saw and the hills have eyes a few nasty bits maybe but nothing to make cower behind your sofa just approach it for what it is a mediocre slasher with about 5 minutes of decent sex 20 minutes of decent bloodletting and the rest aimless filler that could easily be fast forwarded through at 100x the speed on your handy dvd controller sounds tempting then go for it 510,cruel
i have the unrated version of hostle i like it for the simple fact that it is the first movie in a long time that has actually made me shudder from the pure gruesomeness of certain scenes the script however leaves much to be desired although it seems to be more of a movie made for people who like blood guts and gore which it delivers spectacularly it is a teenage guy sort of movie with plenty of nudity blood drug usage and sex scenes the factor that makes this movie even remotely scary is that it taps into human cruelty on a level and scale that most other movies dont even think to you see the carnage and you see the people behind it not a very common thing in the movie world from what i have seen i would say that there are other movies from this genre that people should have as their first pick but this one is at least worth renting,cruel
id give the suspense a 7 the gore a 10 the storylineplot8ish it was a very powerful film but too much sex  drugs for my taste i mean thats all a part of horror flicks  movies in general these days but paid sex is just not my taste the plot was very original so id have to give the writer that much credit i wouldnt boost it to say that its one of the best horror flicks out there but must better than the typical girltriestorunawaybuttripsandtwistsherankle or guytriestostartthecartogetawaybutthecarstalls the best part of the movie was the ending no not that it stunk but i almost got up  cheered it was so satisfying maybe i have become a gorelover after all,cruel
people told me a lot about this film so i was warned that i am getting myself into some kind of weird hardcorehorrorsoftcoreporn flick there were some really disgusting scenes and the terror of the victims at times really gets to you i must say though that i am mainly unimpressed the movie is pushing some buttons some reviews said the event in this film inevitably reminds you of what went on abu ghraib what ruins it is the fact that the film just lacks any intellectual depth so it feels strange that people will make movies like that just for entertainment there are also some pretty violent scenes of revenge so i suggest any affiliation of this to politics or some serious effort to criticize some things that are going wrong in this world can be condemned as unbelievable i was irritated overall with the way people in general are portrayed in this movie so eli roth thinks that everyone out there is obsessed with sex and violence i disagree all in all not terrible but definitely not a must see,cruel
this is not the most brutal film of all time though it does have its moments its not really that scary either it is a film about the director trying to make you squirm like the man who build a rollercoaster and like a rollercoaster i laughed through most of it out of enjoyment it entertained me all the way though and if for nothing else the women it in were gorgeous what an achievement in casting this is a film to see is you like violent films if you are more the thinking mans texas chainsaw nogore massacre you may find this rather dull and lacking in thought eli roth though is not trying to make us think he is trying to make us want to tear our eyes from the screen well i have to say i did not final review could have been better but could have been a hell of a lot worse like that godawful piece of rubbish saw or any of that lot anyway a good funny entertaining little film 710,cruel
my word i did like this film very gritty but what was with paxton played by jay hernandaz i kept thinking i was seeing things the film was great but the actors not so watch and see he grins the whole waaaaaaaaay through the film complete turn off his friends die hes grinning hes tortured hes grinning hes having sex hes grinning great actors in horrors are hard to come by these days but were talking outside of the barrel now but there are some great gory bits to get you going saw 1 and 2 come to mind this is set in slovakia so you feel deserted and alone like the characters also a bit like wicker man where you are the fool among the majority ie the townsfolk who all seem to be a part of the torture everything came together like it should do this is a horror film not rocket science i watched and enjoyed apart from all the grinning from paxton,cruel
i give this movie a 510 only because of the smoking hot and naked women truly the only highlights of the movieone wouldnt even have known it was a horror flick without seeing the false preview claiming that the gore was so bad that people were actually walking out of the theatersi think they were walking out because they already saw eurotripthe acting was ok and had a setting they really could have worked with providing they changed its genrei think it got such good reviews because of the hollywood suck ups cmon anything with quentin tarantinos name on it has to be good right,cruel
well this one falls smack dab in the middle of the did i like it or not zone on one side it had a sort of fresh spin on gorefest films with the underground snuffnightclub setup but on the other hand the story was so like the old 70s gorerevenge films like i spit on your grave and last house on the left that it was predictable and upsetting just for upsetting sakei think that if they wouldnt have made it so much like a highschool sexfestslasher film it would have been more believable and much darkeras it is i may have to cancel my hedonism trip to germany prague and the ukrane now,cruel
i think this movie was ok  but i dont think it was scary enough it may have worked better as a documentary if im not totally wrong the people behind this movie wanted to make a documentary on similar things that actually is going on in eastern parts of this world before making this the effects in the movie is quite ok the girls are very pretty and scenery is nice it might took a bit to long before there action started the long story before they came to slovakia did really have little to do with the plot in this movie the main reason anyway fore giving it a mediocre score is that it really didnt scare me,cruel
strange movie its like a product of americas post 911 mentality meets porkys in my opinion its worth a look but im not sure what its trying to say if its about american paranoia and the fortress mentality of everyones out to get us it works pretty well except for one thing the three leads are selfish dickdriven holes who deserve everything they get this may be eli roths point but i doubt any american hollywood director would have the cojones or the principles to assassinate his career by making a movie that pushes the view that americans abroad  including the troops in iraq  are not heroes or liberators but are in fact ignorant vulgar boorish interlopers once you take that out of the equation theres not much left  if its not a critique of american mentality  foreign policy then what is it purely in horror terms it fails dismally its neither disturbing suspenseful nor scary and in terms of gore it pulls its punches badly even on the unrated dvd so having said that 610 is giving roth the benefit of the doubt  maybe he really has tried to slide a subversive something into the american unconsciousness if he has then hats off to him  after all isnt that what really good horror is all about,cruel
the idea for this movie is actually good but the movie itself turned out to be quite bad in the beginning of the movie everything is just porn drugs and party the main characters are pretty annoying and they do not have any depth the one wants to party the other is supposed to be good and innocent but is just more like a common loser then the second part emerges they are caught and tortured and we are supposed to feel bad for them well that was in my case not what i felt the only thing i could feel was a bit of joy watching those dumb guys scream in pain  btw they didnt do a very good job most of the torturing scenes consists of bad acting and struggling to get free if the characters had been more likable from the beginning we would feel bad for them and then it would be a horror movie as it is said to be now i have been critic enough but there is not only bad things about it i could actually enjoy the second part of it because i had already realized that it was not to be taken to seriously so i just laid back and enjoyed the pointless gore even so i did not feel anything special when the credits started if i have to say what i think they should have done when they made this movie in order to make it better it would be to make the first part more meaningful and give the characters more personality  positive personality at least for one of them  and then chop them to pieces to make the audience feel something instead of just making the soft hearted nauseous and the gore loving ones smile in short terms a good idea but a movie that lags depth and meaning 510,cruel
a great dark film but when watching it it felt a bit bitter and that there was something completely unoriginal about it i can see the original storyline and ideas but there are too many rehashed ideas and moments put together to make something new i mean a lot of belieavability into the situation i mean its the ultimate sm torture but the locals truly give the feel of a cross between the locals from wicker man 1973 and chainsaw massacre i mean it even uses music from wickerman and a lot of the look and symbolism is there a lot of the scenes were graphic and cringing but i feel was kept to a good minimum as it should not take place as the dominant feature in visuals like saw did and some of the techniques were disturbing and cut scenes kept the imagination at a full which is always good with graphic scenes of this nature a few things bugged me the full vendetta involved in it and a few unessary scenes and it turned up completely random towards the end it became too random for me towards the climax and the little children were annoying and a pointless bit of child violence and gave a strange feeling of humour that wasnt needed or intentional a good watch but a film buff will notice too much of a collage of multiple films,cruel
the heightened violence and gore publicised in this film made me expect something of the horror and general downright scariness of films like saw although there were good elements to it and an exciting build up of tension until the explanation of everything was revealed something was missing ive found it hard to put my finger on what that was but i think it was the psychological tension you find in all good horror flicks it just didnt mess with my head enough to be the sort of film that stuck with me for days to make the comparison again to saw what scared me with that film was the way in which the tortures were devised sometimes without an excess of gore but in a way that played on the most scary situation you could imagine being faced with just went for gore,cruel
in this thoughtprovoking film eli roth cleverly uses a polarization of human emotional extremes as though it were something from dantes inferno for here we have three backpackers americans paxton and josh joined on their rounds by icelandic clown oli all in pursuit of hedonistic sensual delights yet concluding their wanderings in an unimaginable living hell from one end of the spectrum we go seeing the young males initially enabled to live out their wildest sexual fantasies to spewing vomit as they plead to their captors for mercy in the face of drills and chainsaws its powerful stuff the film is also highly atmospheric particularly in the underworld dungeon scenes when one can almost smell the detergent that is being sprayed against the the ensanguined walls in the aftermath of slaughter possibly the main factor which rather lets this movie down is the films failure to fully exploit the link between sadomasochism and sexual gratification imagine the impact of the american sadist engaging in an act of forced penetrative sex with his oriental victim as he removed her eye from its socket or the german chainsaw sadist perhaps indulging in an act of masturbation as he set about his butchery though admittedly this is hinted at by some of his facial expressions nonetheless a movie that is once seen never forgotten,cruel
i thought this was the lamest movie ive ever seen sorry to those of you who liked it but personally i thought it was predictable and gory which i dont find scary i didnt think my heart rate went above normal the entire movie the scariest movies are made with a lot of mood and preexisting tension going into a bad situation like this one the scariest movies are also made by showing less and telling more neither of which is the case for and i certainly didnt sympathize with the main characters the villains werent motivated enough and i wasnt satisfied with the ending there was no energy in the movie the whole movie was like a snatch and grab job at a liquor store poorly planned poorly executed this movie is boring and frankly uninspired sorry again to those who liked it but i need a lot more than blood and guts to get scared,cruel
i do wish i hadnt paid full price for this film thats not to say its all that bad but its certainly not worth owning the film starts off in that typical way in which all teen films start everyone laughing and joking and then works its way at a very well calculated pace toward the inevitable bloodshedtheres a fair amount of tension in the movie most of which is at the beginning where the general mood does not fit with the promises made on the boxthis is definitely a must see for fans of the horror genre but please give it a chance if you start the film thinking its gonna be awful that is all youll see of it but actually there is something deeply disturbing about the whole conceptthat said there is an over abundance of nudity and sex in the first half but then that just serves to provide a reason for the events of the second halfall in all the cast isnt bad at all the plot is no more gratuitous than any other horror film and the production is goodgive it a go if you like this kind of thing i think youll enjoy it,cruel
the beginning of the movie should be rated x lots of sex and naked women i was afraid the movie wasnt going to go anywhere except to the bedroom scenes i was wrong lots of blood and gore for all those who are looking for the excitement of a horror movie i have been to europe including eastern europe and enjoyed seeing the scenery buildings etc although in all honesty it doesnt matter a whole lot where it is taking place i guess because it is taking place in slovakia it makes it more believable for us westerners heck terrible things dont happen here jeffrey dahmer as i watched the movie i was able to figure out what would happen next most of the time but that can be said of most horror movies but we watch them for their shock appeal this is an average horror movie but if this is your genre of movie you wont want to miss it,cruel
pleaze check the reality tarantinos stuff are all excellent but this this is just so ordinary movie was okay as a horror movie but where the hell came slovakia there where no war for a long time maybe movie makers mean exjugoslavia countries spelling is not that far for the hollywood movie makers mostly dumbasses check the history all the people in the world are not that dumb like the joke u571enigma and all the others will this ever stop is there any true story which cannotwont be messed up to be totally different in the end what the hell means based on actual events its obviously total fiction like hollywoodbullshit always does tarantino sholud take away his name and based on actual events after that its a great fun,cruel
i was beginning to look forward to this film i like a good scare the films central idea the murder holiday thing is the only reason ive given this a 2 instead of a big fat 0the film is gross well not really in terms of graphic its not as graphic as it wants to be im sorry but none of the blood  guts etc looked real whereas another justasbad film the hills have eyes remake at least had decent effectsthe characters were all bumped off far too quick and there wasnt enough tension to frighten me it was obvious from the moment the characters spoke who was and wasnt going to survivethere wasnt enough going on in the killing place we should have seen more the film could have been disturbing disgusting and terrifying but it forgot what it was in all the hypeit could have been much better,cruel
i had high expectations for this film but was left dissatisfied before you rush out to blockbuster or add the movie to your rental list consider the following do you like films do you like stories unfortunately this film has very little story and even less direction it starts off like a soft porn porkys style film and descends into torture and horror but unfortunately the transition between the two parts of the film is so bad you could swear you were watching two movies were it not for the characters i felt id been short changed at the end but was relived to get there it was watchable but that is more to do with my expectation of a twist or a great conclusion which sadly never came disappointing,cruel
i got this film a couple of days ago because im only 16 i couldnt see it at the cinema but due to the amazing trailer i bought it the minute it was released on dvd and i can honestly tell you i was seriously let down because it states that the film is presented by quentin tarantino i was expecting a terrify horrific be sick in you popcorn box film but it is nothing like that this film is really just a huge build up to nothing but a a few shots of graphic violence and one or two jumps but besides that its nothing specialdirected by eli roth the film follows a group of backpackers travelling the world in search of excitement and sex in amsterdam the group are told of a located in bratislava with beautiful girls all gagging for it but when they get there they find out that the is not what it seems and more like a twisted holiday camp for wannabe psychopathsnow as ive already said the film does have some graphic scenes and it really does deserve its 18 certificate but for the first 20 minutes you would think that this is a sequel to eurotrip for example spoilerthere is a scene on a train in which a strange foreign man enters the boys compartment and starts talking later on in the scene he attempts to feel up josh derek richardson dumb and dumberer but is obviously turned down in a some what amusing style now if you have seen eurotrip you will probably remember a scene very similar to this also the film has a character list which is very similar to most teenslasher flicks firstly theres the sex driven character called oli eythor gudjonsson whos only objective is to get laid with as many girls as possible also theres the character who wants to be a bad ass but cant paxton jay hernandez and finally the quiet know it all who ive already mentioned josh derek richardson and because of this i dont believe that this film can be all that it can be now dont get me wrong the performances were great but i just dont think that these actors can really pull the performances off i mean take saw this was a terrifying film and not a teenager in sight which is the way it should bethis film was a serious let down and despite its few scares i wouldnt recommend it tarantino should never have put his name on thismilligan d,cruel
upon first seeing the tv spots for this i expected a fantastic well thought out thriller that i would now expect from tarantino kill bill aside eli roth did a great job advertising this film and catching the attentions of saw fans the movie itself is horrible it starts with three young men travelling from a drugs filled time in amsterdam to bratislava where they plan to get some sex from some of the girls who they have been told are there if you hadnt seen the opening title sequence you would think this is a remake of euro trip its even got them travelling by train and a creepy foreigner getting into their spot and touching one of the kids legs this is exactly the same as what ive seen before i came to this film looking for something different the film is mostly build up its 70 minutes of sex and confusion followed by 20 minutes of indescribable violence the film is predictable it doesnt tell a good story and it has an extremely clich ending it defys everything that i thought it would be the extreme violence asidebut hey at least it wasnt as bad as house of the dead,cruel
ive thought a bit how i should rate this movie on the one hand i can not deny being drawn into the suspense of the horror so in that sense the horror was succesful it sure gives you a scare or two not because of nicely timed shock effects not because of the gore but mainly the whole sociopath thing going on which in its semirealistic settings is just too sick the actual horror part of the movie somehow feels like it appears out of thin air after an extremely mediocre and dull start of the movie of bunch of teens going to amsterdam for sex and joints my immediate reaction was jeeez not again its getting old the storyline is as thin as paper and so are the characters the whole movie basically feels like an empty vessel with some vomit spilled next to it quite a disturbing movie really scary yes at times should you go see it no a waste of time,cruel
the first time i saw the title and setting of i thought it might be promising traveling through europe seems to be a fantasy of a lot of americans so you cant blame the makers for that but the way it has been brought and researched is utter crap its unbelievable how bad the accents are especially the dutch accents reminded me of goldmember austin powers same mistakeas an american living in holland i can fully assure you that i know what a dutch person sounds like speaking english and this is not it they portray dutch people as germans and everything east of germany as russian its almost racistthe actors apart from the childish sexobsessed leads are seemingly all from eastern europe that doesnt necessarily mean they are bad but in this case they are in the making of they even showed a drunk slovakian taxi driver who they decided to stick in the movie anyway due to lack of anything betterapart from the makers not knowing anything about the setting whatsoever the movie is mediocre not a bad idea having a sort of cult idea where people torture people for fun its just all soso if you want to laugh at a movie and not with it this is the one although i dont think thats what horror movies are intended for,cruel
no i do not think this movie was good and no my idea of the scariest movie in years is not a pornoturnedgorefest however connections with dlb aside actually gave you a very dark sickly feeling in your stomach while i do not consider this to be pleasant it means the creators of this film were both visually and atmospherically successful very few movie makers are capable of this admirable feat besides why else would you go to a movie about tortureforpleasure other than to be grossed out yes eli roth screwed up big time with cabin fever and yes was little more than a teen sex romp with some bloodshed much less than expected i might add but the fact that you can feel the horrifying sensation of helplessly begging for mercy at the hands of some sadistic surgeon in the middle of nowhere slovakia means that quentin tarantino must be doing something right,cruel
hmm i watched this movie the other day i think its a overall pretty decent movie does not have a real good story behind it but it a over all good movie if your looking for a good scare but you will have to ignore some of the cheep easy to spot fake things but yeah the beginning is sort of misleading starts off more as a comedy i think and they made the skinny pale guy look like the main character only to end up dieing at about the mid part of the movie no real good story like i said but its a good movie if your looking for a scare but dont watch this if you do not have a strong gut for really gory movies it tends to get really bloody and graphic at some parts and even made me a little sick at part but i would give this movie a good rating just as a horror movie,cruel
kinda like a scanner darkly it could have been amazing but it just didnt work out unlike saw saw took a good idea and turned it into a great movieand this movie had the most misleading trailers i have ever seen the scariest movie of the decade was actually written on the the dvd this movie was not at all scary couldnt they have said goriest or grossest or bloodiest film since thirty days ago when they came out with saw 2 i thought the movie was about some bleeped up people who kidnap a bunch of dudes and bleep with their minds and kill them in bleeped up ways i thought it was going to be another saw the beginning of the movie was the dumbest first hour of a movie i have ever seen the beginning was absolutely pointless with all that said the acting was very good jay hernandez is a damn good actor friday night lights world trade center and the movie redeemed itself after the the beginning but after he escaped from the place the movie actually turned into something worth watching although the only reason he escaped was cause the guy trying to kill him slipped and cut his leg off can u say retardedthat was amazing when he rammed the people that set him up and then came back and ran over that chick it was hilariousterrible beginning good acting good,cruel
finally saw on dvd last nightyes its got ta thanks for the the eurotrip yes its got lots of blood  gore achelles tendon my flinch moment yes its unrealistic japanese girl walking around without an eye cmon shed be unconscious from shock yes it was better than cabin fever but i didnt think much of cf yes im glad i borrowed the dvd but yes eli when you make h2 ill be sure to borrow that dvd too looking for more gratuitous scenes and overthetop carnagei think the 4 stars is generous for the schlocky entertainmentif i want horror again ill screen saw i ii at least theres a decent story and a well developed villain,cruel
recently i watched this film on my own thinking it would be a great horrorgore film and borrowed it off a friend how wrong could i be after seeing all the trailers on tv i got really hyped thinking it would match if not better films in a similar genre such as saw or hills have eyes but really after watching there was nothing like this present most of the scenes involve nothing what is expected of the film and all the horror bits you see are basically the ones shown in the trailer very poor indeed in fact for a horror film there was quite a bit of sex in it which i dont get at all really considering its hyped as a great gore film so in final i call this a porno with the odd 3 minutes of gore and stupidity spoilerand another thing since when do children walk about the streets in groups of 20 and ask for bubble gum and if not given they murder people with bricks poles and knives etcetera what kind of a place is this,cruel
is about three guys rambling around europe the plot is not that important within the hour people start being rendered into meat and meat byproducts this is pretty much in line with the preview which hinted at three horny guys looking for sex in europe and then getting drawn into a new level of r rated violence which is exactly what occurs without further nuance the only thing the movie adds to the preview is more violence it doesnt get deeper more clever or more interesting this could have had the power of bue velvet or last tango in paris but it quickly gets run through the hollywood formula which removes any trace of believability or interest instead its pretty much a retread of friday the 13th in which sexuallyactive teens are mutilated the moralism that feeds the countrythe characters are super bland they have the most normative of sex they make love to some supermodels the movie is little more than hetero boy wishfulfillment you get to see some boobs on hot chicks and theres enough homophobia to reassure nervous viewers theres no possibility the movie will veer into any unexpected direction you even get to hate europeans bonus and gay people are back to being twisted psychotic sadistic freaks double bonus the guy gets to be heroic and save the chick uh well sort ofgee what brave choices,cruel
anyone else find the only thing satisfying was the fact that they were frat boy twits oh and takashi miike has got to want those 15 seconds of his life back doesnt he know eli roth is a halfstep above uwe boll this whole thing felt like troma could have done it better with half the budget i am thinking 2 welcome to guantanamo would at least make for a more plausible and frightening piece of pop trash next time quentin decides to give a fanboy the use of his promotional skills lets hope he picks someone with at least an ounce of creativity save yourself from the lowbrow and track down a copy of ichi the killer,cruel
i really wanted to like this one more i have enormous respect and admiration for the people who made it strictly speaking it took what felt like a long time to get to the point of the film ive heard of the underground murder industry and believe me that is a scary world i enjoyed the lead up to the midway point in the film but it felt like two different movies without much connective tissue between them i also didnt feel empathy for the characters in the film that fall into jeopardy its probably because we spend so much time with them before the danger shows up that we realize that theyre not that likable i think we see too much of them and their juvenile behavior and it just wore thin kinda like nails on a chalkboard for me at least when the terror arrived like a train late to the station i guess i was too tired from standing waiting on it to enjoy the ride i hope 2 is more successful in these tricky areas and 3d and 4 the beginning and v hotel hell and 7 prey 2 heaven and ocho dark night of the gringos,cruel
for what reason i do not know ive been trying to avoid this flick for a while due to the bad reviews ive read and heard about it so it came the other day that i had the chance to see it and i took it im not really disappointed i guess i didnt expect too much of it did i for the plot the buildup didnt really move me at all i was more amused with the beautiful scenes being depicted in the latter part of the flick which are quite dark and for some reason the scenes brought my thoughts to the dark ages dont ask me whyi was heavily annoyed by some of the lines in the flick which gives a subtle boost to prejudices about europeans and americans and to what is supposed to be seperating us id rather see the flick without this generalizing crap lines but theyre there so lets try to forget about it and focus on again the beautiful scenes 510,cruel
this movie was kind of weak i think the movie was missing that little something that would keep our attention but it lacked that the good parts was the gore it sounds kind of nasty but its true eli roth had a good idea with this movie but he could of done different things to add that little something that would keep our attention on the movie the acting was ok jay hernandez does a great job on a mediocre script that tends to happen a lot in movies this is a one time movie which means that you watch the movie once and thats it its not like other movies that you can watch over and over good luck to eli on writing and shooting part two i will admit i am waiting for it to come out hopefully i will enjoy this one,cruel
it is just another lame b flick nonczech dont recognize czech cities labels spoken language in the background trains etc by the way the end was shot on pragues train station not in germany   and whats worse even slovak republic where the story is supposed to take place doesnt look like the poorest russian cities where people drive old vehicles volha and policemen can beat people on the road as it was shown in the movie but i liked the idea of luring western sex tourists into trap just to be killed by another type of touristsi have seen better movies shot in czech republic where czech cities substitute another places eg shanghai knights the lord of war tristan and isolda and so on,cruel
eli roth has joined forces with quentin tarantino for the follow up to his rather awesome debut cabin fever if the tarantino involvement was not warning enough that the film would be crap the internet buzz surrounding has been almost deafening with 12 year olds across america loudly claiming it to be the most gory horror film they have ever seen to cut to the chase  is not particularly gory or disturbing it is however a decent mainstream american horror film that showcases roths obvious ability and potentialroths debut was one of the most humorous and ironic horror films to be released in the past few years im usually not a fan of comedic horror but cabin fever is funny in such a subversive manner that it almost created its own subgenre one of the first things that becomes apparent on viewing is that roth has ditched the humour for a more straightforward approach this seems to be in line with the films obvious aim of returning to the aesthetics of the genre and exploitation classics of the 1970s where the violence is sadistic and often interspersed with gratuitous sex and nudity this lofty goal is noble indeed however despite a promising beginning the film never quite achieves what it sets out tothe premise of is inspired the idea of an organisation which sells rich businessmen the opportunity to kill tourists who have been rounded up in a local is just twisted enough to be plausible the film begins promisingly like a slightly more explicit version of a national lampoons movie travel plans quickly change when the main characters learn of a in bratislava full of beautiful seemingly amoral women josh paxton and oli leave amsterdam quicker than you can say buy some condoms and arrive in slovakia ready to party once in bratislava the blood finally begins to flow however much to my disappointment the results are far less gruesome and far more hollywood than imaginedfor all the talk of the cutting edge violence and sadism most of the action occurs off screen in fact most of the gore is pretty lame the film only comes close to its goal of hardcore gore during the torture scenes which by american horror standards are reasonably graphic the eyeball cutting scene is great and there is something about the misuse of power drills that does it for me every time that said anyone who has sat through asian nasties like naked blood or daughter of darkness will be scratching their heads at all the fuss and i really hate to think what haters would make of red room or heaven forbid some extreme measures filthit is not only the tepid violence that irritated me but also the incredibly stupid turn of events that sees paxton turn into some kind of teen rambo all the while looking like a backstreet boy jay hernandez just doesnt cut it as an heroic figure he looks like he would be more comfortable on the set of thats so raven his transformation makes the entire last third of film incredibly annoying no wonder the bubble gum gang left paxton in peace they probably mistook him for one of their own the other lead derek richardson while hampered by his whiny and insipid character is at least more credible than hernandez the real acting is left to jan vlasak who makes a very creepy dutch businessman and rick hoffman a highlight as a psychotic american customerdespite my gripes which admittedly have more to do with the way the film has been promoted than with the film itself is a very good horror film the premise works and there are shocks and disturbing moments aplenty the violence while not as explicit as the hype would have you believe is still strong in comparison to most of the stupid fluff that passes for horror movies in america the combination of sex nudity and violence is also a nice nod to the more adventurous euroschlock that so desperately tries to imitate most impressively roths vision and direction is not impinged by tarantinos sometimes overbearing presence eli roth is clearly a man with huge potential hopefully next time around he will stick to guns and forgo the hollywood ending,cruel
horny americans paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson backpack the europe with their new pal oli eythor gudjonsson in hopes of getting laid and smoking weed they bump against a lad who promises them heaven of horny women in some croatian village so off they go they take lodgings and a and they soon discover that the lad was right pretty naked ladies roam the but as soon as they get there their friend gets missing and soon they all find themselves from the hands of sadistic rich bastards who entertain themselves by torturing people to deathas for horror goes this movie is gross and it without any doubt is one of the most brutal main stream movies ever made but where i ask is the merit in that there is no real story just some torture and a vengeance i dont see a real need for this kind of a film that makes the killings and violence in a pornographic manner yes yes i like kill bills but in them the violence wasnt serious you can even say that is as much a real movie as are porn films but the direction is good though that much i must give for its benefit maybe that was the reason i did dislike and perhaps that was the intention all along the film that muchbut if senseless violence is all you need well maybe then is the right film for you but i am sure that the real mass users of the genre say that isnt even the goriest nor most sadistic horror film ever no one would have heard of the film if director quentin tarantino wouldnt have taken special interest about the project he produced and was the presenter like the opening titles said of the film oh and if you really want to learn anything out of this movie then maybe its stay home or slovakians sick puppies all of them,cruel
patter patter can you hear the blood splatter well you wont just hear it in this poor excuse for a horror film the first half of the movie is tna and after that we are bombarded with images of graphic violence and torture this movie messed me up for about two weeks after viewing it i went in to see what all the fuss was about and can say i now never want to visit a well actually my friend lives in one so id wanna go to her but not any other one this is the most disgusting movie i have ever seen youve got to give credit to roth for having the balls to make this though but i would not ever want to watch it again the thing with the eyeball was just too much i love horror films but this was just too much,cruel
first i need to say that is a film that only men will like im pretty sure im right on this there are more naked women in this film than i thought existed there is more gore and blood than a lot of other films in other words 2 things any typical guy will like it and if youre looking for sharp character development and an unpredictable story dont expect it from eli roth in this one nevertheless it is entertaining and short enough to make it watchable and likablepaxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson have met up with an icelandic man named oli and have heard of a in slovakia that is told to satisfy their wildest wettest and most perverted dreams ever they get there and the place does not disappoint but they soon figure out that this is not what it seems and that they are becoming part of a sinister plot involving an infamous torture museumi must say that eli roth had the necessary materials but like cabin fever before it he doesnt utilize it enough also like cabin fever the film is predictable and very one sided there isnt a lot of character development or realism to a story said to be inspired by real events what roths strength is that he realizes that hes made a few goofs here and there and provides all the blood and cool gore scenes that youd come to expect from someone quentin tarantino has thrown his support behind roth makes up for it all with some really shocking torture methods and two very evil villains one who doesnt talk much roth manages to make the film very entertaining even though it gets off to a really slow start the acting isnt that bad but i dont think hernandez or richardson should bank on this movie to make them credible actors after seeing hernandez in a couple more films i must say his future is very bright in this business dont miss him in world trade center710 spy,cruel
ok i paid for this on payperview thinking it wouldnt be half bad when in all reality this movie sucks i love horror movies with a burning passion the more messed up the better and i will admit this movie had its messed up moments but come on no story all it really was was porn mixed with goreits really only for guys who like to jack off then see people die frankly i wasnt impressed what happened to the asian girl towards the end was a really good idea and i give them the props and hey the idea behind this movie was very nice ill admit to that but they could of done better with itso i mean if you wanna waste some of your life and money rent it but please take my advice i wasnt scared,cruel
i first watched this at my college movie theater for 3 and my first honest opinion was that this movie was total cap i thought it was a movie that decided to join the whole sawhype and try to get some  through the whole lowbudget and high expectations deal now that ive watched it a second time i believe i can actually make a more balanced comment on this moviefirst off i have to say this is a scary horror movie but its scariness lies not in suspense or jumpoutfrombehind scenes but rather in the blood guts and gore is scary in that its painful to watch and it does make the viewers cringe and moan in their seats for that i do give props to the makers also the acting is very well done through acting the characters actually give you a greater sense of pain and fear that arises from the insanity of the hellish situation they are thrown into for that i do give props to the actorsnow to what makes this movie simply bad i have to say the plot is awful no twists no turns no nothing the plot is fairly straightforward but it totally lacks the quality that would equal that of saw and saw 2 instead the movie tries to make up for this by adding lots of strong language lots of drug reference lots of sex and nudity and most of all lots of very very vivid and gory scenes cabin fever tried to put some humor into it but this movie doesnt seem to do that either maybe the beginning was intended to be humorous but it seemed stupid even to a college student like me you just see three young guys making a fool of themselves going around smoking pot and drooling for girls totally unnecessary not to mention several confusing elements that were not explained for example why did that one guy have olis coat or was that just a coincidenceconclusion you get vivid and sick gore drug humor and sexual content combine those with a very bad plot and you get in other words a bad movie period ive heard and read good reviews about this movie saying that the movie is a social critique but i beg to differ the sole theme of this movie is sick violence and nothing else pretty much at least i dont see anything out of this movie and i thought it was a waste of time and money i wouldnt suggest watching this if you have anything else to watch but if you do have the time and money to waste go ahead just be ready to see some sickening things that you probably have never seen in a movie,cruel
eli roths isnt a very good film nor is it  in its genre  all that imaginative but its effective intermittently engaging and above all very satisfyingtwo americans  the cocky paxton jay hernandez and the brokenhearted josh derek richardson  are backpacking across europe with an icelandic pickup the partyhard oli eythor gudjonsson stuck in amsterdam and bored with the influx of americans they meet the bugeyed or is that crosseyed slav alex lubomir bukovy with the freaky presence of a young marty feldman he entices them to head to slovakia where the women are all supermodels and will screw you just because of your foxy american accent so off they go soon in the clutches of babes who bed them drug them and sell them to an organization that allows you  with the right amount of cash  to kill another human beinga film like lives and dies by its concept this movies queasy set up is a doozy roth takes his time getting his entertaining trio to slovakia and the camaraderie of men in pursuit of cheap thrills and cheaper women feels right the scenes in the murder factory arent as gross as the ads would have you believe  you grow immune to the shock fast and reminisce about the more ingenious grossouts of saw yet the last thirty minutes are everything a horror movie should be tense funny and insanely reliant on crazy twists of fate that are never less than satisfying to an audienceand is a film that requires an audience one that shouts groans and laughs at the sheer giddy high of more bloodshed and its attendant acts of revenge the best revenge may come from the spike pun intended in travel to the countries of eastern europe regardless of the carnage and the pus and the gristle there isnt one ounce of cellulite on its women,cruel
let me start by saying that i wasnt really interested in seeing this movie in the first place it looked pretty dumb but i thought i should see it just to see what all the fuss was about that said now that ive seen it i still think its a dumb movie and still cant see what the fuss is abouti had the same problem as a lot of people with this movie it starts out like a bad porno by the time it becomes an actual horror movie it had already lost my interest the gore was good the acting was surprisingly decent but the plot was so mindnumbingly awful that i really couldnt enjoy it muchbasically this movie is well made and well acted but it has such a boring straightforward plot that it really wasnt all that great510 ps i did like the tcm reference near the end,cruel
horror films need more than just sex and slashers so if youre looking for something with higher level cinema you best look elsewhere is designed for the young man with an appetite for videogame style plotsthe films premise is at least interesting a in a slovakian city is a jumpingoff point for nightclubs sexual encounters drugs and murder the owners are secretively helping a select group of the rich and demented these wealthy and twisted individuals pay to kill people and an art house on the outskirts of town acts as the facilitator of horrors for those unweary travelers who happen to fall victim to the wiles of the owners ending up drugged only to reawaken in hell on earth is a gruesome and lifeending discoverypaxton jay hernandez and his friends josh derek richardson and oli eythor gudjonsson are three college students traveling through europe they stop at this and are quickly enraptured with a couple of young women who have an appetite for sex once fully involved with these women the boys begin dropping off one by one first oli vanishes the icelandic discolover then josh the nice boy and soon even paxton finds himself strapped to a chair with an axewielding and chainsawripping psycho standing over himbut paxton escapes and with him he takes another japanese girl who was also being tortured to death once out paxton loses the japanese girl and soon spots the main man responsible for this death camp can paxton exact revenge on him or will he get caught and killed the main problem with the film were its characters josh the likable guy who seems to be the brains of the trio is killed off in short order paxton who i thought was a bit of an ass lives on to exact revenge on the man responsible for doing in his friends but this revenge sequence felt very flawed as i had no empathy whatsoever for paxton josh on the other hand shouldve been the guy to figure out everything and avenge the death of his buddies even oli wouldve been a better choice he was at least fun to watch and had a great personality perhaps the script writers werent sure who should live and who should die and i think that really showed in the revenge aspect of the film,cruel
i was not expecting much before i went in to see this film but i must say i was unexpectedly engaged before i continue i will let you know i am in the targeted demographic for the film being a 20 year old male however these types of movies arent usually made with this much thought the director does a very good job at keeping the viewers wondering just what the hell is going on the first half of the movie is mostly about sex and trying to get the three guys laid but the director still finds time to get to know the characters and paint of picture of who they were before killing them off aside from some of the very graphic gutwrenching seens i was still glued to the screen trying to figure out what and why this was happening we were also learning what was happening as the characters in the film were overall i thought this film was very engaging and surprisingly watchable,cruel
i read a ton of horrid reviews which im pretty much in agreement with however i will say that aside from all that was wrong with this movie there was plenty the premise was interesting and really freaky which is probably why there are so many reviews and so many people have at least been curious enough to see itin a nutshell i thought the story idea was good naive american boys travelling through europe smoking pot and chasing women the hotter the better they slowly realize that what they thought was garden of eden turned out to be hell the idea itself makes great fodor for a horror flick however having seen many horror movies id say this one failed because so much of it was not believable the main guy took on an indiana jones quality after he inexplicably escaped the torture chamber without raising an eyebrow from anyone there he went back to save the japanese girl which was not only out of character but completely ridiculous if you saw people being killed tortured sawed in half do you think anyone in the world would go back inside yeah right he finds the perfect get a way car which just happens to have keys in the ignition and a big stack of bubble gum to assuage the little boy gang he just happens to be on the same train as the bad guy and just happens to have the perfect opportunity to follow him into the bathroom and exact his revenge too much,cruel

spoilerthis movie is not for the squeamish it takes a little while to get there but once it does the film is full of ghastly and gruesome blood and gore the horror derives from helpless victims of a deranged sadistic maniac being ruthlessly tortured dismembered mutilated and slowly killed for the pleasure of paying clientsi saw this movie on an afternoon break between classes at the local dollar theater didnt know what it was about the only thing i had heard about it was a caller on the radio saying there were plenty of naked chicks he was right there was an abundance of uncovered female curves  especially for 1 and there was about a bank vaults worth of screaming cursing and bloody corpses critics might say that some of it is gratuitous although it seems to fit in with the storyline to me yes there is a story  a thin one but a story nonethelesstwo american buddies on a trip to europe for chicks and drugs i guess join up in amsterdam with a companion from iceland when the three of them travel to central europe in search of the naked chick jackpot things take a turn for the worse one by one they start to disappear whether drugged abducted or somehow lured they all end up in the slaughterhouse where they can be butchered for a price the fact that it is a business is not revealed at first eli roth who wrote and directed this piece does a good job of parceling out the details bit by bit at first sight inside the torture house there is nothing to indicate there is more than one victim at a time or that anyone other than the abductor is involved gradually we learn that there are more chambers in this dungeon and numerous workers outside security and paying customers the director and film editor also do a good job of showing the actual torture scenes by using a variety of angles closeups and medium shots with the two american pals we see views from behind them viewing their captor  but also from in front of them showing the point of view of the captorattacker the latter view especially lets us see the terror in the eyes of the victim as they plead for their lives to a totally unforgiving fiendthe special effects and makeup are quite good in this movie everything looks real  the violence the aftermath and oh yeah  the eroubabes too,cruel
theres so many things wrong with this movie  stilted dialogue unrealistic actions very americancentric movie its a very onedimensional stupid view of europe and europeans the director is not very good and the script is shallowbut if your a whiteamerican young male that loves splash films youll love it lots of sex naked women and then torture at the end what more could you want contrary to what others have said i found this much more gory than saw so be warned about that  but the torture scenes are short and a lot is not shownso i rate it right in the middle i liked it in spite of myself its kind of like when stewie from family guy lands in a babys crib with a little girl and says looks like someone spoiled their diapers followed immediately by oh god now why would that turn me on,cruel
this quentin tarantino produced picture kind of disappointed me i liked how it started it kind of set up a tone which you wouldnt expect it to turn scary however instead of actually startling you this film just disgusts you the performances were decent the characters were interesting the writing wasnt bad but the scenes of gore and disgust didnt really help the film the direction didnt make it scary kind of ridiculous the idea was great but this film had the potential to be a great thriller like saw or something but it just fell apart in its 2nd and 3rd act and the first act felt like a softcore porn film which makes it sad that the 1st act was actually the most entertaining part of the film jay hernandez was good in the lead this guy was decent in friday night lights and torque and was one of the bright spots of this movie is kind of disgusting but it was over the top for me and didnt meet my standards of a good thriller or horror picture 610,cruel
director of the indie hit cabin fever eli roths 2nd feature and latest horror offering is a starker and potentially more disturbing take vision though not without a sense of humor which seems to deliberately compliment some of the more gruesome of the film succeeds most for me during the first 12 to 23 of the picture characters and setup are laid out smoothly and an abundance of barebreasts doesnt hurt either however once things really start to go from bad to worse it became increasingly difficult for me to continue to take the situation seriously as scenes go overthetop and humor starts to leak through while this was likely a conscience choice on the part of the director for me it hurt the film and my ability to stay engrossed id have rather the tone and story remained consistent and not made the apparent changeupthough still bound to be strong medicine for the average mainstream movie goer seems unlikely to leave a lasting mark on genre fans if youve heard comparisons to miikes audition dont expect to have the same reaction because unlike the latter this film isnt especially disturbing or horrifying its a fun time at the movies and somewhat of a step up forward from cabin fever but just the same not particularly memorable,cruel
the first act of this movie involves sexnudity and getting wasted ok but not enough substance especially when it goes on way to long and the plot gets left behind for awhile sure these scenes kind of have a purpose but not enough to justifythe second act involves torture and at this point i thought the movie was quite sick but i was wrong i was on the edge of my seat and a little uncomfortable but that meant i liked it because it made me react most horrorsplatter films dont do much for me because they are to tame i was actually disturbed a little but the third act was sweet splatter release highly unlikely the way the events unfold but highly satisfying just the samethe acting and directing are just hovering around average most of the time with flashes of brilliance here and thereif you like this type of movie its worth seeing weak stomach dont bother,cruel
the best thing or shall we say the only good thing about eli roths first movie cabin fever was its final joke that was totally out of place but funny nonetheless in his second work roth increased the silliness and it takes the whole movie one step up a story as stupid and unbelievable as this one just couldnt have been done as a full on serious horror flick i do believe the advertising was kind of misleading in that aspect sure does get down to the nittygritty two er thumbs up for the eye scene but its all so hilarious that youre not going to take any of it serious i sure hope that all the stereotypes featured in this movie were exaggerated intentionally god only knows why roth has all his european characters speak german and badly and why he put a gang of criminal eight yearolds in the movie at times one felt as if this was the missing cousin of top secret and eurotrip anyway even though the movie is hilarious to watch its questionable how long roth can disguise bad writing with silly jokes is this man able to come up with a really good horror movie well his next project stephen kings cell is going to show didnt totally change my mind about roths talents but it convinced me that hes got a great sense of humor,cruel
yes im a little slow in getting to this film having quetin tarritinos name attached to this film is probably the main reason anywho i disliked this film the much talked about soft core porn first half was barely interesting seen better in other r rated stuff the second half was just plain disturbing is a film for those who may enjoy films like faces of death or perhaps watching explicit home movies of nazi death camps now dont get me wrong i dont mind gore if it serves a purpose or adds to the suspense of a film somehow but torture as an entertainment medium is just tasteless  needless imo i felt as though i was watching a snuff film is this the future of horror no story driven plot just shock value  torture a teenybopper game of who can look at gore  torture the longest without getting squeamish sick or turning away after watching i just felt as though eli roths main driving goal was to out gross  out shock saw after watching i feel the need to take a long hot showerbloodstones recommendation see if you really get off on torture for tortures sakebloodstones rating 510,cruel

if your woman is showing you signs that she wishes you to leave and you do not have the sense to know it let her rent this movie for you and have you sit there and watch this 94 minutes of pure horror i was screaming at the beginning middle and end from the torture this was by far the worst hyped movie of all time now i have seen some crappy movies in my time but this was not supposed to be one of them from the hype of the scariest movie ever made to the best horror movie of all time a horror buff such as myself was enthused to buy the first ticket however scheduling conflicts did not allow me the opportunity to do so so when my then girlfriend recommended it after weeks of dating i jumped on the opportunity especially since she wasnt allowing me the opportunity of jumping onnevermindneedless to say after enduring the pain of watching this garbage i moved out the next day,cruel
i watched this movie lat friday at a smaller cinema with a  lets call it suboptimal means decent  screen with about 20 other persons in the whole cinema started here just 2 12 weeks agostory  plot there is basically none  but hey its a horror flick what do you expect  it is as good as other so called stories of that kinda movies in one sentence 3 guys 2 from usa backpack through europe get in some trouble not real trouble in amsterdam netherlands hear from saviour that in a slovenian city all girls are horny top models gg step in the trap and get slashed by peeps that pay for itcamera solid but nothing special  i expected more of thatthrill to me  none there are no scary moments but one person left the movie right after the first violent scene maybe she should have been watching cold back mountain or soblood  gore much in the second part of the movie explicitly shown some people might not feel well after that but it all feels a little misplaced to me there was nothing really shocking about that because the whole thrill was missing the japanese woman that left the eye is jumping around the next scene like nothing happened  wtf was that sex sex and horror  there has always been kinda relation but this movie carries sex to extremes  during the first half of the movie i sometimes thought i am watching kinda cheep soft sex flick and not a horror movie nothing stimulating even if the main female characters are kinda hot i have to admit especially the saunascene that was so cheep i cought myself rolling eyes redhanded and grunted oh noentertainment the movie was kinda entertaining otherwise the movie would not pass that quick but i think it depends on expectance of something big to happen  but it didnt dont get me wrong the movie had some special moments that were quite cool and scenes that where kinda entertainingi gave 410 because of realistic i think  how should i  illustration of violence and a real hot female character otherwise it might have been 3 points but who knows but somehow the movie made time pass fast maybe because of unfulfilled expectations who knows,cruel
i found this film to be deeply disturbing and profanely sick unlike one of the earlier comments that this film like aliens created a sense of suspense i found the suspense overwhelmed by the idea that any human beings could find fascination in the gruesome aspects of the film i would not recommend this film to be viewed by anyone young or impressionistic this film does give one an insight into the minds of dawber and his ilk that these types of people actually exist gives one thought thank god for prisons i personally like good old fashion science fiction for its release and films such as this one more sick than slick however i do believe the characters were developed well and we got to know the characters and create a empathy for them having been given the chance to identify with them before they were thrown into the hell that their circumstance became the film as a whole was well done and well directed but the idea that people such as the antiheros in the film do actually exist made the film too intensely sick for my taste,cruel
for the kind of movie it is it is a pretty good flick the premise is interesting and somewhat fresh my biggest problem is it did not live up to the hype  but what ever doesfirst the first half is not a porno all you see is some boobies ok lots of boobies and mildly simulated sex nowhere close to porn but lots of nice racks yessecond the second half is not the grossest thing you have ever see on film some pretty sick stuff to be sure but not what the hype that word again would have you beileveworth seeing by all means if you like this kind of stuff,cruel
i just watched the dvd and saw that there isnt anything different about this version versus the original version it was billed as an unrated version but there is nothing different about it save yourself the agony of trying to figure out where it deviates from the original by bypassing it i loved the movie in the theaters but am sorely disappointed that i was scammed into buying this different dvd the movie itself was enjoyably tense and the gore was enough to turn even the stoutest stomach it was all in all a quality movie with subtle undercurrents of emotional vulnerability and a corporate world that buys and sells flesh for the taking i wouldnt bash the movie if i could but i am disappointed in the dvd guys its not a bad thing to shoot your wad before the fifth anniversary version or the platinum edition or the master gold leaf and free finger versionsad sad sad,cruel
im a fan of gory films but this was not impressive bloody yes but there was no real emotion to it i didnt really feel scared or frightened the deaths were too quick they didnt make you think or wonder what was happening fear is part mental and i just didnt feel that there were a lot of inconsistencies too not the best horror flick ive seen really wasnt even worth my time the most interesting characters arent allowed the time to really fill out spoiler alert they die within the first half hour or so the guy that survives isnt even that interesting and at the end when he cuts off the other guys fingers what is that it was way to predictable and not a mental thriller i love gore but this just wasnt good,cruel
the subject matter underlying should have been enough to make this movie a harrowing one however the film did not reach the level that it should have in dealing with the subject matterthe main problem with the film was the characters in the movie they act like typical horny teenagers straight out of typical teenage sex comedy movies if these characters had been in say american pie or porkys they would not have appeared out of place here they act as distractions they are not memorable or have any redeeming qualities about them the only character who i felt had any depth and substance was the main character played by jay hernandez but only barelythe story itself unfolds unevenly the first half plays like a sex comedy and the second half like exaggerated torture and gore flick unfortunately even the bad characters are portrayed like caricatures and thereby ruin the realism of any of the scenes that could have had any massive visceral impactis not a boring or unwatchable film however to be sure there is much genuine suspense and terror throughout the film especially in the second half but not to the degree it was purported to have had at the time of the releasea passable gore film that should please most gorehounds,cruel
some good elements to it although after first seeing it i thought that the plot of the movie was somewhat similar to what i can see as a serious version of eurotrip2004 the gore was tremendous should have been more much more if only the elite hunters bit would have been moremore it had its ups and its downs i was falling to sleep when it was down most of the time but when that gore came inforget about it drills torches clippers need i say morei guess in a nutshell let me just say movie sucksthe gore rocked,cruel
i really wanted to see when it first came out i kept hearing that it was so awesome and that it was so bloody and graphic then when it came out on dvd i went to fye to go buy it and my mom was standing right next to me because they were obviously not going to give it to me because im younger than 17 and the girl there said you do know this is an rrated movie and she didnt want to give it to me i tried to get it but i couldnt then i got recently and i saw it and it was kind of bad i expected so much more from it it was barely bloody and i kept hearing it was so bloody i thought it would be much better because one day i saw cabin fever and i loved it and from then on i thought eli roths next movie would be as good but it wasnt it just ended up to be another dirty bad horror movie it wasnt that bad but i didnt really like it and i dont recommend it,cruel
even if quentin tarantino was involved in this film it still wasnt very goodit will hold your interest if for no other reason than to see what is happening to all the disappearing peoplesome friends take a trip across europe and they start disappearing after they reach this one particular townthe that they stay at seems to be the hub of the disappearanceseventually the awful horrible truth comes out of what happens to people who disappearthere are a lot of snotty eurotrash roles in this film and that stereotype got old real quickand some of their thick accents were a bit hard to understand until your ears adjustthere is some pretty intense gore scenesone blow torch to the face scene was as gruesome as anything ive seenbut gore does not a good film makebut it is well done with some good solid special effectsthe acting is good and the story is decent but it really isnt the cool looking film that was presented in the trailersbasically it just another sillyteenagersgettinghackedup movie when you boil it down to the bones but the reason for their deaths is at least fairly originali just cant believe that this thing got such raves when it was shown at film festivals early onwhat have these people been watching to rave so about this run of the mill gore filmthe thing about this film that kind of irked me too is that it is so pretentious in wanting to make you think it is something more than just a slasher filmthis movie and tarantinoneed to get over themselvesit is worth a 2 buck rental but it isnt a dvd i would add to my collection,cruel
this movie is actually kind of stupid it seems as though this is just another typical teenage horror movie first you start out with this stupid teenagers who go to amsterdam to get prostitutes do drugs and brag about who had sex with who then they get drugged and wake up in a torture house and then eventually try to survive but some canttypical in all this new movies now this movie isnt entirely bad it had its scary moments but i believe that there can be more thrill though other things not just violencei kind of recommend this movie but if you are squeamish then you should not see this it has a lot of gore and violence but if you really want to see it go ahead there are a lot of worse movies out therei gave this a 510 because as i said its not the best but its not the worst as well,cruel
when i showed up to the screening i was extremely preoccupied by loads of reviews from magazines saying this was the most horrible movie you could imagine they said nothing this shocking had ever been there so i watched the first half an hour of the film not seeing any horror but rather softporn i didnt worry still a lot of time to make up for that the following butchery in that nest didnt make up not for my preoccupied mind i was expecting way harder scenes the stuff i saw was merely amusing me but not shocking maybe they started butchering on the german version of this although it is rated 18  anyways i was really disappointed after seeing this the story poor as it was is entirely irrelevant in a movie such as this i wouldnt have been that disappointed had there been more of those butchery scenes and less porn for a startstill although it disappointed me i enjoyed the movie and had a good laugh i would take this as quite a good movie to watch with your friends and if you like with a bunch of screaming girls,cruel
45 minutes hey were two americans and an icelander backpacking around europe except we dont have backpacks we smoke a lot of amsterdam weed and have sex5 minutes hey some guy told us theres a lot of hot chicks in slovakia the hell with barcelona lets go to slovakia waaaay out of our way so we can get laid based on a tiny conversation and pictures20 minutes were in slovakia hey more gratuitous sex hey whered the icelander go hey whered the sensitive possibly gay american go 15 minutes gore gore gore gore oh my god gore 15 minutes i escape by complete fluke and eventually get revenge and escape sorry thats about the gist of the filmunsympathetic characters pointless gratuitous sex galore poor pacing 45 minutes of boring 20 of good suspense then hyperdrive into the rushed ending and fairly bland acting silly plot twists the kids during the escape stilted dialogue thats what this film consists ofthere was some good eli roth can build suspense very well he proved so here and in cabin fever and the brief scene with paxton and the american client was great mainly due to rick hoffmans frenetic portrayal the rest was serious disappointment,cruel
it starts off a little slow as three buddies are hanging out in east europe in the small country of slovakia 2 from the us  one from iceland as their getting high  laid but they soon find out the theyve been referred to is a orginization that lures unsuspecting victims into a torture chamber where highpaying clients from around the world are able to rapetorture  kill without being prosecuted the storyline is slow in parts but the end is suspenseful  the scene where jay hernandez who did an awesome job as the lead actor  man hes a really cute hispanic guy goes to rescue the kidnapped asian girl whos being tortured as he hears her screams was intense  when he gets in the room  that dorky american guy is burning her with a blowtorch  her eyeball is hanging out of her socket in probably the most brutal mainstream gore scene ive seen in a long time  if ever was making me squirm  im a horror film fanatic  not much makes me squirm and then when jay cant pop her eye back into its socket he has to cut off the eyeball from the hanging muscles  then after he cuts it the yellow goo that pours out was aaaaaggghhhh so crazy i loved it gore fans definitely see this  out of ,cruel
eli roth is obviously a huge fan of the genre this was made clearly evident with his first feature  the fun ghoulish but ultimately flawed cabin fever is likewise a fun ghoulish but lacking movie that is better than cabin fever but missing something if this movie proves anything is that in time roth has the potential to make a film on the same level as the ones that obviously influenced him  texas chainsaw massacre evil dead japanese horror films like audition  but hes not quite there yetthe first half of is girls gone wild as a trio of friends beggar through europe the movie begins by finding the trio in amsterdam need i say more soon however the movie thrusts its viewer into a nihilistic world where wealthy people pay good money to indulge their need for torture and our three drugaddled sexcrazed heroes are the main coursehas a lot going for it its fast paced the characters are likable the women are beautiful and barely wearing a stitch and thats just the first half hour the rest of the film takes place in a kind of hell of earth where limbs are amputated fingers are chainsawed to the floor and the human body is reduced to the properties of a pin cushion people are flayed and dissected with glee eyes dangle from their sockets ankle tendons are severed although the dvd boasts that its unrated the gore level was not as stomachchurningly prodigious as i had anticipated but still pretty much all bodily fluids are on display herein the movie despite all its bloodshed seems to not take itself seriously and neither did i im not sure if the desired effect was to make the viewer squirm and dry heave or at times to laugh out loud at some of the more overthetop effects i did mostly the latter for any horror fan this is a must see considering how stale the genre is it at the moment more importantly shows a horror filmmaker and above all a horror fan improving his craft while delivering the visceral goods to those of us who eat that sticky stuff upof the special features on the dvd the only ones of note are the three behind the scenes features and the four separate commentaries featuring roth and others including one with exec producers quentin tarantino and scott spiegel,cruel
at first i wasnt that sure if i thought the film looked good or dreadful my brother saw it and almost left halfway through i didnt see it in the cinemas but i would have done the same thing though at first for different reasons i did hear quite the opposite from other people i know and though i wasnt that sure i just went for it to basically make my own mind upmy brother would have left halfway through cause it wasnt liking it while i was loosing interest which during the second half though there were some plot twists that i didnt see coming which was the only thing that kept the rating above 1 wasnt enough yet there was something that i cant explain that kept me glued to iton some level i was expecting it to be like saw and though it was gorier than both films put together it lacked a lot i did like about sawwhile like saw it was a sick twisted gore fest it there wasnt anything about the characters that where stuck in the middle of it that i found intriguing which as weired as it sounds was something i liked about both of the saw movies plus the fact that some of my favourite directors tartantino p jackson where backing it wasnt enoughon a positive side the film was well made for a obviously low budget and wouldnt disappoint blood and guts fanatics would entertain the younger saw fans but this is a 100 teen movie and but some of the older fans may not like it at the end of the day if you liked saw depending on your age group you may like it but then again youre better of waiting for saw 3 awful but with some decent  unpredictable plot twists 210,cruel
this was a marginal 2 star picit does little to amuse andor provoke any psychological suspense other than to visually shock roths direction is averagehowever he failed to capture any momentum from his graphic subject matterto sum up this is a relatively new hollywood movie category rockshock  rock star mentality coupled w shock horrorand to be perfectly honest wyou even the unrated version is not really scaryroth should remember what makes good horror is artistically exploiting a strong psychological factorhe had the factor in torture but failed to make any progress in this or any genrethis movie has nothing on the vanishing original or exorcist again original or any other champion of the horrorsuspense genre,cruel
i liked this movie for this kind of genre but i would like to comment on the beginning why did they shoot the film somewhere in eastern europe and said it was amsterdam because that definitely wasntbut i really liked the story and the way the movie was built up for the ones who were planning to go to praque or bratislava go youll love iti could not give a shorter comment so the next lines are useless but i really liked the story and the way the movie was built up for the ones who were planning to go to praque or bratislava go youll love itbut i really liked the story and the way the movie was built up for the ones who were planning to go to praque or bratislava go youll love it,cruel
i am not a hardcore horror fan but i can handle a seriously disturbing movie as long as it has some artistic credentials behind it or says something relevant about the world see seven jacobs ladder henry portrait of a serial killer also ive seen enough gore and makingof docs that that aspect of it doesnt particularly phase me having said that i must say that i was quite disappointed by what could have been a troubling haunting movie about american paranoia human violent instincts and what poverty will make one do for moneyeli roth just doesnt seem capable of the subtlety necessary to pull that trick off here hes good and i did like cabin fever but he spends too long on the setup and throws in too many forced plot elements that are needed to validate future events like seeing the doctor on the train the oddly placed story of the drowning girl that sets up the guy going back for the asian girl etc plus theres the waytoooverthetoptobeeffective special effects gore scenes that take it from horrifying to cheesylike wolf creek another film that focuses on kidnapping and torture over the quick shock of slasher flicks the most unpleasant and haunting aspect of this film is the screams of people at the whim and mercy of a madman in that aspect there were some decent and realistic performances but any emotional punch they packed were quickly neutralized by the overall silliness i mean really that whole eyeball thing was pretty damn sillyin the end ive seen scarier ive seen bloodier ive seen better what scares me the most is that there are so many people out there who are so disappointed that it wasnt more hardcore in the violence that alone makes me wonder if this movie isnt hitting closer to reality that i want to realize,cruel
i liked in the same way that i enjoyed hershell gordon lewis goregore girls and the 80s pop of hall and oates carries in its bloody clutches a guilty pleasure endowment thats hardly mistakable that said there also appears to be a duel train of thought here that was carelessly overlooked during the films making the plot is pretty simple two college students take an uninhibited tour of europes dark under belly relishing the purple haze of legal hash bars  having ravishing sex with bosomy eurochicks lifes pretty good for these irreverent if naive and unsophisticated hedonists then  within a matter of minutes  everything appears to go to hell one of them finds his hands and feet bound by shackles sitting almost naked in a dank room that is lavished with all manner of knives and power tools the purpose of all this well  its sort of like the playboy mansion for twisted millionaires  a place where rich men and maybe women  i dunno can exact all sorts of barbarous sadistic torture on unwilling participants and the question on everyones minds can these kids escape this dungeon of carnal bloody pleasures with their livesfor a movie that spews rivers of blood pulpy bone marrow and mashed limbs  on top of comely nudity and blistering sex is pretty fun to watch i found this movie to be deranged vicious and inappropriate in every conceivable way sure ive seen gore in other films that might make seem like a charlotte bronte novel but the vast majority of moviegoers simply dont watch those films  and for a lot of younger kids who cut their teeth on scream or the i know what you did  movies  the intensity of what theyre watching here might appear somewhat repulsive actually  i might clarify one thing  isnt a horror movie  it tries really hard to be an exploitation shockfest  which is probably why quentin tarantinos name is in the creditsgore for the sake of gore alone im totally cool with gore to me does not enhance the scare factor of a movie though and if eli roth who helmed this picture wants to be a maestro of thrills and chills hed do much better studying the beguiling atmosphere of roman polanksi or even that of alfred hitchcock the point that roth was obviously trying to communicate is that violence under the guise of entertainment is  um  well  bad okay however he relays his message through a camera lens engulfed in thick syrupy sadism hes not trying to disappoint americas fixation with violence  roth is exciting us with all of this bloody madness i dont think im being farfetched when i write that roth wants us to watch  over and over again and because of this his commentary already simple and overcooked is therefore moot but who cares if youre watching hoping to view a portrait of mans inhumanity to man youve wasted your money as a guilty pleasure hits all the essential bases man actually  guys like eli roth might well be the last bastion of filmmakers who dare to push the proverbial decency envelope as meaningless as their work might be you also have to love them for their irreverence for our sensibilities guys like lucio fulci and jess franco were men who swiped the rug from underneath their audience and made them feel uncomfortable roth may eventually clamor among their ranks,cruel
i found this film to be undeniably compelling and suspenseful even welldirected however i just have a problem with the concept of torture as entertainment i think that anyone who has ever given thought to the reality of torture in the modern world would find it repellent that the filmmakers would exploit it for a horror film that goes for mr tarantino as well my assumption is that there is an ongoing effort to find material to exploit in the horror genre and this is the latest example the film deals with elements of xenophobia homophobia phobia phobia and more phobia what makes this film especially disturbing is that like the video game grand theft auto the public seems to have little or no reaction on a moral or values level to this kind of material being put forth as entertainment from companies like sony yet when a film like brokeback mountain is released the public freaks out strange world we live in,cruel
is another slowish movie which is ok i like to get to know my characters and their universe before they are thrown into dramatic or horrifying situationsthe problem with its a victim of its hype its not at all that graphic or gory as the posters or reviews suggest also the characters are your typical american teenagers  please filmmakers horror is not owned by teenagers get experienced actors involved it adds to authenticity and less clichthis story of a couple of backpackers who follow there dick to some wild sx only to be tortured is a wasted opportunity there is some very effective moments i like the scenes with the street kids best actually the gory sequences are nothing really watch the news and there is more graphic pictures on cnnso an average horror given some spice by nice european locations and quentin tarantino hyping it up as the next best thingworth checking out just for curiosity but dont expect much,cruel
i though the movie was good not great could have used a little more imagination but overall i could see something like this really taking place in slavokia or eastern europe were money can get you just about anything you want even if it is snuffing peoplei have been all over the world and seen many things so i can relate to this movie more than most i will be visiting a in amsterdam soon maybe i will get luckyi think that for the money it wasnt a bad film i would have liked to see more hot russian and german women though man they are just so hot maybee ill stop by berlin really made me think about how our world is so messed up and that people would do just about anything for money the next one will be much better trust that,cruel
well ok i enjoyed the blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth of it all this part wasnt so bad personally however i would not count this as a good horror or suspense as horror goes to tell you the truth i was bored rather than frightened and you had to wait through three quarters of the movie for any actual horror at all to make up for it the first three quarters were filled with nudity this unfortunately was even poor as far as suspense goes i found little to no suspense what so ever the wouldbe suspenseful parts were filled with needless screaming and loud bashem up violencepersonally i would categorize this as a low rate porno with a bloody ending personally i believe watching porkys and then a boxing match would be more fulfilling and i hate boxingall in all this film was drab in my own opinion and the long awaited horror scenes were short loud and barely visible howeveri doubt i will be traveling to that particular city in the near future,cruel
the beginning is pointless wow a bunch of guys who want to get a piece of tail if i wanted to watch a stupid teen movie of the same genre i wouldve seen euro trip so then it goes into a twisted horror abruptly i can just imagine quentin with his crooked smile saying wow guys wouldnt it be cool if we just shocked the audience but it didnt reach capacity at all sure a lot of things were gory but when the one main character was getting rearranged his cries of pain only induced laughter in the audience which i dont think the point wasso whatever you finally figure out what is going on and the movie then turns into an actionrevenge movie    come on roth overall this movie could and should have been a lot better but it wasnt put together correctly so it never really appealed to myself and many others i am sureit was still ok nonetheless but certain parts of the movie ruined it and other parts that were good came at wrong times or werent presented correctly  so dont get me wrong youll enjoy it if you see it assuming you can handle this genre but you wont be rushing to buy it,cruel
unfortunately i must say i was very disappointed after watching this movie ive always been a great fan of tarantinos films of course there has always been a certain amount of brutality and some kind of horror his previous movies used to be interesting confusing exciting surprising you know all what made a tarantino movie a tarantino movie kill bill was imho already a big step back from quentin thus i expected his next work to be as good as his films used to be but my expectation was completely condemned with this movie is nothing but an average splatter film regrettably i cant say anything positive about it if quentins next work is as bad as this one then he will be a director who had some good movies previously instead of being the grandmaster of film,cruel
directed by eli roth has its high points many of them in fact and its low points the plot is extremely believable three young adults backpacking in europe trying to find sex and fun when they get locked out of their they meet another young adult who gives them a direction of where the sex and women are great upon listening to them they discover the amazement of bratislava until their friend disappears and then well lets say this is where the disgusting and unbearable comes in this movie has many sexual intercourse scenes and many exposed women it also has much cussing and the gore is abundant parts of this movie are so unbearable in the torture scenes that i thought i was going to throw up the trigger that made this movie the most frightening thing i have ever seen was that it was based on true events so if have a light stomach stay away but if you enjoy an exciting yet disturbing movie this is it,cruel
this movie is definitely worth watching some people might not like it but it just isnt what they are looking for it does not make this movie a bad one people just expect everybody to make movies to their liking and have what they call socially acceptable material this movie has a lot of nudity in it but it doesnt make it cheap like other low budget films the nudity here feels more needed than filler hell it is set in amsterdam and has prostitution why shouldnt there be nudity but the gore and the imagination makes it fun this movie grabbed me i got into it and the gruesomeness of it just made it more fun i guess if you liked saw for the cruelty and death and not just for the twists and plot then you are fair game to love this movie like i did if you found the cruelty and blood thing annoying and dont like tits then i recommend you dont watch this movie if you are one of the 99 of the population that enjoys seeing nice boobs and killing then watch this movie,cruel
its just like texas chainsaw massacre except in europe not america the same who would do this to people based thought in the movie i wouldnt put it very high on the must see list german torture being done to innocent peopleseems familiarnah cant be movie about some tourists that go around europe trying to do as many females as possible then they here about this small town where theres tons of girls and they love americans so obviously the americans go there but once there they party to much and slowly are picked off one by one its true the girls love americans they get paid 25000 if they can bring one to be tortured and killed wonderful world isnt it in the end 1 guy survives with minor injuries cool parts the surviving guy gets revenge on all the evil bastards the kids that stole from him end up helping him in the future the evil doctor gets his own medicine,cruel
the hype for this movie had me freaking out the idea that it took forever to get into any gore also had me expecting so much more first half hour or more is just 3 guys wanting to get laid and succeeding already way out of sense of reality and then they each just start falling into deaths hands one thing i do have to note on as well is how horrible the music was they threw in dramatic background music when the guys entered a town off of getting of a harmless train rideit had no suspense no conquer no nothing and the music portrayed it as a journey of prosperity or something so onto when the movie actually gets to what you see it for the gore was more so laughable than anything the way they had to cut from shot to shot during some of the things such as gun shot then the head explodingor at the end with woman jumps in front of train and you can see very well that its a green screen shotthen it cuts shot to women getting splattered by blood and looks horrible quickly shooting out of it justnone of the bloody scenes looked real at all the only thing that i can say that would have really made this movie scary is if they didnt show anything at all knowing what was happening but not really seeing it like they did at the beginning of the movie with a power drill being shoved into the guys leg was more intense than anything else i cant say anything good about this movie and wouldnt suggest to anyone that they should see it,cruel
okay i made the mistake of actually anticipating this movie i was all like all right this is gonna be pretty gory and quentin tarantino produced it so it might be good i went opening night making sure i got my tickets in advance because i knew itd be pretty big the disappointment was overwhelming horrible dialog even worse acting not nearly enough gore although that part with the chicks eye was pretty nasty i did think the directing was decent though all in all was a big waste not to mention the first hour of this movie which was basically sex now i know some people might like that but that isnt me it mightve been halfway decent if eli roth actually knew how to write and quentin tarantino i expected more from you im a horror fan and this was just bad dont even look at it,cruel
its unbearable to watch but harder still to look away its like seeing your first really bad freeway wrecka head here and a leg there you cant bear the horror but you cant pull your eyes away from that head with no body attachedeyes wide open and you keep looking into them who knows why you just cant turn awaythis movie will make you hunger for the lone survivor to get revenge it gnaws away at your insideshes gotten to make the scum pay your one big disappointment is there are way too many that escape justicetoo many of the bad guys walk awayonly too come back and you know they will be hacking and slashing innocent people that wind up looking worse than if you ran em all through a food processor and set it on puree next time quentinworry more about our blood lust for revenge than doing a movie like this where the final score is good guys 1 bad guys 75,cruel
i might get ragged on for not particularly liking this film but i honestly thought it was way below average starts off with three male friends vacationing in europe one of them being from poland the three guys are basically looking for girls and drugs and amsterdam is the perfect place for that from there they meet a guy who directs them to a youth in slovakia where the girls are apparently willing to do anything so the hormone crazed guys head that way after arriving they find the girls are great but after time goes by strange things begin to happen and after both of his friends go missing the leader of the group paxton is lead to an old abandoned building by one of the girls from the from there on the blood begins to spill and he discovers that the old abandoned building is used for wealthy businessman who pay to torture and brutally kill innocent travelers just for the thrill of iteli roth does a good job and completely disgusting his audience there are some pretty brutal torture scenes here and i will admit it gets pretty nasty yet still felt like your belowaverage horror film to me full of cheap nudity and sex and some intense gore scenes to go along with it the first 45 minutes of the movie felt like the teenage comedy eurotrip and then it takes a dark turn still this movie was a huge letdown because the concept is actually really scary unfortunately this movie was a mess it felt comic at times when brutal things where happening and made the atmosphere all too unrealistic and completely unbelievable an example being the town children attacking the bad guys come on for roths 2003 horror film cabin fever the comic side of it worked but with the comedy played into it makes it seem way too cheesy and not serious enough i was expecting much more and it turned out to be far below average despite all of the insane hype that the movie has gotten i dont understand iti guess it just depends what kind of movies you like is a brutal gory movie with a bunch of nudity and sex and i felt like id seen it all before it all depends on taste though and it just wasnt the right movie for me it wasnt scary i didnt care at all about the characters it hardly had any plot at all it was just disgusting had this movie had a much more serious tone and more plot development it couldve been a good movie but it had neither of those things if a couple of brainless hours of sex and torture make a good movie for you then enjoy for me this movie failed 310,cruel
to be honest with you i thought this film was rubbish i dont usually go out of my way to slate movies but man was tripethe acting was terrible and its not like you should be expecting it  the billing that its been getting and having qts name all over it you would at least come to expect some good acting the characters are the most unlikeable bunch ever i was looking forward to them getting killed not feeling sorry for them like i was in wolf creek the twist and turns could have been seen a mile away they had to con people into thinking it was a tarantino flick so they would go see it cause it wouldnt be able to pull viewers in on its own meritthe scene on the train where they meet the german guy is just plain stupid he is on a train and is eating a salad out of a travel pack and we are suppose to think he is a freak for this oh yeah and he isnt vegetarian either so he must be evilthe two lead guys i cant even remember their names are so clichd one clean cut i respect women and dont want to have sex with one unless i can hold her and cry myself to sleep afterwards while listening to enrique all night emotional guy who misses his girlfriend and wants to work on the great american novel and his friend  the sex hound who is gonna help him get over his exsome of the gore is good ill give the movie that but its one or two scenes of style over substance there is even one torture scene where we have a throw back to tom and jerry i would type up what it was but i dont wanna post any spoilers who those unfortunate enough who still have to witness itwolf creek was 10 times better than this anyone who this nothing happened in wolf creek for the first 45 minutes is meant to be watching a movie like valentine or i still know what you did last summer wolf creek was all about character development building of tension bonding the audience with the cast letting you cringe at the thought of the foreboding danger that lies ahead in the middle of nowhere they did all that brilliantly and when the action started it never stopped and kept you on the edge of your seat peering through your fingers at the scenes you were brave enough to watch brilliant film unlike  which just tried to rip off wolf creek in nearly every way but failed on every account,cruel
here is a good example of a movie i would call film deep theres no real depth to this film and upon seeing it i just felt like i had seen another gore flick rather than anything thoughtprovoking at all now i like gore flicks just as much as any gore head but with the recent wave of sad excuses for horror films remakes and crap i just cant get into them anymore this movie is brutal it did make me cringe at a few parts and the effects were great but there was no real meat to think about in the end what am i supposed to be surprised that people would pay to kill other people mehthis movie gets five out of ten for being just another modern horror movie,cruel
when i heard about the people puking in the theatres after watching i was really excited to finally see an actual sick and gory movie there were a few pretty disgusting parts but it was just like any other horror gory movie most of it just reminded me of saw i guess i may have a strong stomach compared to some people but i was very disappointed with the movie after reading all the reviews i would recommend it tho cuz it doesnt have a bad story and the gory parts are pretty good but the overall lack of disturbing scenes made just like any other horror movie to all the movie critics out there if youre going to right a review about a gory movie and praise that its one of the most disturbing movies every made make sure other people will think the same,cruel
with all the emotional plausibility and depth of a bazooka cartoon strip this high concept badplayboyfantasygonebad riff is already more inert than its more unfortunate leads before it inexplicably morphs into of all things an escape movie unfotunately turns out to be the kind of escape movie where a timetraveling captain kirk must break out of a nazi fortress populated by hapless extras existing solely to walk around menacingly and get clomped on the head a crashing disappointment for eli roth after cabin fever the only horrifying thing here is the planned sequel yeah yeah there are one or two comic touches involving a halffunny twist on the oliver dickens youthful vagabond shtick and theres the inevitable revenge on the badguys but by the time staggers to its paintbynumber payoffs its all too late,cruel
if only i could get eli roth to sit down for an interview there is so much i would like to discuss with him i really enjoyed cabin fever the first time i saw it although the more i analyze it the less i like it its not a bad movie when i heard about this new sadistic thriller with roths name on it i was immediately curious i didnt get a chance to see it in theaters but i rented it the day it came out on dvd to quench my curiosity i made sure i avoided any reviews of it so i went into it with expectations for a really truly sadistic gory ridei was not disappointed using three almostunknowns as the leads was a good idea jay hernandez was especially believable and sympathetic the story is not importantlots of booze drugs and foreigngirl sex the good part starts in a dark basement of a huge warehouse this is where elite hunting is headquartered in the dingy dirty rooms people can pay money to torture and kill tourists yepthats basically itroth took this idea and ran he ran straight for the gore if youre a gore hound like me this film delivers this contains one of the very few scenes which made me feel sick to my stomach overall i recommend itbut definitely not for the faint of heart,cruel
another typical slasher film where attractive bright yet unsophisticated teenagers are slaughtered after arousing sex scenes just real real stoopidwhen i was a kid it was halloween and friday 13th every time a generation comes of age hollywood rolls these xenophobic slasher films out to capitalize on their fear of independence and uncertainty about the future the texas chainsaw massacre was another good example my best friend is 20 and his nimrod girlfriend ran out of the theatre when they went to see so i just had to rent it and check it out i enjoyed some excellent seared tuna steaks and green peas with melted imported cheese on top while i watched it so far so goodthis one is pretty gory and quite well done but just a typical schlocky piece of garbage when you get right down to it  something for the cool 8th graders to brag that they snuck intoim going to go watch it again byet,cruel
eli roths is a captivating film in its last 45 miuntes a frightening and horrifying mix of violence and unrelenting terror but to get to that point you have to slog through 45 minutes of porkys so to speak if the first act of couldve been written with a little more intelligence and less of the frat house mentality would have been a real treat of a horror film instead of a routine horny teenager slasherfest after about 15 minutes of these guys being loud obnoxious and rude i thought to myself  i got it ok yea theyre youngdumb and full of c why couldnt they have been represented better as smart guys who are over there with a noble purpose why is it if theyre american all they want is pot and sex at any rate is an average bloodfest but i look for greatness from future projects from eli roth this guy has talent to burn just not here and i liked cabin fever 12 out of 4,cruel
eli roth has yet again managed to produce a film throughout which one will wince at the unnecessarily graphic violence and cringe at the risible plot and scriptwriting what tarantino is doing sullying his good name with this audiovisual garbage is anyones guess presumably roth has some kind of hold over him and forced him to do so i suspect that in years to come he will be ruing the error of his ways the other notable cameo is that of takeshi miike whose appearance only serves to remind you how much better he is at pulling off this type of gorefest than roth as can be seen in both audition and ichi the killerhaving seen cabin fever another film by roth with essentially the same plot i did not enter the cinema with particularly high expectations and thus i was not surprised when i left the cinema feeling mournful for the sad demise of the last 95 minutes of my life which would have been more productive  and pleasant  had i spent them watching someone removing their own fingernails with a phillips head screwdriver while singing the first verse of wannabe by the spicegirls over and over againthe depth of the characters is comparable to that of the plot and there is apparently little attempt to make one sympathise with them so the prospect of their potential death merely makes wonder in what gruesome manner they might die rather than if or how theyll get out aliveso if you want violence verging on snuff and nudity verging on pornography  both of which im sure are readily available on the internet for free then this is one for you if you want a plot and a storyline my advice is to watch something else,cruel
i remember having read that quentin tarantino pitched this movie as a reinvention of horror or some such i was quite thrilled and watched it recently when the credits began to roll at the end i honestly asked myself what was supposed to be what the makers of the movie want to tell me with this thing it was neither particularly shocking thrilling exciting sad or artsy fartsy the only thing it was was gory at times but it wasnt gory enough to be a classical gore moviei didnt care for the protagonists the plot didnt go anywhere i remember thinking ok when does the actual movie begin where is this leading then after some mild predictable action the movie was over  very abruptly no twists no turns no revelationsif you rent this movie for a pop corn dvd evening it is ok as you wont be bored  but dont expect anything beyond that,cruel
after letting myself get swept up in a bit of the hype this movie has amassed i must confess i was quite let down the true horror just isnt therethe movie has a few tense moments perhaps but it all feels a little too hollywood to truly infect that dark disturbed part of your brain despite the films blatant attempt to be therekind of sad really because this could have been such a terrifying premise imagine the results if executed by a more mature less clichd foreign sadly filmmakerwould have truly made us yanks stay out of europeinstead we essentially get a traditional hollywood horror film with a bit of a unique settingfor all of its dilapidated and gritty realness some of the scenes attempt to exemplify the far fetched plot twists and archetypal hollywood heroisms water down an already merely amusing premise a good scream for the younger set i suppose,cruel
a lot of people have come on here and praised or slated the film for its gorelack of gore and how people would have passed out through shock and how the scene looked realnot real but i have a different outlook on this filmthe most scary thing i could get from this film was if this could really happen thousands of people disappear every year when they head off back packing on the other side of the world for a onceinalifetime thrill and they are never heard from again the societ block has only just been broken up and there are large countries that have taken their independence from russia but how no full knowledge on how to use it most people know that the russain mafia still have strong influences in these countries so why could not would they not set up something like this a small remote town out in the mountains somewhere with operatives all across asia europe and africa just like the guy in amsterdam all tourists who are looking for anything different are informed  advised to visit this place and they will find what they are looking for there once there they are never heard from again bear in mind that in this film they are not only working against the organisation that has ensnared them but the police and a few of the locals toothis film may not have met the levels of saw  saw ii in many peoples eyes but i find the possibility of this actually happening far more terrifying than the saw series a serial killer as in saw would just not elude the law long enough to get away with so much bloodshed as the us government has tight monitoring processes in place that would let them track down such a criminal in their own lands pretty swiftly out in many of the broke away soviet block countries they are no where near as advancesi think this could truly happen,cruel
sorry guys this movie is way too brutal to be watched it takes a while till the movie gets to the plot but the rest of the movie just contains sick pictures and very disgusting scenes of humans being tortured and killed i think the producers messed this movie up by showing all of it they do not understand to thrill the viewer and keep him using his mind i know its just fiction i know there are worse flicks out there ive seen em all i like quentin tarantino movies  definitely not this one by the way the perspective of the countries shown slowakiaczech rep etc is a bit insulting these places are very nice and just a bit screwed up because of their past but they are growing and becoming more and more important for europe,cruel
it had to happentarantino has finally lost itthe whimsical director has done what he does bestput people into trances of awe inspiring shockthis time by giving the nod to the kind of horror movie which leaves you more nauseous than scaredthe script for the first half of the movie seemed to be taken from eurotriponly the less comical porn version of the samethe second half however makes you wish you hadnt eaten nachos and cheese before taking your seat in the center of the cinemagore at its distasteful best a plot with the complexity of a 5 piece jigsaw puzzleill timed 70s horror music and dialogs taken off captions for breakfast cerealsthe efforts at subtle comedy are not worth criticizinga horror movie so amateur in every respect leads me to hope that for the sake of any redemptiontarantino finally sold out my producing a movie with signatures of his previous hits all over the moviethe next tarantino  produced movie should not be watched without a reviewthe brand name is tarnished,cruel
even though im not a fan of mindless explicit violence i can enjoy movies where it happens for a reason hell reservoir dogs is one of my favourite movies ever braindead had me crying for laughing so hard etcnone of those is particularly explicit andor violent i know but neither is after allmy point is this the few minutes in where we actually get to see some gore have absolutely no point at all and before someone shouts thats the beauty of it let me say that it wasnt supposed to be that way eli roth tries hard maybe the whole first half of the movie to introduce us a story behind the massacre that we know is bound to happen to give us context and he fails miserably at that the characters are so moronic in anything they say or do as to almost look like a caricature of your average dumb american travelling through an europe where everyone speaks german the plot is so vain and empty that it looks as if it was written by a six year old with all the neverending clichs and the recurrent phrases and events from the past which come back to hunt you the way those ghosts from the past make their way into the story which is as subtle as a chainsaw the camera work which is average at best the lousy soundtrack that never gets to be even remotely convincing and many moreas if that wasnt bad enough roth felt the need to stick a comic relief into every other scene during that introduction i swear there were chuckles  hell downright full out laughs  in the theatre when we were told that the word the characters have been using to refer to chicks the whole time actually means clit in icelandic im betting the people who laughed were also enjoying great lines like im the king of the swing and of course my horseand then we get to the slaughterhouse where hopefully every teenager who has ever been bullied can let his anger out just sit back and watch some oldschool madness right wrong you get to see blood yes but not as much as the trailer had you hoping for and always with some lame dialogue in between for instance josh you why the dutch businessman i always wanted to be a surgeon but the boards would not pass me can you guess why you see so i went into business but business is so boring you buy things you sell them you make money you spend money what kind of life is that a surgeon he holds the very essence of life in his hands  your life he touches it he has a relationship with it he is part of it josh please just let me go please the dutch businessman you want to go is that what you wantso you see the dutch businessman has problems he has a past here i was thinking that he was just your everyday business joe who loves his daughter and likes to slash ankles and legs open go figurei cant for the life of me think of a decent excuse for tarantino to be associating his name with everything tarantino is good at almost magically ruins dialogue editing soundtracks even mindless pointless violence everything heres hoping we never see a five rooms with roth directing or worse writing one of themalas this movie is so nauseatingly bad that eli roth may just turn into a cult hero fortunately i saw annie hall for the first time the day after i watched this dumb and pointless excuse for a movie and it almost healed all the wounds had caused it only took a year to be released theatrically since roth started writing it now i know why,cruel
the first three quarters of the film is a total waste of time clichd characters clichd lines clichd clich i cannot believe that this got made into a filmthe one thing this film has going for it is the concept but a even that is badly executedtha amount of gore is laughable as well it pales in comparison to the likes of ichi the killer and even saw and because you have to wait till then end of the film to really see any action is it really worth it i know this review may seem a little light on facts about the film but that is because it has no substancea detailed outline of the plot three guys meet up in amsterdam to smoke pot they hear about a in the adjacent country they go there and get picked off one by one the last guy realises something is up and escapes fintarantino should have kept his name as far away as possible from this tripeand a note to eli roth i love nude women as much as the next guy but if i wanted to watch a softcore porn then i would watch bravo after 11 not a hollywood filmnude women does not make up for the lack of plotcharacterisationacting abilitystorytelling abilitygorehorrorsuspensei want my 5 back please,cruel
when i was 14 my main goal in life was to find soft porn movies like this one at 34 this movie feels indulgent sophomoric silly and boring the whole 20 minutes in the netherlands were a soft porn movie no real story line no reason mo nothing a minute of them in a dutch leaning about this other one would have sufficed then the movie goes from soft porn to silly gore the dutch businessman who was not gay but wanted to be a surgeon the local community that is running the killing machine business because they have nothing better to do no real explanation is given about this operation and it is likely that a sequel will happen god forbid then the killing of likable characters ok ok that means that they went against the formula but everything else was formula so it was indulgent to kill the likable characters and leave charmless jay hernandez alive all in all the best part of the movie was the american business man deciding how to kill he explains the story in that energetic powerful little scene but it is not worth the time or money,cruel
wow what do i make out of this i hated but loved it all at the same time for anyone reading this just be warned that this is an colossal uber gorefest there are more hacks than amateur night at the apollocough dont feel the least bit a wuss if torture and blood and comedy dont mix for you this is off the fg scale and thats coming from a guy who loves horror movies would i recommend it welllllll dont get too excited by the tarentino stamp this ones a renter i dont need to see severed fingers and eyeballs larger than my own head on a big screen spoilers clever directing clever visual storytelling and a good slathering of revenge i cant say i felt jipped but the humorous treatment shows its wounds halfway thru when you are left wondering when the amsterdam weed will finally wear off and the plot will finally surface out of the bathroom in a redeyed stupor party or no party we got a frinkin horror movie to watch,cruel
the very best thing about this film was the storyline which was intelligent and believable unusual qualities in a horror movie the special effects were also good and the feeling of helplessness and loss of control was well conveyed much of the direction however could have been a lot better the film stuck rigidly to the hollywood conventions of exaggeration and lack of subtlety and general brashness that goes with this genre the three central characters shouted a lot and the early amsterdam scenes were larger than life american fantasies of degenerate europe with everybody overacting like mad and behaving in totally stereotypical ways the slovak section was visually attractive and slightly more subtle but the whole film seemed to be shot in bright light with loud and obvious background music announcing every nasty scene well in advance i am not saying it was a bad film  of its type it was exceptionally good  but in the hands of a better director it could have been a lot darker in every sense and produced more involvement with the characters none of whom were particularly likable and even more shock impact from the gore scenes it does build to a terrific climax though and horror fans should consider it a compulsory must see,cruel
just finished this i dont know what to call it it is a bad excuse for a movie doesnt scare at all its not even that grouse as u would think directorscreenwriter eli roth is someone i would like to pass regarding his future work he is so limited first of all by presenting slovakia like highway to hell second he aims for simple plain things like nudity gore this movie lacks in ideas little brain usage i am not asking much give me at least 5 dont know why did tarantino even spent 5sec on this sht eli roth u need to retake some lessons watchlearn the saw i think i made my case but i could go on and on describing how low this movie goes to be honest i dont want to see it ever again or keep this junk in my collection period,cruel
horror laid on with a trowel lacked the subtlety of good exponents of the genre torture for titillation much to its shame dull script and lacklustre acting to match no substance to characters and no character development which meant that you scarcely cared what happened to the main protagonists a bit like the torture masters themselves couldnt help but think as i watched it that there was a better movie in there somewhere what if the family of the first american boy who was killed commissioned a private investigator to go to slovakia and find out what happened to him with the story being told retrospectively or what if the second american boy who escaped was found mute and with no memory and similarly a private investigator was sent to find out why at least then there would be some interesting transition in the movie what you actually got was something that felt like american pie then suddenly and hardly seamlessly a trailer for the silent hill video game,cruel
i had the pleasure of enduring the bloodshed offered from this last weekend i entered without really knowing much about the film except eli roth was the director and quentin tarantino was somehow involved with his name was splashed in big font on the poster and opening creditsmy previous experience of eli roths work cabin fever left me somewhat empty and disappointed his characters were underdeveloped shallow and could not gain the sympathy or relationship required with the audience for the moviein my view was a natural progression leading on from cabin fevers thrillerhorror style and in the same manner the characters were still not really developed in any kind of way and again there was not the feel of any sympathy or connection from the audience to the characters the three main characters paxton jay hernandez josh derek richardson and oli eythor gudjonsson are introduced living the any reckless male teenagers dream of debauchery ingesting drugs alcohol and sleeping with as many women as possible women paxton and josh are in the middle of their backpacking trip through europe playing the typical annoying ignorant american tourists having already befriended the loud extrovert icelander oli somewhere along the way after finding themselves locked out of their on a particular night out in amsterdam a chance meeting with a stranger tells them of the ultimate backpackers in bratislava where the eastern european girls are desperate for any men they meet especially american after arriving at the in bratislava the promise of women not exaggerated and all three immediately hook up with three beautiful women the morning after things turn strange as they wake to find oli missing with the hotel reception informing them he has apparently checked out and gone home to iceland strange things continue to happen as josh goes missing next leaving paxton to search for his friends amongst the rather unhelpful locals and a rather vicious gang of 6yearolds to uncover a darker side to the bratislavasuffice to say the film has a fair bit of bloodshed gore and some quite gruesome scenes definitely not for the squeamish the death scenes make you cringe but also has the ability to mesmerise you with curiosityyou would like this if you enjoyed the horror films such as saw saw2 final destination or even the aimless deaths in cube the kinds of murders in all these films were reminiscent with the extravagant death scenes as the story unfolds from plenty of erotica and sex scenes early on then to gory blood and finally to gruesome unrealistically funnyfor a good mindless blood i fully recommend this film it will never be classic because simply there wasnt anything new to offer it did however leave me with a lasting nausea effect for a few days but dont expect any twists turns head spins or any real plot to develop it trundles to the end and finishes with nothing more than a minor resolution to end,cruel
welli was told by a friend that this will be the scariest movie youll ever see and the trailer looked a bit creepy it was the whistling and no music the critics well the ones i read seemed to agree with the hype heres what i thought of it although not original in its concept my little eyethe idea was still a good one if this was a film about giving thought to what you do before you do it and then bear the consequence then it didnt quite hit the mark although there was redemption in the film i found the film good because it made me laugh there was black humour in it but i dont know if it was intentional the feedback from roth on cable inferred not moreover i was not frightened nor was i made to feel squeamish roth alluded to it himself when he stated that humans are more scarier than monsters and i could not agree with him more but this film didnt enforce that belief to make someone feel uncomfortable during death scenes you have to make it believable the scene in donnie brasco in the cellar when they cut the body up that was difficult viewing the native americans and their arrows when they kill timmins in dances with wolves that is uncomfortable viewing butchering maiming killing it cant have more impact than the original texas chainsaw massacre and films from that era or even recently ed gein with steven railsbeck was 18 rated entertainment and it did that well it made me laugh it made me root for the good guy and more importantly it entertained but it certainly did not frighten me nor did it make me feel uncomfortable my personal view is that there are a number of people in the film world and outside that like roth as a friend and may be viewing the film through rose tinted glasses he may be a good guy but you have to be honest to your friends,cruel
if youre not into watching people get torturedkilled then skip this film thats what the plot is abouton a side note this is suppose to take place in czechoslovakia however i dont think i heard a word in slovakczech  the bad guys were all russian but whatever it doesnt matter goes along with the plot vaguethe only thing i didnt mind about the film was its beginningbefore the killing starts after that you can press stop and go watch something elsesummary if youre into movies that focus mainly on human torturesuffering then youll like this film if youre into a goodentertaining story line skip this flick,cruel
i would like the people responsible for cutting the film to give me my money back i am over 30 years old enjoy film gore to the extreme and was bought by the advertising of hostilewhy i spend a large amount in the cinema to see a quarter of a film of which im deprived of the 3 quarters enjoyment taken out by those who havent a clue of their audience before the intellectually challenged who cut the film say they only removed at most about half im talking of enjoyment level i know its something you no nothing aboutif they want to cut a film and want me to see it then let them pay for it not me my advice to screen gems distributors is to rerelease hostile uncut and watch the audience come flooding in my advice to those who enjoy good films is to avoid this until it is uncut,cruel
well what can i say i have seen a lot of horror films but none like this i couldnt decide whether to get up and walk out or stick it out then punch someone at the end of it roth did do some good directing the scenery was terrific i had an appreciation for films like saw and seven which had some gross out moments but there were still developed characters and plots that could keep audiences involved i still cant comprehend how movies like this do so well i imagine through reputation for being gross out films and the fact that taratino has added his name to all the advertising and the opening credits if gross out films with little or no plot or characters are your thing treat yourself to this gem,cruel
i have been waiting for this film since christmas the sickest mainstream film ever made they said saw a kick ass screen shot of what looked like utter sickness to feast your eyes on went to see it at the cinema and was my sick twisted mind satisfiedwas it fk the concept of the film sounds terrifying and twisted but the 40minuit porno film el roth slapped in my face bored the sht out of me as far as the horror and disturbing stuff goes it was pretty wnk okay i will admit there are some really sick moments the eye scene chainsaw scene random vomiting etc etc etc but on the hole there were too many naked european women and not enough death and destructing to be honest i found most of it quite funny and laughing out loud in a packed cinema full of horrified people isnt a good look hollywood has lost the knack of making you sht yourself and sleep with the lights on because your to scared to sleep if i was quintin tarentino id wear a paper bag over my head and dig a big hole to live in till the dust has settled and till another so called shock legend makes another attempt to keep me awake in a cinema the film was so bad i even wrote this load of sht and bothered to post it on the website thats how fking disappointed i am with this film should have spent my cash on a porn film and cut up a joint of beef covered in blood as that would have the same effect that had on me why oh why do you mock me oh and who the hell is el roth should call himself el i make movies that are equal to premature ejaculation roth god what an a hole,cruel
after watching this film its obvious who its aimed at teenagers those seeking to get into their first movie underage oh how disappointed they will be i thought the blair witch was the most overrated film of all time this runs it close the shameful marketing of this film makes me want to demand my 6 entry back directly from tarantino for conning me into believing that the tarantino tag was a guarantee for witty script and original screenplay the horror aspect was far too weak to carry the average script if there is going to be no tension building then lets see some shocking violence but when it comes you just cant help but feel as though the joke is on you the first part of the movie is wasted on nipples and unwitty dialogue there was plenty of time given to do some decent character building its a real shame to see a talented director cabin fever is far far better in every way and a legendary backer bring absolute discredit to their names maybe they are going to release the real in a few months and this was their idea of a sick jokeyou can see what roth was trying to do but i feel as though the potential had been simply been thrown away then he wraps it all up with some perverse hollywood ending based on incredible coincidence to sum up its witless the characters are poorly developed did anyone care if they died in a brutal manner the violence is unoriginal not particularly stomach churning and we are left with mass exploitation of film goers not a happy movie buff,cruel
if someone expects too much out of this movie he will be disappointed i know i was it is not that scary actually it is not scary at all i dont know what all this fuss is about dont get me wrong though the movie is ok if you want to watch it once i honestly can not watch it again i think the movie writer must have been out of ideas because this movie is so predictable oh my god i could have written it in a day the first part is perfect for the boys you see some nice tits basically the second part is basically the reason you will go to watch this movie by the end of the second part the people who made this movie must have realised that they run out of time so they decided to finish it off really quickly obviously not the best tarantino movie but if you have 93 minutes of free time go ahead and watch it,cruel
ive been waiting for this movie for quite a long time and kinda prepared myself for that  read all the reviews and imdb comments and stuff so that made me believe its a great kickass horror film to be remembered in ages plus tarantino plus miike  seemed to me as a lot of work and fantasy in it i know a thing or two about a thing or two if it goes to the movies im a huge movie fan and i work in a cinema but this one left me stone cold have you seen road trip is absolutely the same only scary just the same plot  youngsters are headed for europe to get laid they go to amsterdam for drugs then they go to bratislava for girls only in they get killed i am so disappointed man the thumb cutting scene and the achilles tendon cutting scene are from house of wax the foreigner in the train grabbing a guys leg is from road trip it was too funny to forget europe is shown entirely wrong now those who cant even tell slovenia from slovakia think that poor children of eastern europe kill for bubble gum and that the whole amsterdam is the red light district eli roth sure apologized in front of iceland but how about the rest of the countries shown in the film ok i may go on forever i am disappointed and angry at the makers with all due respect,cruel
well i really do like tarantinos work but this movie sucks i mean it is not the tarantino way he did some really great projects but this one sucks indeed look the idea was great but he overreacted with torturing blood and violence and it seem like a extra low budget movie put that aside the story is ok and the acting is great but i dont know just dont like it he disappointed me pulp fiction 4 rooms reservoir dogs from dusk till dawn even kill bill is soso but this there is a message you can get from this movie and i got it but nothing special trust me,cruel
poor horror film that has no ingenuity and has a dire script i was expected a gore fest in the same mould as saw 1 and saw 2 but this has no suspense and the storyline is so predictable that it becomes so ridiculous a disappointment not worth the 6 ticketthe only real beauty within the film were the two gorgeous girls that the backpackers met at the i can not believe that there has been so much hype about this film and for its supposedly talented directorscriptwriter eli roth i just hope that he does deliver the goods in his next films although he does deserve credit to the amount of cult success that he has achieved with his low budgeted films,cruel
the acting was not bad at all a waste of imagination is the first thing that comes to mind the film starts well and gets a little bogged down after about forty minutes then goes down hill rapidly after that the story line is too predictable to follow the film seems to rely on the guts and gore to sell it to the poor viewer that is unfortunate enough to stumble into the cinema at times i could have been watching a short from the novice film festival shame i was full of high hopes for the film the sort of film the late teens will enjoy not for the couple stealing a few hours from the kids my wife spent about 60 of the film with her eyes shut so that could be a plus i doubt this will be a one of those cult films it will be well forgotten by the summer,cruel
ive seen just a week ago and i must say i was disappointed i really thought it would be a movie with real tarantino dialog and a storyline with a twist but what i saw was more like a bmovie with sick elements in it dont get me wrong the storyline is very original and the movie is reasonable but certainly not what they want you to believe it is the torture scenes are brilliant and thats why i was so disappointed that the rest of the film was pretty crappy a movie like saw 2 is much more tense has very few tense moments its really all about the cutting and stabbing and burning people go and see it for yourself its just another horror movie that belongs on the top shelf of the local movie rental nothing more nothing less,cruel
to my dismay people are giving this movie a ten this movie is just another chapter in the post scream era of horror movies trying to infuse comedy with no luck the movie seems more like a 70s porn if you are a gore fan and were hoping to see any that is realistic this is not the movie for you youd be better off watching an episode of niptuck most fans will point the scenes of the eye being burned out by the torch or the achilles being cut but in truth you do not see this happening nor do the following shot of the people evoke any real terror in the audience if you wanted to see a movie that is half way decent go check out roths cabin fever a much better movie and no dont listen to the morons saying he is trying to make a statement with his movies cabin fever is not about aids and this is not about american arrogance,cruel
is a cheap nasty exploitation film this wouldnt necessarily be a bad thing except for the fact that its been hyped to death not that thats entirely the filmmakers fault but i imagine anyone over the age of 14 will come out feeling shortchanged and if theyre 14 they shouldnt be watching it anyway because its so pointless the premise is good and the film does convey a sense of the panic one would feel at being trapped in a strange country with the events taking place also the ideas alleged basis in fact does have a chilling element to it but ultimately its a long wait until anything happens and when it does its strictly formulaic and even insulting the violence is not for the squeamish but its totally unconvincing if you dont avert your eyes there is no style in terms of cinematography or direction neither does it take the wolf creek realism angle it looks like a nasty version of porkys if it still appeals to yougive it a try but only on dvd,cruel
as gore films go this is a good one it is not just a series of stomach churning violent scenes that leave you reaching for the sick bag in fact the story line is well developed and the film as a whole has a menacing feel there are just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing the whole way through and you are always one step away from really knowing whats going on there is also a moral thread running through the film which is shown between the parallel of the boys buying women at the beginning and being bought themselves at the end there is just enough gore and violence to keep you happy but not leave you feeling over faced it is not a big budget hollywood gore flick packed full of special effects but i feel that it benefits from this because it has to rely on plot line and suspense to deliver the real chills on the whole this is an intelligent and believable horror movie that leaves you asking the question could this really be going on somewhere right now,cruel
hmmm where to start as a gore hound i was very disappointed with the movie i was hoping if the movie didnt deliver in gore it would at least deliver in shocks however it also failed to do this if you go to the movies to see full nudity and sex then this is the film for you although as a horror film it was a great let down however despite all the failings it does manage to deliver some hilarious scenesspoilers child smashes guards skull in with a baseball bat whilst others throw stones from the roof tops like ewocks from return of the jedichinese womans face gets blow torched when the remains of the eye are cut off with some scissors orange gloop oozes down her facetorturer slips on victims fingers and lands on his own chainsaw tcm,cruel
i would like to give what i saw in the plotting of the movie here watching this movie gives too much of precautions and deep inquiries before back packing somewhere to have the ultimate joy without no hesitations  three backpackers move to have their most exciting manhood experiences and wandering the west of europe and finding no real enjoyment or satisfaction and are guided to go to slovakia to have their unprecedented sexual intercourse with women of no men in town due to the waging wars and leaving women without their mensupposedlybesides the movies shooting techniques it gives too much knowledge of what might come after hastily decided plans and schemes and disgruntled killers restless desire to hire innocent people and killing them with the most vicious torture ways and tools and these three guys fateful allures by femmfatales and snares they get trapped and finding themselves handcuffed to be killed by the perverted freaks gives the audience the feel of adherence to the seatsduring the movie please do not ever look for any fullfledged technology or any failures  just watch it and avoid some sceneries and the directors slambang effort to display more blood ruptured and torn bones and pierces and eviscerated bodies etci would never ever be a substitute for jaypraxton even if i knew it was just a movie it gave the gooseflesh skin all on my body from the first moment to the lastnever hesitate watching this movie if you are into this kind of genreevren buyruk,cruel
as a horror fan its getting really disheartening why is it that its becoming increasingly difficult to find modern films that fit the bill of decent effective horror we all know it does exist as there have been the odd recent examples but were still having to rely all too frequently on the output from the asian film industries to find something remotely effectivethen i heard about from everything id heard it seemed like this might actually get back to some of the raw darker roots of the horror genre  and for once this wasnt just a remake of a great 70s80s exploitation flick i never liked cabin fever which although having potential never actually delivered anything but putting that aside the impression ive got from reading interviews with eli roth is that hes actually interested in going back to those exploitation roots and pushing the boundaries againso what the hell happened theres an interesting premise thats interesting in the context of a horror film the dark grim almost nihilistic feel that suggests something really shocking is going to happen yet very little actually does in fact i was actually quite surprised by how little the first half of the film was pretty bad and extremely cheesy and sets out to show as many naked women as possible which intentionally or not i found to be an mildly humorous homage to 80s slasher movies despite it showing a lack of actual creativity but also worked effectively in making 2 of the 3 main characters pretty unlikeable as you know something shocking is going to happen later on you can half accept these bad scenes at least that was what i thought the latter half of the film just completely missed the mark on being any sort of decent horror movie the torture scenes were generally quite restrained and unless youre new to the genre pretty much veered away from anything particularly shocking the one exception being the scene with the japanese girl there were no scares and the one or 2 suspenseful scenes were lacking any actual suspense the opportunity to shock shouldve been the saving grace of the film as thats how it had been billed but when this restraint is put alongside the bad first half i was left wondering why i was wasting my time the ending of the film turns out to be so contrived its practically the most painful thing to watch despite all this though the filmmakers did have 1 clever idea  the takashi miike cameoas this wasnt a tense or scary horror movie it needed to shock and repulse the audience to get a reaction that didnt happen yet again this is becoming the ultimate clich of the genre the potential was there to make something really effective but that was squandered and the film ends up as just another average american horror movie with little going for it although eli roth is clearly a horror movie fan it seems he doesnt actually make his films for fans of horror movies,cruel
with takashi miike quentin tarantino and eli roth all involved in you expect it to be an extremely entertaining film to watch it isntthere has been a lot of talk about this and i have to say i was disappointed the ending was a disappointment as it was so sudden and the first 25 minutes are just an excuse to show loads and loads of topless women i like them as much as anyone else but if i wanted to see that i wouldve hired a porn movie as you kind of already know what the film is about you are sat there waiting for something to happen and you have to wait a while for it to happen and when it does finally happen it isnt long until its over again which leaves you waiting for something more to happenfrom what there was at the main point of the film it was good apart from the im american i have to be a hero and save the girl kind of thing which was in there and didnt help its cause in making me like the movie overall i found it disappointing and has been built up so much due to the big names of tarantino takashi miike etc that you expect it to be amazing it doesnt live up to expectationsdont get me wrong its an ok film but my expectations were pretty high for it so it left me disappointed and the ending was a bit sudden i can maybe see a sequel sadly,cruel
okay enough is enough feel let down by this pretentious and hollow film eli i had so much hope as well even think cabin fever at least stayed true to its roots i know people will love this film gorehounds andor teenagers but come on the film is truly sensationalist and very shallow see neil marshalls attempts at horror im sick of americanised socalled horror movies no originality just ripoffs of usually eastern horror done before have you seen suicide circle then eli  whats with the thriller ending as well the american dodgingchasing around slovakia jesus man and the first half seemed to mock the american attitudes towards europeans do you believe in your characters eli the portrayals of amsterdam and more so bratislava was disgustingly inaccurate  was this the point then if so why such a conflicting ending come on people lets wake up theres better horror out there switchblade romancecalviere for the serious or dog soldiersbrain dead for the tongue in cheek etc etc is simply not good enough  and i really did expect great things 10 seconds and 1 sentence from miike as well at least the kids in the row ahead of me liked the separate gore scenes ps whats with the is slovakia a real country its part of a country called czechslovakia correct spelling are people this stupid   please let me know lee uk,cruel
off the few reviews i had to go on this had been made out to be a scary gory and entertaining horror flick how wrong they werethe main problem with writing a review of this film is that in doing so would give the plot away  thats how thin it isessentially some backpackers one of which looks quite like ryan merriman from final destination 3 head to slovakia on the advice of a guy they chance upon the they find themselves in is far from the utopia it seemsthere is little in the way of plot it serves just to move the characters on from location to location getting gorier as it goes under scrutiny it doesnt hold together in the slightest the only character you empathise with is killed off the bit part characters are transparent and do little to guide the film essentially is several minutes of gore not altogether that explicit with a few more minutes of dialogue a stupidly weak plot laboured characters and a loose endingfor my money stay away from this carnival of horrors,cruel
first of all i would like to let any readers of this review know that i love horror and have over 120 horror films and i love this genreright now the review first of all i dont understand why this film was made i am not a squeamish bloke but there were scenes in this film that i could not sit and watch it was like watching scenes from an abattoir just too much really and there really was no great plot i was close to walking out something i never do but stayed to see what happened at the end i really shouldnt have botheredthe performances were average but overall this film is dismal and goes for shock value over content avoid,cruel
i had waited a long time to see and with all the underground hype in the uk was lead to think this was going to be a full on horrorfest that would leave me shocked for daysoh dearnot only was the filmslow but had the script and dialogue of a homophobic schoolboywho was interested in nothing but tits and drugs the so calledshockhorror scenes were not only short but totally ineffectiveif you want goodpsychological horror see saw or saw 2in fact see the remake of the hills have eyeswhich is a far superior film in every waydown to the effects and the actingwhen i saw that at the cinema a lot of peoplemostly girls with boyfriends left after the first attack scene in the motorhomein most were just bored and stayedone thing i did think was disturbing about the film was the huge amount of homophobiaim a very open minded person like that and understand if it is needed for a films story and is relevant but its just put into the film as anti gay crapeveryone who they dont like is a fag or faggotanything they dont like is gaythe main nasty it is implied is a closet homosexualwith all this homophobia flying aboutit makes one think that eli rth just may be a closet homosexual himselfin all a childishineffective and long winded attempt at a shockhorrorsafe you time and money and see saw or seven or for a really good creep out the exorcism of emily rose,cruel
i found this film to be a complete disappointment it lacks a solid plot and this shows in the first half of the film with the pointless nuditythis time could have been used developing the tension and the plot as for the violence an goreyness the film has a lot to live up to and falls way short of saw and saw 2 the use of a gang of violent midgets children on the streets of bratislava was tacky and i failed to understand why they were in the film i think i have been more disturbed by some scenes in bambiactors jay hernandez and derek richardson did do a good job and provided humour to the film i think they forgot however that this is meant to be scary not funnyid advise anyone thinking of going to see this to wait until its on dvd,cruel
i have to admit when i started watching this i had great expectations afterall people were saying this is the scariest movie i have ever seenthe story is about 3 backpackers 2 americans and 1 european who travel through europe in search of some fun girls girls girls in the western europe they dont find much fun and they decide to visit a town in slovakiaby recommendationthis movie is just another american scifi story about how different degraded and dangerous eastern europe is this movie is not for those people that want to have thoughts like oh my god what is going to happen next i cant even imagine what can happen next the whole story is very predictable you know what is happening and what is going to happenthose that liked wolf creek and jeepers creepers will surely love this one also those that are more into blair witch project and saw will laugh at thistake a silly plot a bunch of fresh actors add some nudity add tarantinos name somewhere in the credits and a moderate amount of blood and there you go you have a moviein one sentence another overratedtarantino mediumbudget horror movie with a silly and exhausted plot with a lot of bugs and stupid mistakesthe only thought that came into my mind at the end of the movie was damn quentin i hope they payed you good money for this cause if you also like this crap  youre getting old,cruel
was warned this was extremely brutal and difficult to watch but found it slightly less shocking than japanese films such as auditiondo you agree with me not that i think it was nice big spoilers also liked the way it lured you into thinking nice boy white wannabe writer american was the hero and finally hispanic actor ended up being the boy to root for quite rare in films although im not a buff so correct me please thought hernandez carried it really well and am hoping hell be cast in the future really was gunning for some vengeance at the end good boy wasnt sure on people paying more for americans is this some antiamerica sentiment not keen on this aspect much im not american by the way,cruel
the film splits into two parts the teenage sex comedy part and the horror part which is not necessarily a fault horror is most effective if it starts in commonplace circumstances and smoking pot and hunting madly for sex no matter whether at the native college or with backpack overseas seems to be commonplace for kids of the age group that was portrayed in the film and that is dominating the audience i do not admire such behavior but i do not think that because of how the poor kids behave one cannot sympathize with them when they get tortured later surely he who confronts his companions with his naked bottom repeatedly for no apparent reason and calls himself the king of the swing should be punished but chopping off his head is a bit too much perhaps it would suffice if his friend an admirer of kafka would read him loudly the first chapter of the novel amerika anyway maybe a teenage sex comedy really has some potential to serve as a preamble to a horror as the makers of the film believe i went to the theater just to see whether this is the case in fact i walked out after the first torture scene and i knew in advance that i will walk out i do not have stomach for this kind of horror i like vertigo but not the silence of the lambs my general feeling is that the first part of the film is shot loosely without focus and verve as if the director thought i am shooting an indie film a film for fans of whom there will be plenty so why care when some suspense appears after all it seems like it was smuggled into the film by the actors behind the directors back i am talking about the creepy saladeater in the train and the girl with an eloquent smile at the reception desk of the but not the children gang please these wellfed czech kids thinking that they will look frightening if they will frown into the camera were laughable perhaps if the film was shot in slovakia as the script suggests and not in czech republic it would work better after all the opening takes of the horror classic nosferatu were shot in orava a rough but beautiful region of slovakia near the slovakpolish border,cruel
i began to watch the film with big wonder but i found it nothing but disgusting  these guys decided to go to a country which they do not know after only hearing some gossips from an unknown man  besides  this film is a very bad advertisement for slovakia  because when you watch the film it looks like every man and woman going to slovakia thinks about having sex and taking alcohol in any unknown  i think this film is just the right example for those which has a bad scenario with big logical mistakes and has very disgusting scenes in it  also first 20 minutes of the film was very like a porn movie  as a result  i do not recommend it who dislikes blood and brutality,cruel
dear fellow slovaks that feel offended with allegedly revolting image of their beloved native country portrayed in the movie could have calmed down i dare to refer to some of the postings at discussion boardssome spoilers what a delight to find out that those sophisticated entertainment for wealthy foreigners comes from nowhere else than homeland of ballet vodka caviar and kalashnikov just have a brief look at the email address at the elite hunting card incidentally my favorite sony wega that vividly and truthfully reproduced the colors of this movie was made in slovakiaeverything has its price perhaps russians are the easiest prey in that neck of the woods while americans are hard to find if american meat is five times as much expensive as that of the russian  its a market economy or maybe russians are simply more primitive and the excitement of torturing and killing a russian for mere five grands is nothing compared to the sky high pleasure of dismembering a more complex live organism it would be ridiculous if russians would feel somehow abused and may protest against the inadequate pricelistthe chick that lured the boys into the trap natalya is russian her blond girlfriend svetlana is czech besides no one would judge the entire country by a couple of hookers the bad guys are dutch german and american oh ive just forgotten hideous takashi miike nice cameo contrary to them the majority of the locals look friendly and intelligent i guess maybe the bunch of zombielike kids that kill for a chewing gum is something slightly over the top  but anyway they did a good job in one of the final sequencesthe rotten renegade cops that lawabiding individuals must be afraid of are abound elsewhere in the world  otherwise internal investigation officers could have got the hookmost of the cars exhibited in are good old russian volgas i understand that the country is now flooded with major european brands of vehicles and vintage russian make in a reformed east european economy may look something extraneous and ancient but at least this is a part of the soviet legacy that should hardly be embarrassed of the movie is shot on location in neighboring czech republic frankly i found most of the scenery to be quite beautiful and not appalling at all irrespective of either it stands for the particular country or noti believe theres absolutely none of country specific features reproduced in the film that could have shattered respectable image of slovakia especially considering that this is just a movie moreover the filmgoers shouldnt expect that foreign filmmakers could do a feature about their country better than their local producersas to the film itself unfortunately the concept about a kind of human safari wasnt extremely original as the producers claim at least i found roths earlier effort cabin fever to be more chilling effective and surprising,cruel
its a slow build up to a messy ending that really scarps the bones for any real reason or storyline even when it does eventually give you some meat to chew on its a little too familiar to the eyeeverything about this film smelt like it wanted to be a japanese extreme feature could even be the reason takashi is in it no real acting not much dialog just a lot of shots strung together to keep you watching for the last 15minutes of bloodbathim sure however that the fan boys out there will love this film as it does after all have qts name on it in the end was left puzzled and disappointed it does however have some very nice tography in it at least roth has a good eye for a shot,cruel
this film is not the style of quentin tarantino he directs films which include so much talking in this film there are little talking so much blood and sexuality of course he didnt direct this film but he included in a position of producing the movie named i wonder why did he do that he doesnt like that kind of movies does he also i think this movie does not deserve the point of 6 out of 10 because it doesnt have a kind is it a horror movie oh come on the ring is a horror movie cant you see the differences between them it is just an example i can give many examples to prove is not a horror movie actually not having a type,cruel
i read some reviews of this movie at imdb and still wanted to see it they couldnt be all wrong they werent fortunately a colleague of mine downloaded the movie so i could borrow his copy instead of paying for it the subtitles matched the movie they were just as bad i watched this movie most of the time using the ff button on the remote control even at 4 speed the movie had a slow pace i was wondering if maybe my dvd player had some sort of problem but no most of the time there wasnt happening anything at all everyone was just talking even at 4 speed it was easy to guess what they were talking about no sympathy was felt for the main actors and while the movie went on and on i was only hoping for these guys to get slaughtered so that the movie would come to an end please dont waste your precious time on this movie as it is a dreadful peace of work quentin tarantino should be ashamed to connect his name to it,cruel
first of all let me start off by saying they promoted this movie in australia as another tarantino flick which put me in the mood for something completely different to a nonhumor horror flickafter the credits where read i realized that he was just an executive producer and eli roth was the director i blame myself for not looking into it more being a movie buff and allim not a great horror movie fan as most horror flicks dont really work as one person mention i havent been scared since alien was made gore doesnt really work unless you feel like the characters this doesnt mean that you need to be like them but know someone who is similar which worked in many would have complained about the soft porn and i agree but it was to put you in the picture of young boys who will be easily seduced by the thought of easy sex in europe and the people who live in europe where taking advantage of this by showing them what they wanted to seeone of the heros was clearly a mummies boy and frankly i was glad died the hardest he was homophobic and he was making a point that he was a prude and yet he wanted the cheap sex and arrogance of being an american he was perhaps a sterotype american and to the nonamericans of the world they could identify that type of character i was sort of scared that he would be the sole survivor as in other movies of a similar nature but i was glad it was not the casethe horror was perhaps too strong for many but i agree it wasnt labored on and when you look around at horror films i found it hard to find anything that was scary enough to make me move and yes this film scared me and moved me so the goal was achievedi think that the last victim had a great twist and instead of all the movies where he manages to escape and the police save the day it was good to see someone getting revenge for a change most movies are fairly predictable i guess this wasnt one of themas art which it should be seen as i liked it overall perhaps i wasnt in the mood for this type as they promoted it as something it wasnt eli roth picked good cast of not so well known actors and it was good to see ladies where not just the pretty bodies but had an important role to playto a point too much sex strong gore but if they didnt do it the movie wouldnt have worked the eye scene was fantastic im not a great hollywood fan as i guess you could see with my comments if you tried to tone this movie down wouldnt be even a decent bad movie but if they did tone it down it would really just allow others to bag it as another boring hollywood movie,cruel
gotta get as mediocre as i can with a 5 out of 10why because this nearly mimics everything a cannibal ferox or cannibal holocaust has already done and doing so without improving a bit over the classics i desperately waited for some ingenuity for some ironic for anything that would lift above the 2 aforementioned classics and bring the exploiter to modern cinema alas nothing i gotta admit i truly love cabin fever eli roths first for everything it has done with the genre thats completely missing in with instead you get no outstanding soundtrack no good characters the casting is terrible the camera never seems to get above average tv stuff a stupid script in conclusion everything you are used to have in a seventies exploiter classic but instead of going the full homage way with inserting some ironic and selfdisrespecting stuff eli just did the same stupid stuff they did in the seventiesnah this thing has had some excellent marketing stuff involved and truly outstanding poster art but behind all this theres not much at all to explore subtract the jungle insert slovakian cellar bunkers,cruel
ok where shall i begin oh yeah forget tarantino the story behind the film is the only aspect i truly liked about it paying to torture people very cool idea to make a film about but the end result is a disappointment this movie started as a road trip film a la american pie or some sort party till you drop and some sex on the side seems to be the theme of the main characters notice all the flaws in in the beginning there is no real moment in this film where i sat on the point of my chair the first 40 minutes are very boring to be honest to much beautiful single perfectbodyhavinggirls throughout the film very unrealistic all girls seem to be craving for sex which aint the fact in real life ofcoarse when the torture starts at around 43minutes viewing time it gets a little exciting but no more than that it goes from an american pie into a james bond flick trying to be realistic but with that amount of flaws in a movie its hard to create a realistic movie aint it 4 out of 10 is more than enoughflaws dutch people speaking german are you kidding me the main characters telling the viewer they are in amsterdam which isnt the case looking at the buildings and surroundings its hard to travel without your passport in the east side of europe but for the main character it aint a problem,cruel
1 it has loads of gore 2 it has some black humor 3 dont take it seriously 4 check out the more than hot chicks in it 5 go watch it with your gore hating girlfriend youll have a blasti know i know  it has his flaws and stuff  but its entertaining  the gore is very descent situations in with the characters get are horrible but fun to watch if you love gore movies that is and peeps from usa  we dont speak german in holland i am from holland myself anyway just go watch it with your girl have a nice drink and some popcorn its really not as bad as they say it has the feel of a 80s90s gore flick,cruel
starts out as before sunset this time the american boys are two instead of one josh still has to get past a sad high school story while paxton in the first only serve as a comedic narrative device for josh to try unblock himself throw in another icelandic overly expansive dude he probably would have been black if the movie was set in usa for goodso you got this notsofunny questforeurosexandpot set up and running and guess what its boring does it get any better short answer no these guys end up in an exeastern block poor country harboring all but the most illegal businesses and all they got is killed well not the narrative device who after all should be left almost untouched to keep the movie going is it scary theres a blair witch project lookalike sequence which is halfway through the movie black screen people screaming jeez people im totally scared by the absolute boredom this stems among the other sequences worth noting there is one where paxton cuts the optical never off a jap girl who hes saved from being tortured then they happily escape she obviously feels no pain and then you find the only meaning of this otherwise useless character is that her suicide later provides paxton a way to get on a train unnoticed superbly writtenim really scared by the simple fact they want you to pay to see this shabby piece of script translated in an entirely uninteresting 90 minutes long filmthats why im running away from the theater im left with the feeling that the filmmakers see us the moviegoers as the bitches dumb useless cash cows,cruel
im reading a lot of comments that state how kickass this film ishas anyone noted that there is almost not one single original piece to this film at all every and i mean every depiction of violence has been done before many times over most of the sequences after the initial oh so long characterization of the vics were lifted from other films as obscure as delicatessan mainstreamish as marathon man ummm hello to as lowest common denominator as toxic avengerthis is no more on the edge or pushing the envelope than bloodsucking freaks it just looks better same amount of nudity though theres more augmented breasts here same amount of poor acting same amount of redeeming social value zeroyou want people to freak out like really freak out this film is an example of how the potential was there but wasnt done properly if this film really wanted to screw peoples minds properly than joshs derek richardson  the best actor in the piece  killed off first  duh torturedeath scene shouldve gone for 20 minutes that wouldve been scaryfilms like this focus too much on the violence to freak people out you wanna freak people out focus on the psychosis of the people doing the torturing show us how much fun theyre having seeing an eye being blow torched out of a victim that i dont even know let alone care about does nothing for me however seeing the antagonists excitement over it that would scare me would scare anyoneall due respect to roth i have never made a horror film i have seen a lot of them tho and i can tell you i have seen before in many different variations often made by far superior film makers more often made by people who cant direct a hose pipe let alone a film people kinda like eli rothim sorry but geez even compared to saw another film made from rehashed ideas from countless other films this was bad bad badat least it was better than cabin fever,cruel
all those posters all those hyped comments the marketing trick that they did in my cinema giving airplane pukebags when you buy ticket all fall into ice cold water when you get out of a cinemaspoiler 1 first hour of a movie  lots of breasts and drugs 2 15 minutes of little bloody scenes and lets be honest i saw more disturbing scenes watching the simpsons itchy and scratchy 3 heroic endi never knew that cutting of 2 fingers produces 5 liters of blood i should watch when cutting bread next time cause even if i as much as scratch my fingers with knife i will obviously bleed to deathwhy all the hype all those scary posters all over the place scariest movie ever yea right go watch alien 1 or silence of the lambs and its friends feeling pretty much disappointed unless someone is paying for your ticket or renting dvd for you  dont watch it cause you will waste your money,cruel
cast is pretty unknown but these american twenty something are well  assorted eli roth director of cabin fever another odd film has conceived a movie with brutal action scenes and horrifying sequences that goes beyond the limits of this genre nevertheless the film is quite tense and not that silly maybe slovakia though the flick was shot in czech republic is portrayed too much like a monsters land but the idea of post college european backpacking turning into a nightmare has its originality all things considered not only nudity what gorgeous eastern europe gals and blood but also something more though its not a masterpiece,cruel
i have watched some of the horror movies that have come out this past year and most of the time i have been tragically disappointed with what ive seen watereddown remakes of asian horror films mixed with even worse remakes of hollywoodditto and on top of that we have absolute crap like skeleton key not a remake but still lacking all kinds of creativity and fresh ideasone of the movies i did in fact enjoy somewhat was saw and when i read what was written about it seemed this would be something similar but i think that its pretty far from it while saw was no real masterpiece as such it did have a couple of nice touches it was fairly original and most of all it had a definite touch of evil ingenuity to it that gave a certain touch to all of the unpleasantness i found that touch sorely lacking in this movie starts out like a collegemovie three guys in europe enjoying legal drugs and loose women then they hear of a in slovakia where the women are apparently insanely beautiful and willing and they love americans too good to be true of course it is this is a horror movie after allit seems to me director eli roth really went above and beyond trying to create as many disgusting effects as possible in this movie and in that respect at least was a success but all the blood in the world nor a shallow ending trying to make some sort of commentary about human nature cant save a movie that lacks style as well as substance without either a sense of humor or a distinct message in all the carnage its just blood and blood in itself is not very interesting i guess there is a huge crowd loving movies like this one and maybe im just not one of those people who can appreciate this kind of unpleasantness because when the movie ended i found very little to like or be impressed with,cruel
i was very disappointed by this film after seeing quentin tarantino talk about the film and knowing he was executive producer i really thought i was going to be in for a great movie he did an interview were he talked about taking horror to the next level and usually films associated with him deliver and deliver big but not this time the fact that it is restricted to 18 years and over here in australia i also thought it would have to be something pretty exceptional the plot was very thin the suspense was nil all of the killing scenes felt like they were cut short by 5 minutes the story was as predictable as any b grade horror movie i found texas chainsaw massacre and saw 2 far better movies the movie poster said scariest movie in 10 years i thought it was one of the most disappointing movies in 10 years,cruel
ive watched the movie and i dont get few things1 why does it talk about slovakia when the whole movie was shot in a village in czech republic and it doesnt have anything to do with slovakia2 there is this girl who claims to be italian with russian roots and speaks czechslovak dont these people know that russian is a totally different lanuage from slovakian or czech if you speak russian you cannot understand those languages3 guys are using new cellphones and the whole movie was shot in 6070s or at least that is how they showed czech repbut not to only mention what i dislikei really liked how they pictured czechoslovakian girls because they are truly the hottest,cruel
quentin tarantino presentsand thats about as far as his influence extends several cogs above cabin fever to be sure but that isnt saying muchif one were to be objective about this filmperhaps subjective is more appropriate  one might justifiably wonder what the hell has happened to societys values and creeds generally that a piece of questionable cinematic worth like this is paraded as upmarket entertainment not a solitary persons life on this cerebrallychallenged planet could possibly be enriched by watching this ode to mindless violence the sad thing is that just such a scenario  an arthouse catering for the more twisted morons amongst us lets say  would in fact make millions there would be no shortage of psychotic customers queuedup with their black and deckerstarantino has flair  his horror from dusk till dawn thru kill bill is art is artless  a crudely assembled rampagingly dark canvas filled with a motley array of fully dislikeable peoplehernandez himself the one marginal exception who amongst us is in to euro trash like this anyway  this flick has probably set tourism there back three decadesthe cinematographers odd artsy turn cannot hide the true nature of this vulgar and unbecoming little flickand thats exactly what it is  little for those of you happy to queue up expecting to be pleasured at the sight of ongoing torture and maiming throughout the film  be aware that nothing happens until so far into the thing youll be wondering whether or not you wandered into the wrong theater by my estimationactual screen shots of a high disgust factor read as drilling sawing gouging and their ilk take up less than eight minutes the rest is simply your imagination at work the film justifiably deserves an oscar however for presenting the greatest number of repulsive characters on screen in the space of 90 minutes do you really think gregory peck charlton heston david niven henry fonda kenneth moore danny kaye bette davis peter ustinov deborah kerr robert redford audrey hepburn laurence olivier and katie hepburn to name but thirteen would have queuedup for the chance to star in this crap yeah i hear youwho are they,cruel
a couple of years ago eli roth made a movie that was lets face it okay now he intends to follow that okay movie with this poor excuse of a film this film seemed to me that it was just an excuse for the director to tour europe with a camera a crew and a couple of unimportant actors who need to learn their craft harsh i hear you say well tuff this is crap and i for one want eli roth whipped or even pummeled with bats for wasting the promising talent he has on this really crap filmi also want to know what qt was thinking when he decided to present this film was it for the money was it because eli roth had photos of him wearing high heels and suspenders or was it because he thought it had potential im hoping for the high heels and suspenders that way id still have respect for him as a film makerif you dont want to waste any time in your life then avoid this movie,cruel
the marketing was great big names and throw up guarantees but what came up on the screen was just crap the first 40 minutes are filled up with cheap drug and sextalk which nobody really wants to see and after that 3 or 4 gross scenes are thrown in thats all folks no suspense no stomach churning and a stupid up story make this movie something to scare your 6 year old sister not more i really dont know what kind of a sissie could get offended by just because of 3 scenes if you like bloody movies and if youre used to watch films like high tension or 70s cannibal stuff take your hands away from this one its not worth the ticketprice,cruel
the 3 backpackers are in amsterdam so then why does everyone speak german i hate it when that happens its very tiring to see a pretty good movie from my favorite genre but the research part is just so very bad quentin if you read this man youve made good movies but just dont do this again please for the love of god man its almost discrimination ok so i just found out that my comment has to be at least 10 lines some other prejudices for you folks in the us or canada we dont do dances and stuff and live in windmills we do make pretty impressive structures like dams and buildings we also have the most expensive gasoline 110 per liter and o yeah we are dutch our language doesnt sound like the german language its more like a combination of english german and french thats all what i wanted to say about the subject thank you for viewingale van der heijden aka aikitoy,cruel
was there a website address on the business card that was slid underthe bathroom stall at the end of the movie if so what was it or was it just an email addressalso did anyone find out what the girls were saying to each other in the bar when that dude let them know he could understand themfinally does anyone know if this type of crap really happens anywhere in the worldme and my girl were talking about it and we figured there had to be because that just couldnt be completely madeup,cruel
frankly i did not expect this from tarantino but anyway he is not the director so i can forgive himthe girls were the highlight of the movie otherwise there was nothing much in it i would not call it horror nor a thriller suspense far away from that if you call the reason for all the crap happening in the movie as the suspense i would not buy that and it was revealed in a pathetic waythe saw series is a much better directed one go and see thateli roth can go to hell dooms day is nearbyoverall very bad gory and disturbing,cruel
if you want to go see a cheezy poorly written horror movie to laugh at like eli roths other movie cabin fever then is perfect for you  otherwise dont waste your money at the theaters and wait for it to come out on video get some beers and watch it with a bunch of people so you can have some fun watching a laughable movieafter reading some of these user comments about i was expecting a good horror movie that you made you think people said things like this movie questions human values it was very well written the torture scenes were intense  all of which were not truethe first half of the movie is basically a soft porn which you could see better ones of on cinemax every weekend starting at about 10pm the second half is no where near as intense as people made it out to be my friends and i were laughing out loud during the most of the movie my wife who usually has to turn her head during most movies like this didnt even flinch once and i think was more disturbed by the fact that she was watching a porno with like 50 people the rest of the people all had the same exact expression on their face when the movie ended  you know the one that says i cant believe i just watched that whole movie and dropped like 40 because of itdont get me wrong this is not that bad for a goofy gory movie get together night for a 4 rental like cabin fever thirteen ghosts etc but dont expect anything more than that,cruel

each year less than 50  of mainstream amc films can truly be called good movies the majority of them are unoriginal poorly made or crowdpleasers when it comes to the horror genre it is rare to see a true mainstream gem this year eli roths pseudohorror film is best described as a modern roman coliseum it is a wasteful piece of violence and sexfilled entertainment in which moviegoers sadly waste their money on at the local cineplex was sold out opening night the audience laughed and cheered at the sex violence and torture entertainment and filmgoing in general has reached a pathetic new heightthe premise of has potential three pleasureseeking males go on a foreign escapade of drugs and sex hoping to sleep with as many women as possible what starts off as an imitation of eurotrip or a van wilder movie soon turns into a masochistic vacation from hell rich men have payed big money to torture and murder these american pigswhen shifts drastically in its tone and filming style one would expect some kind of substance or genuine type of horror unfortunately roths film is a flatliner this film is not scary and nothing comes unexpected unlike the best horror film of 2005 wolf creek eli roth presents for pure shock value his characters are ridiculously 2d and seeing them get tortured does not feel all that bad the viewer should have some sort of empathy for these helpless victims but they are seen as puppets in a circus acttakashi miike the modern king of japanese horror has a cameo in referring to the warehouse where the torture is happening he says be careful you could lose all your money in there what a true statementfor eli roth for his worthless characters in the film and for moviegoers squandering money to see a disgraceful waste of bad horror,cruel
eli roth made cabin fever which was not in balance he did it a little bit better with but not much the movie does not meet up to its expectations created by the name of quentin tarantinothe first half is ridiculous with all the people in amsterdam speaking german taking the train from amsterdam to bratislava which according to the movie must be very easy then bratislava looks like a city just bombed by the nazis inhabited by street kids men who look like they all belong to the mafia and beautiful young women who walk half naked all the timethe last 30 minutes are more what i expected from this movie the dirty horror tension trying to escape and a plotor something like thatthe second half saves the movie but eli roth has to improve his work a lot to score a 6,cruel
title 2006 director eli roth cabin fever cast jay hernandez review of all the overhyped movies in the worldthis one takes the taco i mean eli roth the director of the disappointing cabin fever is back with his new creation and this time around he uses the same marketing strategy he wisely employed while promoting cabin fever which was hyped as a return to gritty 70s horror and we all know how that turned out so here we are again with roths latest money making scheme did he succeed in making a better film then cabin fever the story is about three friends who are out in amsterdam backpacking through the country enjoying all the girls booze and drugs they can on a certain occasion they meet this guy who tells them about a that has the horniest and prettiest girls in the universe of course they fall for that irresistible offer and go they hook up with the girls and one by one the guys suspiciously start to disappearthere were some good things in this movie first off the way the film was shot is beautiful we get some nice lighting some nice grissly looking sets art direction and cinematography were excellentwe get good performers jay hernandez being the one that stands out the most he shined in crazybeautiful and here he shows he wasnt just a one time fluke the rest of the cast of unknowns do a cool job and the characters seem real and likable so basically we got the elements for a good film right the problem for me with roths was that it wasnt original at all roth has obviously been seeing a lot of japanese horror films and he is just copying a lot of their style of storytelling roths appreciation and influence by jhorror is so evident that even takashi miike one of the most respected japanese horror directors has a cameo on the filmbut again the film was walking over all too familiar ground friends backpacking through a strange country thats almost as overused as the old stormy weathercar breaking down spooky mansion down the road plot device but there it was similarities to saw im sure will spread like wildfire theres even a scene clearly ripped off from the japanese movie called suicide clubi guess roths just doing the same thing that tarantino does with his films which is basically ripping off stuff that he likes and using it in his own movies but at least tarantino makes up for that by writing excellent stories and dialogue not so on roths film heck if youve seen john woos hard target youll get the gist of what this movie is about the movies plot is waaay to simple so much so that i quickly got bored when i saw that it was going to go nowhereand then there was the gore and this my friends was the thing that upset me the most we get some gore but this film is being marketed as a balls to the wall gore fest that will leave you gasping and it really isnt all that the gore was highly restrained i could feel the blades of the mpaa cutting away at this film more sharply then ever beforewatching reminded me a lot of the time when i saw romeros theatrical release of land of the dead you could just feel the censors holding back roths film specially during those scenes involving the actual torture of the characters just when you think stuff is going to get good snip the almighty hand of the mpaa cut the film im guessing i can better review this film once i have seen the final directors cut of the film and not this hacked down version i hope the gore will really be out there cause the version i saw at the theaters was really tame compared to other horror films ive seen it does have its moments like that eyeball scene but for this seasoned horror fan the gore was a bit lightbut movies arent all about gore so lets see aside from the fact that the movie was ripping off a gazillion other horror moviessome scenes were just too stupid theres an instance in which a character looses two of his fingers at a certain pointyet he manages to drive a car run around hide and fight some bad guys all without passing out i wasnt alone in thinking that it wasnt at all possible the dude would have passed out from hamerging a loooong time ago yet there he was hopping about i know i know its just a movie but suspension of disbelief will go only so far all in all id say that was a film that had its moments and had some good things going for it and yes when compared to cabin fever is far superior but still it was missing one ingredient that matters a whole lot for me in horror movies originality still i think roth can come up with something better this sophomore effort is ok but just ok im still going to wait out for roths masterpiece cause this sure wasnt itrating 3 out of 5,cruel
this was trash 30 minutes of naked people followed by 20 minutes of nothing and then 40 minutes of blood and people getting cut upid save your time and money and just look at smut websitesalso i was told tarantino directed it i suppose i can only blame myself for not checking that out myself but he didnt he presented it and helped develop the idea for it what a stupid pointless moviethe russian chick is pretty hot thoughthis movie is up there on my list of greats with day after tomorrow flight of the phoenix even though not related theyre just as bad,cruel
this is yet another texas chainsaw ripoff it seems that is the trend in horror these days filmmakers are either extremely classphobic or they are banking on the idea that the movie going public is it seems like every horror movie these days is about some sort of sadistic person or group living in an isolated impoverished area getting their jollies by torturing and killing snotty overprivileged kidsfilms like tcmespecially the remake house of wax wrong turn wolf creek house of 1000 corpses etc all play on the idea that poor rural people are dark dirty and evil things to be feared it may be because this stereotype of rural bumpkins is unattractive to an image and wealthobsessed youth culture and its easier to fear those who are unattractiveanother reason for tcm type villains may be because the rural american image is usually shadowed by a reputation for racism and modern horror audiences are so saturated by urban pop culture that subliminally tying a villain to racism makes said villain even more despicableobviously does not fall into this category though the prejudice in this picture is just as prevalent here we substitute poor foreigners for poor americans with the fear of the foreign ever increasing in an age marked by widespread antiamerican sentiment abroad it only stands to reason that we we have evil poor foreigners looking to torture and kill americans kids just out to spend spring break innocently spending their money exploiting eastern euro whoresso if you count that eli roth combined the fear of the impoverished and the rural and tied it with american xenophobia as being original than yes is original taking texas chainsaw and relocating it in a war torn country that deserves americas pity more than its fear was a stroke of genius the same kind of genius that decided to send john wayne hero character to vietnam for the green berets roth may not be a good writer but he definitely knows how to profit off of peoples prejudices if he were around hollywood for the early eighties we might of had night of the living aids victims with zombified homosexual men hell bent on spreading a disease im guessing that reagan would have exec producedin summary roths latest pictures incredible lack of plot or originality is the least of its sins the greatest sin of them all is that id be willing to bet this steaming pile knocked more than one superior project off track for release,cruel
i found that this movie contained enough blood and gore to keep my attention because the story line or the lack there of was certainly not enough to even last twenty minutes the story line in any other film might have taken up twenty minutes okay heres the basic story two college guys go to europe to do the whole eurotrip thing and meet this guy who sends them to russia to get the best girls who just love to give it up for the american dreams they arrive at this a hotellike place that you share rooms with other guests almost dormlike conditions and meet these two beauties who are just as they were toldready and willing for the americans they continue to see the girls and find out that the is actually a supermarket for the russian mafia to find people to kill they charge people to come and kill someone just so they can find out how it feels it took you just as long to read that as it should have taken to show on the screen the only thing that i found entertaining about this feature was the torture sequences that allowed blood to spill and pour overall it was no more than okay,cruel
over all i thought was one of the worst movies ive wasted my time on no great plot and not really a well thought out movie at alldrugs sex and clubs are all sweet but as it progresses and reaches the murder parts it just kind of makes you want to twitch the places they used for filming were uber sweet the buildings sspecially asian chicks in there are pretty hot too but seriously i felt i wasted half my brain cells watching that whats the point to it ohhh yeah im gunna pay to flipping kill someone is not the greatest plot in all of history if you havent quite figured that one out yet i think id be better off watching two heads arebetter than none than this if you wanna make a killer movie have a plot,cruel
i seriously did not like this movieand this is not because it was too scary or anything i live for scary movies it was just badthere was no plot whatsoever and it was entirely too predictable i think that the point of a scary movie is that you dont know what is coming and when you do you dont know exactly what or when the acting was horrible and it was just bad i cant think of anything else to describe it as it had so much potential and the idea of transitioning to paying to have sex to paying to kill thats pretty good butit just seemed like a movie for college kids to watch drunk while a little horny and then puke afterward,cruel
i so so so long for the day when you could go to the theater to see a horror movie and actually be treated to a movie that was good not just something which blurs by your eyes for an hour and a half leaving you thinking whatthats it when the end credits start to rollsure there is the rare exception i quite liked the grudge but in this time era the horror genre is an almost barren wastelandand this title makes sure to continue the unfortunate trendyou cant really say much about the plot without spoiling elements of the movie for those whove not seen it because the plot is so paper thin typical for this type of movie sadlythere is not much to talk aboutlike the summary sayspot boobies sex and fake gorewhile i have no moral objections to any of these things its clear that at least three of the above mentioned subjects were very heavy padding for this filmthere is nothing new about the plot watch any movie where wealthy guys get together to hunt torture kill whatever some hapless victimsmix in your typical hollywood victim survives becomes a bad ass and goes back for revenge garbage and you pretty much know what type of abysmally uncreative story your are in forthis movie takes a few more hits however due to the ridiculously convenient revenge scenes as well as bad story tellinghow did the lone survivor mysteriously escape all those people including law enforcement who were looking for himguess they decided they didnt want to find him so badly after allall in all this movie is little more than cheap porn mixed up with a sloppy graphically shocking gore storyand a predictable shallow outcomeif you are in the mood for that sort of thing greatotherwise those hoping for a good horror story will leave the theater unfulfilled,cruel
is about a group of young men venturing out to fulfill their quenches for sex and drugs of course torture enters into the movie later as the previews depict and at this point the movie takes a sharp turn the film includes a very long introduction which exists simply to show that the protagonists like breasts and pot the characters are certainly shallow but the problem here is that it is difficult to feel empathy toward them at any point in the film is better than most horror movies for those who have seen the grudge and the like and were rightfully disappointed you will find that this movie is undoubtedly better but unlike the truly successful horror movies like saw this lacks an intricate plot and good actingwhich despite this common modern belief that gore and quick bursts of loud music or lights flickering on and off to make you jump is all that mattersis actually a problem again the film is gory although a good portion of the movie lacks any goreor suspense for that matter for those who love gore blood and fingers breaking off see this you will see some images that will more than make you feel uneasy but this movie could have been better and youll see why too,cruel
eli roths is the kind of horror movie that film buffs have been waiting for a long time the horror and gore dont come until later in fact it felt like i was watching the sequel to eurotrip the story begins with three friends in amsterdamn looking for easy sex in the brothels when they come back they meet up with a guide who tells them about this great in another part of the country that has tons of hot girls living in it at first when the guys get there they hook up immediately with some of the women and they have a fun filled night of sex and debauchery then the friends begin to disappear one by one and they each end up in this factory where people pay a lot of money to torture and kill another human being i dont want to give anything more away but what makes this film work is how the audience perceptions about violence change at the start the violence is very horrifying and disturbing but by the end i heard crowds cheering the torture scenes are filled with enough carnage to make you squirm a little but it will never compare to the last fifteen minutes of auditon the thriller by takeshi miike who has a cameo appearance in another thing that made the not as scary as i thought was the score the composer was trying to make it sound more like a hitchcock thriller than a horror movie i do hope that horror genre will continue in this vain and try its best to scare us to our wits end ,cruel
when i first heard of this film i was thinking oh tarantino is producing it its made by the cabin fever director and it looks pretty gory when i first saw the trailer i thought it looked somewhat like a saw ripoff i saw this film last night in a pretty crowded theater the basic story is 3 friends are in amsterdam and basically just getting high and looking for girls which they find out are very easy to come by they here about a with these great girls that will satisfy them so they head out there then they find out what awaits them at that i was pretty disappointed with this movie the trailers seem to put it out as a real scary gory film when its honestly not this movie is just about as gory as saw theres a lot of humor in the movie which i didnt really know about because the trailers are pretty misleading and really dont let you even know anything about the story theres a few cool scenes but i was expecting a lot more this movie is not very good its definitely better than cabin fever but thats not particularly a good movie i recently saw wolf creek and think both movies rank around the same score but i would say i enjoyed a tiny bit more both movies start out pretty slow and could have been trimmed down in time drastically if you really wanna go out to the theater and see a horror movie then this is the one to see right now but honestly i would just wait for the dvd instead of seeing this movie you might want to maybe rent some of the good newer horror movies like devils rejects saw high tension which i all enjoyed much more than ,cruel
i have to say i went into this movie with high hopes probably to high but i am a big fan of horror films what i was hoping for wasnt what i found though if anything id say this film was a thriller not a horror movie at all the shock value was probably what was the most redeeming quality of the movie in my opinion the thing thats i guess is scary about the movie might be that it could actually happen i lived in europe for a few years while in the military and visited a few s while there if i had seen this movie before i went i may have thought a few times about going i recommend seeing this only if your into being shocked and wondering could this really happen to me,cruel
a film that doesnt know what it wants to be behaves like a sex comedy but has a mean spirit and problems with tone shift and is just too funny in a very immature way to be an intense horror film has been hyped as a retro horror film any movie goer going into this film with that notion will be disappointed the bottom line it really isnt that scary or gory also tried to included social commentary the film fails completely in this aspect spoilers the concept of how rich people will pay for anything and that there are sick people who will take the money and provide them with the product remains lost in the mess that comprises s narrative spoilerseli roth the director continues to exhibit the same weakness that his feature film debut cabin fever suffered from both films should be more shocking and thrilling creating a sense of fear and dread but roths horror comedy approach deflates whatever emotional ride he was setting up his audience forthis fault of roth is a real shame shows great promise and missed opportunities eli roths direction in does show some genuine ingenuity and talent one scene in particular where one of the victims sits in complete darkness not knowing what will happen to him was very nerve racking and effective the opening three minutes of are also quite good so maybe one day eli roth will make a good horror film but for people looking for a far better take on the theme presented in this material i would recommend my little eye this small clever film is not a great horror film but my little eye successfully tackles the same themes as eye manages to be truly frightening and more importantly follows through on the social commentary of the rather sick and perverse idea that was the basis of end kdc,cruel
i just came back from seeing this film and surprisingly i left the theater with the same numbness i felt when i saw the passion of the christ only this time part of my tranquility was due to the fact that i was stunned that hollywood has now stooped so low to make a movie like if you are expecting something extremely gory and twisted go see it however if you actually want a decent plot without a 95 minute nightmarish feel to it go see something elsethe thing is we all have our own disgusting torturefilled imaginations that could fill up numerous pages of a script the real hard part is finding a way to weave them into a good storyline not just chuck a bunch of blood and gore at the screen and call it a moviei thought cabin fever was a great movie very smart and original however is like eli roth and quentin tarantino getting together in front of a computer trying to play a game of who can outgross whom theres no doubt that you wont be able to get some of the images out of your head and will probably talk about them for a couple of days but is doomed to fade away into another goreinfested film that only 13 year old boys watch with their girlfriends to ensure that the girls will cuddle up with them when the torture begins,cruel
on friday the 13th of january 2006 i had the great pleasure of seeing i am sure this movie had the attention of the male audience the entire 95 minutes it ran the one thing that i was disappointed about was all the nudity in the movie hence the r  18a rating but seriously you have half of the movie showing breasts the entire time it was really like watching softcore porn but in a movie theater with 100 people around you after the film had ended i could over hear women saying that they didnt bring their boyfriends or husbands to the movie so they could sit watch breasts being shown every 10 minutes i get the fact that it takes place in europe but all that for a movie okay  looks like i spoiled it spoiled the fact that the movie has a lot of nudity that being said i am not against nudity pornography or anything of the adult nature all i am saying is that it was a little to muchafter getting passed the nudity and getting into the storyline this film was excellent it had me on the edge of my seat right until the end you think you know whats gonna happen but then bam  it turns around and you are in awe after watching this film i and a lot of other people i have talked to got a saw  saw ii vibe from it great movie 810  go see it,cruel
i watched this movie because i am a huge quinten t fan not to mention that student loan monies have not arrived and i counted change to watch it i was not pleased with it it made me feel like i was watching a home movie of high school age kids in europe the dialogue was not the level i would have anticipated from a movie like this produced by someone who is known for intelligent dialogue i left half way through because a gross movie is only worth it if the other content is at least at par with a decent movie save your money and rent it when you feel like having a slumber party with a bunch of children and pretend you are watching faces of death i have warned you,cruel
the only way youll enjoy is if you rent the dvdfast forward it to the second halfand watch it from therethe film is as graphic and disturbing as they say it is and blood and gore fans will find a taste for itthats only if theyre able to sit through about an hour of character development and plot setting which has not been surrounded by any suspensesurethere is the nudity but i didnt really carethis is sad because director eli rothwho directed cabin feverwhich i thought was superiorseems to have a taste for horror films but he fails to use it in this filmalthoughthe film is not that badi felt pretty much angered by the fact that i got less of what i wantedits not one of the best or one of the worstbut some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of waiting and the lack of suspense,cruel
this type of horror fare is not my usual cup but based on other viewers positive raves i felt compelled to give it a try not without some trepidation did i purchase my ticket for what i felt would be a squeamish couple of hours i dont know anything about director eli roth but with quentin tarantinos name attached to the project i felt that there might be something here worth taking awaymovie goers save your money this film uses the tried and true formula  college age students getting one good hedonistic fling out of their systems before real life the gruesome depictions of mutilation and slasher gore and the go for the gusto revenge rampage by the lead character paxton jay hernandez i cant even say that any of the torture scenes were particularly innovative though those faint of heart will require shielding the eyes every so often now based on what ive read im sure the version i saw had deleted scenes for american audiences but ones imagination is tested enough with this offering and i can honestly say i didnt have to avert my eyes even oncei recall reading one posters summation stating that one would think about this film well after the movie was over that indeed was the case as my thirty minute ride home was entirely concerned with why i spent the time and money falling for the hype,cruel
this movie is extremely violent violence includes use of chainsaw gun knife etc i have never seen a movie with more gore the first third of the movie has an enormous amount of nudity but the last twothirds is pure gore and torture brilliant movie but not for me took some time to uncover the main idea of this movie but you eventually figure it out i would suggest another movie if you have a weak stomach the movie is very jumpy my friend and i jumped like a foot when the guard grabbed the two main characters i screamed so loud most of the gore looks like it could actually have been real but the detached body parts look extremely fake,cruel
as a fan of film in general but especially the horror genre i have to admit that i was drawn into the hype swirling around this movie and went in with expectations that may have been a little high i will say that i do enjoy cabin fever for what it is a purposefully overthetop horrorcomedy that was about having fun and being inventive as most horror fans seem to confess ive been nothing but bored by most of the american mainstream submissions lately finding movies like saw to be at most an interesting idea very poorly executed so with all its talk about a return to real american horror and likening itself to the recent school of noholdsbarred asian filmmaking and miike cameos i had high expectations it seemed like eli was speaking just to my complaints and hopes concerning what the genre needswhat crap that all turned out to ehyes i had read that the opening was purposefully drawnout t  a that was meant to lure the viewer into a eurotrip familiarity so that when the terror hit the characters deaths would be that much more terrifying still that seems like mere pandering to any intellectual complaint that lets face it a whole lot of naked breasts will make some viewers happy no matter what a letdown the film turns out to be the first half of the movie is worthless the plot is barely inched along and its totally obvious to anyone who has seen a horror movie before who isnt to be trusted there is no air of mystery or even a satisfying the audience is in the know kind of suspense after all of the nothing i found myself hoping someone anyone would get on with getting killed just so we could get to the meat of the movie and it is in this very meat where the true disappointment liesthe gore is not excessive it is not disturbing it is not in fact anything above saw or final destination or any of the other crap that fans were basically promised it was going to above it is nothing close to the levels of intense ineedtolookawaybutcanttakemy eyesoffit asianstyle violence that promised it would be everything you read that says the camera doesnt pull away is basically referring to one scene that caused me to laugh out loud which admittedly is probably what eli would want me to do at its overthe topness but one thirtysecond sequence and a few quick throat slits doesnt make up for the hour and twenty minutes of boring crap i suppose that to a crop of horror fans who think something like final destination 2 is toally messedup man than yeah this movie might be considered edgy but to a fan of real horror basically to someone eli was making this movie for is a just a letdown,cruel
2005starring jay hernandez as paxton derek richardson as josh eythor gudjonsson as oli jan vlasak as the dutch businessmanplot three backpackers are making their way through europe partaking in the sex and drugs in countries like amsterdam they are soon told of a slovakian city where they can pay for anything they want from the girls they soon become victims of a group called elite hunting in which innocent people are captured and then tortured and killed by paying customers is an interesting movie it is directed by eli roth the guy who made cabin fevera movie i loved this movie had a lot of pressure to deliver i thought they went and attached quentin tarantinos name to it as a producer talked up how shocking it was and made it seem like horrors second coming so naturally it had to deliver or would be considered a huge disappointment correct well im happy to report that despite being overhyped does come through and bring the goods in disturbing fashionthis movie lives up to its exploitation image that the trailers were trying to portray i thought theres lots of partying in the beginning which equals lots of drug use and nudity in general this lets your guard down for what happens later the whole thing had a sense of dread throughout especially in the beginning when the characters are having so much fun and you know that something bad is going to happen to them then when the horror finally hits we are treated to lots and lots of gore severed heads slashes with scalpels nasty cuts severed fingers cut up bodies sick hammer shots in which we see a skull cave in chainsaw action severed leg gunshots people run over lots of vomiting and more i havent even gone into the eyeball scene which was just so gross it was unbelievable this got an rcut i find it odd how people complained about lack of gore when there was just enough in the right amounts here so in terms of brutality it certainly lives up to how it was played up none of the torture would mean a damn thing if we didnt care about who it was happening to jay hernandez leads the pack with a good performance as paxton he looks genuinely terrified as opposed to acting like it and his character even has some decent back story which plays into the decisions he makes derek richardson did good as josh and i liked his character eythor gudjonsson played oli well and he was pretty funny how could you not love the king of the swing jan vlasak was kind of creepy as the dutch businessman but that was how he was supposed to be so good job the girls in this movie were hot and thats pretty much all they were in there for this movie has some flaws however some of the comedy felt forced that was part of roths problem in cabin fever trying to inject comedy in certain situations where it just didnt work and in the beginning we are treated to lots of partying then more partying and more and more and more i get the fact they wanted to show that these guys are out to party but you know it just seemed a tad bit repetitive i wanted to get to what was advertised also id have to say that parts of the movie were a little predictable and the ending was anticlimatic also what was up with the kids i really did not like having them in the movie as this little juvenile gang even if i did get where they were going with it it felt pointlessother than some hiccups here and there does its job well it shocks and scares the audience and while it may have been overhyped it still lived up to most expectations i had for it plus in addition to being shocking this movie actually was pretty scary as it sure made me never want to go backpacking in europeever and the audience i was with was definitely jumping when they needed to and cringing in their seats during the torture scenes i definitely recommend seeing itrating 12 out of ,cruel
when i heard about i was really intrigued it looked like a really good premise for a thriller my curiosity was titillated even more with the quentin tarantino presents tagged above the title after i saw it i can not describe how disappointed i wasfirst of all eli roth seems to be a pretty good director the way he handles certain scenes of this film were great i will also say that he can come up with some good ideas for movies yes even cabin fever seemed like a good idea s weakness is the way it was written it seemed to follow the exact same formula as cabin fever only to a bit more of an extreme ie more sex more gore the whole first act of the movie is basically porn thats it roth as a writer obviously feels that making flat and some times unnecessary characters is a good idea even the story was nonexistent its just as the summary says it isbut i will say i gave this movie some points for the third act the payoff towards the end of the film worked excellently it worked so well that people in the audience were cheering and clapping for the character that is what made it better than the droll cabin feverbetter than cabin fever but still not able to be called a legitimately good movie i give it a 4 out of 10,cruel
this was definitely a horrorthriller flick but superficial critics may not get the societal undertones there is a lot of nudity and gore that will appeal to younger audiences but this is just the coating peel that back and you get a small peek at what people with money and political power do with that money and power this is specifically shown when one of the victims has a conversation with one of the torturers now in reality the rich may not actually pay to dismember unfortunate victims but the torture definitely mimic ks the deity like power that people with money often think they have over others in other words i have money and poweryou do nottherefore you are less than human and i can do whatever i like to you whether it be cut off your toes or take your property to build a mall i assure you that kind of power may not be real but money makes many perverse people think that it is and they will take advantage of unwitting less than rich people than themselves dont let it be you,cruel
i dont think some people realized this a dark dark comedy in a lot of ways i saw tonight and really enjoyed it i love seeing people getting up and exiting the movie theatre after systematically throwing down 875 to see it eli roth is a very interesting director let me tell ya cabin fever was hated by a lot of people because of the humor put in place of scenes that should have been exciting and terrifying while this turns a lot of people off to his style it gravitates me towards it and thats what he did with the humor is a little more straight forward and is brilliantly done if you cant notice the sheer comedy of this flick then dont bother to review it because you are to stupid for me to care how you criticize it roth intently mixes dark humor and vicious spine tingling torture in a nice soup though not really a horror movie like advertised it is a on the edge thriller without a doubt also make no mistake that this movie is incredibly brutal and shocking my advice is bring little billy to this movie and let him get used to this kind of hollywood because by the time hes 18 he wont even cringe at this sort of thingjust like i didnt i loved the torture and it kept me glued to the screen to the last horrifying scene this movie is one guilty pleasure any gore lover shouldnt miss if you are a fan of dark comedies you might wanna check this one out to if you arent squeamish 710 baby,cruel
and told my wife that will likely be the last horror flick i watch for a while i want to wash offgood points it is a well made film and is especially successful at putting the viewer in the victims place not that pushing the envelope is always a good thing but if you think seeing on film what might be in your darkest fantasies then its a good thing it took balls to go where this flick goesbad points i dont know about the uncut version but cutting 20 or 30 minutes out of the first half of the film would make it better unless you need a lot of ta to warm you up to the gore it felt like 2 movies  the first half taand the second half what you see on the previews maybe it was an expectation thing for me but the way it was hyped i figured to see the camera stay on some scenes just a little too long  which would have fit the premise of better but maybe it was designed that way and it wound up on the editing room floor it would be interesting to see the uncut versioni gave it a 6 mostly because it took to long to get to the payoff but if thats the audition tradition then what do i know,cruel
in the grand tradition of horror films everyone knows that its what you dont see that is scariest in that sentiment eli roth failed miserably watching someone get their foot cut apart is not scary it is just gross its the knowledge that your foot may be cut off that is truly terrifying some of the films scariest scenes come from the anticipating of pain i wasnt ever truly scared at times yes i was upset and nauseated and even found myself rolling my eyes when a certain female character gets a certain appendage amputated by our lead the introduction of jay hernandez to his torturer is one of the only truly horrifying scenes in that for the first five minutes nothing happens but we are on the edge of our seats waiting blood screaming torture death and an overabundance of female nudity this film is nothing short of a snuff film with a big budget with only about 1015 minutes of good movie  6 of which are the credits,cruel
to begin with i just saw the cut version of the movie so perhaps the uncut version was much betteri am most disappointed with the first 3045 minutes of the film this is where eli lost his way from cabin fever the time was wasted mostly on t and a and partying scenes in most effective movies of this genre and i feel three things were missing in this movie in the beginningfirst is something to jump start the movie such as the gunfight in the devils rejects or the opening murder in halloweenthe second is character compassion what i mean by this is the characters are well developed and a personal or intimate moment is revealed to the viewer this in turn draws the viewer in more to the characters pain when something unfortunate happens to them kind of like in the first saw i could care less thanks to the princess bride idiot despite whatever was happening to him so despite these guys getting tortured it was not that effectivefinally are certain hints or elements that bind the movie together as they go along other than the kids who kill for candy given the only one i picked up on was this which began half way through the movie question for you all would have the one surviving character still have gone back to save the asian girl if he had not witnessed a girl drowning in his youth the movie needed more of those character traits but the whole guy on the train thing i figured him to be a torturer right off the bat they were showing way too much of him to not be involvedthe nonlethal euthanasia involving the girls eye was a nice touchas far as the second half is concerned it wasnt that bad it had the whole last house on the left feel where an unlikely killer returns the favor for all those involved in his friends deaths and his tortures as he comes by themall and all i gave it right down the middle because the beginning was almost useless and the end was goodmy advise for those who are into this genre stick with more indy films like elis first one,cruel
i think its my fault for coming into the movie with high expectations really the only thing i actually liked about this movie is the acting the actors truly did an amazing job i think these people should have been in saw instead unfortunately the acting doesnt really matter if the story line is lacking which this movie is definitely missing the whole first half of the movie is about three college students who go around the world to do activities you wouldnt get away with in the united states legally very clichd they are then told about a where the most beautiful women in the world are where not too many foreigners visit they get what they want women then consequently everything goes down the toilet it turns out the foreigners are in for a rude awakening when they get tortured by wannabe surgeons the torture scenes themselves are not as gory as i expected in fact the director doesnt really show us anything the scenes rely heavily on screaming sound effects and a good imagination of what the hell is going on in fact the goriest parts happen outside of the walls of where they are tortured disappoints in the aspects this movie is being marketed for the gruesome scenes the story and the scare factor in which its not scary at all if you dont mind a lackluster story line and go into the movie with low expectations you will find yourself enjoying ,cruel
spoilers ahead for all the hype my friends and the commercials put on this film i left the theater feeling somewhat unfufilled let it be known that is pretty damn graphic but some of the things were so disgusting that i found myself laughing at its extremities instead of being scared i mean theres spoiler people getting ran over limbs getting cut off pussing eyes and lots of vomiting in between i hope i dont sound weird for laughing during all this but seriously the whole theater which was full as hell was laughing along with me another thing that hurt the film is that the first 3040 minutes is like a giant sexfest with very little scareshell basically no scares at all all in all strives on gore and i found that it does little to actually scare its audience try the original texas chainsaw massacre and maybe even saw but all in all i think will only provide an hour and thirty someodd minutes of oohing and ouching,cruel
sets the new standard for horror movies it has gore violence and makes you close your eyes when i saw the movie i was not disappointed i thought this movie was good it will make some money from the box office but will it go to the oscars or even golden globes  i say no because if a horror movie goes to the oscars thats super rare here is the list of movies that have gone to the oscars seven silence of the lambs which was the most successful horror movie of all time jawsexorsit which was the first horror movie to be nominated for an oscar for best picture and last but not least pschyco there is probably more but what i am saying is that a movie about torturing people for 90 min does not go to the oscars but is one the best horror movies of 2006 and is very entertaining,cruel
23 of this movie was more about nudity beautiful naked women and sex more than a horror flick the rest was a terrible movie the audience laughed and clapped more than they gasped or groaned and the most exciting part was when two people in the theater started yelling obscenities at each other and almost got into a fight during the first screenings there are only 2 explanations as to why ambulances came a the movie company paid them to show up to create a buzz or b someone choked on a jujyfruit while the movie isnt that good the aftertaste it leaves is at least like a horror flick leaving you a bit paranoid about those around you and a bit scared aftertaste good taste disgusting,cruel
ok people this is not everything that i expected lookim a gore hound and this was not up to par this is your typical fade to black because the audience cant handle actually seeing anything happen movie this is not say that i dont appreciate leaving some things to the imagination  the ear cutting scene in reservoir dogs was genius however if you advertise a movie as being gory then by all means  let it be gory this was a good movie id give it a 7 out of 10 however i find it really difficult to believe all that ive heard ambulances having to come to the theaters people puking and afraid to go home come on this is also not to say that i want gore just for gore sake im just sick of fade to black sorry but to me seeing pruners around the toe without seeing it get cut off is like sex with no orgasm not worth the time and effort seen the trailer then youve seen all you need to see if youre gore hound want to see some soft core porn then a little gore head to the theaters you wont be displeased,cruel
decent enough story but handled with great immaturity and stupidity granted eli roth wrote it and secured financing for it so in fairness he should be able to make any movie he desired however someone should of stepped in and suggested filling in the many plot holes and logic lapses so that it actually felt like a real movie and didnt seem quite so convenient all the way through also they could of removed a couple of the unnecessary tit shots and sauna scenes so it didnt so closely resemble a porkys or carry on film and felt more like a horror film dont get me wrong as a 26 year old guy i liked the first few but after the tenth he did come off as a horny 14 year old with licence to see breasts is he actually still a virgin geezeto sum it up nice idea badly handled by a immature filmmaker lacking talent which i could of expected coming from the writerdirector of cabin fever had it not been for the endorsement by quentin tarantino which suggested a film of much better quality come on quentin i know hes your buddy and kindred spirit but you cant just put your name on any old crap,cruel
sigh 2005 had to be one of the worst years for movies ever in my existence we had nothing but either remakes or stupid flicks with no originality however starting to 2006 in the theaters with isnt so bad i understand people not liking the film because its not typical in some ways but i think this has in its own little way of being a cult classic one day just like texas chainsaw massacrethis had a true feeling of ultimate terror and my heart just lept several times out of my chest i mean i just was like gnah during the torture sequences that were extremely painful to watch and you just kept on hoping the best for jays character and that someone would get their up comings for torturing innocent people this was in no way meant for the family its extremely gruesome and terrifying but to horror fans i felt like this was a treat because it had such a real feelingthe acting is above average over all i mean its just three boys trying to get laid in europe and happen to get mixed up with the wrong people but like i said its just a fun little gore movie for fans of horror so id recommend if you are in the mood for a gore fest and an excellent scare this movie will have me up for a few nights 810,cruel
this movie consists of forty five minutes of obnoxious sex and frequent breast shots there are breasts in the movie almost every shot for the first half then suddenly it switches over to demon children beating people up and disturbed people cutting people up the movie will make you want to throw up the disturbing images are enough to make you puke but the fact that there is no storyline to this movie makes it insulting its obvious that its supposed to invoke extreme fear and revulsion but it only achieves the revulsion its not scary its disgusting the ending is completely coincidental i wanted to walk out of the theater within twenty minutes dont see this movie rent saw instead,cruel
a large group of my friends and i went to see this movie midnight opening day  the theater was pretty much sold out and everyone was very excited  and very let down this movie is nothing hard core the story is weak the acting is weak and above all the gore is insanely weak if you wanna see a decent horror film stay away from the movie theater im a giant fan of takishi mike quentin i even liked cabin fever  this movie doesnt live up to any of that its stupid as hell and i highly recommend you avoid seeing it and avoid the hype as well anyone who would call this movie hardcore is a pussy this movie sucked balls,cruel
so apparently filmmaker eli roth had premiered his debut film cabin fever in 2002 at the toronto film festival three years later even when his sophomore film still had technical tweakings to be worked out he felt obligated to the toronto film fest audiences to come on back and come back he did his new film entitled is just as gruesome if not creepier than his latter it concerns a couple american tourists josh derek richardson who until now has been written off for his mistake in acting in the dumb and dumber prequel and paxton jay hernandez who have been backpacking in europe with fellow icelandic backpacker oli for the last few weeks when they arrive in amsterdam they are told by a kid named alex that there is a town in slovakia where the women outpopulate the men 51 due to the civil unrest of past war and that every woman there loves tourists especially americans the three find all of this to be true when they travel to the small town and meet their sexy limber roomies who somewhat resemble skyy vodka models when oli disappears after the first night they spend in their new the boys eventually shrug it off and continue partying but it slowly becomes apparent that there is something very wrong going on very very wrong like a 15 on a 110 scale of wrongness bottom line if your a horror fan even if youve just began to get into horror this cabin fever as well is a must see some parts make you laugh other parts make you feel for the characters and a lot of parts make you grit your teeth and clap in satisfaction afterwards  all the elements of a great horror film eli roth knows what a horror film needs to be and he shows it in his work and if he continues his work like he does hell be around for long time,cruel
two american pals named josh derek richardson and paxton jay herandez are traveling around europe for sex and fun they meet an icelandic man named oli eythor gudjonsson during their trip in amesterdam as they head to a slovokian city where they stay at a local and get laid with beautiful girls however their ideal vacation turns into a vicious nightmare of ruthless terror as they are taken to a special place where they find themselves in a hellish place where criminals torture and kill their victims for profit but can one of them escape the wraith entertaining and violent horror crime thriller from writerdirector eli roth and producer quentin tarantino its quite flawed such as the acting but you can overlook that stuff and there are some gruesome moments like the icky eyeball sequence done to a japanese tourist the film pays as a tribute to the torture films of the 70s and 80s such as bloodsucking freaks mark of the devil the new york ripper men behind the sun etc and has plenty of sleazy atmosphere with nudity and torture sequences even though it may not live up to its big hype as disturbing i still say its a fun horror ride for anyone who likes violent filmsthe sequel is even better,cruel
im slovak and i expected much more from this movie like poor scenes with no deep idea but whats worse it caused a bad reputation to slovakia and who will them say a sorry like to the icelandss president i mean its totally ridiculous the cars used in film are from the communistic times and are not used for long time and they put slovak girls into a poor position to do everything for money what is a nonsense the telly in the is an old one from maybe the fifties or sixties what else oh yeah when the guys came to the slovak countryside it was a czech village and the person who was telling the passengers where they are in the speakers when they got off was using czech language the whole film was made in czech republic and its said in slovakia what doesnt mean czech looks like that the only slovak were those two girls using a few sentences in slovak and the big blokes getting out of the car in front of the bubble gum gang i heard them to use a bit of russian as well so its really confusing and really bad yeah and the songs used on the discos were not pop songs but slovak rock rock at disco ok maybe for an american it never minds because must open a map first a search where slovakia is and still it will give no idea how its there like,cruel
i love horror films and though obviously im going to put films like the devils backbone and the original haunting at the top of my list films with some character and meaningful plotting and subtlety im not above enjoying a bit of mindless gore either what stephen king called the grossoutbut this film left me feeling dirty its just plain nasty two thirds the way through theres a scene  spoiler coming up  where the hero rescues a woman whos being tortured with a blowtorch her eye is hanging down her cheek and our hero has to snip it off with a pair of scissors i put the dvd on pause and went to make a cup of coffee to recover no i thought thats not clever thats just taking the p the strangest thing about all this is the involvement of as producer quentin tarantino and as actor and mentor takashi miike those two between them have directed two of the most memorably nasty scenes in cinema history  the torture scenes in reservoir dogs and audition respectively its worth pausing a moment to consider why those scenes are great because they are everything this film is not in reservoir dogs the worst thing never actually happens slicing off an ear is bad enough but its not the most terrible thing and all it does is establish that the psychopathic torturer is capable of anything everything after that is all in the audiences imagination its all in the thinking of what might happen the torture in audition is even more explicit of course shockingly so and first bad things happen then even worse ones but its timed perfectly and it has a real moral purpose the hero has done wrong theres no doubt about it but surely we ask ourselves not so as to deserve thisno such intelligence or artistry or simple technical skill informs anything in this film not at all theres nothing in the script or characterisation to make us care about these people in any way and though the director makes a sort of halfhearted attempt to build up some tension and creepiness he just abandons the effort after about half an hour as though saying right thats enough nonsense for an intro now lets get on with the tortureso incompetently is this done that were presented with our first glimpses of the torture chamber from the point of view of the victim looking through a hole in the hood over their face any possibility that we might feel some empathetic fear here is rather spoiled by the fact that we dont actually know whose eyes were looking through we can make a good guess and it turns out that probably our first guess is the right one though it could have been one of several people but this isnt clever or skillful its just lazy and incompetentthe worst of it all though is that these arent bumbling but enthusiastic amateurs theyre smart experienced filmmakers if they were amateurs you might award them some credit for breaking out of the usual dismal remaking my favourite scenes from the evil deadblair witch mode but these people are clever and dont they just know itthis is what is finally hard to take the sense of being patronised by these fools who hold our intelligence in such disrespect that they think all they have to do is gross us out and well be amazedheres an odd little trivial detail which i dont think anyones noticed having arrived at the and having fallen prey to the siren seductresses who lurk there our two heroes enjoy a sexual encounter with them not so much softcore as parental guidance this is accompanied by some exotic music the first few bars i was going to say snatch but that somehow didnt seem appropriate of which are a quote too accurate not to be deliberate from britt eklunds dance in the wicker manyeah clever but not clever enough dont patronise me first make a decent film then you can set about dazzling me with your witty allusive references and homagesoh and im not surprised there are protests here from slovakians ive never been there though its one of many places in eastern europe and the balkans id love to see one of the better musical choices in the soundtrack was a little hint of smetana as we look over the river running through the city but even without knowing the country i can tell this is just a crass insult almost racist in its generalised offensiveness and sublimely adolescent dismissal of the morals intelligence and integrity of an entire nationim being harsh i think eli roth could make a good film but first he has to face up to what a bad one hes made here,cruel
id definitely rather clean the cat box than watch this again and id like 12 of my rental fee back because i had to fast forward through about that much of the filmif this had been made in black and white by a film noir director without all the so very red gore it would have made a crackerjack 1 12 hour film the setup is very clever and so is the end the problem with this film is that it lingers so lovingly on all the humanonhuman violence that it loses its plot and its atmospherethis is not just a female reactionmy male partner was so horrified bored and disgusted that he was angry with me for insisting on fastforwarding to the endnot my definition of a horror movie and definitely not escapism more like living a cat box horror movie and being forced to watch really gross stuff one feels that ones mind has been violated somehow by a good plot and its perfectly unnecessarily gory execution,cruel
let me start this by saying i love trashy films i love those cheap b movie horror gorefest films that take a certain mindset to appreciate i have that mindset no question i also enjoy a good movie too a well written thought provoking storyline with well developed characters and maybe something to leave you pondering even after it is over this movie fits into neither category in fact if pushed i wouldnt know what category to put this into except for to say it is complete rubbish if you are reading this in the hope for some kind of help in making the decision whether or not to watch or gaspbuy this film then i am really glad to help do not bother for you will regret it on the other hand if you like watching breasts and dont even require that they even partially fit into the storyline then go on punish yourself with this nonsense the storyline what storyline the horror rating haha not even so bad its good not funny and not scary the gore even more pathetic than the storyline i hate the way this film took minutes from me i want them refunded,cruel
ever since i began to watch the movie ive had this strange feeling about the movie the most weird thing about the movie was that you couldnt see anything up to after the second half of the movie at first it even reminded me of euro trip however suddenly you could see a scene where one of the main characters ends up in a torture chamber reason who knows i dont for sure my overall opinion is this movie sucks it lacks any kind of conception a true story violence without even a little reason a kind of art or what they did say in the movie im really sorry that the czechs gave their actors their resources and even one of their villages to the film the whole movie represents them as a wholeheartedly corrupt and deceived nation which allows anything to happen in their country and which has murderous children wandering on the streets who kill even in exchange for a bag of chewing gums one more thing which i dont understand is that how did they end up in a village in bohemia czech republic when they were heading to bratislava which is in slovakia,cruel
this movie is sick i am a huge movie fan and there was a couple of scenes i had to look away at a little slow to start but it really picks up and its worth the wait this is a must see for horror fans if your squeamish i would pass on this one the special effects were way off the chart best i have ever seen thus far the main characters are lovable and the villains are in the most part very believable you can get lost in this movie and its like a roller coaster you go up that long ladder seems like its inching then bam your over and trying to catch your breath wondering what just happened i will see this movie again it was worth the money spent,cruel
first off this film really shows just how low our society has gone really the fact that we see torture and blood as entertainment it really makes me think of the romans and id like to think that we have grown past them you know i have watched many of horror movies and thrillers and i have to say that this film is by far the worst thing that i have ever seen the texas chainsaw film was tolerable only because it was based however loosely to actual events yet was just an excuse to show boundary pushing blood shed how long till we go back and resort to real killing an other thing tarantino if you ever read this you are no better than the main killer you put this film on the market you ever thought to create it and you know what the worst part is that i know and you know that out there someone loved seeing this blood fest and i know that someone is making one worse how in the world could ever see this as a good thing how can anyone ever make it and not be over come with gilt its far beyond me and you know even if it does happen or the events are based on real events do they have to become entertainment the thing that degrades those involved and makes it seem ok to do such events o and you know that this film is going to cause people to copy it and this time it wont be fake blood well thats what i have to say take it to heart all who read this and help me do something about these perversions thanks,cruel
let me preempt this by saying that i was in no hurry to see this movie i hated roths previous flick cabin fever  unlikable characters poor script and not much horror i decided to watch really only because there was nothing else i wanted to see at the theater plus some of the hype probably got to me as wellthat being said i think the hype and marketing they created is somewhat of a downfall to the reviews i have read here this movie does not do well to the general public people disgusted walking out of the theater too much nudity too much gore well really what were they expecting i believe if this had been shown in a smaller number of theaters with little or no publicity it would be an underground hit garnishing more good reviews by the horror fan basemajor spoilersanyway i thought that id add my two cents worth as other reviews have testimented this really is a movie of two halves the first being a eurotrip kinda sex n drugs road trip introducing the characters and the foreign soil the second is a frightening glimpse of sadism and retribution however really it should be seen as having three partsthe last being a revenge pieceso the first part bring the audience 3 happygolucky guys 2 american and 1 icelandic traveling in europe in the search of girls to hump and dump this section has a few laughs and lots of nudity one thing is that roth seems to be looking for a realistic feel to this movie but all the girls naked most of the time are super hot model types i guess this is pandering to the target audience also see cabin fever but doesnt exactly help the realism lets move on to the real meat and bones of the moviethe guys do not realize that they have fallen into a honey trap and the girls that they meet in the titular are selling them into torture and death a lot has been said of the torture scenes  i personally didnt find them shocking but they were effective what is really scary is that im sure this does go on in places in the world and the movies premise is feasible our villains of the piece are frightening as they appear so ordinary they do not have super powers return to life after being killed or any of the other horror clichs they range from the creep on the train to the local police and the feeling of helplessness of being somewhere where nobody will come to your aid is palpableonce the torture is out of the way it changes to a revenge flick where the protagonist gets back at the people who hurt him and killed his friends let me first tell you some of the issues i had with this flick  we do not see what happened to the king of swing  just that he was dead  a missed opportunity i think too long of a build up  the first section could have been trimmed without losing any building of the characters the pack of kids seemed like an afterthought and didnt really fit in too many coincidences when the lead is getting his revenge  the american guy torturing the asian girl is the one he met having the 2 girls and the guy they met in amsterdam standing in front of his car and finally meeting the guy on the train againend of spoilersoverall i think this is a massive step up for roth and i may actually be excited to see his next movie his writing and directing have both improved this movie is not really that shocking to anyone who has an affinity to horrors but it does have a lasting effect its one of those movies that gets better the more you think of it after you have seen the moviei also want to reply to some of the comments i have read about this swing towards torture scenes in movies and how terrible it is there have been torture scenes in many many movies throughout the years its nothing new  for example off the top of my head mainstream movies such as pulp fiction rambo the passion of the christ which has much more brutal and more detailed scenes payback casino goodfellas the marathon man brazil robocop scarface to name but a few and none of those are classed as horror movies,cruel
i have been waiting to see this film for quite awhile now and ill tell ya im happy with the result the first half of the flick plays out like a hardcore eurotrip complete with drugs and lots and lots of breasts some say its like a softcore porn film in the beginning yes there is lots of sex but thats what these three guys are here for sex and drugs i thought it helped add some character development even if ya dont like the guys they are pretty disrespectful towards females once the sun comes out and the parties are over and done the torture begins and now i will say this this film is not nearly as violent as some have led you to believe dont get me wrong it is still extremely violent and often quite brutal but some made it out to be vomit enducing and while its wrapped in a different package youve probably seen most of this gory violence before i wouldnt even really count this as a horror flick id call it a thriller the last 30 or so minutes are awesome and the ending is one of best and most satisfying endings ive ever seen i highly recommend you check it out and make your own choice about whether or not its stupid or not cuz we all have different tastes so give it shot only if ya can handle some heavy violence,cruel
as i walked from the theater with a smile on my face i overheard a quentin tarantino fanboy exclaim to his friend i dont see why tarantino put his name on this film if youre going to see a film based on the producers then you probably have no grasp of film anyway which would explain this fans confusion this film is far more straight forward than roths first offering cabin fever which at times became silly though i must admit i enjoyed it quite a bit this film like cabin fever sets its story up to allow for maximum bloodshed and black humor oh and lots of boobs too if you can allow yourself to settle in for entertainment of that nature and dont demand that every scene be a metaphor of some type you will probably enjoy this film it takes quit a while to build steam in spite of that its never boring or lagging i applaud roth for not rushing things in our age of short attention spans once it picks up steam it becomes a real treat i found myself delighted by the frantic pace of the last 20 minutes or so roth did a very good job of keeping the audience guessing the fate of each character and really rewards the audience in the end a very nice effort 810,cruel
is similar to the overrated saw movies in the sense that it is not afraid to show excessive gore or mutilation while saw prides itself on the violence prides itself on the characters ive read many reviews of who hold it to the same level as movies like saw calling it typical clunky or nothing newis nothing like saw is a wellmade film about the terror of being in an unfamiliar place pair this with the typical american mentality and we see our asshole american backpackers travel deeper and deeper into a nightmare that they wont be able to escapei am a huge horror fan whether it be old american horror or modern japanese horror i love horror films i heard so much about this movie how great it was how original is was how good the acting is everything and its all true the only thing i found to be untrue was the amount of gore if anyone thinks this is the goriest movie ever made they got some renting to do this movie does feature some brilliant effects and scenes of violence but its not as brutal as i had hopedif youre a hollywood horror fan looking for a date night scare youll come out disappointed as this movie builds up its characters before letting anything remotely dangerous happen to them but if youre a horror fan looking for something more along the lines of the devils rejects then may just be the flick for you,cruel
ok so ive heard good things about this movie since production i even like eli roth but holy crap i did not expect the stuff i saw frist thing i though was this is just a foreign version of saw but after watching the movie i was likeis this eurotrip but i was corrected nothing but tna during the first portion of the film did i cry about it though not at all as an 18 year old youth of society i love tna in horror movies its kinda like finding 20 bucks on the street nice and no complaints but then the proverbial crap hit the fan and you realize that the tna was nothing but a look into the utopia of young american men today you see this movie shows you two things everything want and everything you dont want in life and yes this movie is not for the squeamish that means if jumped in saw or texas chainsaw massacre go watch the chronicles of narnia out of 5 stars i give this movie a 37 and a half i give it a half because of japanese chicksooooo i love me some japanese chicks so do the world a favor and stop reading this go now and watch or the chronicles of narnia or whatever floats your boat stop readinggogo nowtool,cruel
eli roth can be commended for attempting to do something other filmmakers have left only half done he has attempted to put on film the actual relentless and somewhat realistic image of torture and pain the film achieves a cold level of intensity it makes its audience feel isolated and successfully prevents anyone from looking at the film with any humor its true and dry terror but it does not last for longonly so many bodies can pile up only so many human beings can be subjected to sadistic torture before the audience gets tired thats right tired after the first 40 minutes or so you will desire to leave the theater not because you cant handle it anymore but because youve already handled too muchroth tried something he tried a film without humor or cutaways it didnt work hitchcocks old rule remains the same im afraid when it comes to horror its not what you see its what you dont see roth would do well to remember it,cruel
toronto film festival cut mr blacks grade b starring jay hernandezis a work in progress and some effects werent finished and there was a temp soundtrack in use this midnight madness screening was in a small theatre because the studio was only able to supply an hdcam version of the film well acted spooky funny and a very nontraditional hollywood horror film what more could fans want lets just hope they get as much as possible into the theatrein a year with  for the most  pretty crappy horror films certainly does stand out this is not your traditional hollywood horror film for there is a very different flow than your standard pg13 rated thriller director eli roth admitted owing a debt of gratitude to filmmakers like takashi miike and chanwook park thats ok  roth throws a very uncommon spin on things this film is very effectivebe forewarned this film is very very violent what we saw on this day was likely the directors dream cut roth said the film was going before the mpaa the very next day he was not sure what would happen but stressed that the films producers knew what they had and would likely try and buck the current trend of pg13 rated horror films,cruel
i had read a lot about this film going in and i had very high expectations eli roth did a fantastic job the movie is simply amazing in the tradition of 70s80s european gore and his own comedichorror style eli is able to create a world in which the viewer is disgusted but completely satisfied and in love with all aspects of the filmdrugs sex and blood no one in the screening was complainingit is evident that as a scriptwriter eli has evolved since his last film from pancakes to bubblegum i wont spoil anything or clarify what this means is a far more intricate funny scary and suspenseful film than cabin fevereli roth cares about his fans and the horror genre it looks as though hes here to stay and hes staying gold xox,cruel
does not even qualify as a horror movie its just a bunch of disgusting clichs regarding slovakia and central europe a grose americancentrism makes the whole plot it builds a pseudo realistic and pseudo ironical register which excludes any supernatural feature consequently the film suggests that poverty marginalization and corruption in slovakia are the causes of serial murder and horror obviously americans are shown as victims but also as heroes,cruel

this should have close to an x rating gratuitous sex and violence it is like a teen slasher movie with the actors just a few years oldergood thing i didnt pay for this movie i would have asked for my money backwhat actors do for money is ridiculousdisemboweling beheading limbcutting eye gouging body fluids spilling all over what idiot thinks up this stuff did they find a 13 year old to write this after watching the evil dead my friend and i called up other people immediately to tell them to forget this movie it was so bad we had to do it right away after walking out of the theatre,cruel
boring predictable lots is plot mistakes and i cant relate to any of the characters in fact after 15min i am cheering for them to be brutally murdered that is how annoying they arethe movi is disrespectful and offensive to all the countries it portraits and to the usais it possible that the writers mistaken slovakia whith slovenia and nobody bothered to correct them,cruel
this is actually a very decent horror film the characters are paper thin but its the situation they are put into thats interesting hostile being etymologically related to its the meeting strangers abroad in the form of hot girls and the lack of compassion concern and basic humanity in them where the real horror lies in this film desirable on the surfacerepellant on the insidethe concept of big business being behind the spate of missing people is also a really interesting idea although it lacks common sense that theyd pick middle class travellers as too many people might start asking questions homeless people would be the better choice for obvious reasons not exactly a great advertisement for eastern europe but great entertainment nonetheless,cruel
good movie if youre into intense gore and nail biting scenes however there are a lot of shake your head why would you do that moments,cruel
rule 1 of horror the audience must connect with the main characters must like them andor relate to them and must feel like theyre real people thats what makes good horror so horrific if you like people and can imagine yourself in their shoes and want them to be well the events of the movie are terrifying on the other hand if the main characters are twodimensional badlywritten annoying actors you dont care what happens to them or worse you start hoping they die just so theyre not in the movie any morebreaks this rule the characters are stereotypical american college men saying stereotypical college dialog five minutes in and already i want these annoying twats executed i would keep watching for the satisfaction of seeing badly written characters tortured but i have better things to do with my time,cruel
everyone else has already mentioned the drawn out intro the lack of character development the bland characters and the senseless plot i will not continue to harp on those points what really took me out of this movie within its meatier bits are the stupid antics of the survivor movies are no stranger to the idea of someone surviving massive blood loss but most make some attempt to couch this in reality unless its the villain and normally i wouldnt much care this movie shoves it in your facehe has his hand sliced open with a chainsaw not to mention the other wounds and at no point does he bandage or cauterize or even disinfect the wound in some way the entire time i was waiting for him to at least get dizzy from it but he runs around the rest of the film completely fine he winces when he puts on gloves but thats about it and he cant even curl his missing fingers into the palm in later sceneshe miraculously makes it to a car undetected but then runs back to save kana only to cut off her detached eye a going back in was a ridiculous decision and it makes no sense that they got out again just as easily b a doctor could have saved the eye as long as the optic nerve wasnt severed you idiot but its fine because they somehow miraculously run over the scouters only to ditch the car instead of having a car chase like hmm maybe a hospital or a police precinct in another town would be a good idea at least when you hit germany i mean sepsis anyone but no revengeeven though her injuries arent that bad kana kills herself and yet the train keeps running even if the city was completely lawless police wouldve stopped the train at least long enough to identify the body i mean someones got to clean it up cant be driving a bloody train over country linesthis film asks you to suspend your disbelief over and over throughout and while i normally have a large tolerance for that but this is ridiculous not in an overthetop fun thrill ride sort of way but in a nagging you are watching a terrible fake movie sort of way the more i think about it the lower the rating gets,cruel
the initial setting of this film left me outraged slovakia as a place of beautiful and sexually available girls because of deficit men seriously what war they have cellphones so the world war 2 was ages ago and while the slovak czechpolishukraine women seem better looking than lets say british ones its only because they are normal thats the golden rule  the closer you are to being average and balanced the better you look and normal women tend to have normal lives high school boyfriends universitypolytechnic marriage two children career grandchildren retirement im not from slovakia myself but i have a lot of friends and colleagues from there and i always liked that country as a matter of fact we were one nation not so long ago dont tell me that its just a fiction how would americans like it if we made such a stupid untrue and slandering film about their own countryhowever as the plot progressed ive realized that the film isnt about slovakia and slovaks the whole scam is ran by an international gang ran by russians which is entirely plausible so is the police which is easily bribed and more likely to believe a word of a local over that of an american sextourist from that point on the slovakia and its inhabitants became more of a background as a matter of fact they never had any kind of a prominent role in the story the film made quite well around the world but trust me its considered highly controversial in our countries cz and sk,cruel
i am able to enjoy violent and even gory movies as much as the next guy but this was the only movie that absolutely repulsed me deeply it seems to be nothing but a portrayal of some of the fantasies that severely psychotic people may have on the topic of sheer destruction of life this being a movie and not a documentary it must imagine itself to have entertainment value and while it can be interesting to have a viewer imagine how truly terrible and horrifying it would be to find yourself hunted by sadistic torturing psychopaths this movie also seems to aim to present the whole thing in such a detached clinical way that is to me dare i say it beyond offensive and perplexing,cruel

the premise of all three movies is rather absurd the gore is over the top and at times it seems medically inaccurate they build on the classic slasher film formula and through the use of ball gags and fetish suits become fantastic examples of torture porn if you accept the fact that its all just a story i suppose the film can be thought of as frightening the idea of such a powerful institution created for the sole purpose of catering to the needs of sadists and psychopaths is a spooky one but a series of b rate performances and c rate characters makes the story difficult to sell the movies do nothing new with the horror genre the idea is fantastic though so much so that we have to acknowledge how ridiculous it is a good fright but there are so many better movies in the horror genre if you consider yourself a fan watch these movies when you have plenty of popcorn and nothing to do,cruel
i loathe this movie it is so pretentious and boringat least in cabin fever there was some comedy to balance the silliness of the plot making it slightly more enjoyable there is nothing of that in personally i think that this movie was a major waste of time it neither wasnt thrilling nor interesting the characters were bland and onedimensional personally i think that this was the weakest part of the movie it was very hard to care about the fates of such unlikeable victims but the bad guys werent much better either the plot was dull and boring with lots of tired clichs and annoying stereotypesi dont mind if a movie is too violent if it has a good story sadly this is not the caseis a dispensable film which only serves as a perfect example of all what is wrong with modern horror,cruel
more unoriginal torture porn coming from the small mind of another unoriginal sociopath who fancies himself an artist anyone who finds this film enjoyable in the least amount or entertaining is so lacking in any trace of humanity that they are indeed a sociopath and should probably be put in prison before they act on their impulsesthe film offers nothing worth seeing aside from its morally repugnant story it is very much a derivative and formulaic piece of crap lacking in any cinematic artistic virtues beyond the mere technical skill of the production as a firm advocate of free speech i find it hard to say this but films like this should never be made should never receive funding and should be banned from distribution this studio should be boycotted and be criminally penalized for making this sick crap it is too bad that we do not have laws against this genre like we have against child porn,cruel
by the end i was ashamed that i actually contributed money to this terrible b movie trying to pose as a horror film cabin fever eli roths first movie was a pretty good indie movie but a bit over the top gore for my taste but was a decent starting point for a director considering he took that credit got a bigger budget and used it to make a trite plot less gore porno is just offensive to the intelligence of movie goers this isnt even a movie all it is is a porno for sociopaths its pretty much the movie from the 80s faces of death that was essentially a documentary of what people look like when theyre dead and kids would rent it as like a dare because it was really gross had no plot was just gore and grossness there isnt much to say about it since there is no story its just yawn weve heard it a million times two college guys go to europe do drugs in amsterdam and find out about this awesome place they should go in some screwed up poor part of europe that no one would ever go they show up and of course the girls are always naked and have sex with them surprise everyone is being paid off to bring in young kids so psycho rich guys can torture themthe end seriously thats the plot and the entirety of the story of course once they get all of that story out of the way they just cut up kids in gross and unthinkable ways anyway i have zero respect for anyone who could possibly enjoy this film and eli roth is a sensationalism hack who plays on peoples curiosity to sell tickets im sure his mother is very proud he probably sells babies on the black market too,cruel
all i have to say about this iseli roth please dont make any more movies buy a book and do some reading it will help you and everybody else awful movie awful plot awful characters and most of all awful research skills do not watch and if you do the only people you need to make judgement about are the makers of this film everything else is just american ignorance the film has nothing to do with reality misrepresents not only slovakia but the whole continent of europe and its people it tries to appeal to the brainless goreseekers but it ends up insulting even them this should never have been made for the sake of eli roths reputation of being a human being as it portrays him as an brain celllacking neanderthal on drugs,cruel
i dont want to spend too much of my time or energy on this review because this terrible movie doesnt deserve even the 24 words ive already typed slasher films historically were low budget inconsequential forgettable nonsense that hollywood depended upon to bring in just enough teenage cash to cover their costs and maybe help finance another more creative worthy endeavor but actually aspires to something more it actually has lofty ideals and it sincerely strives to be profound it wants to be taken seriously and thats the sickest most depraved aspect of a film that has no moral or ethical qualms about plunging to the lowest depths of depravity in its quest to shock the most unshockable desensitized deadened generation of film goers ever director eli roth has exquisitely exploited the most modern technological cinematic methods in crafting his damaged deranged frankenstein of a film it barely lives in any human sense it lurches and lumbers like a lobotomized linebacker slowly and deliberately strangling the life out any sentient being in its path by the last half hour i felt so ashamed and so disgusted to be in the same species as the wretched creature that contrived this horrendous mistake its just so deeply sadly desperately sick just like the deeply desperately sick society that would ever consider this mess to be anything else but a complete tragic abortionso maybe is deep and profound in that regard the way it reflects just how hopelessly corrupt is our culture and how its all coming to a horrible grisly end so much faster than anyone cares to imagine the feeling of helpless despair i have for our poor crippled world i also feel for the makers and fans of this poor crippled film,cruel
by the dawn of the 21st century there had been a number of very low budgeted films saw cube to name but two who were despite all shortcomings able to breathe some fresh wind into the stagnant genre of splatterhorror was one of those films but considering that both saw and cube had their moments of brilliance i could not for the life of me say what the hype was all about the story of american students travelling europe  oblivious that europe isnt a country and that there are differences between bratislava amsterdam and paris  in search for the ultimate joyride is wellworn in our protagonists fall in with a ring of gangsters running what can best be described as a snuffclub where rich patrons pay heft amounts to live out their murderous fantasies sure has its moments mainly those concerning themselves with realistically simulated tortures and killings but thats all got running for it im not going to talk about uncharismatic lead actors lack of artistic talents or the pretentious style of directing i want to talk about bloopers see im not a very bright viewer and am virtually blind to things like errors bloopers and inconsistencies no i never noticed that charlton heston was wearing his wrist watch in ben hur im completely oblivious and i dont even care  until it comes to the issue of the film is riddled with errors to such an extent that after about 40 minutes i asked myself say dude is this a joke yes partly it was i remember director roth explain that the constantly changing makeup of the japanese girl in virtually every shot was intended because he wanted to do something to the audience  not sure what the purpose was because eventually my brain turned off to the rambling having too often heard shoddy workmanship disguised as artistic innovation so how did this cgrade production ever become cult or hyped in the first place well it would probably never have seen the cinematic light of day if it hadnt come with the oversized headline screaming presented by quentin tarantino and to tarantino fans it seems to be all gold that shines or rather has the moniker presented by quentin tarantinoid give it 2 points from 10 for a couple of the gore effects but thats where the sympathy stops,cruel
 and not in a good way could anything every be with that headline this movie is like they have taken all clichs from all bad american horror movies and put it in one single super bad movie the acting is bad the directing is crap the dialogs are braindead and the entire story is like  i mean come on is that the way americans really are or is it just bad propaganda rich cool brat kids going to europe which they consider as their own personal play ground with braindead horny european chicks and cheap drugs and alcohol come on usa is that all we are to you and from time to time they put in a line like thats the way things work in europe like a bad attempt to show a bit of understanding of how things work in europe fail and all european guys over fifty are of course murderous psychopaths i felt a bit generous and gave the movie 210 the special effects are okay too bad everything else failedand yeah before i forget  did i tell you the movie sucked,cruel

but it was darn close where as saw had a ridiculous contrived and terribly flawed plot has nearly no plot at all the story is weak the writing is weak the characters are weak and the idea itself isnt that interesting to stand on its own feetfirst off i do understand that eli roth tried to do something a little layered by setting the whole first half of the film in what seems to be the complete opposite of a horror film and trying to establish parallels between the two halves problem is the first part is so shallow so forced and so dumbly crafted that the only thing it produces is boredom and annoyance the characters remain perfectly flat and bidimensional all the way through so pretty much all of the desired effect is gone out of the windowsecond the proper horror half of the film is nothing new really folks this one came after saw theres no ground being broken here with the torture and the graphic violence at least it doesnt even pretend to say anything deep or thoughtful so no worries in that department but the whole thing just comes across as ridiculous and satisfying if the intention was to keep away from torture porn the film actually handles it quite well for a while but then we get a completely idiotic long shot of the main character cutting out a girls gouged out eyeball its like the film gave up all hopes of being gripping and disturbing and went straight into xtreme looney tunes territory once and for all and what comes next is even worse at least it gets sort of exciting towards the very end but the aftertaste is horrible the empty feeling of having wasted so much time in such fickle fake pleasureat least you can draw parallels between the films both halves and us the audience in one hand it seems like the hungarian red light district seems like a much more satisfying and lifeenriching experience than this film and on the other hand we ourselves are the victims of cinematographic torture except we are the ones paying for itat least i didnt pay for it,cruel
i waited 5 years to see this but im glad i finally did i can honestly say that most critiques of this film are inaccurate and unfair is an intense and extremely wellmade modern horror film comments that the action doesnt begin until after an hour were obviously written by viewers with infantile attention spans and video game addicts the calm before the storm is known as tension building or suspense begins to get creepy almost immediately before the guys even leave amsterdam when the slovakian guy makes the comment about being able to do anything to the girls from this remote village by the time paxton and his traveling companions arrive in slovakia it is already obvious that what will follow will be something very bizarre and terrifying director eli roth has obviously learned a lot from not only classic horror films but also foreign film as he takes the familiar direction of the slower more suspenseful style of his euro counterparts beautiful and strange little touches like the murderous children and the ambiguous suggestions of one main characters sexuality also lend this one a definite euro feel those that commented on the amount of nudity and sex in the film must have led very sheltered lives never seeing a foreign film the nudity is very brief and only occurs at the beginning the abandoned building where the torturekillings take place is truly brilliant in all its dirty and bloody splendor and the violence is realistic shocking and disturbing anyone offended or sickened by said images should have done a bit of research before looking at the film and known enough to steer clear of it but no they wanted to see it just so they could rip it apart and call it sick these same people paid to see it what does that make them hypocrites cleverly lulls the viewer into a false sense of security with an intentional light mood the beginning portion of the film utilizes bright colors and upbeat music the second portion sees the colors washing away along with the light feeling halfway through observant viewers will notice that the color is gone completely leaving only shades of black brown and gray with the only real color being the red of the gallons of blood being spilled the harshest critics should watch this one again only this time they might want to switch their brains on and maybe they will see all the little nuances and symbolism that make an intelligent classic horror film the thing that places in a different league from similar films like saw is the suggestion of evil on such a grand scale while saw dealt with the anger and vengeance of one man suggests a world where an entire village might be in on the conspiracy of murdering innocents and not even for some moral or spiritual reason but rather these people are in it for nothing more than financial gain suggests an evil and an inherent corruption an immorality on such a large scale that the film can hardly fail at being one of the most evil and disturbing films of our time as a horror film therefore succeeds and surpasses all other imitators,cruel
is basically an attempt to garner attention from collegegrade students and to be a party movie that turns into a horror movie the problem is that it fails in pretty much every facet of this it misses the mark with its culture references and the youthful dialogue sounds like it was probably written with crayon or drool stains this movie leans towards offbase clichs and the nudity really just is there because well its nudity its supposed to create an atmosphere of the perfect road trip for american teenagers but due to its lack of integrity dialogue and acting its just a thoroughly unconvincing pile of garbage that has boobs in itas for the horror aspect it too is pretty lame it is nowhere near as violent as it was marketed and it just isnt convincing the claustrophobia geared scenes are mildly effective but overall its just a boring piece of crap film that will leave you more offended than scared,cruel
i can totally understand all the negative reactions has receivedthe idea behind the movie is just halfgood and for sure nothing revolutionary it could have been developed much better but the premise and the whole unfolding of it are still deeply rooted in the land of horrorslasher clichbut well in all honesty a good movie whatever its genre doesnt necessarily need to be groundbreaking or innovative to be good there are many predictable movies which are good okay or just enjoyable for what they aresadly fails on that ground too lets see how1 dull plot horny teenagers looking for sex end up in a creepy god forsaken town and get kidnapped and tortured by some sick rich bastards wow color me surprised2 cardboard cutout characters as if the plot wasnt predictable enough the characters are so unidimensional its impossible to empathize with them and even the bad guys are left at the typical evil for the sake of it state just one the wannabe surgeon is given some sort of weak personality and reason for his violence3 plot holes galore sure its just a movie but for a movie which claims to be a trueish story there are just too many plot holes and weakinconsistent events lets follow this creepy strangers advice and leave amsterdam to go find a fabulous brothel in the middle of nowhere slovakia urban legen anyone the brothel exists indeed it looks more like a 4 stars hotel and its filled with centerfold material wholl sleep with pretty much anyone for free in the middle of slovakian wasteland no not suspicious at all a seasoned slaughter apparently cant handle a chainsaw or stand on a vomitwet floor no severed fingers wont be hindering your escape from the fortress and youll look good enough to fool one of the elite hunters the bad guys will allow you to escape with an unknown asian girl at tow real heroes dont leave alone without putting up much of a fight if i was an elite hunter id fill a complaint for that kind of money id expect a better security service a semidisfigured girl walking around wont draw attention on you and most important even with some fingers missing you wont bleed to death faint or experience the slightest distress and will have enough strength to kill your torturer after a nice train trip5 euro stereotype so according to this movie afghanistan is disneyland compared to slovakia i dont care if it was a tongueinthecheek portrait of what many americans think of eastern europe beautiful women wholl sleep do anyone for a drink poverty and violence on the streets of dull grey towns crooked police evil foreigners better if halfnazis using the place as a private playground that idea of eastern european countries is outdated by like 25 yearsill stop there as such a disaster of a movie doesnt deserve more attentionawful plot awful execution passableatbest for the 15 minutes of torture but not even some decently shot torture scenes can salvage such a trainwreck110 just because it wasnt possible giving it a lower score,cruel
a certain phrase has been slung around in popular culture ever since the appearance of the saw series and that phrase is torture porn the idea behind torture porn being a movie or story that deals with the torture of human beings with no rhyme or reason other than to illicit a sick form of pleasure to a certain audience ive never liked the term torture porn because i certainly got no pleasure in what i saw in the saw movie even if the first one is one of my favourite suspensehorror movies but thats something entirely different so what about the other big name torture porn flick well although there are certain sights on display that did illicit pleasure mainly in the form of various beautiful women but that didnt really have anything to do with the torture so im already straying away from calling this torture porn but unlike saw there is no rhyme or reason here so if there is a movie out of the two that deserves that title it is is not a good movie the torture isnt scary as theres no tension to it a lot of guts are spilled here and there are some painful looking scenes but somehow eli roth was able to take the pain or horror out of these scenes and the only groans they got from me werent in disgust they were of boredom to make something like this work as horror it has to be tense suspenseful and most of all have an edge that makes it scary instead of repulsive cant do any of this the only repulsion the film brings is the fact that its yawn inducing because of how boring it is the plot is muddled and confused and it seems to be telling two different stories  one story from an american pie movie and the other from a wannabe guinea pig horror film neither work i suppose the american pie section works a little bit only because there is some nice nudity but it still comes off as idiocyin the end theres nothing here for anyone really its too tame and lacking in edge to please those few sick depraved individuals that do get off on movies like this and it lacks the suspense and edginess required to make it scary for folks like me who want a few thrills and chills from their horror and even the part that tries to be a sex comedy doesnt really work either is just a stupid movie with practically no appeal no talent i only give this a 3 because a 3 is a rather curvy number and the curves are really the only positive to this film,cruel
please stay away from this film at all costs it is honestly one of the worst films i have seen with little to no redeeming qualities the characters are flat the dialogue is generic the acting is mediocre the gore is laughably fake the story is next to nonexistentto be fair the idea was a decent one which is why i give this movie a 210 the concept of an international torture ring is genuinely engaging however the idea fails before it is even introduced into the movie it starts off in what was supposed to be the netherlands but extreme inattention to detail resulted in many many inaccuracies we get some softcore pornography to start the movie off with some t  a for some reason we are also introduced to several dull stereotypical and unsympathetic characters after a lame discussion between these characters we learn that there are apparently no males in slovakia due to a war which one im not sure so our dull stupid characters go to slovakia for the noble cause of scoring some pussy follows several minutes of generic and pointless dialoguethen comes the gore for a few seconds when the main character enters the torture building we get the feeling that the film might actually become good at this point it doesnt we see the violence from a distance at first and the directing is quite good very creepy then however the crapfest continues horrible acting is complimented by lame special effects and dumb horrormovie clichs im not going to spoil the ending but rest assured its no better than the rest of this garbagein short this movie has mediocre acting and directing little story no character development no scratch that no real characters at all it is completely inaccurate in just about everything it portrays from violence to the dutch speaking german to portraying slovakia as a 3rd world hellhole there is even a little wtf sequence where a group of bubble gumaddicted gypsy kids rob people by broad daylight of course at that point in the movie it didnt really even surprise me please do not watch this movie it is not scary cool deep or anything lastly just because tarantino attached his name to this turd doesnt make it any the better,cruel
i was so close to not watching this film because of the comments here but im so glad i did this is the first comment ive made on imdb because i had to tell everyone who hasnt seen this film that this is nothing like a conventional 510 horror film im a huge cynic with horror films i hate nearly all post 2000 american ones but i havent just sat down and enjoyed one like this since alfred hitchcocks psycho 1960 i heartily recommend this filmto prove you can trust mereasons i think people undeservingly hate it are they are in denial a person would pay to kill a random human being and say this is unbelievable they think nudity is unnecessary for some reason its not used in anyway to try and expand the target market of the film or any cheap shot like that they just shows some tits and a bit of sex which is not a big deal they think the gore was unnecessary because there is not any in the first half the gore is great and adds to the impact the characters didnt bitch enough definitely a good thing when im watching a horror filmso please dismiss negative comments about this film thank you for your time and brace yourself for a killer film,cruel
i watched this movie with a bit of chagrin the start was plausible and the holiday etc rolled on when the lads go on holiday and become trapped in the the disgusting torture porn starts everything that happens in this film is just not believable it is pure imaginary rubbish coming from the mind of people who seem to get off on watching others suffer the film could easily have been 30 minutes shorter at a lot of points it seems a little dragged out the end and revenge angle was justice done etc was enjoyable but entirely predictable didnt enjoy this and those who did need help i was genuinely surprised they made a second one,cruel
i was so looking forward to this film but it was a great disappointment dont waste your breath energy or time on it it was bloody ridiculous it did not really concentrate or concentrated on anything really one of the worst horror movie ever i do enjoy some of eli roths work but the was completely bs so was the second i was all porno if you ask me more than 23 of the film is porno and men getting there jollies on it there was not much torture in it as i was expecting so if you want to watch this or was looking forward at all dont bother i couldnt go to the movies to watch the dumb movie so i was dumb enough to buy the dvd waste of 20 and 2 hours of my life watching it now its sitting at the bottom of my dvd collections where it will stay,cruel
the infamous is about two teenagers jay hernandez and derek richardson and their icelandic companion eythor gunjonsson traveling across europe in search of women for the most basic reason sexual intercourse of course they end up in slovakia where they get exactly want they want however they soon discover that the endless sex is too good to be true because the girls intend to lure them into a particular nasty trap that makes all three men into torture slaves for this underground hound networknow some reviewers have given this film very high ratings others have called it utter trash the truth lies somewhere in between the first half of the film was actually very good director eli roth who also wrote the screenplay succeeds in building up the suspense and you get a strange feeling that things are not what they seem aside from that the viewer beholds some lovely cinematography of slovakiabut once the dark secret of the film is revealed the film descends into the familiar monster fest of blood gore and body parts now some people like that but frankly i dont this is one of those movies that uses torture blood and gore not to advance the films plot in a meaningful way much like eastern promises did but simply to entertain viewers by shocking them these horror tactics have gone on for more than three decades now perhaps the most infamous example being caligula but frankly it takes more than cutting off fingers or pulling an eye from its socket to create a good film in other words the problem is that the plot exists for the sole purpose of serving the film directors sadistic fantasies it would have been much better especially if much of the gore and blood was edited out if the sadistic scenes actually advanced the plot as they did in hitchcocks psycho in the godfather parts 1 and 2 scarface or dressed to kill instead what the viewer gets is a pile of sadistic trash aside from that the film is very offensive to slovaks and slovakia in general,cruel
so bad that i only waste time to vote and write the words for a comment strange that a person will sell out of his name as much as quentin tarantino do here shame on you mr quentin tarantino but then again i just note that the director is mr eli roth who never have done anything good as actor and neither as writer director and as producer just take a look at the mr eli roth filmography on imdb and ask yourself if you find anything you hear about before waiste of time and moneyif you pay to see this moviethen i pity you i note he also have a finger on 2 sure i already now know that i will never waste time on that to well i will never say that a person is hopeless all the way in life i why notmaybe a movie will be good in the future but without using the name of mr quentin tarantino to honest i will give it a  of 10not an a b or c movie but it might rise up to a d,cruel
i hadnt planned to watch particularly after cringing all the way through cabin fever a few years ago  but after noticing that it was on tv i decided to see what the fuss was about very quickly i realised that my opinion of was going to be based pretty much solely on how i reacted to its portrayal of extreme violence which in the event generated a sense of indifference i began to find rather troubling after a whileeli roths petulance is something to behold if you dont like his films youre out of touch apparently because this is art yeah its metaphorical yeah its probably symbolic of something too maybe probably yeah i dont know if this has occurred to roth but if he wants to claim that those trained articulate professional critics who bayoneted this film back in 2005 dont get it then maybe isnt doing its job properlyi can if im generous see the basic genesis of some kind of artistic statement here that only goes as far as roths limited ability can take it all the obvious touches are there that suggest a film trying to pass itself off as high art  dramatic reversal of roles characters who talk in silly epigrams that sort of thing  but never becomes the modern day texas chainsaw massacre it wants to be by dint of being extremely badly written the actors maul their way through dialogue that clunks like a broken clock while all the time being characterised as weird cartoons a quick glance through imdbs memorable quotes section reveals just how banal the dialogue is the narrative is just as shabby as time and time again our hero is rescued in the nick of time by a chance event such as a knock on a door happening at exactly the right moment after a while this kind of contrivance just distances me from a story thats supposed to suck me in and unnerve me roth lacks his mentor quentin tarantinos ability to present the postmodern and therefore just comes across as crude and shoddy rather than subversive and selfanalyticali wont say much more except that ill grant one more star than cabin fever got because it doesnt strike me as being quite as smug ultimately though if you dont get turned on by the extreme on screen violence then there isnt much in the film i can recommend to you if you do get turned on by the extreme on screen violence then stay a very long way away from me,cruel
this piece of crap does not even warrant 1 out of 10 films like this were originally called snuff movies the only difference being in the originals the cast were really murdered on screen how the hell does a talentless sick retard like roth get near a film studio god help us all with minds like this at large the first 30 minutes are mind numbingly boring when the nasty stuff starts it gets even more boring and stupid and sick sick sick there is no plot line no real story what was the point of it i stuck through to the ott ending then felt i needed a good bath and a drink before you askno i am not squeamish i worked for 25 years in one of the emergency services and have become accustomed to real blood and gore i also recognise a sick mind at work when i see it,cruel
i really loved it is a very very good movie regardless of what many people think people cant seem to see beyond the violence or the gorethe photography the editing the acting the score the script everything was top notch it is really well made there are a bunch of tortureporn but really tortureporn flicks like violent sht or porno holocaust out there with zero production values just made for the hell of it which i suppose theyre fun in a way but basically they are pieces of garbage people dont seem to realize how well made a movie like isi believe torture porn is not fitting at all for is a very tense very disturbing nightmarish look at human nature its a horror movie in every sense of the word and stylistically its very much like an italian gialloright now in times when you get a lot just for the sake of being gory movies cant be taken away from that context but i assure you will be a horror classic cause its really well done and it actually has something to say,cruel
the suspense is brought rapidly to a peak at each seemingly innocent or curious encounter we suspect that the intrepid travelers have started on the path to their doom yet they continue unharmed and would make us wonder if perhaps nothing is wrong that is we would wonder if we didnt know we were watching a horror film the suspense doesnt slow when the gruesomeness starts we are sill left wondering who will survive if they will survive or how they will survive the director gives away nothing as moment by moment the plot unfolds the tension doesnt slow as the plot tilts from terror to revenge since every step of the way it threatens to slip back into terror even as the film reaches its conclusion the twisted plot leaves the viewer wondering if that really is the end or if there is one more twist waiting for us after the credits roll the film is fast paced scary convincingly acted true to its location and achieves moments of brilliance particularly in one scene where a single and seemingly innocent sentence we are going to the sauna would you like to come reveals every secret to paxton in an awful epiphanythis is a gore film but in no way a formula slasher film the bad guys arent superhuman the victims arent stupid people doing even stupider things they behave like normal people that a rational viewer can identify and sympathize with a lot of the real gore does move off camera that i would have liked to see but i wonder if the film was risking an x rating if they showed it all,cruel
well mister tarantino why dont u do us all a favor and find yourself a job as a hot dog seller it would suit you so much more than making movies this movie is full of nothingit has no imagination unless you are a serial killer and by the way why dont you hire yourself a shrink because you definitely need one if you want to see how a movie should be done take notes from hannibal of course thats old school but is 10 000 times better than this movie when i see your movies i almost throw up what are you trying to prove beside an urgent need for a shrink i see nothing well i see that you have no talent but hey who can blame you there are so many losers out there making movies that one more doesnt countnext time when your genius thinks of making a movie please find your own ideas and dont destroy good movies with your lack of imagination lets face it you took the idea from silence of the lambs and hannibal you added some make up and voila aka nothing worth watchingplese get a life and stop trying to make movies it only makes you look bad,cruel
came to mexico in 2005 whit a lot of expectations because quentin tarantino presents the film and also because a lot of people who already see this film said that this film was the most disturbing film ever finally the certification in mexico was d just for adults it was the first not porno film that have this certification in mexico so i couldnt see this film in the cinema well first for me this film wasnt the most violent ever and in consequence is not so disturbing as the publicity said and of course i think that the certification was excessive in that way i feel really disappointed when i watch in dvd for the first time i mean is as disturbing as the mainstream could be and even the most disturbing photo that appears in some posters and later in the dvd cover the man with a drill in his mouth doesnt appear in the filmbut that doesnt mean that i dont like this film for me is very entertaining and in general aspects is good and could be better without the excessive publicity the plot is simple but good two young americans and another from iceland are on vacation in europe first in amsterdam where they only want to have girls and later in slovakia because a guy told to them that in an in that city they could find the most beautiful girls in europe in slovakia they are part of a business for sick people that want to kill a person the americans are the most expensive so the girls of the help to put the americans in that business there are like three chapters in the film first amsterdam where is only parties and fun and looks as a teenage film later slovakia where also is some fun whit the girls but the fear and the bad feelings start to affect the characters mind and the film start getting good and finally in the factory where theres only paini like the idea of eli roth to put this kind of original business in a film you pay for kill a person and the prices are different according to the nationality of the person i read once in a newspaper that the story was based on a true story of a place that eli roth finds in internet where yo pay for shot a unknown person i mean that is truly scary to know that places like this really existwell the cast is just good mostly young actors and the makeup and the visual part of the film is really well done also i love the cameo of takashi miike even he cant speak english he accept to participate with eli roth who is a fan of ichi the killerconclusion thanks to an excessive publicity was disappointing but anyway i dont recommend this film to sensitive audiences and for me the film is good very entertaining and worth a look 85 out of 10dvd great whit a lot of comments by eli roth quentin tarantino producers and the cast also whit a documentary of the make of and three different angles for the scene when the crazy childrens destroy the car,cruel
i have very little to say about this piece of trashthe eurotrash stereotypes were straight out of eurotrip though the jokes were a lot funnierthe nudity was gratuitous and not at all sexythe torture was laughable saw was far better roth could really do with taking lessons on suspense from james wani understand why no one showed up to see 2roth will end up crawling back to troma begging lloyd kaufman to let him direct toxic avenger x,cruel
the main prostitute in the film was quentin tarantino which goes to show that some people will do anything for money the movie and dvd came out looking like it was a tarantino film but quentin tarantino had nothing to do with it other than to sell his name for some big bucks too bad smellovision never caught on or everyone could have gotten a whiff of how bad this film really stinks the script was awful the direction was awful the acting was awful i think awful must stand for a worse film is un likely the first half of the movie dragged the torture scenes were disgusting and there were only two of them plus some revealed results the real torture victims were the those who paid money to actually watch this piece of trash two severed thumbs waaaay down to quentin tarantino shame on you for recommending this utter waste of time,cruel
thats one hell of an idea they got on this movie i think i mostly liked it because i thought i had the whole plot figured out and in the end i didnt and i really liked the idea the movie also develops itself very quick so is not boring i hardly noticed time passing and i had a few laughs alone which is always a good sign you dont usually laugh when youre alone i think its a controversial movie and not everyone will like it youll like it less if youre expecting a tarantino movie which isnt and maybe is not the classic horror movie you watch with your girlfriend but the one you watch with your friends it gets you thinking because you have to wonder how unreal the movie is most horror movies are not supposed to be real what actually gives the creeps about is that what happens there might be true for all you know,cruel
when this first came out i never thought that id sit through it in a million years im nowhere near a gore hound and would prefer psychological thrillers to any sort of outright torture porn although i had this in mind i eventually grew more interested in seeing it hearing that it was absolutely terrifying and utterly disturbing i was curious so when i saw that it was on showtime one night i decided to sit through itboy was i stupidin general its a poor film at first thought the most blatant mistake that roth makes is his characterization if youre going to make a film specifically about torture and youre trying to make your audience sympathize with the victims the worst thing to do is make them seem like completely stupid and shallow frat boys from the first moment if the audience is sympathizing with the predators instead of the prey because they prey are such frustrating and silly characters your films not gonna be effective secondly i wont deny that the plots idea is frightening the execution however is not so much the torture is more silly than frightening im sorry but i had to laugh when the asian girls eye was hanging out with a budget that large there is no reason for visual effects to be that excessively cheesy and it is much too amateurish to be disturbing the acting was just made up of a ton of simple screaming making even something as nasty sounding as a slit achilles tendon seem dumb now dont get me wrong there were one or two genuinely creepy moments the only one coming to mind as when jay hernandezs character is in the locker room talking to a man who is freakishly excited getting ready to go in and torture someone that i thought was a good effective way to actually make the plot seem frightening and present everything else however doesnt do near the same jobpeople fans of the genre have told me that if i could handle i could handle anything after seeing it i am now genuinely scared of the state of modern horror if this is the epitome of terror in modern cinema then i dont want to know what the future holds for the genre,cruel
this movie is an embarrassment to watch its predictable disgusting and basically a porno eli roth cheated off of saw by trying to make as gross a torture movie as possible but what good is that kind of movie without a plot and let me tell you this had no plot at all two americans tour europe and hook up with girls in slovakia the girls basically use them into getting them kidnapped tortured and eventually killedthat is not a plot thats just plain dumb stupid ridiculous and horrible i guess i could say that if you want to watch it then watch it to see how stupid it is i ended up despising eli roth and you probably will to because if i ever meet him im definitely going to be up in his face like whats youre effing problem yeah hes a 100 sick man and i think those who actually do like the movie is because they think the same way eli roth was thinking when he made the movie disgusting thats all i have to say,cruel
was a great followup to eli roths great cabin fever it was wellwritten scripted and acted also had roths interesting blend of sex blood horror and comedy and it works much better here than in cabin fever is definitely not a film for everyone but genre fans are sure to love roths newest film i especially loved jay hernandez and derek richardson is great performances and their characters made this film so enjoyable for once this horror film allows you to get attached to the characters so that when they die it is all the more effective i would really recommend this to anyone but i think that horror fans will get the biggest kick out of it while it wasnt as good as the sequel was still one of my favorite horror films and a shockingly great time,cruel
the thing that drew me to this film is the fact that it was directed by a brilliant director quentin tarantino always delivers with his films and this is just another one where he scores big time the story is strangely believable because the bad guys are ordinary people just like you and me but people who are looking at getting kicks from killing others the bloody horror that unfolds is one that has your choking back the vomit on watching this film for a third time i watched other peoples reactions around me and their faces as more grizzly gore appears on the screen its unnerving and you feel every scream as the victims are tortured beyond belief in the most grotesque way it is a definite hit and one which should not watched by the faint hearted or people who are that little bit squeamish that being said i have never winced much at horror films until i watched this one the unforgettable eye scene shall stay with me forever i still cover my eyes now one to watch,cruel
there are scary movies and there are horror movies is the later what do i mean by horror a movie that makes you flinch thats uncomfortable to watch and stays with you long after you see it the movie starts like the gardenvariety scary movie in the vein of scream and 80s slasher flicks but by the last half it becomes pure unadulterated horror the director did a pretty good job taking us from the cheesiness to the terrible cruelty you experience later to its unrealistic but satisfying hollywood ending many people will say the hollywood clichs will ruin what could have been a classic but i think when the subject is so disturbing you need a little movie magic to lighten up things when the movie ended the most horrible thing i think i experienced was not watching helpless trapped people being tortured like if they were in the deepest stage of hell it was thinking these things are happening somewhere in the world right now not in slovakia where this movie does what borat did for kazakhstan but in places like china iran and cuba where americans are likely doing it too there are some parallels between sex and violence in the movie but its easy to forget if you only want to watch it as face value there are too many clever things done for those who want to read between the lines one last praise i think it was pretty clever not to subtitle any foreign language it adds to the experience which in the end is to make you uncomfortable in all levels possible,cruel
even though there was some minor gore  nothing worth talking about however  this awful movie has been an completely waste of time and money of mine as well of the makers actors and producers of this so called film being no more than a piece of junkokay this movie mightnt have had the intention to be known as one of great script andor story line and it had its arrows probably aimed at being gory to the max but it hasnt at all succeeded in doing so there was less gore in this whole movie than there was in the first ten minutes of for example bad taste which also had a pretty meek story line to it but nevertheless managed to turn out to be one to me even the of the classics in goreis a very very bad movie with an awful plot countless errors in continuity and and a massive amount of absolutely nonsensical scenes and actions like there is the miraculous escape of paxton with kana  its also full of facts that dont in any way connect to reality in amsterdam for all i know they speak dutch not some invented whatever language see scene in the disco somewhere in the beginning of the movie and then most of the people in the netherlands speak english rather well especially in the capital and not with the strange accent as they do in the movie like the fat guy in the coffee shop when our friends arrive at the closed at night in amsterdam they all of a sudden start speaking german to the aroused people that they woke up do s in amsterdam these days really still have curfews get realthis movie could probably have scored a lot higher if it were filmed from the other perspective the torturers i mean and not from the horny kids but who am i nobody thats right and i am not getting paid sh1tloads of money for making movies itd be an interesting thought thoughtheres also something else i find very disturbing and that is the fact that master producer god himself quentin tarantino presents this movie why mr tarantino please tell me why because of a few scenes of gore dont try to convince me that its about the story slovakia might produce in the imagination of people who dont live in europe an image of a country thats inhabited with retarded people that speak a language that people wouldnt even teach their pigs if they were allowed to speak but it has a history that goes so much further back than  well you know what i meanand then there was this subtle hint of the russians being the bad guys again whats that american turmoil against russia coming from these days besides the obvious i thought we all enjoyed night watch and day watch reading in the press that russia was finally able to compete with hollywood  russian email addresses end on ru and not on rus sure that everyone filming knew this but decided to make it rus anyway so peopled be sure to think that it was russia behind all the atrocities and that it was them we should blamedont get me wrong though i am very pro gory movies and atrocities visualized on screen its my favorite genre but theres a thin line between good and bad man this scene where paxton is lying on the cart under a bunch of corpses and where the butcher is cutting up the bodies in order to dispose of them in an oven treblinka is one of the worst things i have ever seen its so stupid and not scary gory of unnerving at all at all its plain stupid and it therefore is one of many a good example of the movies accomplishments a nothingmovie on all accountstrue the cutting off of the fingers of the bad guy on the end was more or less decently filmed why paxton had to slit his throat though ill probably never know wasnt he supposed to be so freaking good and honorable he wasnt in this godforsaken country of slovakia anymore but in germany he couldve called the cops no well whatever i am happy imdb gives me the opportunity to vent a little after having an afternoon wasted on this junkwant to see gore with a more or less decent story or for that matter a bad story but still watchable go and check out saw i and iii for example or bad taste if you havent already or or or theres too many to namei am very sorry that mister tarantino has sold his name to this very upsettingly bad movie hes still one of my favorite directors though maybe mister tarantine maybe you should direct iii yourself i have very little faith that ii will be any better but as i am ill give them the benefit of the doubt and will watch it anyway just for well whatever reasondikke jules,cruel
i hated this movie not to mention disgusting scenes the movie was simply cheap bad scenario poor story pathetic acting etc etc etc even the movie started with a painfully clich atmosphere 3 young men are traveling in europe for some fun like thousands of 3rd class hollywood movies and actually continued like that during the whole movie apart from disgusting torture scenes they were definitely not scary only disgustingi am not a faint hearted person in my life until last week i even used to choose particularly the action and horror movies to watch i dont know how many times i watched kill bill or some japanese movies they were all some sort of fun for me but this movie was like a wake up call right after watching the i sat down and asked myself  what am i doing why am i a part of this insanity and cheapness every time directors and writers are being a bit more disgusting and insane for the sake of impressing the audience for the sake of impressing the audience they can sell a whole nations reputation slovakia became one of the most corrupt countries in the world i am not from this country and i know this is just a silly movie but what really annoys me is the reckless approach of hollywood they feel like that they have the rights to make bad whichever country they want a country is corrupt or not this is their problem not an idiot american directors by the way another cheap flick was promoting the movie as tarantinos last work just to create a higher reputation the bottom line is i want to watch movies i mean real movies from now on i do not want to waste my time for such a rubbish any more,cruel
i remember i seen this with my main gal ivy in the movie theaters and it has since become my favorite movie of all timesthis movie still scares the pants off of me i seen it almost a million times and i am still not tired of itthe very fact that the movie is almost feels like a teen sex comedy in the first half makes the torture scenes all the more frightening and chills the very blood in my soulim a gore hound myself but i always found myself still a little shocked by how life like the violence lookedi could swear i was seeing real blood and it made me feel sick for even enjoying the moviebut its all pretend and fake so i dont feel so bad anymore but still this movie will always be my favorite movie for its effective use of disturbing images for full on fear factorfear is a factor to me and it will be for you too since what happens in can happen in the real worldthat is so much more scary than ghosts demons devils or pretty much any thing super naturali highly recommend this movie to everyone since i never seen a horror movie that was this scary since the evil dead series,cruel
i think i was expecting something really cheesy and bad thats why i took this long seeing it but it was actually really good it reminded me of a few movies like american werewolf in paris which isnt as bad as its supposed to be either and suspiria and oldboy in spots it wasnt nearly as gory as i expected and except one scene toward the very end i wasnt really freaked out but mind you during that scene i had my hands out in front of me going stop stopas far as the story goes i thought it was great the only thing i would have changed was something that kana did i didnt want her to do that but in reality it totally makes sense that she did jay hernandez was great theres something really likable about him besides being cute that i think you need in someone whos in peril i also liked the main villain the more normal they look the creepier they are and speaking of looks i thought the movie was actually very beautiful to look at which is something you used to get with horror movies all the time now not so muchi cant imagine why it has such a low rating 58 as im writing unless lots of people who just dont go for that sort of thing voted on it but i dont understand what they would be doing watching it anyway i dont really consider myself a horror fan but i do appreciate the good ones i definitely think this fits into that category,cruel
this is a tarantino flick as much as eli roths there is plenty of shock gore and even a little comedythis is the film in a nutshell  in modernday slovakia there exists a which lures young lowprofile tourists into staying long enough so that they can be captured and used by a hunting club the main characters are lured by the prospect of beautiful women and plenty of sex when they first arrive the girls are everything they expected and more later we see that the characters start to disappear one by one as they are abductedthey are taken to an old warehouse run by an organization which charges members worldwide fees for the right to torture and kill a victim of their very own in the privacy of their own cells using dozens of torture instrumentsi rented the unrated dvd version of the film it definitely goes beyond a standard r rating one disturbing aspect of the film is that the club charges the most  for the chance to kill americans they are considered the fillet mignon another is the fact that none of what happens is all that unbelievable jerky guys who travel a long distance to get laid let their guards down and fall victim to beautiful girls drugs alcohol their own egos and even a band of poor kids who roam the streets as gangs demanding candy i think eli roth is trying to make some sort of social commentary here you think what the film does very well is keep you guessing every actor is an unknown so youll never know who lives and who dies,cruel
i guess the thing that i didnt like about was that it took so long for anything exciting to happen and that about 60 of the film revolved around sex and the pleasures of europe however this is indeed anything but typical or cheesy its rare to experience the reallife horror of europes murderforprofit business and to know that things like this really happenwithin this film three backpackers travel to europe for girls drugs alcohol etc and find themselves receiving far more and far worse than they could have ever imaginedif you think that this is a cheesy overdone predictable or pointless film then why dont you go watch something like eight of the nine sequels to friday the 13th or several of the nightmare on elm street sequels,cruel
is a movie that so many people will bash up and downfor many years to come its a horror film people and for those of you that do not like it that is fine but just remember that comedies and horror flicks do not always rank high at the box office if you are judging on the number of ticket sales then you are seriously missing out on a masterpiece in the making this movie is worth seeing by everybody in existence its a movie that will always be successful because even the so called people who say they dont like it probably actually did this movie did it all for me nudity character development foreign vacation and pure horror that comes for three guys just looking to have a good time i can honestly say with out being a spoiler that this movie was one of the better horror films ive seen in a long time it was much better than wolfe creek in the fact of originality there are limits set by all horror movies on the brutal ability allowed to use part ii should be much more gruesome and live up to some of these trolls expectations all in all you need to see this movie its great,cruel
i loved i rate it one of the better horror movies of recent years i dont know why everyone has to get on the hate train with this one i found it incredibly sick and brutal of course the girls will leave the room if you put it on  the bad guys are wonderfully creepy and in a way that is believable and depraved it made me feel pretty creeped out at the end of it and i grew up with all the gore fest horrors of the 80s etc but this is a kick ass movie not as good as wolf creek i love that one also some great scary ass sht in that one i just dunno why all you haters have to get on board and call it lame etc it frigging rocks and if you havent seen then see it and judge it yourself not on what the kids are saying on here about it,cruel
this is the first good suspense film ive seen in a very long time please notice that i say film not movie it is something you must see for yourself to truly enjoy but to summarize the plot i will say that the 3 guys backpack thru europe and encounter something so evil that the mind can hardly fathom it kudos to eli roth for the incredible suspense it contains and a minimum of gore that is so overdone these days i dare say this film hearkens to the touch of the master of suspense alfred hitchcock jay hernandez is spectacular as the protagonist and is totally believable in his character i will be purchasing this on dvd very soon if you have the chance check it out it is well worth it,cruel
when i watch a movie i often enjoy the movie because i can relate to one or more of the characters in this movie i could not relate to any of the characters i would never want to be the victims and i sure as heck would never want to be the psychos performing the chopping up of bodiessome of the acting was good by the young boys in the movie but the story was poor our world is already full of criminals who murder others and do awful things my fear is that this movie could give people like that more ideas it may promote more violence because in the movie violence was portrayed as a fun thing to do weak minded individuals out there would believe that it is a fun thing to do to othersthe other reason i disliked this movie is due to the way it portrays europe i dont know who would ever want to take a trip to amsterdam after seeing this movie the movie is bothersome and i have to wonder how sick the writer must be to have come up with such extreme violence and low respect for human life,cruel

thank you eli roth for taking an intriguing premise and transforming it into something of no value whatsoever tells the story of a couple of annoying yank college students and one seriously burnt out foreign dude traveling through eastern europe since they spend the majority of this film sucking up whatever drugs they can get their hands on banging prostitutes and acting like complete morons they become perfect targets for an business looking to recruit ie kidnap distracted and brainless young tourists just like them before you can say good riddance we discover that said business is actually a grimy decaying underground labyrinth where customers from all over the globe pay big bucks for a chance to torture a mutilate a real live human being sounds like a blast doesnt it while might seem like a disturbing horror film in theory its so badly directed and written it aggressively refuses to deliver anything remotely resembling suspense terror or shock value the only memorable sequence happens near the end of the picture and involves a dislocated eyeball that needs snipped in the meantime the characters are so poorly developed obnoxious and dumb the dialogue is risible and the film so slow moving you might find it a trust test of patience to hang in there id say eli roth probably had his target audience in mind when he vomited up this mess people who are content with nothing more than ta and blood being flung around sadly those sharing his same mentality tend to be too young to actually see rrated moviesmost surprisingly this mess managed to make a dent at the box office a small dent but a dent nonetheless just one more sign of the times when something this bad turns out to be one of the highest grossing horror movies of 2006 and that has nothing to do with it being a quality horror film and everything to do with hype hype being some major name calling dredging up quentin tarantinos money investment and a misleading ad campaign claiming this is the most shocking film of the past ten years unfortunately it doesnt even come close and is just another waste of time and money,cruel
being a fan of horror movies all my life this was a big disappointment on nearly every level the story was unbelievably dumb and the movie dragged on a very slow pace for nearly an hour before the action starts the look is totally amateurish the make up effects are a throwback to the italian gorefests from the eighties there is no single shock in the film the blood and guts i expected are also absent ok there is some gore but nothing spectacular and not very much except you call a few body parts lying around and a few puddles of blood as gore the was not a single bit of suspense in the whole movie but a ton of dumb coincidences making me shake my head i feel sorry for the talented jay hernandez being in such a mindless and boring movie whatever quentin tarantino saw in this flick i cant find it i gave a 2 because uwe boll and rob zombie make movies even worse than this one,cruel
begins surprisingly enough along the lines of eurotrip as a crass riteofpassage sex comedy about a trio of young western backpackers chasing after exotic thrills in the seductive form of a bevy of loose and kinky european women the film takes a sudden turn for the sinister as they head east in the direction of slovakia while on the train they share a carriage with a slimy dutch doctor who sets the scene for the horrors to come by messily eating raw mushrooms upon arrival they find themselves the victims of an unsrcupulous honey trap next thing they know these silly lads are strapped up in an underground torture complex at the mercy of some leftover josef mengele typesif only eastern europe was really this excitingi didnt have a big problem with the uneven structure of the film from the opening few minutes it was clear that i was watching unadulterated trash  not always such a bad thing i had more of a problem with the drably hedonistic and totally transparent characters the strange lack of involvement i felt towards the nasty events and the somewhat retarded attitudes of eli roth towards women foreign countries and just about anything you cant learn about from watching splatter moviesthe unpleasantly childish fratboy mentality of the writerdirector spreads to most levels of the film theres a puerile selfregard in the characters motivations their attitudes towards women and gays and in the revenge scenario that later develops especially offensive is the vile treatment of asian women in the film i get the idea that roth was weaned on japanese films like guinea pig and the more extreme works of takashi miike who has a cameo in seeing how awfully japanese women are treated in their native cinema he had to try a hamfisted imitation in his own film i also have a disturbing suspicion that the film might have had more problems with american audiences and censors had it shown a beautiful blonde american girl having her eye burned out with a torch people wont mind so much if its only a japanesewe beat them in the war after all i hope im wrong about that eventually the ridiculously contrived plot sees the uninteresting hero of the film escaping and taking bloody revenge on the various people who set him up and tried to murder him but theres no gruesomely thrilling catharsis of the kind experienced while watching i spit on your grave for example the honey trap women are lined up for easy disposal like ducks in a barrel the mushroom chewing doctor is wiped out with the blandest kind of gloating sadism were meant to cheer the hero on but we never gave a stuff about him in the first placein sum there are horror movies that chill your spine or provoke your mind there are those that legitimately shock and appall you merely annoys and offends if i had to say something positive i would note that the women are beautiful and i dont have problem with simple eye candy a setting in the gorgeous continent of europe cant hurt either eli roth is capable of creating an atmosphere of sickness and menace but im left with the impression that hes a myopic individual with all kinds of dubious outlooks even more so than his patron quentin tarantino who can at least create characters that we care aboutif you want a gruesomely enjoyable thrillride i recommend wolf creek high tension or nonhosonno if you want to be appalled and brutalised see the untold story men behind the sun or salo id only recommend to the most undemanding splatter fans,cruel
i saw it in a dvd after my friend raved about the movie and told me he saw it twice already i am not a fan of the gory genre but i thought i would give it a shot and i did i shouldnt haveits not only disturbing but a sick attempt at making a sick movie i mean what the hell you show the eye ball of a live person hanging out of the socket its bound to be disturbing but whats the damn point wheres the damn story why did u make this movie i am sure some people would appreciate the movie there are some people who like mindless gore blood and flesh and these people dont mind being shown some skin too but these people are as much expected to appreciate a good movie as much as president bush is expected to eloping with osama bin ladenanyways a crap movie with absolutely no script no point whatsoever,cruel
for the first time ever a movie distributed in norway was given the nonexisting age limit of 20 years nonexisting because the highest age limit in norway is 18 yearsthats our age of majority so why 20 years what most people dont know is that the age limit was set by nbc universal themselves instead of the government controlled norwegian media authority which normally takes care of these things in other wordsits hyped through the roofi didnt know this and was expecting some pretty nervewracking stuff it was pretty gory but nothing unusual compared to other similar movies also it was surprisingly thrilling the effects was pretty good and the movie was well directed still a little involuntarily funny a few places the acting was maybe a tad better than you would expect from a teenslasher film this movie also has a few turns which make it a little less predictable as other horror moviesit may be trashbut its good trash i rate it for what it is and give it a 7 out of 10,cruel
to make a horror film scary it used to rely on the suspense but horror films made today now rely on gore to make it scary which leaves barely anything to the imagination is a film that only relies on its gore to try and make it scary but was it scary no wayis about a group of three backpackers who go to a in bratislava where the women are pretty and will want to party and have sex with you all the time but later on in the film the women lure the men into a torture chamber where one by one they are tortured and killedwas really unenternainig the first thirtyminutes was just partying and sex but then it gets to the torture which i was waiting for because i really wanted the characters to get killed they were really unlikeable this films is not wellmade because it makes you look at your watch constantly making you ask yourself how much longer do we have left and it leaves you more bored than scaredby the way dont be fooled eli roth directed this film not quentin tarantino,cruel
admittedly i was deceptively seduced by this films trailer and movie poster into believing that this film would cross the threshold into uncharted territory of the horror genre ok ok i know thats the desired effect the movie makers hope to accomplish with those two vehicles however the disturbingly haunting advertisements were so reminiscent of dark films such as the shining the exorcist and even the texas chainsaw massacre all three breaking new ground in cinematic horror that i took the bait unfortunately as is all too often the case i was disappointed when will i learn my lesson what worked for me i found the premise that wealthy perverts pay slovakian mobsters big bucks to torture and murder kidnapped tourists to be quite chillingly possible just as films like hardcore and 8mm exposed the feasibility of snuff films i must also confess that i found the blatantly gratuitous lovemaking scene extremely hypnotic two beautiful and quite nude slovakian ladies writhing to the sneaker pimps how do playing in the background was intoxicating please forgive the male hetero dog in mewhat didnt work for me the director eli roth failed in his obvious attempt to assault me with an overthetop sadosexual exploitation film sure there were a couple times when i winced and said yuck such as when a victims eyeball is torn from its socket and left dangling whilst she screams but at no time did this film remotely deliver the fear it promised even the violence was an overall shockless blah character development was so nonexistent that i felt not a smidgen of sympathy for the protagonists roth would have had better luck if this film had been geared towards a public health message warning keep it in your pants and dont sleep around or you might have your fingers cut off and your eyeballs ripped out of your head as the two protagonists come off as a couple horny imbeciles looking to score on anything female awake or passed out the ending was not only inconceivably unrealistic but i found myself shaking my head in disbelief at such a botched attempt at irony the only irony i enjoyed was reading the films tag line welcome to your worst nightmare as i left the theater there was no art here only the greedy intent to capitalize on violence looking for their next fix i enjoyed cabin fever more than this film and i hated cabin feverill leave you with this if i spit on your grave floated your boat then youll probably see this film as a masterpiece and if you do i have two words for you get help,cruel
i went into thinking it would be similar to saw but i was severely disappointed this movie makes saw look like the greatest film ever made the characters had no personality and i honestly felt nothing for them the plot was so simple it barely existed and it contained a lot of questionable turns going back for the japanese girl why eli roth is clearly out of his element when it comes to crafting an interesting story line and characters all he is good at is coming up with scenes of senseless and unnecessary gore cutting the eye a point to thati love all of quentin tarantinos movies which is another reason i was so surprised at this i cant figure out why such a brilliant filmmaker would attach his name to this piece of garbagethats what this movie is really disgusting garbage in fact staring at a pile of garbage would probably be more entertaininginterestingthe 2 stars i gave are generous extremely generous,cruel
minor spoiler ahead but nothing cruciali consider myself a jaded horror movie fan who is seldomly surprised anymore it is my contention that the atmosphere and tight editing make an intensive visceral horror experience that fact is pretty much nonexistent nowadays with the insipidly selfimportant  almost maladjusted splat pack relying on the pure spectacle of blood and guts to inspire revulsion and absolute disgust rather than go the route of psychological horror that actually inspire fear and terroralmost made the cut pardon the expression but it did not impress me that much the first onethird of the movie is a borderline sex comedy with gratuitous nudity which irritates me a bit after that it went into the horror show that feels almost as authentic but even after the creepy  grimly lit atmosphere is established it nonetheless fails to scare the bejesus out of me as texas chainsaw massacre and halloween the originals did overreliance on gallons of blood and guts is overreacting in vain attempt to inspire genuine terror but i make one exception which i will explain in detailfor the record i saw alexandre ajas haute tension at sundance film festival in 2004 and it was so over the top in pointless gorefest and outrageously idiotic plot twist that i ended up loathing the movie i dismiss alexandre aja as a hack french filmmaker who cant write good shton the contrary eli roth did a fairly good job establishing the atmosphere that is borderline creepy with vile evil with the introduction of the fresh concept based on with a sad note true events somewhere on earth there exist evil that some conscienceless people indulge in perpetrating inhumane acts against the innocent human beingswe know the historical facts on the atrocious likes of the cia israelmossad spanish conquest of the americas torquemadainquisition josef stalin idi amin dada saddam hussein prerevolutionary iran savak and wwiiera japanese imperial military that utilize torture rape  murder to the extreme only that such people actually pay the lucrative price for the opportunity to commit torture and murder of innocent human victimsif that is true it is a commentary on the inhumanity of humankind that under the circumstance of absent conscience psychological  mental and law even the meek  timid would be given the freedom to do what one wish would do to another human victim perhaps in revenge for the perpetrators personal failures in life attributed to societal and academic rejection or just partake in the endorphin rush of killing a victim to feel the surge of pleasure in the organic function of the perpetrators brain theoretically this is common with serial killers who keep doing it for the rushserves as the exposition of this evil that the audience have not been aware of and here belies the real horror that even the thought of someone paying the underground business to become personally involved in the pleasure of indulging the grisly homicide of a wrongfully imprisoned victim without interference is revolting to the nth degreeyet this underground criminality seems like a nobrainer to make the illgotten profits arising from utter amorality on the dual side of business runners who abduct to imprison and clients who can afford the price of executing victims for the fun of it just as the postwwii united states foreign policy dictates profit and power above liberty and respect for human life especially the current situation in the middle east and central asia nothing is sacred and out of bounds it seems especially when it comes to maiming and killing average humans for convenience and profiteering sanctioned and afforded by the elitethe infamous french novelist playwright  philosopher of nihilism the marquis de sade had it right in perspective when he wrote on the natural impulse of barbaric cruelty to satisfy the inherently maladjusted human psychology free of the confines of law and conduct never lose sight of the fact that all human felicity lies in mans imagination and that he cannot think to attain it unless he heeds all his caprices the most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to satisfy his vagaries so that concludes my minithesis on the films main pointbesides the point laid out above the film isnt scary in the remotest i am very jaded and was not pleased with the films nauseating wave of gory violence and nonstop fbombs that dilutes the tension of living the horror of the dingy dungeon imagined from the terrified victims perspective i liked the revenge exacted in the end because it justifies doing inhumane act to truly inhumane monsters who walk freely in broad daylight after concluding their amusements of depravitythats exactly what i would do to one another who is proved beyond reasonable doubt that have committed unspeakable acts and which i would do equally horrible things to in order to avenge the victims 12 out of four,cruel
i have never given a film a 1 before and always wondered why people do so i once noticed for example that an awful lot of people gave magnolia a 1 and i thought why why would anyone give a film that makes you think a 1 why would you give a film with beautiful cinematography a 1 why would you give a film with great acting a 1 even if you dont like a film doesnt mean it is necessarily bad and deserves a 1 a 1 should be reserved for when a film meets none of the criteria that we might attribute to a half decent film moreover the criteria that makes a generic film a worthwhile part of the canon it seeks company withinmanaged this complete lack worthiness it was neither scary suspenseful well acted well shot well plotted it did not supply any pathos who cared about these stupid wnkers anyway nor did it bother to even disgust the gore was as pitiful as the acting and direction it did have some great tit action but as im not a teenager im not really going to let that sway me this film gets a 1 it was crap crap crap b movies must charm or sleaze their way into your heart this just lay around farting,cruel
i finally watched this last night my flat mate was desperate to watch it so he rented it  and i was intrigued to see what this was really all about as i had heard so much  well it was poor and that is being kind it just featured lots of gore well that isnt horror is it its just somebody getting their kicks to my mind probably in all reality unfortunately there are places like this in the world as we have sickos like the one portrayed in this movie to sum up this movie had no plot no suspense no seat clutching tight tense moments in fact to my mind it was just a poor sick comedy as the whole scene involving the american who escaped showed if you seen it you know what i am talking about it was ridiculous a horror is a film along the lines of alien thats a horror and a bloody great one as well this isnt its a parable for teenage boys,cruel
it is certainly possible to see why some people were put off by the titsnarse quotient a the start of this film subsequently writing it off as another stupid american horror clich however i can honestly say that the first half or more of the movie was superbly bland thus making it all the more realistic when confusion sets into the backpackers when people start to disappear the sex drugs and clubbing might be a caricature of peoples travelling lives but believe me it is certainly accurate in describing somewhat makes this film truly great is that it doesnt resort to ridiculous plot twists or any other particularly obvious horror stupidity to draw the audience in it simply wends its way along with the path of events gradually becoming clearer in a quite natural way there were very few elements of the whole thing that i thought were just movie rubbish that could not possibly happenbig spoilersthis counts double for the central tenet  rich sadists paying to torture and kill people any way that they please you can say that this is not likely to happen in the world but you probably would not say that it isnt possible this is horror at its base  trying to find the common denominator of fear lurking in the backs of our minds torture must be high on the list for most people but this isnt the middle ages any more suddenly we have a realistic enough premise to bring these fears back into focus and what is worse the protagonists are simply normal paying customers  not drooling cartoonish shadowy evils when you see the japanese girl having her eye blowtorched and the matter of fact way that the american goes about it you finally realise that the film makers have touched on true horror  that which is inside the minds of everyday people given ventbest film i have seen for a long time  one that is brilliant for its simplicity,cruel
having been a movie buff for many many years going to video shops long before blockbuster came along i never thought i would see a more gut wrenching movie than madman the burning i spit on your grave last house on the left scanners pure horror at its best this was until i saw fantastically well made movie that has everything from comedy sex violence and above all the imagination of a truly great writerdirector excellent movie not for the faint hearted even when someone has told you about the film in detail this still does not prepare you for what you are about to see its not the fact that you see every gory detail its left to your imagination on most of the scenes but having seen the gory films of yesteryear this is truly a magnificent piece of art which only makes me wait in anticipation for the next instalment tarrantinoroth a remarkable combination may the pair of you continue making films like you do for many years to come,cruel
for the most depraved movie of 2005 category at an awards ceremony would hands down be a winnernow obviously the whole shock value of the movie is what the director eli roth was going for and he did it well the acting was good if not great and there were times that you believe the actors are in pain as in some scenes where the actors was physically sick i actually felt a little queasy inside there are some movies which just shouldnt be made and left in script form only and would definitely be one of them the amount of gore in the film was surprisingly less that what i was initially expecting and while the last hour of the film is definitely fast paced there are some breather moments where the gore is out and just more thrilling action is inthe sad fact of the matter is that there are most likely countries or people out there who would love to pay to murder another human being in countries where life is cheap then this movie makes it out to be easier to do than buying a loaf of breadthe whole time i was watching this movie i kept thinking turn it off turn the movie off but for some reason i could not turn away and credit to the movie crew for doing that i like a horror movie as much as the next guy but there are just some lines that shouldnt be crossed wolf creek brilliant movie but crossed a line as did beware of attractive foreign woman who want to sleep with you is one of the messages i got from this film the drug happy chicks in this film are a scary bunch as are the killers themselves as a previous comment mentioned the amount of sex and nudity in the film i will have to agree that it was a little overdone although many european countries do talk freely about sex and are quite happy to walk around nakedif you have any shred of human decency left you will not watch this film,cruel
a first glance at made me remember the first time i saw saw a bloody gory thoughtprovoking weirdo mess that was just entertaining on the same hand just maybe a different fingeraccomplishes the same thing except this movie made it feel real who the hell cares where they were but we do know it was somewhere in europe which is foreign which is automatically creepy europe is supposed to be cozy and warm and the first 40 minutes demonstrate the friendliness but when people start to get hostile things turn bad i wont spoil anything but i do want to say that jay hernandazs acting was impressive eli roth is also a very underrated director and both of these men prove their surprising brilliance through one sceneof the many especially in the second half that amazing bit where paxton is tied to his chair scrambling screaming and throwing himself about until he hears the chainsaw and stops slowly grabbing the chairsupport bar as it gets closer and closer brilliant director great acting excellent ending all in all its definitely worth a watch and what a watch it is,cruel
wow thats the first word that comes to mind after viewing this movie what really caught me by surprise is the fact that it only received a 58 on the imdb rating system how can a movie like this get such a low rating with over 16000 votes at thatthis is one of the goriest movies ive ever seen in my entire life if you think that the final destination trilogy or saw 1 and 2 were gory then you need to check this movie out it makes those movies look like sesame street on a good dayits about what youd expect except the movie is by all means nonpredictable when it first started out i figured that it was going to follow the same boring formula boy was i ever wrong i was in for a wild ride the entire time ive got a strong stomach and many times during this movie even i had to close my eyes it was that intenseso dont listen to the naysayers and check this one out today it was that wild intense gory thrilling and horrifying i absolutely loved this movie i have a feeling you will as well,cruel
so ive just spent the evening watching this film a few mates recommended it to me and i can guarantee you from now i wont listen to them again the cast is weak the storyline marginal the horror predictable and the duration to shortit takes just on 1hr to get to the crust of the story within 30 mins its over and your pulling the dvd out of the machine i was looking at the end thinking is that it where is the rest then i realised that it was indeed the ending i cant understand how tarantino got involved with this weak film im even more bewildered that lionsgate is involved in it also id not pay money to see this its totally lame best part was the half decent looking european girls,cruel
not really a bad film in its own right i was expecting twists turns and fantastic story telling however got predictable story  clich american hero with lots of blood and slashing this may be because its based on true events leaving less room for writing a story  which is fair enough but as a horror film in its own right it leaves much to be desired in summary its a teenage kid gets slashed up film not a suspension creepy psychological film if your looking for blood and visually unpleasant scenes your going to enjoy it as the film it is however if like me your into great story and twists  turns id give this film a miss,cruel
this movie is just another one of those movies what i mean by that is the stupid teen comedies where boys are craving for boobs and sex is just about the same of eurotrip except it has horror in it the horror i see in this movie is nothing there is basically no plot to it at all i mean we dont even give a sh if the guys die because you seriously know nothing about it besides their sex cravings the first entire half was this one word sex sex and more sex actually make that boobs this is more like a porn movie instead come on oli is ing some broad in her ass in a club then some sex house in amsterdam or whatever its either eli roth is just a retard whos obsessed with sex and has nothing better to do or hes too stupid to direct any movie at all shockingly even cabin fever was much better than thisnow i cant blame everything in this movie the setting and props were amazing and very eyecatching rusted chairs and torture instruments were set out pretty good all that vomit gave you an extra touch of disgust what disgusted me was when joshs ankle was cut off in order for him to escape it showed really good detail and realism one last thing that amazed me only for a few seconds was the suicide of kana the expressions after seeing her gruesome face showed how much sorrow she feltthe thing is there was nothing in this movie that made your mouths open wide and leave with shock just obvious conclusions and a thought of this was a piece of sh i best off say dont rent this movie especially if you dont like torture and violence the torture wasnt that heavy but if you havent noticed all of it was basically shown on yahoo if you have high expectations for this movie like i did beforehand then watch it just be prepared to see lots of boobs and moaning and yes lots of rust and blood too,cruel
i rented this movie and hoped for buckets upon buckets of blood and meaty chunks what i got was a mix of softcore porn and a faces of death tape both are good on their own but turns into one godawful soupthis is where the massive spoilers start i will ruin the whole crappy movie ok the beginning of the movie is eurotrip with out the cheap laughs three friends are backpacking through amsterdam in the pursuit of pot and girls after just enough breasts to weird out your mother the three buddies are tipped off by a amsterdam pimp about the wonderful girls of a small country at this point of the movie i actually realized i was tired of looking at boobs they take a train and get to personal with a businessman again eurotrip sans comedy they arrive at the and hookup with some girls that slip them some pills can you guess who gets screwed in this deal ok lets just skip to the gore remember that businessman he is owns a murderformoney business or as i call it pay n slay forget about the other two and focus on paxton and his astonishing ability to halt massive blood loss he gets a few fingers chain sawed of before the customer slips on the blood and chainsaws him self eventually paxton find a change of clothes and somehow the massive blood loss cost by loosing fingers is stopped from this point on i was begging for him to die from the blood loss he is about to escape but has to rescue some asian girl who gets her eye removed via blowtorch they escape in a car chase but before getting on a train she jumps in front of is while on the train paxman hear the businessman he follows him into a bathroom and cuts of his fingers and drowns him in a toilet the end end of spoilers and crappy movieso in the endresult this is just a horny bloody overhyped journey into boobs and blood in that order if you have to see it please just rent it,cruel
is tarantino broke or has he become greedy beyond reason giving his name and his name solely for this disgusting piece of hooey and i dont mean disgusting as in shocking splatter and gore  i mean disgustingly bad and cheapthe first half has you thinking slow buildup get over it in time well get there but just when the story finally should start  it gets real bad the second half redefines the term predictable every move or minute  you see it coming half an hour before except maybe the end because there is none the story just  stops which is likely what you hoped for at this time so second thought by the time your intelligence has been utterly insulted even this kind of noneending is predictableironically the most realistic detail in this film would be that the average girl in bratislava been there several times is in fact a breathtaking beauty but then again they are quite crafty and they smell a dumb square 10 miles against the wind by accident got at least that part right ,cruel
the negative reviews really seemed to flow on this movie i think many people felt duped by the inclusion of quentin tarantinos name on this film i still have not figured his true affiliation with this movie it may have originally been a ploy to salt the trail and lead viewers  like keyword spamming on ebay  therefore critics are retaliating by overly harsh criticism this is an interesting movie well written and acted its a shocking ride if you are expecting reservoir dogs or pulp fiction why because somebody mentioned qts name forget it this is a different movie and certainly not trying to be like any other many people didnt seem to understand the soft porn galore but the movie takes place in amsterdam prostitutes really do advertise by dancing in glass windows along the street and absolutely anything goes its for real roth didnt invent this stuff hes bringing you in on the real deal we are in amsterdam folks it sets up the premise for the rest of the movie that money can get you whatever you desire and be careful what you wish for this is a raw potent and extreme film not for those afraid to be deeply shocked by things they probably have never imagined they could imagine what movies are for anyway,cruel
i love this movie the details are very cool and jay hernandez is sooooooooooooo cute and hot i love the two girls that are part of the plan theyre very pretty and one of the girls names is natalya thats my name even though you spell it differently natalia love the end the guy deserved it i wonder if theres going to be a 2nd one and if there is jay hernandez better be in it and he better survive i recommend this movie to people who like saw or other movies that are related and if you like jay hernandez if you dont like movies that have gore or if you dont like jay hernandez then dont watch this movie this is one of the best movies ever and thats why i give it a 10 out of 10 wooooooo go awesome movie make more with jay hernandez,cruel
i think quentin tarantino should not put his name on horror movies anymore he may have presented this film but it ruins his name to be attached to projects like this especially when you combine this film with the endorsement he gave wolf creek which almost everyone seems to have despisednow this film was presented as a gore film it was not a gore film there was gore but if you watch movies like saw and saw ii and expect this to be on the level youll be let down you might have heard a certain scene was intense but you were probably lied to because most of the violence seems so fake i dont know what dangling eyeballs look like or what its like to get run over by a car traveling five miles per hour but i dont think it looks like thisalso you might have been told its a film about a place where you pay to hurt people yes thats in this movie but only for about twenty minutes the first half hour time it on your watch if you doubt me is just a variety of sex scenes and naked women i like naked women but i have no idea what any of it had to do with making a horror filmit wasnt an entire waste the idea was decent and some of the characters were interesting the american client is cool the dutch businessman is creepy and theres a surprise cameo by takashi miike the director of several asian horror films which have been banned for excessive disgustingnessi guess you may as well see it if you wanted to but there are other films id recommend first saw ii and hills have eyes should be seen first,cruel
i just came back from watching the premiere in germany and am a little bit confused on what to think i went into the cinema with extremely high expectations having seen the wellchosen trailer i could not help but be amazed and excited about it i expected one very unique movie with extreme neverseen before perversity and gore what i saw then was still a very good movie with not as much pornography as i feared and as others have posted in here and some very good horror scenes what i didnt like was the shortness of the movie i think there could have been way more of the gore as it didnt seem cheap or forced into the film the perverse scenes rather seemed like a prefect fit for the movie but in my eyes eli roth didnt go as far as i hoped i really hoped i would get to see something that would make my blood get icecold and my teeth tremble in agony but just didnt cross enough lines still a very good movie out of a very good idea but more could have been done with it,cruel
writer and director eli roth has redeemed himself with i followed into the hype for his prior flick cabin fever and was absolutely disappointed by that awful movie i am happy to say that i enjoyed yes i will admit that takes awhile to get where it is going the best parts come about an hour and 5 minutes into the movie but it was a ride i had a lot of fun taking when the guy escapes the compound he is at in a car where all sorts of illegal medical operations take place and sees the people who sent him there he mows them down in such glorious fashion that it made me clap smile and laugh it was one of the best scenes in the movie when the gang of misfit kids beat the two bad guys to death is also a great scene i really cant wait to see what eli roth does with 2 i can only hope its as good as this if not better,cruel
the movie was exactly what i expected which is what you can tell from the cover of the movie and all the commercials i saw i had already seen cabin fever and eli roth has no shame in the movies he makes the movie is worth watching i love horror movies but i was so grossed out by certain parts of the movie and it was hard to watch people being so cruel to each other but never the less the movie was well done it scared the heck out of me and i think that was roths point and to entertain us jay hernandez did a great job and that was a main reason that i wanted to see the movie i think that most girls might not like this movie because it makes girls look pretty inappropriate and just another notch on the guys belts but i wasnt bothered by it and i myself am a girl,cruel
i loved the movie i thought that the graphics were wonderful and it was such a twist i am glad that some one thought up this movie wow i must say i defiantly recommend this movie to others unless you have a weak stomach then you may not want to watch it but it was fantastic i really like the eye ball part that was pretty sweet if only i could come up with an idea like that sick and twisted but yet you can not take yer eyes away and the surgeon wow that is true they do have your life in their hands i just would not want to come across this guy and the twist that it made wow two thumbs up,cruel
this movie is not for softies its a horror film and as such its intent is to horrify the viewers the movie succeeds in horrifying viewers by combining grim scenes with a sinister story about a eastern european towns involvement with a fictional club named elite huntingthe grim scenes involve humans being mutilated and maimed in the most awful manner at times this scenes were too much for me which means it succeeded in being horrifichowever the movies storyline is much more sinister than the scenes it involves a group named the elite hunting club whose purpose is to provide other humans with the capability to torture and kill other humans in any way they desire further the movie takes place in a in an impoverished town in slovakia where american tourists are the preythe movie is interesting and provocative a must see for most,cruel
this is such a good movieat first i didnt understand the movie but as i kept watching it i began to understand the movie i thought it had a great plot to hit the only thing i was a little sad about was derek and oli being killed so quick in the movie i think this movie is for teenagers and fans of scary movies i was also a little upset by the ending only cuz they made it out to be like their was going to be a sequel which would be cool if they did i liked all the death scenes in the movie and i loved all the blood and gorebut what i liked the most was the characters in the movie who was played by great actorsi would definitely recommend this movie to everyonei loved itkim3,cruel
thilling really sucks you in manyincluding me and my wife mistakenly thought it was a tarantino movie but he is just a producer in reality its the second big release from eli roth the director who did cabin fever as someone else said is a better movie than cabin fever in every way like cabin fever its pretty heavy on the realistic gory spfx horror fans will not be disappointed with this one but there is more to this movie than that crowd is usually looking forstarts out like a buddy movie with a few echoes of eurotrip the humour is incidental to the plot the jocular type you might expect given the situation roth went out of his way a bit to include a nod to peter jackson in a scene that involves an altercation with an angry elf roth had his share of crap from lotr fans walking out of his last movie many went to see it solely because cabin fever was praised by jackson at the height of the lotrs popularity this was the first taste of how skilled this director is at weaving layers of meaning into his moviesin fact the reminded me quite a lot of hitchcock movies the way it meanders while setting the stage for the nastiness to follow like hitch roth is skilled at building suspense rather than diving right into the madness like most horror flicks do and like most hitchcock films the can be enjoyed on many levels their is the top layer where neither disappoint in providing escapist entertainment and then theres all the deeper stuff that film buffs get off on one of hitchcocks standard layers was having characters who make morally wrong decisions and then end up being punished severely in a seemingly unrelated event think of janet leigh how did she end up at the bates motel well she stole some money from her boss and was on the lamb of course norman bates had no idea about this  he didnt even bother with her purse when he disposed of her and her belongings  but the director did this relationship plays itself out in several of his movies this relationship between loose morals and being punished in an unrelated way is a strong element of the there is a socialpolitical layer in the as well and it is believable the most believable element is that people in europe generally dont like american tourists the movie explores this reality in the extreme but there is something even deeper than this going on the film presents a view of where those who develop boredom with sex tourism could logically end up in an exaggerated way it shows how this industry destroys lives and communities in the slovakian town the buddies end up in war has provided a culture where people are not bothered by cruelty and human life has no value beyond what tourists are willing to pay for it on the one hand it has some tourists being victimized by the prostitutes in that the tourists become the commodity but as it is in the real world of sex tourism it is the uberrich some of whom get punished in the hitchcockian way tho who end up victimizing everyone to show how clear the directors vision is in this area there are two asian women tourists that are really the only ones who succumb to a tragic end without having done anything to deserve it i hope that people can get past the sensational gore and think about the larger issues this film explores damn fine movie with something for everyone over the age of 18 ,cruel
when i saw the previews to this movie i could not wait to see it i dont like to go to the theater to watch movies to many people ruin it for me so i waited for it to come out on video so i could watch at home i am glad i did not pay to see it in a theater it was really a big let down i did not find it scary at all let alone the scariest movie in a decade i found it dull and boring not worth buying not worth rent either but if you feel you must see it i recommend renting it after all the hype it is really a let down the acting was not bad it just was not scary it was not even all that gory i am glad the movie was not more than 94 minutes long,cruel
just seen this turkeynothing new completely lacking of atmosphere and tension despite the graphic violence which by the way is too much oldschool makeup artistry to have impact if it had been combined with computer graphics in a way similar to irreversible it could have at the end the movie totally looses focus and relies on way too many convenient solutions it is interesting that despite exteriors being shot on location it all seems sanitized and artificial maybe because the cinematography is toolooking for the proper wordrigid safe everything is overlit except for the dungeon which is too horrorstylized a more documentary approach would probably have been more effective as if it was being shot by one of the backpackers themselves and this makes millions at the boxoffice i guess there is something to be learned from that make a lackluster movie with some nudity and gore make money i have longed for horror movies to be scary and bloody again like in the 70s and 80s but i can live without this eli i think you can do better than this i hope your next movie has more substance and imagination plays it too safe by trying too hard to be controversial,cruel
skip it skip it skip it 20 mins into this film i knew it was going to be a simple minded attempt at storytelling of course i should have known when i read written  directed by eli roth in the opening credits cabin fever was the first of mr roth s writerdirector credits i saw and if i werent a 2nd chance kind of guy i would have stopped there after viewing roths i cant understand why someone still allows this man to write 3rd grade students write with more intellect please keep in mind this is just my opinion but for the love of god will someone stop eli roth from writing anything elseas for the film boobs alcohol blood and gore without any elements needed to tell a story like a plot are all you get do not try to make sense of it because you wont and youll just end up frustrated i guess we the moviegoer are only entertained by bare chests and some of the worst special effects i have ever seen i think we should find this film insulting as if we dont actually look for a good story with our bloodnguts hello saw saw was a damn good story take my advice and skip this garbage tarantino thought needed a budget to become a film horrible pointless movie,cruel
seemed almost pointless in the beginning and the transition from basically porn to the torture portion was abrupt and slightly awkward though it was gory especially the torch and kanas eye when finished i couldnt really determine any plot to the movie kinda like a snuff film without the sex if you still want gore but want a little plotline and character development to go along with it as well as a twist thats true to the horrorthriller genre definitely check out either of the saw films in my opinion much more fulfilling however if your ultimate goal is to simply to be disgusted and entertained then this movie is definitely for you,cruel
i am a huge fan of tarrantino his work has always been daring and different starting in amsterdam two young lads on a college break decide to travel europe they meet another traveller and whilst on a train journey they strike up a conversation with a seemingly normal man about a place in russia where you can have the woman of your dreams its a obviously they arrive and there are many nubile barely dressed young hotties to attend to their every whim and fantasy obviously men being men do not think to themselves hang on a minute somethings not quite right here they just get down and dirrrrrty there is quite a lot of sex shown in the beginning i felt this was necessary to the plot line as it showed how they could so easily be led by these harlots one of the group the extra traveller goes missing no need for too much alert as he is a traveller so one would assume he went off ermtravellingthen another leaving a very dishy young man whose name escapes me but the dark haired oneto try and find him anyway it turns out that one of the russian strumpets has set them all up she has been trafficking travellers to an abandoned warehouse where rich sick mo fos kill their prey in any way they like its gory but not over the top there is more gore seen on an episode of casualty and i feel again it was necessary to the plot as you really did feel what these poor blokes went through the only problem i had with the film was the ending our dark haired hero manages to escape but goes back in to save a young japanese girl who has her eye badly mutilated by a sick american thats not what i have the problem with he saves her risking his neck and when they are trying to sneak onto a train without the nasties seeing them she catches a glimpse of her eye socket and throws herself under a train a how vain  i would be made up that i was still alive and b how selfish  he risked his life what a waste of time anyway he gets away although its not sure he will and who does he happen to see on the train home yep thats right the nasty buggar who set them all up in the first place the dude on the train what a huge coincidence hah overall the film was well made well scripted and well performed by all the cast many of whom i had never seen in my film obsessed life there are a few drug taking momentscannabis and ectasy but it is not a major occurrence but again necessary to the plot they are in amsterdam  europe after allits takes place on a day to day basis recommended but dont let it fool you us european girls arent all that looseoh who am i kidding ha harating 710 thumbs up quentin,cruel
i dont understand why so many comments about nudity on this moviei dont believe that anyone will watch it for the sexuality and nudity there are more appropriate films in that subjectthe matter in fact is that 3 young students were travelling in europe looking for fun and sexmost time is spent showing how they are living the experience so we wouldnt expect something elseok plot could be better and first half could be better edited even some horror scenes could be better the eye part is stupidbut the story is realistic there is no bad villain sick serial killer or a freddy kruegers like characterpeople that are used to standard horror films will obviously get boredwe are living the characters experience and then we are trapped in a business of violence and horror along with thembut the film is effective and most people probably leave the room thinking about it wowit could be real ,cruel
this is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life the advertisements could not possibly have been more absurd especially concerning the content of this movie was one of the most unscary and even boring movies ive ever seen the first hour literally nothing happens and then you see a few emotionless torture scenes where they dont even show most of the gore and finally the movie ends putting you out of your mystery the plot has a twist which is completely boring and ridiculous avoid this movie if i wanted to see something scary id watch anything with hilary duff or larry the cable guy because it is terrifying that people pay them to act,cruel
i was drawn to this film with low expectations as i have been for the last several years with horror understanding that this was to be a shock and gore fest and not a revolutionary new horror film i was not disappointed honestly i was delightfully surprised some felt that it took all the old clichs and ruined them i think theyve forgotten that these old clichs of teenagers backpacking through the us europe australia or where ever these groups of people traveling and running into some type of horrific terror has the most probable suspension of disbelief that is to say could this actually happen with thats a resounding yes this is something that really and actually happen whereas some movies end and the viewer says to themselves yeah right that isnt even possible can leave one asking what they might don in this same situation i felt that all of the t  a added to the story and im all in favor of any movie with that much t  ato simplify when it comes to horror ask yourself next time you watch a horror movie could this really happen and if your answer is yes then you know the movie scored,cruel
i dont think that the movie is worth seeing because it is supper gory violence and i dont recommend it at all for people who hate violent movies this movie is worse then scream 1 2 and 3 i would say that is wasnt one of the good movies that was made in 2005 it is a torture land movie because people get locked up and killed for no reason by crazy people the should of made it more like scream with out all of the knifes chain shaws and other items for hurting people they should only have torched them and not have killed them you shouldnt trust s that you dont know much information about because they can turn out to be bad in the end and you might not make it out of them,cruel
i not only found creepy but truly frightening just the idea of falling asleep in your bed to awake in a place that isnt your room and seeing a table covered in instruments that have been and will be used for god knows what i think what made so frightening was that story wasnt so incredible as to not be believable im sure a place like this exists somewhere and the screaming just hearing those people scream and cry and plead for their lives was enough to make me want to vomit i think that anyone who thought this was stupid and lame should remove themselves from the human populationps i love you eli roth will you marry me ,cruel
the film is not a profound study of the effects of torture on human beings its not a sharp insight into hidden recesses of the human psyche its not a fascinating portrait of americans abroad its not even an entertaining horror movie its a snuff movie and its not just the gore that had me reaching for the proverbial sickbagalthough the acting is generally very realistic esp derek richardson and jan vlasak it works against the film on the one hand to go for verisimilitude with the actors performances and on the other to go for laughs with slapstick eg the german guy with the chainsaw doesnt balance well at all at the cinema people were laughing because they felt they had to in a vain attempt to alleviate their feelings of revulsion and awkwardnessthe denouement is terribly contrived and the desultory nature of the films narrative wouldve been given far greater credence had it all been some drunken dreamturnednightmare and the fact that such an uninspired twist would salvage the film speaks volumesnot only was this film bad in the sense that it made me want to vomit it was also deeply immoral i can forgive a violent film or book if there is some underlying morality i think directors have to be very careful when dealing with a theme as dark as torture if youre going for pure entertainment then you dont want realistic performances and if youre going for morality profound hidden messages etc then pass on the puerile jokesthe worst film i have ever seen at the cinema avoid,cruel
what you see in the screen when concerning eli roths newest project is okay although not excellent this movie like any other has its ups and downs the ride was dark curious and definitely entertaining and it displayed a nihilistic view through not entirely unsympathetic characters while watching it especially after the first admittedly fun half hour i found myself thinking it quirky but not exactly a masterpieceit was once the movie was over though that i got to think and it was thinking about the premise about the truly dark sinister and yet perfectly realistic theme about the subtext which maybe i didnt catch the first look through but which definitely was present when viewing it later and you might not want to see it but once you have a deep thought on it this gory at times comedic film becomes something entirely different  and by all means effective  which haunted me days after i realized soif youre willing to give this movie a second thought and actually glance at its true motives it becomes terrifying the classic formula of sex and gore really disguises the dark message but its there  and its true very very truerelating to the plot this times excuse moves on as we follow three colourful happy characters who present a clear and radical contrast with the flicks dark setup this movie tricks and truly plays with the viewer by making them believe exactly the opposite of what truly is going on as our joyful enthusiastic heroes meet abrupt ends at the hands of antagonists who are gruesomely mentally perturbed and yet extremely realisticthrough the first half hour the characters are introduced as basic stereotypes but while one of them doesnt live enough to be properly developed you do get to feel for them as they crave escaping from their torturers at one point one character one i was particularly empathic with is given a predictably false chance to escape but the short sequence where he crawls for the exit of the room where hes being held captive is so intense you can practically feel the fake pain a friend i went to the cinema with started whimpering at this point eyes shut as the character met a particularly grisly endits true maybe that this movie takes its time to get to the real meat and potatoes but nothing and by that i mean literally nothing happens without a plausible and unquestionable explanation  and reason  to back it up later in the movieso im all for people giving this little movie a chance is twisty disturbing and freaky  you have to give it that,cruel
well well well what a swindle when i say its the worst movie ive seen in a theater i mean its the worst and its the worst because i have really great expectations about this movie promo photos trailer tarantinos production as i have heard later he didnt watch the movie before giving roth the money and so on i expected to find some kind of saw like crazy gore situations stress and things like that and what i have found some kind of eurotrips bad remake with a gore conclusion it wasnt the movie i paid for i felt really disappointed my girlfriend too and i hope no more people watch this awful movie and mr eli roth in europe we have cars made after the 60s you know and in slovakia they have men not like you have said they died in war what war please do me a favor dont watch this movieregards from spain,cruel
when i see movies like it makes me sad for the state of the socalled horror genre these days is far from the most terrifying movie of the last 10 years as it has been billed all it actually is is the two things that get young males going  nudity for the first 50 minutes of the film and the pointless violence for the last 40the fact that this film even got made speaks volumes about lions gate studios the film does not even get properly started for about 50 minutes the majority of which plays like a bad softcore porn flick after that we get to the of the title the only problem is that the characters are so poorly developed and frankly unlikable that you dont really care about what is happening to themthe second half of the film is just a mass of gratuitous human torture scenes with absolutely no point in any of it the violent street children seem like a pointless exercise in trying to comment on the situation of the world today and it failsin fact everything about this movie fails spectacularly its not erotic its not scary it doesnt have anything intelligent to say about the world contrary to what other people have tried to claim overall i would seriously suggest you avoid this video nasty i would rate it at less than 1 star but the site wont let me,cruel
i went to see this film with a couple of friends yesterday and i have to say i didnt really liked it in fact i cant understand how people could like it first of all this film creates a very wrong image of europe and europeans the storyline is simplistic and the only thing that isnt predictable is how disgusting the next scene is going to be it is also very unrealistic many aspects just dont make sense you wont run back into a horrible place after you escaped from it just because someone is screaming would you except for jan vlask the acting was awfully weak especially by the two amererican lead actors although they only have to be high or run around screaming i think director eli roth isnt really talented because the only thing he is able of is creating a claustrophobic atmosphere during the torture scenes but i have to say that nathan barr his soundtrack was pretty good and the film does show the darker side of the human being but they could have done that with some good dialog and a little bit of gore and not the other way around because now they kinda lost their believability i only recommend this film to people who enjoy excessive gore and really dont care about an intelligent story,cruel
three young backpackers eager for sexual encounters in europe are guided to a near bratislava unfortunately the turns out to be a collection point for elite hunting a club for well to do psychopaths who pay substantial amounts of money to realise their fantasies on hapless individuals using a variety of surgical building and other industrial toolsamongst other implements our friends are subjected to the business ends of a cordless drill bolt cutters scalpel scissors chain saw nasty spiky thingsall of which leads to a profusion of severed limbs blood and other body fluids it has to be said that scenes in which this takes place are mercifully short and darkwhile the film scores highly in terms of gratuitousness it does not not really have any moral or humanitarian theme and as such lacks character there are also some directorial nonsequitors nevertheless it is quite engaging and will provide anyone who enjoys seeing likable characters being sliced and diced after getting their oats with an entertaining 90 minutes,cruel
this film if you can call it thatwas the worst i have ever seen not in a shocking or gory way it wasnt bad in a disturbing way it just sucked and not in a good way the script was terrible the acting was so bad i took out my voodoo dolls and started jabbing them furiously with toothpicks there was no story to this film three guys try to have fun for about 50 minutes of a film which seemed to go on forever then they start to die thank god any longer and i really think i would have bludgeoned myself to death on various kitchen appliances the toaster was my number 1 choice some of the torture sequences are ok but they cannot make up for the first hour if you are looking for a gruesome horror movie dont watch this if you are looking for a film that will thrill and excite dont watch this in fact just dont watch this i was really disappointed with this movie can ya tell,cruel
this film can only be described as crap granted some three to four times there are greatlooking women more or less naked on screen for a couple of seconds but take my word for it the remaining 90 minutes are crapnotalent actors a script a twelve year old boy who has watched an episode of csi probably easily could do better and a writer  director that seriously should consider a career change roth if you should be reading this stop making movies all though i am grossed out trying to imagine what you had to do to get the funding for making this movie as it clearly was not due to talent please have pity on moviegoersi did not know anything about the movie but the gentleman selling me the tickets said it was good it was not for the first time since watching league of extraordinary gentlemen i was tempted to leave the movie long before ending you do not need to go through what i went through the movie is not scary funny clever well acted fast nothing the movie is crap my god,cruel
lets see this movie has no suspense the story is bad the performances are amateurs and laughable the movie plays like a saw wannabe in some parts the message there is a message but its obvious that its delivery was the lesser of the intentions for the filmmakers as it is hinted it does not justify the movie so what are we left with well of course with the visual impact the thing that this movie is getting famous for but since we are so concentrated in that we expect a lot from that and guess what the gore is handled with so little style and impact leaving well evident the intention of the filmmakers of producing shock that it doesnt work either it would have helped a little that the actors playing the victims could act more convincing during the torture scenes but their performances are so laughable that we lose any sympathy for them and just wish for the torturer to finish them right away its ironic that this movie is in some way related to quentin tarantino since he has made graphic violence and gore something with style in his movies but thats exactly what we miss here in the hands of another director it may have been a better product as it is its a very good moviefor the 15 year old crowd all of the sudden saw i and ii seem to be masterpieces ,cruel
worst movie ever if they let me swear in this review the whole thing would be the f word a waste of my time you had to wait forever to get to the gore and there were only a couple of parts that were ok it wasnt even scary and whats with those kids it was just stupid bubblegum holy swear word was it supposed to be funny i mean when the asian girl was looking at her burnt face before jumping in front of the train i was laughing cause it looked so gad damn stupid there was no plot no character development no acting and nothing that makes sense this movie is retarded period eli roth should be shot or at least caged up so he cant write any more terrible movie scripts im disappointed in quintin i thought he would make a good movie but i guess the story was just too bad i was looking forward to seeing this movie forever and now i want to go back in time before i watched it and take a dump on the dvd and burn it with a blowtorch and cut it with a chainsaw and flush it down the toilet please im begging u do not see this movie even if u like gore its not worth it you will be gouging your own eyes out before it gets good well it doesnt get good the only good part is when it is over,cruel
i went into watching with the hope that it will be something that will stick with me like films such as stagefright aquarius or suspira it was close but sadly not close enoughthe opening scene is the one part of the movie that to me sticks out the simplicity and subtle brutality of the lone figure cleaning one of many it turns out of the torture rooms whilst whistling nonchalantly is a vivid and unsettling opening to a movie the whistle while you work subtext within the scene is also very cleverfrom there the film takes the viewer on varying journeys from drugfuelled sexathons in amsterdam to a well deserving revenge in a railway toilet via undeniably horrific scenes of tortureall in all i was impressed with the film as a whole but was left with the feeling that it could of been so much moreon a final note was it me or does that eye makeup on the japenese girl look just like the make up used in the horrorcomedy april fools day maybe just me hey thanks for readingmatt,cruel
it must have been a curiosity  related to my slovakian motherland which prompted me to screen in cinema after slovakia  the country in the heart of europe popped up in previews and reviewsthe horror seemed to be executed quite well when considering a fragmented structure and explicit violence courtesy of ms encarta  are the hallmarks of the master director quentin tarantino i dont think the movies can be branded an a movie or place itself among top 10 though although the storyline is that of credible real life situation with exception of upbeat actionheroupforjustice style ending it is the amount of violence and gore which all of a sudden bursts out in 2nd half of the movie the very shocking  sickly images that drove away a few fellow cinemagoerswhile is not for the fainthearted people who liked wrong turn saw or creep and similarly creepy flicks packed with human butchery will surely find it quite enjoyable paradox as it is consider yourself lucky to find this sort of savagery confined only to silverscreen aimed to amuse in a weird way unlike real life victims eg somewhere in bagdad where psychopaths roam freele without inhibitionsand perhaps this might be a reminder for young travellers if something looks too good to be true it most probably is feel safe to visit slovakia or czech republic  i insist on these places to be as safe and civilised nowadays as spain britain or us few distortions in the local character can be found featured pop music originates in before year of 1990 and based on this fact you would be hard pressed to find such relic 50s style tv sets even in early 80s czechoslovakia uniforms with the slovak signs which the police force flashed several times appeared for the 1st time aftermath 1993 but that would mean not such communist models of cars only like those depicted in the movie my judgement clearly says that the location for the train scenes and storyline in slovakia movie itself was solely shot in czech republic even though the countries shared common past and places may look alikewell this movie might be a refreshing addition to your horror collection once youve waited long or rather short enough to buy it cheaply in sales,cruel
eli roth was the master who brought us the neat little shocker cabin fever which was a pretty gruesome piece of work now he has donned the role as director in quentin tarrantinos torture shocker which completely over goes the limit of how far a hardcore horror audience will go this sick little shocker relies on its main cast and its low budget but believe me this is far more believable than your average jmovie ghost stories and arguably more scary for example the story is pretty simple 3 guys looking for booze sexand wellbooze and sex stumbles upon a seemingly superb andyou know the restroth was clearly feeling peckish with limbs flying about like a tennis tournament and scenes to curl even the straightest hair an eye for an eye i must say as a women is literally ripped apart okay then i found this movie pretty shocking and couldnt believe the reaction from others in the cinema wowgoshaaaarrrrgggghhhh unbelivebly gory but this really is hardcore haven and compared to such horror trash as the fog remake this is the granddaddy of all horror movies,cruel
this film seemed to drag on and on until it got to the point of the film about 23 of the way through wasnt anything special just seemed to go for the shock factor over plotstoryline which was disappointing considering tarrantino is associated with the film this film has one memorable scene which wont spoil for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but thats just about it theres nothing in the filmplot which makes you the audience think or try to work out whats going on and why it was pretty predictable as to what was going to happen next and a fairly predictable ending personally i think saw is a far superior film of this genre by far,cruel
i went into this film not knowing anything about it other than that it was a horror filmand believe me the feeling of not knowing what the hell the film genre is increased as the minutes passed by  rather slowly toothe film starts off with 3 guys that are randomly in amsterdam going to whore houses to weed cafs etc etc etc nothing sinister about it other than the awful examples of cosmetic surgery on girls that probably used to write mr in front of their names anyway they get a tip off from some shifty looking guy to go to slovakia by this point youre thinking  i swear they said this was meant to be a horror filmon the train going towards slovakia they meet in a rather clich manner the baddie of the film and you get given a piece of information that is completely useless up until when the 2nd guy gets killed  ie nearly towards the end of the film they get to a happy happy where everyone is happily still taking drugs and still even more happily having clich sex with random eastern europeans the sex fest carries on then one of the guys goes missing then another goes missing but roth put a special little twist on this one it looked like he was going to get away due to a change of heart of the baddie but it turns out his feet had been half cut off well theres a surprise and a half  yawns loudly and then surprise surprise our hero appears saved only by getting locked in a stock cupboard where the hell is the superman cape when you need one he tries to find his friends at the where theres a tiny little spin  one of the only half clever things about this film and then finds them in an alleged  art show he gets taken to by one of the evil slut girls  this is apparently the twist in the story and finds himself being subjected to the same torture his friends were subjected to he gets away because get this the butcher guy slips on paxs blood slips and gets sawn to bits by a chainsaw then he gets away using what looks no more powerful than a golf cart kills the shifty guy and the two girls rescues another girl and blah blah blahoh and then he gets his own back on the baddie because he just so happened to be on the same train as him contradiction he despises the actions of the bad guy  and he said previously that hed let girl die which haunted him for ages yet he does the exact same thing to him fair play but a bit more originality was needed i gave this film a 410 basically because the potential was there but it was very badly executed because a the plot line was extremely confusing with not enough emphasis on the real storyline  who cares about people getting stoned and the red light district to see a true glimpse of it look no further than your own town b the start took up most of the film so nothing was developed thereafter c the only slight sympathy was towards the knight in shining armour and that was due to his character development that lasted roughly 30 secondsd the way that roth and tarantino made all the little subtle clues link together to what really happened to the group of friends was good it just wasnt well developed and quite unrealistic in the way that he found exactly where they were just by talking to the two girls who were miraculously traceableand this film is one of the reasons why box offices are generally not doing well,cruel
wow so many adjectives could help describe this film but that would only be scratching the surface as eli sophomore effort is a story littered with multifaceted themes that allows the film to literally jump out of the screen and break away from the conventions of horror movie recently i have acquired a taste for horror films mainly the ones that attempt to try something new actually its fair to say not so much horror but the inventively titled horror porn a la saw is definitely a step in the right direction for two reasons this is the kind of contemporary horror that captures audiences attention especially when they are so thirsty for the sawlike films and it allows us to see that eli roth is certainly an inventive and a wickedly evil person albeit in a funny waythe story of american backpackers paxton and josh both played well by jay hernandez and derek richardson respectively who whilst travelling across continental europe meet oli played superbly by newcomer eythor gudjonsson  possibly the most likable screen character in recent horror history together the three travel to amsterdam where they are told about a place just outside bratislava in slovakia where the town which has been left sparsely populated by an array of gorgeous women who have been left alone without husbands after they left for war the apparent sociohistorical ignorance of the horny trio leads them to this town immediately we are plunged into a surreal world postcard picturesque buildings friendly contrasted by tortury museum surely foreshadowing events to come and grimy underground nightclubs wrapped in drugs and sex with willing women its too good to be true and obviously it is one by one our trio is reduced to just paxton the overall protagonist who goes searching for his friends who outofcharacter just pick up and leave when paxton eventually finds and stumbles onto the main plot conceit of torturing for fun and pleasure with the aid of human trafficking we are abruptly plunged into something far more sinister and this is where the film really picks up and has you knee jerking for the remainder of the film praying for no more gory torturesthis is the main storyline yet as i said the themes that play throughout can be lost due to the huge controversy surrounding the film of just plain gratuitous violence for the sake of art lets get one thing straight here yes there is violence but its not as much as the trailer would have you believe and yes it is integral to the story and leaves a poignant and chilling mark with the audience the most intricate themes that i picked up on were the idea of basic human desire our primal instinct on the torturers side being the alpha male dominating and making a mark by hurting the opponent and the poor captives who are reduced to our most weakest human characteristics pitiful whimpering lost innocent and naive these themes bring out one argument we are all as low as each other as the basic human desire the primal instinct of survival is imprinted on everyone just witness paxtons retaliation to notice his loss of innocence and eruption of sub human violence another theme and one that was portrayed the best in my opinion was the idea of horrorporn or erotic violence the belief that our very own base curiosity as humans and subconscious thirst to witness violence which is enacted by the torturers who are representations of the audience as we have now become viewers more importantly the idea that we are enclosed in the cinema there is no other thing to look at but at the screen we feel compelled to look at the most squeamish scenes because it is curiously interesting and possibly erotic as our adrenaline rushes it is a voyeuristic mechanism that roth employs to full effect and is what makes the film so goodthe film is a twisted piece of imaginative thinking elaborated to the worst extremes whilst the torture scenes are not long they are extremely intense and are a test of nerves on the audiences part especially after roth and his clever writing pitches us an almost tarantinoesquire introduction we are allowed to interact with these characters we enjoy paxtons jock pretty boy charms olis dirty yet good natured quality and joshs naivety yet there is somewhere deep beneath our gut feeling that we should not invest too much love in these people as something very bad is going to happen this is where the film packs a punch because as soon as we settle and accept these characters bam gone we are embroiled in a seriously twisted film if any comparisons are invited i would say its pulp fiction redux the drug addled directors cut  we are talking im gonna get medieval on yo ass stretched to its utmost possibility and there is a huge sigh of relief when the film is over we suddenly feel that slovakia is just too close for our liking and regardless of any critical bashing as gratuitous nudity and drug references they seem to forget this is about human desire the vices that we all desire yet when you have the opportunity there is a divide the social divide how far will your thirst take you the ultimate rush it would seem is killing and this is why roth is giving us the respect as an audience we full well know the dirty side of life and this is just a segment regardless of what people will think roth had managed to get people talking about all sorts of ideasthe kind of cerebral film that not only is a sign that audiences are much smarter than any blockbuster film will give them credit for and that is a sign of a good film1010,cruel
despite whatever criticism cabin fever received i personally thought that it was a decent horror film with suitable amounts of gore and a general unpleasant atmosphere hanging in the air it was one of the best horror films i have seen this is saying something as i generally find them boring clichd and not scary im not saying cabin fever was particularly scary as such but rather that it creates a very unsettling atmosphere and builds on it to create a panic stricken adventure in the middle of nowherenow is quite a different beast while starting to me at least in quite a similar fashion to cabin fever with a bunch of loudmouthed stoner friends and fratpack humour it divulges into a far more perplexing film it is hard to say much about the film without spoiling it but ill try my bestfirst note that this is not as the posters claim  the most vicious brutal bloody film ever or whatever because that implies that it is some kind of all out gore fest no that is not in fact i felt that the use of violence was quite reservedok well there is quite a lot of blood here and there but the films success is rather on the disturbing nature of what the film transgresses to from the trailer you should have gathered the focal point of the film a place where people are allowed to torture other people the torture scenes are quite disturbing as one must consider why the hell anyone would actually pay to do this the way the place is shot is very unsettling with stark use of light and grimy deshevled surroundings although this place is not actually introduced right at the start roth instead builds up his characters so the film is not quite what one might expectoverall a strange film but a successful one it is quite uncompromising however and definitely not for the weak hearted or easily offended,cruel
i absolutely hated this movie the trailers for it were probably the only good thing about it they definitely made me want to see it however it was incredibly disappointing when i didit was extremely slow to start with and the acting was mediocre i felt for the first 30 minutes that i was watching a softcore porn movie and this was not what i went to the cinema to watch when it finally got down to the bit that people were waiting for that was when the whole experience turned sour for me there is nothing new gore wise but some of the things portrayed in it are absolutely sickening i personally was disgusted and wondered why i had even bothered coming to see this even though i knew about and was expecting scenes of torture for me it was a step to far and i found myself wondering if there are actually people out there who want to do this to people and that is what sickens me mostso basically if you want to see a cross between eurotrip and saw and you want to be sickened then sure this movie is for youi wanted to get up and leave many times during this movie and i dont doubt that i was alone in thinking thisit is awful my advice is dont see it dont waste your time or money,cruel
brutal stuff and i use that in the most negative sense as opposed to the violent sense the violence is so overly stylised that i found myself in hysterics laughing as opposed to the horrifying reality of the violence in wolf creekcomparing this to wolf creek or saw is like comparing star crash to star warsit feels like it was written by a 14 year old whose knowledge of the world outside of america came from eurotrip except they decided to remove whatever little and i stress the word little bit of humour that movie possessed and replaced it with a softporn horror pretender every attempt at dark comedy tried in this movie had me and my friends looking at each other and bursting out laughing at the pitiful attemptsi really couldnt be bothered going into any detail but this one little point should give you an idea of how patently ridiculous the movie is they are given the location of the in slovakia and told the local girls are remarkably sex starved due to the lack of men because of the war what war would that be exactly slovakia broke from the czech republic without much happening back in the early 90sslovakia slovenia what the difference eh avoid at all costs,cruel
a massive disappointment after seeing the trailer for this film and hearing the hype i was very excited in anticipation to see a brutal gory and disturbing horror film and what did i experience 30 minutes to start with uncannily similar to the teen comedy eurotrip where 3 guys travel europe trying to get laid and then its interlaced with a guy wondering where his friends are going and spliced with very short torture scenes mostly glimpses of torture rooms and hinting at the plot spoilers there was what 3 torture scenes where you see anything remotely graphic a guy gets drilled in the chest which you do not see but only hear the sound and then see his chest with trickles of blood coming outyou dont see the guy get his achilles tendon severed but only when he gets to stand up you see its been sliced been done before the second scene involves a guy getting some fingers chopped off big deal the final scene pretty good where a chick is getting her eye slowly burned out by a blow torch and its all melted away and shes screaming in agony thats what i thought that film would be throughout and unnerving like that scene wasbut it wasnt this film is hardly graphic saw ii was way worse in terms of brutal graphic violence the plot was lame the acting was indeed terrible and the visuals were truly ungrippingnot scary not brutal not explicit  at all,cruel
i was reading the interviews with the director and he said he saw a website in thailand ill bet there are some websites in my country which is in the same asian region as thailand so the perspective im coming from is it can be real and it can happen not just in slovakia or more realistically in thailand the movie itself is decent with maybe a bit too many coincidences happening that favor the heroes but the real point of the movie is people can become a commodity we can now put a price on anything love war and even a human life and thats not an original idea because even before the 20th century there were a lot of countries being conquered by other countries my country the philippines being taken over by spain for instance thats when the abuses and the torture comes in because a commodity for you is a something which you can take care of or break whatever pleases youthe gore isnt the real horror its the idea that taking a human life is a business that makes it all truly disgusting i think this point of view elevates past its imperfection to a pretty good horror film despite being not violent enough for horror nuts and being too violent for the regular moviegoers as for the people who deplore horror films they should meet two horror masters cronenberg and miike i havent really met them in person but i hear they are very gentle funny people in person and cronenbergs movie set is the most untense relaxed and collaborative set an actor can work in so do violent films really beget more violence should horror film directors be aborted after conception or do they actually perform an important aesthetic function for mankind,cruel
just a bad bad movie overall the dialogs suck and there is just a very thin story line the only two good things bout this movie is tarantinos name and the nasty atmosphere of the torturescenes it is an horrorfilm after all the biggest spoiler for me was the fact that over and over again americans just cant seem to cope with european geography for the record amsterdam is part of the netherlands so way the hell are all the people speaking german if youre in holland the natives speak dutch not bloody german sigh believe me i know therefore two thumbs down for this film it could have been so much better,cruel
i have read marks comments on this film and i have to agree that it does take some time to reach the climax however as with all tarantino films the plot the characters and the intensity all make this one of the most thrilling and equally gruesome films ive ever seen and some scenes towards the end of the film did make me cringe and i had to look away for a few seconds but obviously you will see this for yourself when you go to watch the moviethe settings and scenery especially in slovakia are dark and cold and just add to the drama of the film and this in my opinion is another tarnatino classic that is a must see for all horror fanatics,cruel
i cant rave enough about this film it has a real story to tell and so much character to it that it really goes above and beyond the call of duty for a horror flick what i find so awesome about this movie is that not only could this actually happen rest assured my friend it actually does happen on a grander scale than your american mind can imagine i wont say exactly what it is but this could absolutely happen to someone and that is what makes it so perfectly creepy and horrificthe story takes a long time to introduce you to the characters and this is important in a real horror film because you need to identify with the characters in order to be horrified by anything happening to them the tension of many scenes is like a razors edge that suddenly snaps into either a roller coaster of terror or evaporates as if the tension was only your silly imagination this is great suspense and i loved every single frame of this filmthere are sideplots galore interesting characters and situations and it is all in a european vacation sort of setting but instead of the fluff we have been fed in the past this is the harsh european vacation that shows you a bit of the toughness of the war torn areas and the people they produce i was reminded of lilja forever with their representation of the quasipseudoslovanianbatslavian areasif you never see this film you are a total idiotbtw this is indie style not hollywood so be prepared to get real funkyplot 3 friends arrive in amsterdam looking for whatever off the hook wild times and partying they can get themselves into with the intention of creating memories to look back upon fondly when they grow up and be responsible two are longtime friends and the third they picked up along the many countries they visited before amsterdam they enjoy the rich delights of amsterdams red light district and then they meet someone that tells them about a place a place they have to check out man and the fun begins muahahahahaahha,cruel
i cant find words to describe how much i loved this movie if u havent seen it hurry up and go to the nearest cinema and see it it will blow your mind i thought that i had seen scary movies before hostage with bruce willis but my soul took a beating and i cant put in words how freaked i was after seeing this movie i mean this director is a master of drama the build up is amazing and i was on pins and needles all the time after a while i dont even know if i see any point to ever watch another movie again after seeing this masterpiecethis movie gets the highest grade because it truly is the best movie i have ever seen,cruel
wow such a disaster and waste of money is nothing it promises to be its doesnt contain enough blood enough horror enough sex or enough tension its just a copy of american horror cinema that has become to be so afraid to accomplish a thing completelythe movie can be analyzed in three parts the first part is a teen movie where were supposed to learn the morals behind the 3 guys going to slovakia its so weird in this part that an american whos living in a dream world himself tries to judge the europeans for being selfish and selfobsessedthe second part tries to put some horror into the movie as this part of the movie begins its so obvious that is going nowhere roth is helpless and its no surprise that he doesnt find a way out just a small and idiotic surprise to turn things overthe third part is supposed to be the strongest where some tension and thrill should be inserted but this part is so quickly finished that as you watch you feel like the film was out of budget so some parts were just not shot possible spoiler  well there is however one thing to learn from if one your friends happens to have an eye flopping out of her brains you can just cut the vessels or neurons whatever connecting the eye to her brain and the bleeding will stop dont worry end of spoilers to those who think about seeing this or buying the dvd think again its not worth it,cruel
thank god i only paid the studentprice even though im not a student but still that was even too much i want my money back with an extra 300 to begin with to pay for damaging my brains and eyes and 94 minutes of my life not that it was scary but because it was so incredibly terrible and an enormous waste of time fake blood money and everything you can think of after the movie i tried to look for a nice thing about the movie there has to be something but no bad acting bad scenes dutch people speaking german dont tell the dutch because they are not going to like this and only selling drugs and sex bad horror and all characters from the good guys to the prostitutes from the bad guys to the victims are unrealistic think of all the clichs and try to make the worst movie you can think of and then you are almost there well this is just the beginning it gets even worse its everything but scary everything is predictable because they were so nice to shoot it in such a way that you know whats going to happen and also the music helps you a lot to prepare for the scary moments well scary first i was thinking to give it 2 stars because the two girls look nice yeah im a guy each girl a star but im not going to do it what the hell its pity the lowest i can give is 1 and not even lower do they really think we are that stupid if i read some comments im afraid they are right in some cases i cant find any good word for it im sorry i tried but its just impossible do not give that man money to make another movie,cruel
eli roth has come a long way since cabin fever a completely underwhelming film that seemed calculated to do little more than earn roth a title as heir apparent to the legacies left by his horror forebears playing off his newfound industry buzz and access to horror auteurs roth has cobbled together a team of celebritiesturnedsycophants including tarantino and miike to champion his latest endeavor a wannabe asian extreme gorror the result a spectacular film roth may be calculating in his hollywood machinations but that same calculating mind has brought us a film of such ferocity and brutality that its nothing short of astonishing for to be a mainstream american release in 2006 this film is as enigmatic and fearless as cabin fever was obvious and safe the critics reviews versus the box office speak volumes on this one although the press may not be ready for an angry america the audience certainly is,cruel
its so rare these days that decent horror movies are actually made for every the ring there are 10 saws and its a real shame because i have always been a shameless horror movie fan but finally there is a horror movie in theaters that actually delivers the goods and its name is i wasnt a big fan of eli roths first film cabin fever in fact i downright hated it so my anticipation for his next film wasnt that high that was until reviews began to come in and everyone talked about how brutal and gory the movie is this really peaked my curiosity because i am somewhat of a gore freak so i figured that i had to check it outnow the first 20 minutes are for the most part terrible i admit for most of the first act i was pretty sure that i was gonna hate this movie the first act is sort of like what would happen if they made american pie 4 but looking back on it after the movie is over the first 20 minutes look better because they are sort of your breather because the rest of the movie is freaking brutalthe middle section of this movie is simply brilliant all of the scenes in the dungeon are truly frightening in a this could happen to you sense and somehow through the movie roth actually makes you like these characters and we want to see them escapemy biggest problem with the movie is the ending where our one remaining lead decides to get him some good old fashion revenge the last 10 minutes are simply laughable i think the movie would have been a lot better if the movie had ended with paxton escaping from the and returning to america a broken man but they decide to take the juvenile routea lot has been made of the gore in this film and to me it wasnt really that bad although there was a lot of groaning and screaming in the audience i saw it with so it seems to work for people not used to this kind of thing but for any horror movie fan there is nothing in this movie that you havent seen beforein closing i think that with a tighter script and a better beginning and end this movie could have been a modern horror classic but as it stands now it is an enjoyable time at the movies well maybe enjoyable isnt the right wordand i recommend this film to all you horror movie freaks like me out there,cruel
i am sorry eli roth but man this was such a shitty movie first of all what was the soft porn about the first 45 min or even hour was so useless i mean does that improve the movie to let some bactors look for sex in different countries and then the horror startedwhat a disappointmentjust watch some japanese movies and youll get the same torture scenes so what now all of a sudden is the scariest movie of the past decade  are you kidding me anyway two days before i saw this movie id seen the descent and i have to say that that movie is so much scarier and better acted that this one maybe eli roth should have left out the soft porn part and should have made the movie have a way darker feeling to it than it had now maybe then it would have been okwho knows,cruel
i just finished watching and wow the trailer was completely misleading as i imagined this would be a good movie first off the beginning of this movie has you believing it will be a terrible eurotrip ripoff fortunately this illusion is quickly dispelled and the movie turns to softcore porn wait what yes at least the first half hour is softcore porn eventually this gives way to meritless shock cinema at its finest with scene after scene of gore torture and mutilation its not really scary or disturbing just gross also someones eye comes out at one point and their optic nerve is cut to relieve them of the pain a thick yellow liquid proceeds to pour from the severed nerve this is silly the only liquid this could possibly be is some sort of pus and this victim had only recently been injured this makes no sense speaking of sense how could this bizarre paytokill operation even exist i think i can safely assume that the people abducted from this had lives and were not all shiftless drifters with nobody that cared about them all of these people can disappear with no consequences or investigations ridiculous so far weve concluded that the movie has no merit and makes no sense what could redeem it not the acting we have sexhound foreign guy apprehensive shy guy partyloving student turned reluctant and useless hero creepy guy 1 creepy guy 2 creepy guy 3 i suppose these people are accomplished actors if accomplished means being able to pull a weak stereotype or seem shady worthless all in all i cant believe i just wasted how long was it it seemed like forever and any time at all was too long dont waste any money on this heck if youre some sort of movie pirate dont even bother downloading it its a total waste of space and time no matter how you look at it i only wish you could give negative rankings on imdb so i could sink the rating to a more representative levelfinal scoring cinematography 2 acting 1 angry child gang 9 shock value 7 other value 229847723 final score 0,cruel
in my country movies dont get so much attention on tv yet under quentin tarantino famous name appeared in every set of ads stating how medical teams were needed in cinemas for fainting viewers and people spewing up this led me to believe i would be watching a really stomach churning film and with the r18 rating i expected the bestwhat i really got was your standard american attempt at these newage horror flicks plenty of hot women and nudity and when we finally get to the gore and action it does not last long doe the famous change camera angle as we are about to see something brutal and then the movie suddenly ends with a slightly happyish ending in terms to what it could have ended likeif you go see this movie hoping to see some brutality and such dont if you want everything i said above sure go for itif i didnt go see this film expecting everything they hyped it up to be then i may have enjoyed it more but most of my disappointment came from the fact of how hyped up it was built me up just to let me downi will not recommend this to friends but rather advise them not to go and there are many other films i would recommend in what this movies genre was suppose to be,cruel
boy i liked this movie a bunch this is an excellent visual experience very well acted and as shocking as you could want from a movie this movie will make you think twice about backpacking abroad with the set design and filming locations you really got the feel of being there and let me tell you its not a place you would want to be i cant think of one thing that i did not like about this movie and i throughly enjoyed my movie going experience i am not getting into any detail of the movie because i think the less you know going in the more moved by this film you will be if you are a fan of this genre than this is the movie for youdont miss it at the theaterbuy it when it comes out on dvd and share it with everyone old enough to see it you all will love it,cruel
i had two expectations when going into this film firstly that it was going to be just as good as cabin fever and secondly that i had heard it was brutal both expectations were met  and then some roths direction and writing was terrific there was never a dull moment in the filmthe cast were all fantastic too jay hernandez was great as hottie paxton and moved from being carefree to fighting for his life with real conviction derek richardson was also good as nice guy josh it was extremely difficult watching what happened to him ethor gudjansson was rather annoying at times as icelandic backpacker oli barbara nedeljakava and jana kanderbkava were both well cast as natalya and svetlana jennifer lim doesnt get enough screen time as kana but she was awesome finally jan vlasak was terribly creepy as the businessmanwithout giving too much away i describe as a modern day video nasty not that we really have video anymore but you know what i mean due to its extremely gruesome moments the pain that you see these people go through even though not real is shown with such conviction you can almost feel it yourself the little business that is being run in would be deemed so socially unacceptable that im surprised this film wasnt banneda tremendous job well done to all those involved the dvd will be great again without saying too much natalya and svetlana most definitely got what they deserved,cruel
when eli roths cabin fever came out in 2002 the opinions amongst horrorfans were divided quentin tarantino however claimed himself being a fan of roths debut so he agreed on placing quentin tarantino presents on the promotional poster for though he isnt in any other way associated with the making of this film it did result in the fact that is now receiving a widescale theatrical release across europe smart move mr roths storyline isnt too complicated two american backpackers paxton and josh are travelling across europe together with oli a friend from iceland in amsterdam theyre being told that slowakia is a real paradise for backpackers because its the country with the most beautiful and wellwilling european woman the horny threesome wastes no time and heads off to slowakia at their arrival they check in at a paradiselike little hotel and hook up with natalya and svetlana and indeed the women are gorgeous and the sex is splendid but little do they know that theyre about to descent in the underground world of organized crime and torturetourism as they will be confronted with mankinds darkest and sickest naturethe subgenre in which pleasantly revolves itself has been around for a long time it all started in the 60s with the making of the first goremovies and continued during the 70s and 80s with the release of numerous exploitationfilms and shockhorror features during the 90s such movies vanished from the horrorscene in the new millennium the sadistic realityhorror genre is back and the first thing we notice is that its much more stylishly portrayed the genre got a considerable boost with movies like saw and takasi miikes ichi the killer the screenplay of is a bit less intelligent than aforementioned movies but director eli roth clearly knows what a horrorfan wants to see and therefore he delivers the goods in other words expect a lot of female nudity and bloody gore during the first part of you actually have the impression that youre watching the umpteenth teensexcomedy so the sudden blow to the head is as hard as it gets when this movie starts showing off with its disgusting torturescenes the bloody makeup effects are done by greg nicotero and as to be expected excellent and believable except maybe one makeup effect seemed not too realistic and reminded me a bit of those early 80s italian zombiemovies i think youll know it when you see it but it was fun anywayi have to tell it like it is eli roth has improved as a filmmaker not only does he seem to have taken some lessons in scriptwriting making him aware of things like 3actsstructure and point of no return he has even learned how to build some suspense in certain scenes okay the plot may contain some unbelievable coincidences but if we make up the overall score we have a very decent politically incorrect horrormovie thats recommended for gorehounds i might be overrating it a bit but its just that i had so much fun with it and it is a solid improvement over roths debut cabin fever,cruel
is a terrifying ride from almost beginning to end although it takes over 40 minutes for the action to set in the most horrifying thing about this film is that all the while as you watch these young men have fun youre fully aware of what will eventually happen to them they laugh smoke have sex and generally enjoy themselves as the audience winces in their seat unsure of what moment will be their last and then when the violence finally starts it fails to ever let up rather than having gore spray like fountains youre treated to snipped tendons puncture wounds and the like  all of which are far more cringeinducing than a head popping off a unrelenting film coupled with a very satisfying ending make this one of my top horror picks for 2006 i think the us will be hardpressed to find something that outdoes this in the next ten months,cruel
i completely enjoyed eli roths it had me from the beginning to the very end as i sat in the theater with my family and friends i enjoyed their reaction as well as my own i mostly heard screams and saw some jumps it makes you think about the way things are and the what ifs in this world we talked for hours on the movie and i believe that if you havent given this movie a shot you should that is if you are not weak in the stomach and have the residual i am afraid to sleep tonight after that movie it could have been more focused on the last half but you would have to see it for yourself to decide how you would react to this powerful movie i would compare it to many others but i would rather you made your own mind up,cruel
i got suckered in by friends into seeing this movie and i had to leave midway this is a movie that was made without any direction you could of done this movie in a less graphic way and had a much better film i left when someone was tied up to a chair and i heard a chainsaw i can only review what i saw what i saw was just too gross for me if your a human being with feelings then skip seeing this now i know this passes as entertainment for some people but if you are over 15 then you wont like this crap with all the violence there is in real life why watch this crap sad that films like this get made if you think i am an old guess again the director eli roth has no business calling himself a director i hope to god i never see something like this again if eli roth ever directs has another movie i will stay away from it lions gate how can you be proud of making money on garbage like this shame on you,cruel
makes cinematic history no other movie has ever had so much graphic torture clearly groundbreakingit begins with a fairly genteel account of some twentysomethings having a good time backpacking across europe a dream on every americans todo listbut once the hammer drops on this one it dont let up until the very last frame the hammer falls in one scene in particular where one of the three disappears and the hostages picture mail appears on his buddys phone with the phrase i go home from this point on it truly gets as medieval as anything ever seen on screenreaches all in the audience on a visceral level as torture of this nature is truly the most common deepseeded fear that exists its no accident that s homonym is hostile as this is one of the most hostile assaults on an audience in cinematic historyi would recommend three things one bucket two toothpicks and three shots of rye hug the bucket during the movie toothpicks for you eyelids as nightmare preventative and the rye will help in the deprogramming phase afterward you dont want to go to this one alonethe criticism i have is that there could have been more comic relief a few wellplaced tarrantinos would have really escalated this movie to the top of the heap like a soup with too much garlic and nothing to help kick it down a notch the recipe of soup called for too much ghastly and not enough comedyin the end this is the groundbreaking high water mark of torture movies i hope i dont see another try to top this one for many years to come but somehow i know i will,cruel
tarantino is great one of my favorite but is crap i dont mind that story doesnt face the reality of slovakia thats not what art is about but even though i barely could find any artistic quality in this film i also was wondering at such a lot of misleading details in this film story is set in slovakia but you can clearly recognize that film is made in czech republic czech railway logo on trains czech railway stations all writing stuff and also a lot of talking is in czech language even the cops wear czech uniforms this is a horror film i really dont understand all these comparison to exorcist do you mean yin  yang excellent exorcist vs light weight felt like watching lame teenage comedy and one more thing kids gangs dont exist in slovakia this phenomenon occurs in romania and maybe in some other balkan counties but beautiful girl in slovakia thats right,cruel
before i even get to reviewing the actual film this needs to be said i would have most definitely given this a 10 if i would have went into this movie totally blind without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews unfortunately that was not the case as ive been following this film for months and couldnt wait to finally see it that being said if you havent already spoiled yourselfwhich by now is damn near impossible dont do it the hype will probably ruin it for youthis was a fantastic film no its not the nonstop gore fest that youre expecting on the other hand its not for the squeamish pg13 horror fan either this is a truly sick film and it will scare youcenters around 3 young men backpacking all around europe to put it bluntly theyre basically just looking for some action for one of the lead characters who just got out of some kind of bad relationship or whatever theyre having a pretty good time where they are then some guy tells them to go to this other in slovokiasorry if thats not spelled correctly where women will just basically throw themselves at you this is where the story picks upplease if you do see it dont leave just because the horror hasnt started 10 minutes into the movie anyway so they head over to this start hooking up with hot chicks yada yada theyre having a pretty awesome time until one of the guys goes missing they get panicky and thats where the real fun startsim not going to explain the gore in this review there are threads upon threads on the message board that will explain the scenes to you if you want them i personally thought though that it was extremely well done the parts that will disturb you the most are the scenes not of the actual slashingcuttingdrillingetc but the ones of the cutaways the stills of the instruments that will be used the screaming you hear from the victims this is where eli roth breaks away from the mediocre horror directors and will one day be a legendall in all i loved this movie its not for the faint of heart its not for kids but if youre a fan of real horror go see thisthen go rent some miikeloved his tiny cameo dont let all the hype scare you away from this excellent film,cruel
if you cant handle your blood guts and puss in movies why dont you go see last holiday because this definitely is not for you it starts off as a nice movie about three friends in a in slovakia but soon takes a turn for the worst which isnt exactly the surprise of the century the acting was good especially the parts where the poor actors had to yell out in excruciating pain the lead character jay hernandez is a guy who you like from the start until the very end the only bad thing about it is that it is shorter than you think it runs about an hour an a half but it goes by much quicker than you can notice if you like the blood and the guts and if you liked kill bill you will enjoy this film pay particular attention to the subtle homages to director quentin tarantino,cruel
i actually just got home from seeing and am extremely satisfied out of all the horror movies and all the luridness of my interest in things like rottencom and death this movie effected me dramatically afterwards i felt light headed my knees were weak and my stomach felt like it was churning butterit follows a similar scenario to the movie house of 1000 corpses travelers being lead by seemingly kind strangers trying to help them out then finding they were actually lead to their most horrifying nightmares also you can see quentin tarantinos connection to the film as pulp fiction was playing on one of the tvs in the middle of the filmafter seeing both saw and saw ii i thought that gore couldnt be brought to a higher level and this proved me wrong i cannot wait for to come out on video though only one thing disappointed me the endingthe clich of the victim running back to what he was running from in order to stop whatever terror it brings is far too common in horror films if i were paxton and i heard a woman screaming thatd be one more reason for me to want to get out as fast as i could though he does the heroic thing goes back and saves her only to lose her to a trainin my opinion the gruesomeness of the movie makes up for this common clich and as i said before i cant wait until it comes out on video d t,cruel
i have seen many horror films i am a college film student and an enormous fan of horror films i am also a veteran of operation enduring freedom and have seen a number of truly cruel and brutal acts inflicted upon people i feel it necessary to include this preamble when i think of how i felt when i saw this moviefirst off all of the sex in the first 45 or however many minutes of this movie were completely irrelevant to mewhat got to me was how realistic the nature of violent human cruelty was portrayed after i watched this movie i felt a renewed disturbance to my core as to how human beings could do such horrible things to each other i would prefer to just delude myself and think that such things dont happen but i know better if you read a bit of honest history you will hopefully understand this statement the most horrible things that you can possibly imagine being done have already been donethis movie disturbed me so greatly because it made the idea of the elite hunting club seem completely plausible the depictions of utter domination cruelty torture and murder do not look to me like a mere movie they are a reflection of a horrible potential that may lie in all of us,cruel
first off im 13 and i saw this on opening weekend and i loved cabin fever i thought it was so well done it was gory scary sexy funny sad and freaking sick and twisted i read about this movie on coming sooncom about 6 months before it was released i was so ready for another great roth movie well i got what i wanted another gory scary sexy funny sad and freaking sick and twisted movie the first half of the movie felt like erotrip good movie more nudity than i have seen in a r rated movie by the way that was ok but could be toned down a bit how did this get away with r one more second of nudity and it would have been nc17 the second half was full of blood and gore cool very scary and disturbing yes a must see it was so bad my dad got mad and grounded me for a weeka must see,cruel
after i read all the comments in this site about how graphic and brutal was i was expecting at least something in the vein of audition a movie with far better make up and way more perverse than this one but instead all ive got is something like a scooby doo film with some gore and to be honest lame gore cabin fever was neat because at first you thought it was a slasher flick and it turned out to be something different it was a fun trip but seems like a video game an absurd montage of gory scenes with no purpose at all and its not even disturbing or exciting its just stupid there was some nice humor like the pulp fiction part i was laughing at that oh and by the way i really dont understand why you people complain about all the nudity thats a human body with no clothes on and thats it why do you find it so offensive maybe because there was almost no male nudity but its not something to be offended about but it gets dull yeah that i will give you the eye part was the worst i couldnt stop thinking about how fake it looked roth did a great job in cabin fever with special make up but this is terrible you cant get fooled by itthe ending was far convenient for paxton i mean i was waiting for a scene where the t 1000 would show up to help him through its not realistic nor even suspenseful you just know its almost the end and cant wait for the titles to show upif you think this is real horror and gore you havent seen a lot of flicks,cruel
i finally got to watch this movie after all the bad comments i thought it was gonna be pretty bad but it was actually pretty good there was some parts that we probably could have did without but the overall movie was good you have to really like horror films i would watch it again i hope to see a part 2 the scary part is you stop and think this probably really happens in real life after watching this and wolf creek i think ill stay in my own country you have to pay attention in this movie to catch what the ending means i give it a thumbs up like someone else said if you did not like this movie its probably cause you liked the movie scream,cruel
i went to see tonight with some friends im going to give a brief rant here but i wont spoil anything for you in case you still want to see it after reading thisthis pile of crap is an abomination to the movie industrylet me start off with a little advice dont waste 715 on seeing this in the theater hell dont even waste 5 to rent the dvdthe only way this movie is going to make money is purely on the hype from the tv previewstrailersit had a decent plot and pretty good actors but there was just way too much dead time for the first 40 minutes you sit there wondering when something is going to happen during that time you figure out the whole movie and then nothing is a surprise later on but then after they dont surprise you because you already figured it out they try to explain it to you only a total moron wouldnt have figured it out already the whole movie and every single character was so friggin obviousadditionally the previews say things like in test audiences ambulances were called and people were puking in theaters because its so graphic what the hell are they talking about graphic ok sure i wouldnt suggest taking a child to it but its nowhere near as gory as they made it out to be the devils rejects was 100 times more gory and it was much much much more entertainingsimply it was a good idea that they threw in the toilet with lousy directing part of it is because they thought they were so smart theyd have to spell everything out for the stupid moviegoers its a bloodandguts movie for gods sake it doesnt need much of a plot and you dont have to spell anything out as long as you have a decent director and screenplay writerim no movie directorwriterproducer but as i walked out i thought even i could have made this so much better there was so much room for more action and more gore but they didnt take the opportunity maybe they were trying to avoid an nc17 rating or something but it could have been so much betterdont waste your time or your money on this steaming pile of anal leakage,cruel
possible mild semispoilersdespite what everyone would have you believe is not an exploitive piece of torture porn  its a good little movie with no selfdoubt about what it is a pulpy unpretentious but scary and effective flick made for horror fans by horror fans with no attempts to try and pander to the general publici wont lie to you  the torture scenes are pretty goddamn gnarly and in a couple of places even downright disgusting but in truth they only make up a very small portion of the film and the picture has a lot more going for it than just blood and guts for starters characters are all pretty likable i felt actually concerned for them which is more than can be said for 99 of horror movies post1980 the scares dont come as much from single individual acts of torture and depravity but from an overall feeling of dread of being a million miles from home in a european village where everyone is in cahoots and is against you if anything it belongs with deliverence in the subgenre of vacation gone wrong moviesthe kind of fear that im sure everyone has experienced at least a little of when theyve taken a trip for some r n ri saw this in a theater full of teenagers and i for one really like horror movies with an audience because i get a kick out of the shared reaction the girls screeched and ewwed in all the appropriate places and when the villains got their bloodsoaked comeuppance at the end there were actually cheers of course my horse,cruel
if we are to believe it may be based on reallife goingson in asia although the director has changed the setting to eastern europe a place few american tourists visit some backpackers are lured from the relative safety of western europe to slovakia on the promise of hot sex but after the hot sex they are drugged tortured and murdered along with hundreds of others in an old mental asylum refitted as a series of torture rooms in which affluent males from around the world pay heavily to play torturer jay hernandez leads the unlucky backpackers and the film takes a good 50 minutes before it gets down to business the suspense is killing and the last 40 or so minutes is all about killing the gore and the production values are great although most of the torture is suggested rather than seen with terrific sound effects for those things we are not permitted to see a good thing too the few scenes actually showing nasty deeds being done are patently fake and had us alternately laughing and groaning spoiler sole survivor hernandez has a great time avenging his buddies deaths and were right there with him as he gets every last one of them in various novel ways you too will be screaming for their blood after you see what they have done,cruel
im no movie critic but this is possibly one of the few horror movies i have seen that stick to its genre lately we have been given thousands of fillers promising to scare you out of your mind but so far all ive gotten is a one second long shock of surprise and a killing desire to get my money back yes its true many people will be sensitive to a movie like this and it isnt a movie for the general public some may misinterpret the idea behind this movie especially because they do not know what the director was aiming for or what his reasons were while making this movie i dont know if many of you know but the director based the plot of this movie on real events as sick as that may sound and what you saw or are going to see is just a display of a very probable situation you can go psychological here but honestly i wont feed you a bunch of bs a movie is a movie and not everyone will understand the psychological reasonings behind it in my humble opinion this movie is worth seeing if you are a real horror fan that is because even though some may think that those who start as victims end as victimizers but if you ask me i think theyre wrong the turn of events just shows justice it actually has a plot and its not some mindless timewasting concoction that in the end will just bring you back where you started,cruel
okay we watched it last night and my tummy was pretty much upset for the rest of the night since some people already explained the plot ill just give you my reaction i can handle horror normal horror what most might call kiddie horror like the texas chainsaw massacre or things like that but this went into absolute sick horror i thought i was preparedbut i wasnt first and last time ive seen it and honestly i just cant believe these positive reviews ive seen cabin fever and i liked that movie was kind of funny but was straight out sickeningi actually wanted to get out of the theater but didnt because my husband and brother in law wanted to finish it not that they liked it or anything the whole plot is just simply stupid they did a good job making europe look pretty bad prostitutes messed up looking back streets etc but come on you can find that about anywhere in the world no matter what country you go toi read the movie was graphic sexually as well as bloody but to be honest  i only thought the bloody portion of it was true oh gee was it true and not a bit exaggerated being from europe originally you can see sexual scenes like that in about most of the 8pm prime time movies by now america is just not used to that simply because many many of these scenes are cut for american television  ive seen if for a few years here nowi can only suggest to everyone to use their money for more useful stuffmy opinion,cruel
lol i just seen its nothing too laugh about all the gore and violence hooked me on and the nudity well im only 15 and didnt follow the point of them paying people for them to kill someone why did the butchers all want to be surgeons like the dutch dude help me out please so i wont have to spend money on seeing it again to try to learn the point the end sucked how kana jumped in front od the train it would have been better if the next scene said 1 year later and it showed kana wearing an eyepatch and a wedding band they married after settling down after that incident and they both changed there identities and went and got that tattoo of the club just to get in the torture building and break thru everyroom freeing the victims but not before killing the butchers in the ways that they were tortured just to show them how badly they ed up by doing this after getting done with the rooms they plant heavy loads of c4 all around the city i mean 24000lbs of c4 in the torture building and city alone but they run into a problem in the middle of the revenge the c4 detonator has been stolen sending them thru the city on a search and killing spree lol you all will probably think that i sound very goofy right now comment on this please,cruel
little slow in the beginning but the women and the sex made the slowness not seem so bad oh yeah then it got towards the gory parts which were awesome then towards the end was a little weird and the ending could have been better compared to saw this isnt as horrified due to it taking too long to get too the actual horror plus even when it got to the horror there was a good amount of gore but sadly there could of been more but once it got to it was very fascinating its almost like was just to scratch the surface and 2 which comes out early 2007 will be the psycho nightmare that will make saw and saw 2 look no better than the petty alone in the dark movie atleast i hope so overall i would have to say it was a pretty good movie if i do say so myself,cruel
good movie overall i felt cut short of what it was built up to be i have been reading around and have seen that many other people feel this way america has to butcher such great horror films and all that just because people cant handle it if you cant handle a movie dont go to see it the european girls were sexy and they did a great job promoting them in fact if you threw in some shots of sneepur then you could even call it soft core porn i just feel that it was hyped up to be more gory than it really was think about ityou saw a cut on the back of some guys leg then you saw fingers getting cut off ok like we havent seen that before it was scary and a good movie but look at it this way  there was no suspense to the movie everything was to the point and not built up nothing made you jump out of your seat the best part of the movie were the european chicks,cruel
i was looking forward to this movie because i thought it might fill the void of decent horror films that has existed for the past decade however while viewing the film i realized that this is one of the most overrated films i have seen this film would have been better off as a pornographic film considering the first thirty minutes is basically that anyway what makes my previous comment valid is that the small amount of violence that actually occurred in the film was not actually as intense as the reviews might suggest i admit i am not easily scared but this movie made me feel bad for providing revenue for its makers i know many of you filmgoers have faith in quentin tarantino but i think he made a mistake to endorse and produce this film,cruel
this movie really contains nothing out of the ordinarythe gore factor was no higher than other movies of its genre ie texas chainsaw massacre a nightmare on elm street for a movie that seems to be banking on the prospect that it is one of the most bloody films going it falls shortthe plot becomes evident very early so there is no real suspense such as in saw the camera work is standard and the horror comes not from psychological suspense but from the amount of blood on the screen see abovethe only redeeming qualities i found in this movie were the abundance of nudity not really something to sell a movie on and ollie ollies antics make the movie almost worth watchingmy suggestion wait until it comes out on video and then talk someone else into paying for the rental,cruel
i have read a bunch of comments stating that this movie is hardcore and real horror but its not the truth is the horror movies that are being produced today are just so terrible that this movie appears to be for real i was really disappointed by this film so much potential and so little actual payoff the beginning of the film that is supposed to be setting up the sequence is waaaay to long i dont really need this much character development they are a bunch of early 20s morons who travel to europe to take drugs and have sex how much more do you need to know apparently you need half of the film when you do finally get to the the violence and horror that could have been never appear granted there are a few scenes that make you cringe but nothing that hasnt been done before much like roths last film cabin fever this is nothing more than an homage to better films if you want to see a great power drill sequence check out felucis gates of hell i am willing to give roth a break since the movie had to be edited pretty severely in order to get an r rating i would wait for the dvd to come out and see this movie without the constraints of rating system in the meantime i am throwing all of my hope for good horror films on aja shoulders with his remake of the hills have eyes,cruel
alright is it just me or are horror movies getting exponentially worse i say exponentially because i learned it in math class anyway they are getting bad man where are the good flicks that actually scare people when are there going to be horror movies that are actually about monsters and ghosts and murderers and not just drugs and sex it really makes me mad ugh i mean this movie was alright but i want more scary content and less sex and crap i mean good lordwhere did the good stories go i saw a review for that described it as an unnecessary gore fest for hormonally challenged teens maybe its just me but i dont know just an observation,cruel
okforget all the hypeill give you the real deal about now of course i am one of the seemingly few who actually also liked cabin fever so i guess youll have to take that with a grainofsalt as well but i think was a good second film for a director who definitely shows some serious potentialstarts off with 2 friends backpacking through europe during their adventures they meet a european drifter kinda guy and they all decide to pal around and check out the sights they do the types of things that any young single guys would do namely  smoke dope and check out the hookers and while in amsterdam they hear of this great place in slovakia that houses all the hot poonanny sho nuff they get to the joint and its drippin with hot european ass the guys are all having a great time until after a night of heavy partying with a couple of eurohos  their drifter buddy disappears this kinda worries the two yankee cats as euroboy didnt bother to say any goodbyesbut they chalk it up to the drifter mentality and try to put it out of their minds well another hard night of partying goes on and one of the american dudes disappears too this leaves the other american guy with no idea whats going on and hes obviously more than a little concerned about his homeys well being the remaining american guy starts nosin around as things seem pretty fishy and one of the eurohos tells the yank that his boy is at an art exhibit she takes him to some abandoned looking shthole place keep an eye out at this point for a brief cameo by japanese uberdirector takashi miike and tells him to go and find his boy obviously the place is no art museum and as our hero goes in search of his supposedly artloving friend really starts to take offhonestly i really liked it definitely is a little slow paced in the beginning but i think that this was intentional if not completely effective on the behalf of roth he said that he was going for an audition hence the cameo by miiketype of feel to his film and anyone thats seen audition knows fullwell that that film is slow as dirt until the last 15 minutes or so personally i would have preferred a quicker build up or perhaps a little more teaser footage in the beginning of the film even so the last 30 or so minutes of really makes up for any lag preceding the climax of the film and even the relatively slow beginning does have enough hot titsandass to keep the average male or female if you roll that way viewer interested when the gore does come it flys pretty heavy especially for a us theatrical release film its nothing compared to some of the more rough underground films out there but still plenty of redstuff for a mainstream film also many people gripe about roths use of fratboy style humor in his films i personally think he does a good job of handling the funny moments and does a good job of knowing when to turn them on or off depending on the vibe of the scene not many directors can handle balancing comedic timing and horror in the same film but roth does it admirably well overall is one of the better horror films of 2005 and is definitely worth a peep for any horror fan it appears to already be another loveitorhateit film much like cabin fever so im sure the debate on this one will go on for a while but i give a very solid 8510,cruel
i heard a lot of comments about the moviemost of them badand i couldnt believe that tarantino made a lousy film and my god he did not its a real thrill to watch this movie it is true that it took maybe too long till the real action but i dont mind seeing so much boobies do you i guess not those terrible scenes of torture were the most thrilling scenes ive ever seen ive just watched the film and i am still on shock cause its one of a kindso far anyway i recommend it to everyone who likes quentin tarantinos works theres just one thing that i dont get whats up with those kids theyre like a guerrilla or somethingthats a minus ,cruel
this is perhaps the worst horror movie to come out in a long time and thats saying a lot even the promised gore really only filled a small portion of the film the direction made almost no sense the dialogue was ridiculously bad it made saw look like an oscar worthy film people are comparing it to dont look now or the wicker manit cant even hold a flame to either of those the characters arent developed at allexcept for a few sentences of backstory that were really irrelvant in the long run i found myself laughing more than anything if youve seen the previews youve pretty much seen the whole movie its an absolute waste of money and an absolute waste of time,cruel
i love horror films and have for a long time i have probably seen every type of horror film out now i enjoyed eli roths cabin fever but i still gave it a bad review has a good story going for it the film is about three college buddies who are backpacking around europe and going from to hooking up with gorgeous women one night they hear of a different kind of in slovakia that has the best women they are duped and one by one end up in this place this is for people who want their most sickest darkest and twisted fantasies come to life they pay money to torture mutilate and kill a prisoner in this place the movie is welldone with lighting and camera shots with lots of blood and gore to spare the movie has lots of moments that make you squirm in your seat which is what it is supposed to do eli roths is a very gory film just a word to some guys dont bring a girlfriend to this movie because they wont like it trust me i have to say that is one of the better horror movies released today and i did enjoy the film and with a simple story with the right mood and plot is good enough for an audience,cruel
just like the person above me i have to agree that the gore and violence put in wasnt there for the sake of seeing blood all the violence that happened somehow moved along the plot or tied up a loose string from beforea lot of scenes also kept you on the edge of your seat like oh my god whats going to happen next kind of thriller also there were a lot of unexpected bits of humour i actually dont know if it was supposed to be funny or not because i was the only one laughing in the theatre but some parts were funnyalso jay hernendez did an amazing job in this movie and both main characters played their roles superblyif you liked the saw movies then this is right up your alley just more gore and you can actually see the damage being done i always thought that i could handle gore and blood but wow this movie was something unexpected,cruel
is a perfect horror film the story is believable and haunting director eli roth delivers endless screamsviolencetorture and much much more for all you horror hungry fansit was really surprising because last years cabin fever was a horrible moviethe movie begins in amsterdam where three friends are backpacking through europethey hear about this place near bratislava where you can find gorgeous women ready for anything and anyoneonce there they are brought one by one to a place where you can kill torture and fulfill all of your sickest fantasiesthe movie is veryvery intense which is great for me because i am really tired of all these pg13 horror movies i recommend you urgently go see it,cruel
i love quinton but this movie was a mess now please dont get me wrong i am all about gore but when i have to cover my eyes whatzzzup were we there to see porn and blood or a movie based on facts  dont waste tour money people wait for it to come on hbo  i think the whole crew wasted money next time film this in your backyard using some college students studying foreign relations an film making you would sure save a lot of cash hey i got an idea get a five year old to hold the video camera still they could do must better then terrintino did this film is a definite flop in our state people were walking out and an ambulance had to called because someone had a heart attack not cool at all where did the artistic ability go ,cruel
this movie is designed for a younger crowd i went with my wife who loves horror movies and we were both watching the time so we could finally leave what seemed to be hyped as a very gruesome and graphic film was anything but i saw very little actual blood and gore and the parts you did see were very badly done making it was almost unbelievablethis movie is very slow to develop and uses nudity to try and keep you interested for a young hormone driven crowd this may work but it failed to do that for us and we were happy to finally be out of the theater,cruel
the story is based on three guys going backpacking across the country looking for women and a good time when i was in the first 45 minutes of the movies i didnt know if it was a porno or a horror movie the storyline gets a lot better whenever oli  their icelandic friend goes missing eli roth redeemed himself in my opinion from cabin fever lots of intense scenes and hot women if you are looking for lots of gore and naked women this is a movie for you but if youre looking for a movie like saw 2 with lots of twists and surprises this isnt a movie for you i give this movie an 8 and i think its probably going to be one of the best movies to come out this year,cruel
2006 8510 its been a tremendous amount of time since ive sat in a theater and suddenly glanced around me to see so many people intrigued or stunned by what was happening on screen with theres no gloves no decent nature no pleasurecombing dreams its simply a developing nightmare what made this film so interesting even in its slow beginning is the mysterious gravity thats centers your attention on every characters moves or hellish interest and while the film runs a bit slow you always sense that theres a disgusting destruction on its secret way theres absolutely a cinematic static when it comes to this film and its audience a sick yet honest treat beneath its colorful and violent nature,cruel
make sure you each your snacks with in the first 45 minutes of this film the worst film i have ever seen starts out as a soft porn and finishes with a snuff film no scariness at all just pure disgust if i wanted that i would have watched girls gone wild and my neighbors beat each other at the same time the only redeeming value of this film is the lesson that if a girl puts out on the first date andor shows herself naked before the date you dont want to hang around for the second no matter how hot or good in bed she is never go to europe and leave the safety of other americans the best thing to do is wait for the rental and eat dinner before you go,cruel
why the hell would i want to see a pointless movie about chopping toes and blood everywhere that was the response i got when i asked some people if they wanted to go and see tonightsummed up in 3 words damn good writing and maybe i am one of the few sickos who enjoy a good shock to the system but i gotta say  eli rothgenius yes theres gore yes theres parts that just make you want to curl up into your stinky little movie chair close your eyes and think of aladdin but come on you just gotta sit up open your eyes and respect eli for taking a small idea killingfantasyprofit and writing it into this dark twisted world where you realize that true fear really is being far from home,cruel
it said on the rating that their was sexual content well after 15 minutes and seeing 15 different naked bodies including pictures of 58 people piled performing an orgy i walked out what a waste of money whoever gave the mpaa rating description screwed up bad on this one how about a little warning of nudity how am i supposed to know that sexual content means full out naked orgies other movies have this same description have no nudity and but implied sexual themes who knows if the rest of this movie was good i just couldnt get past the first 15 minutes of filth save yourself sometime and just go rent a porno or surf the web for a snuff film or something,cruel
is by far the worst movie i have seen in a long time not only was this film not entertaining it was almost impossible to watch i dont know who was being tortured more the people in the movie or in the theater after people started leaving i made myself stay thinking there would be some plot twist or something that might resemble an iota of a plot turned out the people who left saved about 45 minutes of their own lives i couldnt tell if i was watching a snuff movie or a soft core porn i decided it was more of a snuff movie because soft core porns have some plot lines this movie sucked eli roth sucks and the only person who wasted more money on this film was tarantino i wish i had more than a thousand words to describe how much i actually loathed this film eli if youre reading this i hope you undergo some kind of torture my idea of torture would be to make you watch your own film for the rest of eternity,cruel
i have honestly never watched a worse movie than this one the plot well what plot yes i understand that will be already expected with a horror movie but there wasnt any horror there was no character development and the violence was so bmovie my friends and i left the theatre with an unsatisfied feeling for the rest of the night not a word was spoken everyone knew already what the others were thinking we gave away our movie stubs and forget we even went until someone brings it up anyway in my opinion i would recommend you save your money and sleep on a bed of rusty nails instead youll most likely get the same outcome i was especially disappointed that quentin tarantino allowed himself to associate his name with it,cruel
anyone notice the irony in the fact that everyone that went to see this movie saw it because of our fascination with horror and gore and the fact that the entire premise of this movie surrounds and focuses on this building where people go to live out their inner most desires of torture and killing eli roth has us despising these characters like the one the jay hernandez character meets in the locker room however in a sense we are similar to these people in that we spent our money to go and see this torture and horror on the big screen obviously i know there is a big difference between the actual act and watching it in a movie however i did see the irony that roth perhaps unknowinglydisplayed to his audience in the entire experience of ,cruel
is the story of two young american backpackers josh derek richardson and paxton jay hernandez traveling across europe after graduation from university they meet a guy from iceland oli eythor gudjonsson and all end up in amsterdam together searching for drugs sex and postadolescent spring breaktype fun in europe the film is really well shot with some incredible visuals and backgrounds according to roth he filmed most of it in the czech republic after meeting an easterneuropean guy in amsterdam the trio of hungry guys head to slovenia to find a known for its beautiful easterneuropean women what they find instead is a place where beautiful young easterneuropean women collect men and women from all over the world as playthings for international torture afficianados who pay exorbiant sums of money to have their way with their unsuspecting foreign victims the nationality of each victim is understood to be part of the attraction part of each torturers desired objectfetishdebuted unrated and in an unfinished format at the toronto international film festival in september 2005 viewers felt it was one of the best horror films they had ever seen according to viewers who saw it then the horrorgoretorture scenes were graphic and explicit leading most reviewers to fear for its eventual presentation after editing for wider cinematic release thank goodness for dvds everyone suggests that then at least viewers will be able to see the deleted scenes the released film is still extremely graphic and filled with marvelous scenes of explicit gore and horror for those who like such stuff anyone who enjoys slasherhorrorgore films will be entertained roth has made an enjoyable film that is well scripted well filmed and well acted unlike most horrorslashergore flicks which spend a great deal of time focused on the traditional male on female heterosexual violence roth plays with this and turns it on its head in roths interpretation female bodies are objectified as sexual objects while his male bodies become objects for torture an interesting twist which heightens the horror of the film not to overlook the superb acting by derek richardsonwhile roths film plays with traditional horror films and to a lesser degree spring breakeuropean vacation films at the same time his film reinscribes morality heteronormativity and justice in ways that are far from innovative the good guys are americans americans when in immoral situations rise above them and make morally justifiable decisions and bad guys are tainted with homosexuality making their sadistic desires more repulsive because of their sexual orientations inevitably the goodguy american must punish the bad homosexually inclined european other in order to bring about a cycle of redemption that is traditional and normative roths film would have been more interesting if he had not fallen back on the characterizations of goodguy americans and badguy european others and instead played with the amorality of the world he is depicting the subject of roths film is at once disturbing and riveting it is important given the nature of our world today according to roth in an interview with arrow in the head he had come up with the idea when a friend had showed him an internet site which marketed such horrors we live in a world where human lives have become commodified and marketed as experiences of desire experiences that for the right price can be purchased and consumed the world roth portrays whether real or not draws attention to the fact that sexuality desire sadism torture and pain have all become a part of the greater world of capitalism we live in world where all experiences are commodified and subject to the amoral laws of the market a subject that certainly needs to be addressed on a critical level beyond the slashergorehorror aspects of roths film these fundamental problems lay at the heart of his film and need to be discussed,cruel
i must say there were several times in this movie that i just cringed and clinched my teeth i didnt know what to expect with all of the hype surrounding this movie there have been some many mtvstyle junk horror movies that have come out movies like cry wolf wolf creek the grudge have been disappointing enough on those ive already wasted too much time on them alreadythis movie is a breath of fresh air from a director eli roth that tried to make a good horror movie not just money i enjoyed cabin fever for the most part its not the best horror movie ive seen but still it was pretty good for a young director in eli roth showed growth in storytelling and in sicknessthe hype lived up to the billing the deaths and premise of the movie are all twisted and creative the scripts and performance were also very good eli roth does a very good job of creating memorable characters that add to the story the script was humorous when it needed to bealmost all of the elements with the exception of 80s rock were in this movie sex drugs hot chicks deaths and torture are all in good supply for this movie i can see why quentin tarantino put his name on this one it is definitely one of the best horror movies to come out in recent memory,cruel
i dont normally take well to scary movies i love watching them at home not in the theaterwhen i go to see a scary movie especially in the theater i want to walk out scared i want to wake up the next morning scared i want to be scared for a t least the weekend i love the movie saw and when i watched a preview for this movie i thought id love it well i found it intermittently scary with a bit of humor i love gory movies however so this ended up at the top of my list ha but this movie im not going to be scared again unless i find myself backpacking in slovakia and one of my friends comes up missing elite hunters the idea of people paying for the thrill of killing is crazy but in this sick world i could almost find it coming truethatd be the only thought that could make this movie scary or the fact that someone could be crazystupidsick enough to make a business like elite hunters the story made sense but for quentin tarantinoits not scary its just sick and gross and my achilles tendons will forever hurt at the thought of this movie,cruel
ugh i didnt bother reading the reviews and that was my own mistake but the movie wasnt spooky at all which is what my expectations were it was nonstop nudity and then nonstop gore maybe if i had been prepared for it it wouldnt have been as bad but i simply didnt enjoy it at alli enjoyed house of flying daggers that tarantino presented but this not so much moral of the story always research a movie or get a first hand review before going to see it simply because a name is attachedand please dont bring kids to this movie someone had a 6 or 7 year old in the theater that was poor judgment to say the least,cruel
dont want to be preachy or prudish i dont think im either of those but this movie is really nothing more than a gorefest with a lot of nudity the nudity was fine cute girls and all that but its essentially a torture and grossout movieprobably was more disturbed at the number of young kids at the show yeah yeah i know kids are kids but at the least enforce the under17 rule at the amc 30 in warrenville il there were quite a few under 17 kids and like 1015 yos that were there its pretty easy to get in there is no one at the movie area itself to check the age so if you have a ticket to another movie you can get inall in all though really not very scary didnt actually think it was very well made either see it for yourself and compare it to producer quentin tarentinos kill bill seriesthose movies features about as much gore and violence but far better madeas steve colbert says eli roth youre on warningand id add amc 30 youre on warning too for letting in lots of unescorted young kidsgood luck you may like it i thought it pretty much sucked,cruel
i wish there was an option of giving no stars because that is what i would have given this movie this is the worst movie i have seen in a long time maybe the worst movie i have ever seen i only wish i knew how bad it would turn out to be 30 minutes into the film so i could have gotten my money back and and done something else with those 2 hours of my life i spent watching this film the film is sex and gore so for those who love sex and gore with absolutely no plot or character development or decent story line then this is the movie for you its half sex and drugs half gore split pretty much right down the middle if your looking to see a good horror movie save your money dont be stupid like me and drag people with you to go see it telling them how awesome its going to be then be completely disappointed and also feel bad for making the other people sit through this awful awful movie dont see it,cruel
i saw this movie two days ago and i still havent gotten over it it is not that the gore that is sticking with meit is the feeling that i wasted two hours of my life it is literally like the filmmakers just decided hey guys like boobs guys like violencejackpot and lets toss in some murderous ten year olds just for good measure honestly i went to this movie knowing that i would probably not enjoy the graphic violence but i heard it had a good plot and i decided to give it a trynever again if you want to save some cash do yourself a favor watch the first half of american pie then switch over to reservoir dogs just in time for the torture sceneitll have the same effect that had,cruel
i have tried for years to understand the works of quentin tarantino and why he is so highly acclaimed but this movie didnt help me at all now before i get jumped on for this i must say that even though i dont like any of his films i have respect for anyone who can stay fresh in hollywood these days while still doing the movies he wants to do seemingly without compromising his visionnow after presenting my stance on the main driving force behind i must say why i loathed this movie i first caught a restricted trailer of this film before saw ii i was horrified at the preview even though it was no more than three minutes long now i love horror movies hence how i saw the preview but seeing how many gruesome images someone can cram into 95 minutes of film is not scary its more sad than anythingim not ripping on the violence because im squeamish but because its so over the top i like a horror movie with a fairly comprehensible storyline in not only was a decent plot nowhere in sight but it seems as if to compensate for this the torture scenes were more elaborate to divert attention from the fact that the plot was thin and the characters one dimensional so in the end you care very little about them so it isnt a big deal when they die most horror movies have at least one character that can be liked or identified with by most people on some levelfor those who like the film i am not saying anything against the fans i just cant see any appeal in it,cruel
i defy anyone to tell me that this movie was at all suspenseful scary or very graphic suspension of disbelief is relied upon for every single event in the film that moves the plot forward i thought that cabin fever wasnt very good but eli roth apparently forgot everything he knew about filmmaking prior to that movie cause this one is much much worse the sad thing is that like cabin fever the concept of the story is actually really intriguing the acting was horrible and the execution was horrible i hated every character in the movie equally but apparently i wasnt supposed to hate the hernandez character because he saw a girl drown thanks for 2 lines of crappily written dialog for a backstory im getting too mad to finish this review,cruel
my friend and i went to see this movie on its second night out in the movie theaters he had no idea what this movie was about he just likes seeing movies he enjoyed it very much and so did i and yes every thing people are writing about this movie is real and true unless they say it sux cuz it definitely does not suck yes it did take a wile to get to the point of the movie but it led u into the movie very well the scenes of blood and violence were very realistic it was a very very tense movie my friend and i both turned our heads at least once the acting was greatand as for the nudity and sex there was a lot the first half hour of the movie was nothing but boobs boobs boobs dont get me wrong these were the best looking women in the world so all in all i would definitely go see this movie again this movie will be remembered for a very long time and i will be in my movie library when it comes out,cruel
when you go to see you have an idea just from previews and commercials on tv that its about 3 backpackers josh paxton and oli that backpack in europe looking to be with some of the finest euroupean woman seen to man so you can just imagine much of the first half is beautiful naked woman who they have encounters with the first half is very funny very light hearted almost cant believe it will somehow turn into a film that will have you clutching your eyes every now and then to look away from certain sadistic scenes it was almost weird being in a theater and actually seeing people around me reacting to the torture scenes and looking away it was weird not even while watching saw this happened is directed by eli roth who also directed the much hyped cabin fever almost cant believe its the same guy doing this film there are difference between films but the humor we get in cabin fever also shines through in oh so you want to know about the torture scenes eh well in all honesty its not the blood that pops out that makes it gory but its the fact that we are seeing humans being tortured is a good enough to have anyone shaking in their boots almost makes me not ever want to backpack to another country ever lolin closing in a day and age where most tend to stay home and watch most of their movies on dvd is one film you wont regret seeing in theaters i must say the best part of watching is actually having an audience that is into it as much as i am it was great the theater experience for this film was quite like no otherget a chance to see it in theaters while you can,cruel
proves eli roth can do suspense which is great cabin fever proved he could do gore which is great was a solid disturbing and suspenseful movie yet it was not balls out extreme by any standard personally i thought cabin fever got away with more in theaterswas only disappointing because the gore was implied gore maybe once an unrated dvd comes out will we truly see what was made of dont get me wrong here the implied thoughts were sick but thats all the true gore was implied and not showni am not bashing this movie this was an awesome movie which will hopefully raise the bar for suspense this was the first good suspense film in the 21st century i guess message boards are really the reason i was disappointed message boards everywhere compared this film to the disturbing pictures like salo cannibal holocaust and men behind the sun when in fact it really didnt compare to modern movies like the devils rejects or house of wax both of these films were nothing in terms of movie quality but they sure as hell got away with a lot more than did in theatersso i am saying go see this great movie only go seeing it as a solid suspense movie not a gorefest like the previews made it out to be,cruel
the movie was just as roth had wanted it gory and suspenseful ill admit the plot made you think come on get to the good stuff to begin with as many of the intense scenes that are in the previews dont show up until later in the movie nevertheless the beginning was far from boring as it made you attach to the characters more emotionally i dont mean to contradict myself but it isnt the goriest movie ever not by far only a handful of violent acts are actually seen taking place the rest are left to the imagination which can sometimes be worse than any digital effect i dont know how much farther i can go without spoiling anything so as a guy let me tell you this violence suspense nudity what else should there be in a movie,cruel
just to be on the safe side ill acknowledge that parts of this review might spoil the film for anyone who hasnt 1 seen the previews or 2 read any of the major reviews everyone else should be able to proceed with confidencebased on imdb message boards and various reviews id guess that is supposed to be controversial some have even applied the label exploitation film to it there are a few disturbing momentsthe previews allude to at least one involving a toe and some pliers if i remember correctlybut the movie didnt scare me or even gross me out that much more than content which is of course disturbing id say that this is a matter of timing and the balance between humor and horror as with his film cabin fever roth indulges in a lot of silliness the beginning sequence of exposition which is rather long establishes a goofy tone that i dont think the balance of the film effectively subverts in fact while im no prude i found the overt sexuality of the movies first half perhaps its most disquieting elementnot because the characters are indulging in it and in fact i think their weaknesses are critical to what eventually befalls them a pretty class move but because the director is so clearly indulging in it i think hed claim some higher artistic merit too which is the maddening part not ta in general horror films and ta generally go together right now for the torture sequences sometimes roth puts it all out there for you and yes theres gorenothing particularly new though the hellraiser movies of my childhood were much worse i think sometimes he plays coy and darts away which is perhaps a relief but also irritating what he fails to do though is offer any of that slow unbearable suspense or slapintheface surprise that has distinguished earlier horror films even cabin feverim thinking here of the scene when its revealed what the dog did to that girls face the film is both breakneck in its pacing again once you get past all of that setup and completely predictable you know which characters are going to do bad things later on as soon as you meet them you know what that unfortunate disfigured girl is going to do before she does and so on,cruel
is the story of two young americans traveling through europe josh and paxton joined by icelander oli who tire of the crowd of americans in amsterdamact i desperate to find easy and beautiful women they meet a friendly european alex who tells them an unbelievable story about a small city in eastern europe that has no men theyve all been killed by civil war whats left beautiful women of course alex shows pictures of him with naked women and the three men are convinced off they go until this point roth has writtendirected a fairly standard and expected teen flick with josh as the shy and reluctant tall boy and paxton as the gruff obnoxious and egotistical leader roth plays with the theme of american greed capitalism and imperialism but only at a surface levelact ii josh paxton and oli arrive at a that is beyond their wildest dreams filled with beautiful women a spa in a charming little town this will be their heaven until they can seduce every woman available the women they meet are modernday sirens luring the men in order to sell them for the exhibit oli disappears first then josh paxton at first full of bravado is now forced into action and once he discovers josh his innards exposed after a gruesome torture scene hes forced into the role of prey its only a chance moment the torturer slipping that paxton survivesact iii paxton escapes and enacts vengeance on several of those responsible for josh and oliroth starts slow and gets stronger in act ii but he cant carry the weight of either the antiamerican theme nor the gruesome terror the shock value wears off rather fast though jay hernandez does a commendable job however his is the only character that has any arc unfortunately roth manages to tie everything in a nice bow rather than leaving story and ending up to the imagination,cruel
i gave this movie a 2 for a few reasons and the reasons are the movie took to long to get started and it also developed slowly the whole torture thing isnt torture its more less someone getting their kicks from killing people why because torture is about making someone suffer other than just killing them because they can torture is about making someone mentally scared for the rest of there life its the whole fear of dying or fear of pain not death if you want to see this movie id wait to rent it in three or four months cause thats what its worth so take my advice and wait til it comes out and until then we can only wait til a true horror movie comes out,cruel
was a big disappointing for me i had been looking forward seeing this movie for a long time taratinos name was almost bigger then the actual name of the movie on the posters and so your hopes go even higher after seeing that when i walked in out of the theater i wondered if he ever saw the movie the first 60 minuets of the movie is just 100 nudity so much that i felt strange and after the movie it ran through my mind if they where trying to win the audients with that well it just looked ridicules finally we started to see some action after 6070 minuets the torture seemed real but it wasnt as scary as i thought it would be the audients didnt really got to see anything except how scared the characters where and every time the throw up then the movie becomes a normal james bond movie eli roth had a good story when he has practice some ill watch the remakethese thinks i found funny the list below contains spoilersthe music was way too loud and did not in any way fit the movie  when you are watching a cowboy film from 1960 happening in the desert youll always see some kind of a tree ball roiling in the warm wind past the camera when youre watching a action film happening in mexico a hungry skinny dog walks past the camera in this movie a poodle dog walks past the camera in this country where you cant find a building with every four walls hanging on and no ones got money i cried i laughed so much  why didnt the just crash into the children did the movie suddenly had to have some horror limed  what did the japanese girl expected to see in the mirror after her eye had been burned out why was she so surprised  when the paxton jay hernandez escaped how did he know that the kinky eating with his hand man on the train killed his friend only josh derek richardson knew that,cruel
i was all excited to go see this movie the reviews ive heard said it would be one of the scariest movies it wasnt it was however disturbing seeing the previews and hearing that some people were being taken out by paramedics and others were passing out was all bogus the crowd at the theater was laughing at certain parts that were not funny and werent intended to be i read all these reviews that were making it seem like a real horror one that would finally live up to the standards it was more grotesque than anything i liken it to the texas chainsaw massicure what was all the hype about i could see worst things in movies like house of 1000 corpes or even aliens it was good to an extent i cant wait to see if the come out with either an unrated version or directors cut on dvd perhaps then it will truly be the horror it was hyped to be,cruel
well in a few ways has it ups and downs for one thing this movie is really really good dont get me wrong most horror movies in the first 30 to 45 minutes drag on unless u saw white noise that totally sucked this is the way that they should make horror movies u do not produce it by mtv and u dont put any famous actors in it i know jay hernandez is a somewhat known actor but everybody else u probably never heard oftheres stuff worse out there from faces of death to even traces of death when u got the mpaa on board u have the idea that your movie will get cut down from an nc17 rating to a rated r rating and that cuts out the worse parts of the movie that u either have to see online or get the uncut version that comes out in the future eli roth made cabin fever that movie was actually pretty good its all suspenseful and good to the point and doesnt dragthis movie is good just that i wish some theaters let it come out nc17 the true way that eli roth made it,cruel
my only question is this why is quentin tarantinos name even on this film they should rename the film breasts and blood maybe that way it would make some sense and the viewer would have a complete picture of what they were about to get themselves into lets talk about unnecessary nudity dont get me wrong i like a little nudity in a horror flick in fact its usually expected but this movie goes far and beyond the point of normal there is so much needless nudity that it actually becomes a turnoff and now the blood oh boy the blood i dont like ruining movies regardless of how bad they were but lets just say you wont be gasping in terror youll be cringing at how they cover just about every way there is to make a movie goer reach for a body part and go ouchhh i can almost feel that aside from the above mentioned the movie does merit watching but only in a group and only if your willing to laugh through the entire movie with the rest of the audience i personally hate when people cheer and comment during a movie but in this case its simply necessaryoh and as for kabinky dont worry it doesnt give anything away its just the only think my friends and i took out of that movie that and some nacho cheese,cruel
built up to be the bloodiest and most terrifying film of the decade fell far from what is expected cabin fever was nothing special an poor mans evil dead is you ask me is a pointless ride yes there is blood not the amount gorefilm goers desire saw was gorier and smarter the fact the entire 1st half of the film is about gratuitous sex and naked women makes the second half seem like a different movie if roth needed to rely on wellendowed women and constant drug use to make this film interesting go watch a real horror movie the only good thing about the movie is the foreign actors who make jay hernandez and the guy from dumb  dumberer look pathetic sorely disappointed in both tarantino and rothdo not bother,cruel
this movie was really quite disappointing the first half had a slow build up with a lot of excess dialog and then the second half seemed really rushed and halfassed similar to saw i think the plot of the movie was great but it could have been better executed on film some of the makeup  effects looked cheesy and when the action finally does come it was rushed and just seemed sloppy and thrown together i also love how they use quentin tarantino on the posters to promote the movie when he didnt write direct or even cameo in the movie he was the executive producer wtf dont rush to see this one it is definitely a renter in my opinion,cruel
this does not contain a spoiler but will let you know what you are in for ive seen previews of this movie for a long time and was very eager to watch it they made it seem real scary didnt they well unless you cant handle true horror like halloween and a few nasty scenes which to me arent all that nasty thanks to quick camera shots  youll be finethe movie spends about 45 min which feels like the entire movie in a crappy version of eurotrip then comes a nasty and scary bit in the middle and then for the what it seemed like last 10 min of the movie a scary thrilleri will admit this movie had potential with the set and suspense but still it failed as a movie also the humour and cameo by rick hoffman ruined the tone of the moviehope i save you 8 bucks410,cruel
just recently saw salo the 120 days of sodom which reminded me quite a bit of this movie and the underlying message as someone in the last post had mentioned the movie revolves around merciless torture and humans inflicting pain on other humans so why was the theater crammed full of people when i saw it tonight anybody seen both movies and see where im going with thisbasically i think the movies are very similar in message i wouldnt be surprised to hear that eli roth knew of salo they both have that car crash element everybody knows whats in store but they wanna see or experience it themselves not unlike the characters in the movie what do you think,cruel
how can i say this quentin tarantino is no person to listen to when choosing a horror flick he doesnt know horror he doesnt know jack was this a horror flick yes was it realistic yes does it scare you yes if you have the intellect of a troglodyte and you puddle when nervous but predictable gawd how predictable could this movie possibly be the scene with the chainsawi laughed my ass off i mean who laughs at people being tortured the second guy to be killed josh at least his acting was realistic everyone else was so stone cold boring bland and blas it smacked of auschwitz with its racism hatred and lack of respect for human life and existence and to be honest i thought that part of it was rather a turnoff when is this world going to come to its senses and leave those kinds of pains and ugliness in the past and to top it all off why does the directorwriter assume that it would be a bunch of idiots backpacking across europe that would get themselves in this kind of predicament i say scrap the whole dang thing and watch porno that was the only part of it that was the least bit entertaining dont even buy the video suckola,cruel
wow what potential this film had billed as the most terrifying american movie in a decade had all the marketing savvy to lead me to believe i was in for one helluva ride alas this was not to be the case sorry to say considering the interesting premise incidentally the pseudoretro its only a movie campaign is nothing more than a con jobfrom the seemingly endless beginning leading up to the action to the failure to make me give a damn about any of the leading characters to the mildly satisfying ending left me secure in the knowledge that once again id allowed myself to get suckered out of 10 and 1 hour and 50minutes of my life i should have known right from the credits  quentin tarantino presents when there are indeed two additional producers  that this whole project was your typical hollywood baitandswitch and incidentally even if roth had been allowed to retain every frame of violence shot his inability to build suspense renders this footage and this film completely ineffectivewhat makes the failure of this film all the more tragic is that roth does succeed in two or three ohsofleeting moments to genuinely terrify without citing spoilers allow me to say that these brief moments demonstrate that hes paid attention at some point to an important lesson or twoi just have to throw this ini didnt know precisely what would happen during the course of this film i knew the general premise and that pretty much interested me in seeing this no matter what the marketing campaign had to say as hard as i tried i simply could not care about the characters sympathize with their fear and plight let go of the plot holes or suspend disbeliefnow on the other hand marcus nispels remake of the texas chainsaw massacre had the completely opposite effect on me going in i knew exactly what would happen  almost framebyframe so much so that i was all but convinced i was wasting my time however and what a pleasant however this is marcus succeeded in scaring that daylights out of me and without nearly the gore roth felt compelled to use the secret suspense and artistry chainsaw had me completely hooked on every level  visually aurally  viscerally i remember walking out of that picture and calling everyone i knew to just say hinow that was a horror movie unfortunately pales in comparison,cruel
since director eli roths father dr sheldon roth is a prominent psychiatrist and clinical professor at harvard medical school id sure like to hear this mans viewpoint as a psychoanalyst as well as a father on which is a perfect example of his sons sadistic mind and black heart this film definitely promotes cruelty of the worst kind to othersid really wonder if dr roth would actually defend for his sons sake or would he be able to offer those interested an honest unbiased opinion of elis loathsome hateful movie which was clearly made by his son solely for the purpose of making a whole pile of money by handing us the audience through the graphic depiction of hideous torture the most excruciating example of human suffering imaginablewith elis grandparents being immigrants from austria which is a country situated right next door to slovakia where s horrific story takes place im also questioning whether this close proximity of s vile story to his grandparents homeland was in some way elis screwy way of showing us all his utter contempt for his ancestors and his nonamerican heritagei understand that in his late teens eli roth was an online cybersex operator for penthouse magazine in this undoubtedly rewarding line of work eli posed as a woman he was also a production assistant for a number of penthouse porn filmsand finally  it really figures that the likes of that slimedirector quentin tarantino would have his name attached as producer to this truly vile and abominable picture from start to finish i could clearly see tarantinos despicable snotencrusted presence smeared all over this one,cruel
when i first saw the preview for this film i said to my guy this looks like saw and he agreedplot three single men two american and one icelandic travel to amsterdam netherlands to get their freak on when they return to their the manager locks them out because he will not let anyone in after midnight in need of a place to rest they manage to bunk at some other guys place he tells them if they want to get freaky with a lot girls slovakia is where they should go however little do they know they are in for a real deadly surprisea lot of horror films have either he same plot or the same feel so that is why the movie is a bit clich while writerdirector eli roth takes bits and pieces from other films like the two american backpackers an american werewolf in london eurotrip the hotel psycho the wax museum tourist traphouse of wax the body parts body shopdr gore he shows the viewer that the women are smarter than the men and how some serial killers are sexually turned on by the murder and torture in this film slovakian businessmen decide that instead of selling woman for sex they will sell humans for dismemberment the males will be sold to the homosexual men and the females to the heterosexual menthe movie starts off very slow and sluggish to the point where it is just boring where is the horror and suspense it is at the middle close to the end of the film what happened i read an article that an nc17 rating was supposed to be given but there was a lot of editing done to make the film r rated there seemed to be too much editing but there was still plenty of blood and guts to go around moreover like in an american werewolf in london there is some dark humor however if you are a real horror fan then wait for the directors cut also if you are a new horror buff check out any alfred hitchcok film and see where it all beganif you decide to see it in the theater be warned that what ever you do dont eat popcorn or anything during or before this film,cruel
note my comments refer to the unfinished version of the movie ive seen the final cut and a bit of careful editing has resolved most of my issuesi saw this movie at the toronto film festival this year and i have only a few things to say that you cant get from the other comments and reviews drink a red bull for the first third of the movie because it is boring all the character buildup stuff all the development of the socalled plot all the setup as the characters travel across europe to slovakia snore the actors are decent but the characters are just so twodimensional and uninteresting that all the life injected into their performances is wasted worse yet you arent going to this movie to see interesting and deep characters which makes the first 25 minutes of the movie even more wastefulbut when they get to their destination and strange things start occurring well eli roth is not much of a writer but as a director and creator of gruesome and terrible things he shines the villains are evil the heroes are disturbing and the climax and denouement such as it was left everyone in the theatre shocked aghast and cheeringoverall i give it 45 for style and 25 for substance resulting in my 6 overall score,cruel
you are unlikely to find another contemporary american horror movie with as much intensity and style as this one while it pales against some of the contemporary asian flicks it aspires towards ichi sympathy for mr vengenace is nonetheless a strong contender for the most intense american horror film made with stylish gruesomeness intact a fine addition to this years toronto international film festival midnight madness slot even in the workinprogress formwhile cabin fever had the usual slew of volunteer actors i found that several performances in this flick were top notch transcending the genre ghetto into real capitala acting jan vlask is great as the creepy trainmain but particular note must be made of jay hernandezs paxton role i dont think ive ever seen a twenty something role played with as much believability in some time he totally nails the americanineurope schtick without ever overdoing it while some of his acting compatriots strut their stuff in scenes of agony hernandez actually rises above it all and creates a nuanced completely authentic performanceshot in prague the locations are suitably decrepit you can almost feel the smarmyness of the the rank of the dungeons the smell of the hash in the amsterdam sex clubs if you think too hard about the flick youll find all kinds of clever interplay between the early scenes where the boys are lecherous schmucks to the setting of their eventual doom but that would be silly this is popcorn fun with poppedout eyeballs ample buckets of blood without overdoing it to the point of comic overexuberence at times this film is downright badassin an age of pg13 horror flicks taking the theatres by storm its hard to see what wide audience a flick of this nature will find still its got enough of a plot to keep it interesting and enough intensity when it finally arrives to please all by the most jaded of genre fans not a masterpiece but certainly a fun ride and with the help of rabid support from the likes of exec producer qt it should do very well among a select audience of horror fans lets all hope that roth continues to learn from the masters and that he finds success in bringing this type of stylish gore to mainstream american cinemas,cruel
not sure what has been said about this one but i saw it just over a week ago eli roth presented an unfinished version of the movie with all the sex and violence still in it what was said in the other review on here is all true the level of gore and violence is extreme not necessarily in its graphic nature although that is there but more because this is not fantasy violence its all human on human actions with some very nasty people and a very bleak final comment on human nature at least thats how i read it i enjoyed the first 45 mins as we get to know the protagonists a little before they head into the real story and the blood starts to flow this will definitely satisfy the gore hounds and sadists out there as well as anyone that just likes to see a cool horror movie hats off to eli roth and quentin tarentino for not compromising and coming up with the goods i am interested to see whats lost when it gets its cinema release,cruel
well thats nearly two hours of my life i will never get back awful movie which relies on gratuitous use of gore to keep a thin plot together go watch some classic 70s  80s horror instead and leave this garbage where it belongs  in the bin,cruel
eli roth gets a lot of praise in the horror community im not sure why this movie is 80 percent dumb pornlike junk and then a little horror at the end,cruel
its important to start off by saying that i am not in any way a fan of gore or torture porn i fins these horror subgenres to be in very poor taste at best i recognize zero cinematic or otherwise artistic value in blowing your arts and visual effects budget on blood puss and other bodily fluids or severed organs particularly when i get to watch them actually being severed i dont enjoy it and i try to avoid films flaunting the use of these features the way did still after all the buzz i simply had to check it outim writing this review after watching it for the second and it seems i have forgotten pretty much everything but the main plot revolving around torture indeed there are plenty of scenes i would have rather not watch but lets give credit when its due  is far from tasteless the gory scenes are not just out there for no reason but in order to present a realistic and believable human phenomenon as both the main fear factor and a pinch of social criticism what keeps you afraid is not the use of cheap jump scares blissfully absent in this film nor the disgusting gore its how you relate to the characters and experience the fear of whats about to happen to them through their eyes and experiences the build up towards the torture as people are tied up and realize that every single type of pain is about to be inflicted and theres nothing they can do about it received more screen time than the torture itself the helplessness and terror are delivered professionally and amazinglyon this note the film is absolutely taken to the next level by eli roths direction of the characters and the casts ability to play the role in the most professional and impressive way possible jay hernandez paxton and derek richardson josh played the terror of anticipating their impending torture in a manner that was terrifying and authentic stressing what a raw deal they received in their casting in suicide squad and dumb and dumber respectively barbara nedeljakova natalya and jana kaderabkova svetlana are so much more than eye candy though admittedly not painful to look at to say the least as the s occupants delivering their role in the most realistic manner imaginable and to top it all  rick hoffman american client and petr janis german surgeon are as discomforting terrifying and revolting as youd expect meeting every possible standardoriginally i rated a 5 due to being younger less experienced and honestly less fair its improper to criticize a gore torture flick for showing gore and torture i know that now my new more appropriate rate is 7 meant to reflect the overall level of the film while accounting for what i found to be a wanting plot and an unfortunate lack of a final twist also some of the scenes were simply too much and frankly unnecessary if youre a fan of gore and torture porn  youre in for a real treat if youre not  think hard before you decide to watch this as it will take you places you might not have wanted to visit or experience,cruel
the excess of negative reviews here is in this case a reflection of how well this movie works its one of the few recent american movies that qualifies as real horror the worst possibility comes to fruition every prejudice and suspicion manifesting as far worse than the protagonists could imagine this is what horror does best  bring ones darkest fears to life,cruel
the concept for is amazing the fact that it reminds me of human trafficking which really does happen in real life is interesting the film is awful though in itself and eli roth didnt know how to write or shoot the movie its way to gritty and gruesome swearing is throughout the whole film it only hinders the movie and does it no favors whatsoever eli roth probably didnt pay much attention in film school someone needs to teach him how to make a great horror movie thats scary and creepy not a crock of crap the acting is as bad as anything else jay hernandez shouldve never auditioned for this film everyone in the cast must be desperate for work this movie has mainly no storyline just torture and the killers cutting off their victims body parts the special effects maybe cool to watch on the behind the scenes feature dvd but in the film its way to graphic and explicit shock value should not be the main source for trying to create scares it only disguises the viewer and make them want to throw up this is awful and im shocked that the studios and production companies decided to go through with making this pile of junkfor an overall rating i give 2 and 12 stars,cruel
stars jay hernandez derek richardson eythor gudjonsson and barbara nedeljakova including jana kaderakova and jan vlasak it was directed and written by eli roth the director of inglorious bastards knock knock clown and also the sequel part ii is very strong and graphic in all ways possible the idea of it is amazing but something mustve went wrong during production because the turnout of the film in the end is completely terrible its a flush the dvd down your toilet type of horror film im shocked that the studios and the production companies decided to go through with making this movie its a shame that they produced the wrong horror film when another amazing one couldve been made instead of this trashheaped garbage the horror factor is nothing scary or creepy only blood and guts body parts being torn and the film is mainly pure torture nothing to get excited about or want to see again and again and again so on and so forth this movie should be banned from all stores that sell dvds and on the internet sites like amazon should not have this movie in stock the fact that this movie reminds me of human trafficking is somewhat interesting because it does happen in real life having said that theres nothing else in this movie that makes it worth a second viewing or even to watch it on halloween its a load of crap with terrible dialogue and way to graphically over the top extreme violence with gore featuring tones of cuss words which horror films can do without or very little of if you own this movie throw it out just know that this film is the kind that is banned in certain countries i wish that it was never made eli roth should be ashamed of himself we want new horror thats good and creative not the same old junk that has been coming out what seems like every year or so since he went to film school i wonder at times if he really paid attention on how to make great films or if he was just in a rush to get into the industry if i knew what i know now i wouldve never watched this film in the first place im glade that i saw this piece of junk for free its in my grandmas movie collection otherwise i wouldnt have even paid a penny to see this we need better horror films than this we need scary and creepy not gore swearing and all of this graphic nudity and sex scenes they put in now a days that distracts the viewers and they cant really concentrate on the storyline with nudity and sex every ten to fifteen minutes within the film its not worth anything save your money for a great film that will wow you this film will just make horror fans feel dumb that they got tricked out of their money and want to smack themselves in the faceoverall its a thumbs down2 and 12 stars,cruel
missing lots of good scares this film was just gore all over no story no detail just gore and lots of nudity as a horror fan i dont like these type of films a waist of time this movie is dont see it if you do you will throw it right in the trash this movie flipped out terrible all over where can i begin with the spoiler or spoilers first off theres a scene where the film starts off nudity wise and the characters are having sex all over this made the film flip out even more why do they make these movies i dont know now for the end of the film in the end one of the guys survive and gets on a train so he ends up killing this other guy in a bathroom and blood spills out he gets on another train and the movie ends overall bad dont see it,cruel
by far it is the most horrible film i have ever seen in my life out of the most horrible perversion the sadism it is the worst images are so cruel that somebody has to be sick to shoot them every honest and decent men had to thrown out seeing this film sick film you feel nasty feelings sadism as pure essence this demonstrates that the world is going wrong this film is not for regular people it is for seriously damaged brains human being does not deserve this type of films trash trash i would delete this film from the earth it had to censored such criminal images in order to shoot this images and keep looking at them open eyes somebody has to have a non sensible soul,cruel
this film gets my vote for worst film of the current era of film making not only is it without imagination it is the personification of gratuitous gore and it has a mindless story line i feel sorry for the young actors involved with this project and i feel sorry for the movie going public who has to put up with movies of such poor quality when you plonk down 1000 it would be nice to think you are getting something that has some thought involved this film also marks the start of a trend i call modern junk which to me is comprised of what is essentially bad student movies that have ben tagged for development by the big studiosthere are many films like this out now in the horror style and none of the are any good when i went to see this one i left halfway through it it was that rotten,cruel
i must admit i wasnt looking forward to seeing this however my initial judgement was wrong and this is a very good movie on the whole im not a fan of gore usually but this made me change my opinion i especially liked the bit where the guy chops paxtons fingers off goes to get the chainsaw and slips on the fingers and cuts himself in half for a modern day movie this was fantastic id recommend it to anyone on top of a good cast and realism there is a great soundtrack including slovakian music also the fact that this could happen its not aliens monsters or vampires it could be true granted slovakia isnt the 1st place on your list to go to after youve seen this but it deserves a lot of credit,cruel
i have sworn a solemn oath to never again subject myself or anyone close to me to any film written andor directed by eli roth after having the unfortunate experience of sitting through the entire length of this pathetic excuse for a horror moviei really have some genuine pity for people growing up with todays wretched collection of modern horror films amidst the deluge of bad remakes ie when a stranger calls and texas chainsaw massacre and unoriginal shocking new ones ie saw darkness falls stands at the forefront as the very worst of the bunch so far at least and i havent seen part 2  which i daresay will be even worse though i have no intention of ever seeing iti had the good fortune to grow up in the 80s and bear witness to the truly awesome horror films that came out in that decade when people had to come up with other ways to scare you than just shocking goreokay lets pick this atrocious film apart characters  lame american tourists very hard to care whether they live or diedialogue  opening line is amsterdam mthrfckr enough said but ill go on  it never gets any better than that little gem plot  stretches believability beyond breaking point even for a dodgy horror movie things we are expected to swallow whole include but are definitely not limited to 1 that there is a in darkest eastern europe populated only by gorgeous women in their 20s uh huh2 that a girl can be heard screaming from outside a building even when she is locked in a dungeonlike labyrinth of tunnels underground3 that the exact 3 people you need to get revenge on will suddenly turn up in darkest eastern europe though they live in amsterdam and furthermore that they will all stand in a straight line and remain still enough for you to run them down with your car4 that our hero can find and execute each and every person who wronged him practically in the same order they appeared in the moviei could go on and on but frankly this movie is not worth the time if i can convince just one person to not see this movie ever i have done my job,cruel
i dont care what anybody says is an amazing film it was the first horrorslasher flick to actually scare the bejesus out of me of course i was intoxicated the first time i saw it but i saw it sober the next day and couldnt believe what i was watching i wasnt a big fan of cabin fever but eli roth gained my respect with this movieof course the fact that tarentino had something to do with this movie adds to its magic im only 19 years old but every movie of his that i have seen i instantly fell in love with im also a huge horror film freak so that helpsand dont worry just because this movie depicts bratislava as pretty much hell on earth it isnt it is a very beautiful city and slovakia has a lot of things to offer to tourists just stay away from stoned russian dudes named alex while vacationing in amsterdammy grade for this movie a definitely a must see,cruel
its really hard to review this film without using bad words which i know imdb wouldnt allow so ill try to keep things civil this is a sick sick film and not in the good way not in the tarantino is so cool because of the way he looks at violence kind of way just in the perverted amoral sickminded somebody seriously needs to get some therapy kind of way yeah that kind of sick the kind of sick film that you cant have any fun watching because you can tell the person who made it is truly as depraved as he seems the kind of horror film that offers no horror other than what is behind the scenes the horror of eli roths mind the filth and sleaze that lies within it the kind of film where physical violence is conceptualized as a kind of pornography and where youre supposed to get your i heart torture jollies watching it think snuff films think those real death videos that you see in the bin at the slurpnsnort on the interstate thats the level that rothtarantino were stopping to here and though someone will certainly argue that roth is so cool because he draws your attention to social phenomena blah blah blah mental masturbation and its a reflection of intellectual spew which shows us how we artist wannabe claptrap no its petty its disgusting its vile its corrupt its debauched  and eli roth wants you to think its art,cruel
so the review quoted on the dvd case of calls it the goriest sickest bloodiest movie youll ever ever see there are quite clearly a lot of horrorgoreexploitation movies that this reviewer needs to catch up on and now having wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this crap my only positive feeling is that the film was rented rather than purchasedis a good idea put into completely the wrong hands  sorry eli roth but ill not bother with this years sequel or the next few films you direct whatever their content this movie is poorly conceived has no credibility at all in its effects and is repugnantly racist in its portrayal of eastern europeans the only element of the film that disturbed me in any way whatsoevermaybe im just too jaded and desensitised  possibly something to do with watching the guinea pig series far too many times  but was about as horrific as bambi and about as engrossing as housework avoid at all costs,cruel
eli roth is essentially the quentin tarrantino of horror there i said it the man takes influences from all over and fuses them together into his own creative projects and is no different you got the torture from the audition and reservoir dogs you got the basic premise of american werewolf in paris two american tourists in a foreign country find themselves in a bloody situation and of course eli roths own creative spins those little kids rockedbut the cherry to this very tasty cake has to be the inner social commentary roth laid under the subtext he tackles the subject of getting a high essentially basically asks what happens when you can no longer find a high to reach what happens when drugs sex extreme sports and just about any other method to achieve that state no longer brings you there what will you turn too what will some people be willing to do in order to feel that high again or at least a new form of it and its true our society is a violent on in nature so its not that hard to believe that someone in that state of mind would be willing to pay to kill someone elseanyway thats all i have to say for this film it was a brilliant film one of the best horror films of the last decade eli roth and the splat pack are bringing the balls and feeling back into horror long live eli roth alexandre aja rob zombie neil marshell and james wan the new horror gods,cruel
garbage i hate that i went and spent money to see this in the theater dumbest movie all year and i own a movie store so i have seen a lot of movies if i wanted to see a cheap porn i would have spent the 3 bucks instead of the 10 that i had to pay the previews for this movie were so misleading i thought i was going to see a good horror film and instead was shocked to see that the whole movie was crap until the last 153o minutes of the film i cant believe people actually liked this movie and scary when unless you count the fact that they randomly throw sex scenes and naked woman  thats scary they couldnt even think of a full 1 hr 30 min movie that they had to fill in the rest of the 1 hour in with garbage no movie has ever disappointed me like this one i hope these people never make another movie cause in my opinion they havent made a movie yet,cruel
its hard for me to give this movie a rating i am torn between 9 stars and 2 stars this is possibly the most depraved nightmarish most sickening horror film ive ever seen except that even im not sure whether that makes it an excellent film or a piece of s that wouldve been better left unmade however i shouldnt have been too surprised by such unhinged sadism after saw had such success i shouldve known that irresponsible sadism would hit its stride in horror not that there wasnt any before but while saw is supremely idiotic and utterly logicfree is not as farfetched though that isnt saying much actually saw being so incredibly dumb there is no question that a criminal soft word here operation such as paytotorture is not only realistic but could even already exist in some form to criticize the movie on the basis of its basic premise ill leave to the realitychallenged what is farfetched to the point of ludicrousness is that such a crime net would involve such a large number of people practically an entire town and perhaps even the whole state of slovakia  in this case im not sure if that was implied or not ah yes the slovakians must be thrilled about this movie needless to say its probably banned there and elli roth the writerdirector is probably at the top of everyones slist and heres the other point about the premise it wouldve been far more realistic if set in some african or especially south american country while a solid choice if the choices were limited to europe slovakia is hardly an ideal choice in general as for europe russia ukraine byelorussia all those would have done however paraguay or bolivia or some such semideveloped country wouldve been more realistic though i admit a little less effective since the movie is out for realism and not fantasy i think the main characters escape is ludicrous sure the movie wouldve been even tougher to watch if there hadnt been a good dose of revenge at the end but the escape was too easy  relatively speaking the sadism is selfindulgent and clearly stemming from a sick mind elli roth can talk all he wants about wanting to make a truly frightening film which he succeeded in no argument there and that he researched for it blablabla but the bottom line is that roth is a mental patient just as those cretins who did saw are kids will watch this and they shouldnt hell even i shouldnt be watching such sickening depravity there is no real point to the movie except on the dumbest level ie dont go backpacking to remote places or make friends with strangers or have sex with russian girls whose breasts are too good to be true the film is a sheer exercise in the most degenerate kind of enjoyment in physical torture and should be liked only by psychopaths sociopaths and other paths i am anything but a proponent of the golden age of film ie the nave 30s and 40s with their mostly dull and silly movies but it is interesting to compare dracula from the 30s with something like this how far has it all gone or how low has the world sunk never mind that the movie is fascinating and unforgettable so are trainwrecks but that doesnt mean we should have them and enjoy them trust tarantino that prototype of a 90s geek to give this thing his blessing the fact that someone as retarded as him spearheads modern us cinema is truly sad leading directors of the past were hardly intellectuals but next to quentin they were gods this little nerd who so perversely and gleefully enjoys sadism and torture would scream like not one but 38 little girls if a psychopath so much as said hello to him people like him need a reality check to treat torture as a form of mindless entertainment is a sign of high retardation and having the moral sense of a lizard that is why ive always called him an idiot savant a moron genius talented but utterly hollow no substance there visually the movie is highly effective roth is clearly very talented the chamber scenes are unbelievably somber and compliments for not directing them in the mtv style which would have made it all less effective because less realistic the atmosphere roth creates in the dungeons is uniquely brilliant a drawback which i nearly forgot considering the other aspects is that the movie takes a halfhour to get started which i hate in horror films i believe in the evil dead school of horrorfilmmaking where no minute is wasted,cruel
is a good film although this films begin the one of the torture to dice a very good result in the millionaire numbers and him siege the list the hills have eyes the descent saw 2 and 3 and at the moment tourist ones but this is one exepcion is an excrement inn makes see the side us but dark of the humanity in addition that excites to us with its good scenes of porno in addition the europe actresses are so beautiful the case is is a good film but he is not a classic one nor no to blockbuster of summer if collection 52 million dollars but has great scenes of fear and torture that would that you remain with open mouth and makes us reflect to that badness degree this the humanity but is not what i hoped i hoped that there were persecutions with chainsaw and there are some revolting scenes the point is candle is a great film of terror you altar to awhile pass of anguish and good clear condition and porno,cruel
if you enjoy the occasional bflick with a nice amount of gore you might be tempted to see dont the characters are lame the story almost nonexisting and the bloodnguts are not scary but simply wildly disgusting the diminutive plot has been done to death already in much better filmseven though the genre does not call for spectacular writing or even a deeper meaning the better horrorgoremovies at least has an interesting idea an unsuspected twist or a psychological depth to character development is completely stripped of any intelligent ingredients1 star for gorgeous girls in fullfrontal and for providing a fairly convincing and creepy although very clich eastern european backdrop to all the gruesome stupidity,cruel
hey this comment contains spoilersim not sure why quentin tarrantino decided to associate his decent name in any way with this dog of a movie which is yet another in a recent series of xenophobic slasher filmswrong turn the hills have eyes house of wax texas chainsaw massacre and now apparently touristas go home which i havent seen but im guessing i dont need to that derives its socalled horror from the cultural and racial biases of its white middle class viewer constituency in the clich clan of killcrazy hillbillies has been changed out for a town filled with callous desperate eastern europeans willing to kidnap and sell modelesquire meatheaded americans to the highest bidder prostituting them if you will to a sort of brothel where the very rich can pay to play out their most depraved fantasies of torture rape and murder you cant really feel too bad for the americans though the first half of the film depicts the main characters as basically a bunch of unlikeable buttheaded jocks who spend all of their time vapidly pursuing drugs and poontang so its hard to really empathize or even care when the dudely protagonists are later forced to race through a postindustrial hell of rusty grating and secret dungeons towards salvation from their rich tormentors who are as onedimensional and uninteresting as their prey what i hated most about this film was not that it was dimwitted poorly scriptedshot conventional and just plain not scary though it was all of those things but that it was sexist racist classist meanspirited and misanthropic i know thats a lot of social criticism to heap onto any movie but it seems warranted given that itself is sorely lacking any kind of social criticism unless we are supposed to believe that the films central trope in which all rich men are depicted as secretly evil is supposed to pass for some kind of class critique and based on the outtakes the filmmakers seem just as dull and stupid as their protagonists speaking as a huge fan of horror films both crappy and otherwise i dont make such accusations lightly i have an incredibly high tolerance for tastelessness gore and misanthropy but more than any film ive seen in the past 5 years left me with an incredibly bad taste in my mouth and this is coming from someone who liked american psycho there certainly are interesting social issues brought up by the plot of such a film but only accidentally when it comes down to it only knows how to be exploitative,cruel
this was one terrible movie next to devils rejects probably the stupidest horror movie yet tarrantino is a moron his name is there to sucker you into the theater and then the reaming begins this was almost as bad as that kill bill crapdidnt i see this killing humans can be fun plot in a van damme movie the main actors sucked and the viewer is happy to see them die too bad that jerk lived in the end and the asian girl who is rescuedhow did her eyeball pop out of her skull via blowtorch whats the deal with the little kids as criminals blood and guts are not entertaining or scary whats scary about some dufus pulling out a dead guys organs whats so frightening about a story on why the killer could never become a surgeon whyscrew it im not writing anything else about this garbage avoid,cruel
i truly hated this movie it had no point this started out like an average horror movie did and then it just turned gross i was watching this with my girlfriend and she was very offended by the pornographic sex in thisthe first half of the film is just plain porno the next part starts out with torturing and killing its sadistic and its very wrong this film should have been banned i still cant get some of the nasty images out of my mindits about a group of backpackers that go to europe for fun they end up having fun but when a few pass out they wake up in a where they are tortured and eventually killedthere is so much of blood and gore that it makes me puke dont see it if too much is nasty i thought the whole movie was gross and poorly directed,cruel
i think that is all i could really say this film is terrible truly truly terriblethe tagline to this film welcome to your worst nightmare is fitting everything about was ludicrous and for lack of a better word rubbishit is my personal belief that those behind this film set out with the sole intention of making as much money as the could with as little effort as possible and that goes for producer to director to actor all involved have a lot to answer forit has no redeeming features whatsoeverthe plot is absolutely ridiculous and both the performances and direction were lacklustre at bestthe amount of gore is simply sickening and there is no justification for it at allthis film isnt even really a horror film you could get the exact same experience from visiting a slaughter houseor poking yourself in the eye theres no fear or suspense involved its just disgustingavoid it like the plague,cruel
this film is truly awful full stop for the first hour we are treated to a couple of clichd teenagers running around amsterdam for some more clichd sex and drugs  expecting a trashy horror movie i was a little surprised at this point forcing me to check the dvd case to ensure i was watching the right moviethen came the horror bits  essentially more clichd teenage angst with lots of ooooh clichd scary jumpy bits which weve all seen a million times before finally the appalling convenient revenge ending where the writer should have been the victim not the actorsup there with jeepers creepers 2 as one of my most hated movies,cruel
there is no plot all it is a bunch of friends wanting to get laid many many times they meet a strange guy on a train who ends up torturing the friends oh my favorite part is when the main character was driving the car and hit the two girls who put him in the situation to start gosh what a coincidence the girls just happened to be there as they some how explode when being hit at 30 mph by the car the torture scenes were very short but the softcore porn wasnt i have to say though that the acting was good and the directing had some decent moments there were some good shots im not dissing eli roth the guy has talent but he cant write a script i just dont see how anyone can compare this with saw saw is one of the most original horrorthrillers ever thiswell it wasnt even closeso overall i give the directing a 8 acting an 8 originality a 7 editing a 7 message a 4 and plot a 1oh the message is think twice about getting laid with strange woman in different countries,cruel
well what we have hereyeah so was a cool movie with decent acting and castthe movie contained some scenes and probably not worth watching with the whole family but overall is really coolthe plot is nice and i think that is it really true are there really people in the world who give money and perform dissection on other people crazy if its really truethe two girls are cool the main actor in lead is good and can show emotionsthe movie gets very disturbing at several points like in the end when they chinese girl had her eyeball plucked from her eye socketeweeethat was a scene when i started pukinglol overall is not a bad attempt to a horrorsuspense moviebut it could have been much better if you like horror and bloody movies you will surely like this movie cheers,cruel
a day after watching i still cannot help but ask myself where was the horror because besides a small five minute scene which was not all too terrifying i cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would define this as a horror movie its not its just silly throwaway trashthe plot as most of us who have read anything about it know is that three guys two americans and an icelandic guy they meet up with are in europe looking to sleep with lots of women does not seem to matter as long as they have a pair of breasts and a nice ass they are there so upon finding out that there are all sorts of women doing anything in bratislava the three of them go only to find the women of their dreams and the stuff from their nightmaresto define the movie into certain parts it goes from thirty minutes of sex breasts alcohol and drugs to ten minutes of a thriller to the rest of the movie trying to be horrific along with film noir and comedy elements thrown in for good measure but failing mindlessly people are brought in and leave way too soon either by dying or just by not coming back none of the relationships or motivations are explained at all the actors look like walking swearing zombies no character even the sympathetic jay hernedez is the least bit likable everyone is a jerk and to top it all off there is virtually no good dialogue in the film at all and for some ungodly reason there are way too many homosexual overtones at every turn this movie attempts to take that you begin to feel that the characters should be wearing cowboy hats and making brokeback mountain with torture and murderous mayhem insteadwhen the whole idea of what is going on and why all of these people are being tortured and killed actually begins to make some sort of sense you are just left stunned trying to understand how ludicrous the idea is and after you realize who the lead bad guy is you still do not get a real sense as to why any of this is actually happening it only becomes even more ridiculous than it was before hand it all just seems like heinous and horribly random acts of violence put forth in order to try and achieve some sort of scareful momentum but the movie fails to deliver itbut eli roths problem is like every other modern horror director he shows lots of blood but does not push the envelope there is nothing new here and any methods that may seem new are either not brought to their full potential or just do not seem to make sense at all there is quite a bit of blood spilled throughout the film but its nowhere near as sick or vomitinducing as this movie was hyped up to be instead it comes off as a hyperviolent disappointment that some campy fans may be into but traditional horror fans will see right through he may claim to be trying but this is really far from even saw which the movie is border line ripping off seemed a lot more frightening than this film and it had three times less blood and just as bad actingi have yet to see all of cabin fever but even with the small parts of that movie and the entirety of this movie i really get a feel that roth thinks he is being clever and does not realize that the audience is not as gullible as he thinks if hes going to make a horror movie he should make it if he wants to make a comedy he should make it if he wants to make a porno than he should make it a film noir a revenge tale merging all of these into one incohesive narrative is definitely not the way to go it may work for tarantino but is does not work for rothtake a lesson eliwrite good dialogue make characters likable and add some horrorand for god sake let the movie make senseyou do not horrify the audience with your images you horrify them with your horrendous way of putting the movie together and claiming it to be a horror film310,cruel
is about three backpackers traveling in europe for the lookout of pot and women but dont realize what is actually waiting for them okay i dont know much movies that are worse than this film in the year 2005 but this was a terrible movie the acting was really bad directing of course sucked writing was horrible and the story was pretty bad i mean i didnt know where the hell this film was leading to is it a comedy is it a horror what the hell is it i thought this movie was going to be a decent horror film that could give me a good fright for the night but instead all you saw was pointless characters in slaughterhouse with bodyguards one in particular watching a porn overall a bad film that should make eli roth give up his film careerhedeens outlook 210 no stars f,cruel
i am a major fan of horror my friend lent me this movie to watch thank god i didnt waste my money renting it this has to be the worst horror or whatever you want to call this kind of movie that i have ever seen the first 40 minutes was like watching a comedy filled with sex  boobs i thought to myself how the heck is this a horror movie even when the movie shifted i think it got worse yes there a a few gross parts and some looked really fake but that is about it the storyline was terrible the acting was terrible i actually skipped through some parts cause i just couldnt take it anymore i loved cabin fever but i dont understand how anyone can make a movie as bad as this i know some people out there loved this movie but it seems the majority agrees its garbage,cruel

ok many horror films do go over board with the violence there are blood and guts galore and they lose the idea that they are meant to be scary eli roth amazed me with cabin fever and i had high hopes for i was pleasantly amazed by roths follow up feature what was more surprising i was happy to see that mr tarantino has groomed and toned eli into providing the audience with a horrific movie the violence however will be a talking point but i dont see what the fuss is about the violence is fast but effective the only real section where the film focuses on violence is the last 30 mins and that is totally justified i know that some people will write on here oh what was all the fuss about well the fuss is that everyone in my screening left feeling confused about enjoying it because the violence is so real and most of all how spectacular the movie was even though at times i was watching it through my fingersi just wanna congratulate eli roth and quentin tarantino for giving me one of the best cinema experiences of my life cheers fellas,cruel
i dont normally get too carried away with movie hype i have been burned too many times in the past to let my inner geek run riot when i heard about this movie for the first time on aint it cool news i was trapped in a shelobs web of anticipation the films premise was born out of a conversation between two gore hounds harry king of the nerds knowles founder of aicn and new kid on the block director eli cabin fever roth harry described an underground asian website that could hook you up with an organisation who actually offer the chance to kill another human for the right price reportedly in the 10k region eli went home had a look on the net and was bornlet me just state for the record that im a major gore hound i love extreme cinema i love being scared and i love provocative and stimulating films i love to be challenged on an emotional and intellectual level so when names like fukasaku kinji and takashi miike are being dropped into the mix as apparent influences for this work i was positively moist with anticipation battle royale and audition after all are two of my favourite extreme masterpieces bring it on ok so the premise three backpackers are on a hedonistic spree across europe seeking sex drugs and rock n roll while in amsterdam they hear of a slovakian that promises to be a utopia of indulgence so off they head for paradise naturally they are soon knee deep in slovakian honey and all promises appear fulfilled not quite they have been ensnared by a trafficking ring specialising in human hunting for those too rich to know better and are systematically subjected to all manner of torture pain and eventually a grisly death youd think id be pleased then well not really firstly after about five minutes i absolutely hated all three obnoxious annoying main characters so much that i wanted to take a ball hammer to their tootsies myself and thats basically the critical flaw with this film you see the most devastating and affecting films of this genre are set up to perfection they give you characters to identify with they try to build some sort of relationship or bond with the audience so that when the darkness descends you are there with them sharing their fear feeling their pain the cheese wire sequence in audition is only so powerful because we have spent an hour getting to know this guy and can relate to his loneliness and longing to find a partner so when he suffers some extreme acupuncture ouch we are right there with him thats the real power of this genre we need to feel in control of our universe but these film makers show us the real illusion that is existence they expose our mortality our vulnerability and complete lack of control over the random madness that this life is and thats the real scary thing not the blood and entrailsso when two annoying american students and a baffling icelander get power drilled in slovakia it is hard to care about their fate perhaps the world is better off we lost three idiots the world just got lighter yes of course i understand all the thematic inversions taking place on screen the hunter becoming the hunted the objectification being turned around on our protagonists the pinocchio parable blah blah blah again i hated the morons so all else really is irrelevant without engaging characters the plot falls on its fat derrire and we are left with mindless meaningless gore titillation and overriding apathy could have been a contender but instead plays like a poor american cover version of an asian masterpiece,cruel
based on content acting suspense and story line is a great horror movie until i realized that eli roth directed this movie he came a long way and grew a lot from cabin fever which i thought was cheesy and weak eli did a great movie because the camera shots angles movements lighting and acting seemed very believable i would be proud if i produced a movie like this it left me clenching at the end of the movie and thats the type of horror movies that should be shown on the big screen not those cheesyzombiehorrible acting with bad writing movies deserves 9 of 10 stars wonderful job to cast and crew of ,cruel
i will be quick to admit that i was a long time hater of cabin fever the film simply failed to work for me on any desired level it wasnt until i perused the special features on the dvd that i gained some manner of acceptance for its quirky charm that being said it would be fair to surmise that i had little expectation for how violently i would be surprisedthree backpackers 2 americans 1 icelander are eurotrippin their way across the continent in search of sex drugs and rock n roll beginning to wind down some they have their collective interest piqued when a man suggests a in bratislava where they can satisfy their youthful urges unable to resist an offer they would never want to refuse they hop a train and are on their way the initial arrival is unceremonious until they reach the and it turns out to be everything they had hoped for after a night of partying one the group disappears seemingly having moved on by himself things continue for the lads until another member goes missing now the remaining thrill seekers decide to find their friends only to get caught up in something far darker and more sinister than they ever could have imaginedfor pure bang for your buck out guns pretty much every mainstream movie ever made even out doing most of the infamous gaillo films is has taken inspiration from little is spared the viewer in the depictions of violence and sexuality i found myself questioning the rrating more than once yet it manages the difficult feat of never slipping into exploitation the violence is brutal and jarring never once fun or jokey the sexnudity is cold and detached never presenting the feeling of sensuality or eros and the overall tone of the film perfectly transitions from that of happygolucky party hardy to sheer gutchurning fearthe actors a talented group of unknowns bring the right amount of youthful decadence to the roles while still feeling like any ol joe shmoe they my be a little wild but it seems more like a phase than who they are happily the characters are developed to the proper point without the filmmakers having to beat details into our collective viewing mindthe film does make a few small mistakes amongst all that it does right however for one thing the first story arc runs a little long while the second movement is over with a tad too quickly for another the conclusion is aesthetically satisfying yet is a little short on postscript and finally the film is really dark not as in the content but as in the lighting its so dark at times so as to make viewing difficultfalws considered this is a masterful horror tale from one of horror most talented new directors910,cruel
if youve seen cabin fever youll know that eli roth likes humor as much as his horror is no different firstly hotel is leaps and bounds above cabin fever in every aspect it is very gory but that isnt why it works the premise of men paying money to torture others is a truly terrifying prospect and this idea is treated well here gore fans be warned this film has it all chainsaws blow torches drills etc it is extremely dark and yet at times very funny one exchange between our hero and an american sicko discussing the best way to dispatch somebody is actually pretty funny only one scene unlikely but necessary brings the film down but by that stage i was so impressed with the gore that i didnt care one tip though dont take your girlfriend mine nearly threw up,cruel
i think is a bit more subtle than some have given it credit for spoiler first it cant be a coincidence that the whole torture americans thread appears in the context of our current political climate also it seems fitting that the character some are calling a hero in the movie gets away partly because he knows a foreign language and is able to kindle the additional sympathy of his torturer i dont think were necessarily supposed to feel any more sympathetic toward him than we do toward his friendsit just happens that his slightly wider world knowledge helps save him spoiler next i think the scene in which the american businessman preparing to torture a victim talks to the hero is far and away the best part of the movie the guy is just creepy but believable i consider this in some ways a tarantino touch evoking the great rants some of his famous characters go on in other films it also reminds me a comparison i have not seen elsewhere of american psycho in this case the theme of the psychotic american businessman driven to murder by the emptiness of his existence is drastically downplayed but it is there it would not have taken much for roth should he have wanted to to turn this film into a more explicitly powerful socialpoliticaleconomic commentary whether it was tarantino or roth who is ultimately responsible for this touch the businessman i am not sure spoiler kind of finally there has been a lot of debate about whether it is worse to actually see violence drills going into legs etc or to be left to imagine the worst this film basically takes the latter approach personally i am divided about the issue in the end though i think this one would have been a bit more effective had the torture been more directly shown this cant compare to some of the truly sick films that have been made sado cannibal holocaust but i think its as disturbing in its way as the remake of texas chainsaw or either of the saw films,cruel
i think ive pretty much seen it all especially as an intense horror fan for the last 15 years ive watched almost every kind of horror and gross out blood spattered film out there and made my skin crawl i have to say that there is an enormous percentage of human beings that should never see this film because god knows there is enough sick twisted psychos out there what differentiates this from other blood soaked gory films reality there is something very real about there is something abnormal and disturbing about the situations the setting the captives and the men torturing them or perhaps its just the incredibly sick premise in the first place that will turn your stomach if this film was any more intense im not sure i would have been able to sit through it i almost feel like slapping a disclaimer on this review because although i seem to dump praise on the film with a nine out of teni dont feel many should see this unless youve got a strong stomach and a need to see something abnormally twisted but fifty million dollars worth of people have already seen it perhaps eli roths sick creation is this day and ages texas chainsaw or even the exorcist which shocked and awed people decades agoits not the buckets of blood or even the goriest scenes its just the imagery and the acting the lead actors do a top notch job the film starts out for the first half hour or more and i was beginning to wonder what i was watching because it seemed more like harold and kumar go to europe with another guy getting high f this f that and showing breasts every possible chance just for the sake of doing so no hint or horror anywhere in sight and then comes the intrigue when the friends began to disappear one at a time a factory in a small european town allows rich men to pay to dismember operate murder do anything they want to live human victims who are tourists that are being kidnapped right off the street in all fairness there is a small handful of gory disturbing scenes amidst a basic story but those scenes are powerful enough to make you crawl to your core derek richardson plays the lonely geeky josh he does a good job although he disappears early but his paranoia is the first to be explored as he suspects something isnt right his scenes being tortured and murdered are gut wrenching and his screams are terrifying thats not an easy thing to pull off in such a capacity newcomer eythor gudjonsson plays horny party guy oli and in that rank he does fine he never really gets to show off his acting chops as we never actually see him getting taken or murdered the real shining star of the film is jay hernandez over the years ive seen him in many other things but he has never stuck out or shined like he does in he performs the crazy party teenager part to the point where i thoughtthese kids are just stupid annoying teenagers and then he gets submersed in with the killers and fights his way out he commands the screen and is definitely leading man material and his screams and scenes of torture are brutal the three men shown to be the torturers also do a good job especially jan vlask who actually meets the boys on a train to bratslava he seems like such a normal every day businessman with a family friends personable and then to see him in the capacity of a sick twisted killer is revolting the supporting cast are all very well done but the main characters really do make this filmeli roth who both wrote and directed the film has created something far beyond his usual average campy films this film is very very real it holds a record for using the most languages in a film with no subtitles which simply holds its realism filmed entirely in europe the setting is both beautiful and frightening dark and grim old fashion something very creepy about every scene blood and gore is everywhere as well as female nudity aboundits a cash cow without a doubt but its also well made and hits the mark as a disturbing psychotic thriller i can honestly say i dont wish toand hopefully will not ever watch again because its something i dont wish to sit through not because its a bad filmits brilliantbut because its that disturbing for anyone and there will be plenty who says this was crap and not scary and yadda yadda yaddai think you better make an appointment with your shrink 810,cruel
finally  a horror movie that nods to the japanese greats audition juon and is accessible to us viewersi am really excited about this evolution  having grown up on friday the 13ths the shining the exorcist and halloween im glad to finally see the genre move away from the much studied and lampooned men women  chainsaws formula to a new style which is probably bound to become formulaic but at least it will be a new formula ehi saw with trepidation ive been disappointed by american horror movies over and over  we even saw previews for some of the same old same old  when a stranger calls sigh  now our childhood slumber party stories are being turned into movies i eagerly await the one about the escaped crazy man with a hook and the teenagers necking in the carthe reviews i read were mixed  one of them caught my eye though in the sf gate website the reviewer mentioned that the first part of the story wasnt horror  a bit funny even i immediately thought of audition by takashi miikehow pleased was i to find that miike made a cameo in this movie the story starts out normal enough  a couple of americans are in amsterdam partying it up  roth even puts in a sly reference to the carnival aspects of amsterdam that most americans see when they go there when one of the characters asks do any dutch people live in amsterdam they move on to slovakia  and i remembered my own european jog  the alienness of the newly accessible central europe it is beautiful and seems desolate like other parts of the world the environment makes you cast aside any ideas you had about privilege no one really judges you for being american but there is no safehaven either there are few embassies and far less english is spoken than in other countries youve got to behave yourself and hope nothing bad happensroths message is clear these boys are like pampered beef wandering out of their pens and into the wilderness they are picked off one by one the last finally realizing through a series of mishaps that something odd is going onthen the horror begins the character i liked least the pretty letsgetlaid smarm meister becomes the hero that was a nice touch roth does a great job of setting up a series of situations that allow you to hope he will escape he nearly does  and then in typical hero style goes back for the girl that he wasnt even interested in screwing also a nice touchlike audition the ending is satisfying from the viewers point of view there is no lingering feeling of darn he was so close to getting away and a nice dose of revenge although it was satisfying i was a tad disappointed by the endingbefore i wax philosophic about my own trip to central europe and how i misplaced a traveling companion there for a bit i will conclude this review however this movie is definitely worth seeing  and hopefully the directors cut on dvd is not too far offyea eli roth,cruel
so this is what is to be found at the bottom of the long slow slippery slope of americas gradual moral degradation and cultural roll in the gutter from coppolas first glorification of organized crime in the godfather the creed of greed to that old reliable sicko quentin tarantinos more explicit oeuvre of populist sadistic knowhow the culture of torture thirty years ago hollywoods schlockmeisters started to glorify the creed of greed by which anything can be had for a price by which the fastest acquisition possible of your neighbours material goods justifies all moral turpitude before the planet caves in under global warming from individual getrichquick schemes to giant corporate appetites like enrons to the takeover of entire nations in search of fossil fuels the soapopera about the corleone family now looks like a timid blueprint for the career of george w bush hollywood then proceeded to desensitize a willing public to violence death and the dignity of human life by feeding it a steady diet of roundtheclock mortuary thrills uncensored slasher films detailed depictions of sadistic behaviour tv movies recreating the bernardohomolka murders over the objections of the victims families and other reallife or imagined atrocities crime scene investigations and sitcomsdramasreality shows about the private lives of undertakers mafia hit men or serial murder profilers finally american popular cinema now delivers the ultimate goods films where the viewer becomes the virtual torturer and if he has any inkling of morality left hey it might happen he will be tortured in return  at least mentally i dont think there is a more despicable way to make a buck do you but then what do i know im only canadianon the one hand cynically plays upon the legitimate fears americans have about the way they are perceived by the rest of the world and on the other hand films like make those perceptions even more problematic by picturing americans as a people with a very unhealthy appetite for violent entertainment exclusively concerned with revenge torture and sadism and that cant be goodps need further proof of americas attitude when it comes to violent entertainment count the number of negative reviews on this site who consider this film is not gory or scary enough and who blame the director for not delivering the psychopathic thrills of saw,cruel
if you are looking for suspense and to be kept on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next then dont watch thisif you want a good story with character development then dont watch thishowever if you want to spend half of a movie covering your eyes with your hands then this is the movie for you the movie starts slow from a horror point of view but when it gets going rarely does it let up the horror comes thick and fast and is possibly the goriest movie i have seenthought the movie was very good and will add to my dvd collection when released,cruel
meet porn  hellraiser all wrapped up in one movie i did not see a preview and had no idea what i was in for  the summary does say what you will be watching had i known i probably would not have gone to see it i looove a good scary movie but i am not sick in the head and this movie was really trashy and disgusting anyways awhile back i drug my family out to see cabin fever because i thought it looked creepy and good it was sooo lame that we left after an hour sooo when i told my husband how gross was he said like another cabin fever movie i said no different turns out the same person who did cabin fever  did this movie too i found that to be quite funny if anyone out there liked cabin fever  well perhaps you would like this retarded movie too thumbs way way down,cruel
was absolutely terrible i was expecting a psychological thriller or a mystery suspense and it basically amounted to a whole lot of graphic sexual content and body parts getting cut off there is no plot or likable characters it had some really gross bloody scenes but it was not scary at all it was the most boring movie that i have seen in two years i was ready for it to be over after about twenty minutes the sick part really did not begin until the last fifteen minutes i definitely would not suggest this movie to anyone it was a waste of time and money my friends and i thought about leaving during it several times it was so bad that i cant think of enough stuff to say about it to finish my comments on it thats it end of story,cruel
i have seen many horror movies some good and some only b movies i have to say i didnt think that the twenty minutes or more of constant sex contributed to the movie and i found it to be too much also i saw this movie with friends and we agree that the movie went beyond the bounds of what could be shown in the theatre those with weak stomachs or an aversion to blood and bodily fluids should not see this movie as there is much vomit and blood the movie in short is a huge bloodbath with no real story just one graphically detailed torture after another the unrealistic nature of the movie both in regards to the huge amounts of sex and the torture scene would be laughable if it did not make me lose my lunch the eyeball snipping could have been left out as well,cruel
remember the awful lowbudget b movies we had in the seventies well guys they are back and this one is the worst of them i had a few laughs with it the horror was absolutely pathetic the acting was so absurd some great movies are made lowbudget and they turn out great and had not mr tarrantino supported it i think it would have been a total flop do not count on any of the horrible actors to make it big time any time soon at least i dont terrible it wasnt that shocker as the promos made out to be they should have said bring the wine we provide the cheese and plenty thank goodness we had saw ii and the exorcism of emily rose to relieve us of the disappointment,cruel
is the worst movie i have seen since cabin fever which ironically was also directed by eli rothim not sure why people rave over eli roth claiming him to be some sort of newage visionary of the horror genre his movies are horrifically bad  yet another winkandnod to the selfaware postmodern crap that the new generation of film goers believe to be the greatest thing since sliced breadis just another example of such mental masturbation people speak of how effective the movie is but i failed to see this the first half of the movie is all exposition and fails to endear any of the characters to the audience you feel nothing for the characters and the only character who receives any development is josh in fact his character is the only one who is likable and yet even on the most basic levels i failed to actually care about himas the movie continues only one scene was truly eerie or gross in a nearempty theatre my friend and i were the only ones laughing at how the audience failed to react to the gore effects brought to us by the oftacclaimed greg nicatero land of the deadwhich brings me to the special makeup effects this is where i was surprised to be let down greg a student of tom savini a true master of horror makeup effects was also on the staff of george a romeros day of the dead and land of the dead his work on land was some of the most phenomenal makeup in modern movies however i was sorely disappointed in the originality with the exception of the eyeball of the effects the execution of almost every effect and his amazing lack of ability to make them look in any way realistic particularly disappointing was the fact that he comes from savinis school of makeup effects which tends to lead to some of the best effects in the industryoverall this movie is a onestar film overhyped by an industry in desperate need of a new face for horror as is tradition in the film industry whenever something slightly different comes along in the horror genre it gets marketed as being the great innovation of our age what makes it more disappointing is the fact that the new generation of filmgoers believe it verbatim they reel with disgust at scenes of violence that are simply banal and old hat these are the same death scenes weve been seeing for three decades but no one bothered to catalog them apparentlywhat the industry really needs is a resurgence of the classic horror film we are reentering the age of selfassurance we are going back to what made the eighties a great decade for horror when we become complacentwhen we get too comfortable in our own shoes we need to be reminded that bad things happen to good people that is what halloween friday the 13th sleepaway camp and nightmare on elm street were really about and that is why they scared us so much now when we watch them we think them campy humorous and outright laughable as we near this new age of comfort and security we need these films to remind us that when removed from our safety zone we open ourselves to a whole new world of terror however if quentin tarantino and eli roth are the new faces in this genre im going back to the classics,cruel
flat out the worst movie ever filmed for a viewing audience in the history of motion picture entertainment no plot no story no point to this movies existence in this world if you go to this movie you will leave wondering why this director chose the profession of film making this movie cost me 10 dollars and a hour and a half of my life that ill never get back they think that because saw and saw 2 was so successful that you can put a bunch of gory scenes in a plot less movie that it will sell this movie is a disgrace to the film industry the only good part of this movie is the fact that there was lots of hot naked chicks in it at parts early on,cruel
when i viewed this film i found the first portion displeasing there is too much female nudity a balance would have been a better choice the audience is held captive by hints we squirm in our seats to see what it is that is not being revealed it is a strong quality when a movie can cause restlessness in the viewer in the movie seven towards the end there is a wonderful example of hinting we think that we saw the head in the box when it was not shown only hinted at i found that this film did not use this trick to its advantage there were more than enough for us to come to the conclusion that these were sex hungry young kids in the future i would encourage movie makers to second think these types of choices i very much enjoyed the bloody gore of the rest of the film i jumped with excitement when the girls eye was hanging out of her head then he cut it off all the juice gushed out that was so cool i love the part where the guys slips on the blood of the main guy and gets the saw cutting him i also love the part where the guy who like to eat with his hands gets his fingers cut off and then his head put into the bloody toilet water a thriller aside from the overabundant scenes of nudity ireally enjoyed this film,cruel
i thoroughly enjoyed this film  while i was watching it i didnt foresee just how much it would trouble me the next day i find myself wondering how true this story is  it terrifies me to think that places and activities like those depicted in may actually exist i keep imagining the scene involving an american businessman who is drilling the eye of a helpless girl while she is awake through the whole disgusting actthe film is also extremely realistic which also added to the whole atmosphere of it i cant help but still visualize scenes from the film as though they were real of course i realize they were just actors and special effects but it is a testament to director eli roth that he could create such realismi witnessed at least 6 people who walked out of the cinema while we were watching  whilst i never felt the urge to do this myself there was one moment in which a character is vomiting in fear that almost made me throw up myself i dont believe a film has ever caused that sensation in me before in the end it is worth sitting through brutal acts that shock  disgust purely because the entire end piece does provide satisfaction  this viewer certainly thought that it ended appropriatelyif you are of a weak stomach dont even bother watching this but if you can handle shocking stuff  can appreciate them for plot value you will thoroughly enjoy this movieits been quite a while since i saw a movie that had this many talking points and i doubt there will be anything to come close to it for shock value for the rest of 2006,cruel
ive seen plenty of awful comments for this film because of its gore and gruesome nature but lets be real you saw the previews didnt you did you really expect it to be all rainbow and unicorns you cant say its an overall terrible movie just because of its content when it had the exact effect on you that it was intended to if it made you nauseous and disgusted thats what it was meant to do maybe you didnt realize exactly what you were getting into because i dont know how in hell you could ever be surprised by its nature once you got in there i personally love gore and the blood and guts come on people its a movie for gods sake it does its job and i loved it ,cruel
i saw this movie the night after it came out and i was very pleased with it i was talking about it for weeks building it up and it still didnt disappoint with regards to the gore and suffering expected after viewing the trailers and hearing the rumors it lived up to the hype and then some if you enjoy gore movies along the lines of saw this will be a step up in the right direction a huge step upwhat made this movie one to remember is that the story is not as far a stretch as you may expect you are given the opportunity to bond with the characters something that is often lacking in other movies in this genre there is a buildup that creates a tension that the whole theater can feelfurthermore the story does not rocket out of control as it approaches its climax everything within the movie is completed with a purpose and it gives the audience the opportunity to understand the escalation with clues along the waymost of all as discussed by some others who have voiced their feedback this movie actually gets better as you think about it afterwords while piecing together parts that you may have missed during the actual viewing its not hard to miss something when you have to turn away due to the gore and the suffering seen withinso overall if you are reading this you are most likely interested in checking this movie out i say do it out because you will not be disappointed finally make sure to see it soon as a packed theater only adds to the atmosphere enjoy,cruel
everybody is retarded who said this ending sucked  i mean sure the part with the kids who jumped the car was a little crazy but come on when he followed that guy into the bathroom you know you were like this is going to be awesome and it ended perfect with him looking at him right in the face in every horror movie the killer always wins in the end and its gay its good to see something different even though there wasnt just one killer in the guy still killed the killer in his eyes and i would like to think he goes back home and tells of whats going on there so it doesnt go unnoticed but compared to every other horror movie the has what others seldomly dont have a plot,cruel
this movie is possibly the worst excuse for horror that i have come across in a very long time granted i have avoided nonsense like house of the dead but really dont waste your time this movie is awful the first part is eurotrip without any humor and the second part is gory but nothing too rough and pretty dull leaving the theater i just hung my head in shame i am pretty sure all the positive reviews of this movie are part of a conspiracy to trick unsuspecting movie patrons into wasting their time and money on a ridiculous plot less pointless joke of a horror movie also  you tarantino you little  i have no respect for you anymore,cruel
eli roths brilliantly horrifying story of what fate awaits three young men looking to sow their wild oats while vacationing in europe theyre introduced to a strange slovakian land where sexy foreign women are always willing to bed down with any male especially if theyre americans and fulfill every one of their fantasies after a period of partying and cheap thrills these friends discover theyre nothing more than unlucky possessions in grisly games of torture and deathi think the gradual unraveling of how these sadistic events come to be ia very intriguing and distrubingly real ive subsequently learned that there were at least two endings filmed and without going into detail ill just say that the version which was reshot to play in theaters upon the movies original release was the much stronger and satisfying of the two,cruel
this is with out a doubt the goriest movie in a decade i admit there is too much nudity in this movie if i wanted to watch people die and nudity i would watch friday the 13th this movie was very violent but that is the exact point before i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends and my girlfriend someone puked in the seats if you were a horror freak like me that just gets you pumped i thought this movie had too much comic relief as wellthe amount of violence is a different subject on its own i think it was very well done though i was laughing when the drill came out i didnt think it was bad at all though i never cringed or looked away but i will admit the hanging eye was pretty grossif you are looking for a gore movie and you wanna torture your girlfriend and make them go through it this movie has it alli did not give it a 10 because of the massive amount of nudity i understand why he did it but i wouldnt watch it again because of it,cruel
   its because they fell asleep and because they were tired of trying to keep their eyes openi have been on pins and needles waiting for this movie to hit the big screen and i just returned from the theater feeling like someone slapped me in the face its as if quentin tarantinoone of my favorite cinema shock masters in the us got paid off to put his name on this slop any average schmuck in this world could have sat down and written this script in a couple of days if youre looking for plot twists and turns that will leave your buttocks welded to the seat then save your money and wait for another opportunity tons of things could have been added to this movie to give it some spunk music adds to the mood and amplifies scenes apparently whoever composed the score for the film was preoccupied by watching survivor or something and missed out on possibly adding something to dramatically pull this out of the mudthe acting was decent but it was hard to connect with the characters due to the mind numbing plot the first half of the film was almost pointless and left you on the edge of your seat yearning for any sort of entertainment when the gore and the plot twist finally comes youre already exhausted from the boring foreplaythe gory aspect of the film didnt even come close to the huge rants and raves it received if you want to spend 7 to see lots of boobs and a couple of bloody scenes i say more power to you,cruel
a good movie in its genre very graphic and disturbing scenes but not much of a story although it says its based on true events there was no reference to it and i dont believe that anyway but what was disappointing was there was no actual story behind it no real reason why this was happening except that people with money and the urge to torture and kill could have it arranged for them the other part i was disappointed in was everything seemed so nonchalant  from the girls setting it up to the heavies keeping guard it was like another day at the office for these people other than the premise of the movie being for a certain type of person it wasnt particularly scary,cruel
the make up and sound effects were great but if youre looking for a real good scare this isnt going to do it there is a little suspense but really the only thing this movie is good for is the bloodgore the plot is shaky and it doesnt really give you time to care about the characters before stuff starts happening i scare really easily since i havent had a lot of experience with horror movies but this one didnt phase me again the make up effects and over all ew factor was good but without a bad guy to focus the fear on it ends up lacking in that department its creepy as far as situational but not enough for goosebumps,cruel
on the surface appears to be a gleefest of sadism and gore and its clear from those leaving negative reviews that their examination did not delve deeper underneath the limbs and blood one can see an interesting use of primal fears and anxieties such as castration and sexual anxieties that are effectively used to heighten the viewers unease and sense of identification with the protagonists whether this was intentional on the directors part or an unconscious expression of his latent fears of sexual identity is up for debate in any event i found the movie to be effective surprisingly multilayered and most importantlyenjoyablei would add that the director aptly manipulates the audience into cheering for the very torture that disgusted them 30 minutes earlier the sadistic assault upon the senses is palpable enough to elicit the very same satisfaction in carrying out revenge that the protagonist undertakes at the end of the film many will not notice this phenomenon or know how to label their feelings but those reflective enough will leave the theater with the sour taste of knowing that heshe could be capable of the very same thingmature audiences only i worry about those who see this film without regard or a little soulsearching,cruel
i saw this film this evening and was scared just reading all the hype about the brutality in this film before seeing it after seeing the flick i kept wondering how many of the gore scenes had been cut after the toronto film festival because i missed most of them at least as described by previous reviewers this movie isnt anything you havent seen before in this type of genre in fact if you believe all the hype you will be disappointed of course there are scary edge of your seat moments but the buzz led me to believe that it was closer to snuff than fluff great effects scary concept but it was anything but groundbreakingwait for the dvd the extras will make it worth the price,cruel
if youve seen the promos and trailers for this movie youll know they are selling this movie as being ultra gory and graphic and an overall disturbing film one of the most disturbing movies ever etc while it has its fair share of blood and guts and might shock some people that are easily put off by the sight of blood this isnt true for the rest of us for the rest of us this isnt anything more graphic or bloody than plenty of other movies that sell them self as the scariest movie of the year if you have seen ichi the killer youve seen a bloodier movie than this if you have seen irreversible you have seen a more disturbing movie than this hell if youve seen passion of the christ youve seen a more brutal and disturbing film than this i heard more laughs from my fellow audience members than screams of terror or anything even resembling it now given the movie has some points that are supposed to be humorous but not the majority of the filmfinal words its not a bad movie its still better than 80 of the horrorgory movies out there in that its schlock level is relatively low but it certainly doesnt rise to the level some including myself were expecting and hoping for,cruel
i have seen this movie 3 days ago at sitges film festivalwith quentin tarantino as producer barbara nedeljakova and greg nicotero the master of special effectsthey present a movie made for horror movies fansthey were funny and crazyand waste their time to talk with fanswe can see them in a small nightclub in sitges route 66jijiand i think is pretty gruesome and goryif you like bloodsexand torture youll love thisyou have a lot of great scenes with no compassion and great acting like the italianrussian girlan the man that breath strange the scariest thing in the movie the history behind all the blood is pretty well think and i love when you discover everything as movie is better than cabin fever and i beg you love it is like a hit stressball i hope it will hit box office straight to number onejust for eli can made more films like thisweak points in my opinion the torture scenes are so fast is more like slow killing they dont let to much time for enjoy the suffering for real torture kana caracther must appear more waste a lot of time to present the others but kana only have 2 scenes before the storm we need more of this pretty and innocent girl to appreciate more her suffering please eli go to cut room and add somethingfans consensuswe dont like the islandia boy sorry but we dont care about him you can cut some of his stupids jokeswell nothing more to say this is a great movie and i hope everyone can enjoy it like i dideli come to spain next timecan i be the coffee guy,cruel
i have not seen this movie yet but i just wanted to make a comment about tarantinos film they are always hailed as great cinematic achievements when in reality they are just the playing out of his puerile fantasiesnow i have no problem with tarantino making money off of the crap he makes but dont tell me it is a great movie and deserves 10 starstarantino may have had a couple of good movies in his early career but nowadays it is simply hip to like his movies even if they dont have any entertainment value never mind artistic valuei know i know personal preference plays into rating a movie but just like i wont listen to a lunatic who claims that the earth is flat i will not give credence to someone who says tarantino makes movies worth a 10 rating,cruel
disbelief can only be suspended so much before you snap back into the reality of watching a film that has ran its course well before its end if i were you i would turn it off about 20 minutes before the end because thats where it will all go downhill to heart sinking boredom and brainlessness this film is like a roll of toilet paper its great until it runs out and youre left with a little cardboard tube,cruel
a trio of american students take a vacation across europe indulging in all sorts of hedonistic naughtiness  stopping in prague one of their number goes missing and his two colleagues become concerned about his fate little realising a waking nightmare of their own is about to beginthis was released with a lot of hype almost entirely down to the name quentin tarantino appearing in the credits as executive producer  wow were going to see lots of post modernism and hear smart dialogue if tarantino is involved  well we would if an executive producer had much creative input but an executive producer is merely someone who raises the funds for the movie  if youre expecting a flamboyant european bad guy to steal the show then youll be disappointed because the only stealing in this film will be two hours of your time has two distinct halves  one of the american trio enjoying themselves by chilling and having casual sex with hot czech chicks with silicon boobs and the other half involving some men with strange accents having some fun with the americans and not a 34c silicone implant in sight i will give the film some credit and that is it takes a lot for me to feel any sympathy for rich  hedonistic american pretty boys in any circumstance and did manage to elicit some sympathy out of my sociopathic misanthropic heart  this sums up the films problem and that is the selling point is the cruel and explicit violence  director eli roth isnt really interested in fleshing out characterisation or atmosphere any other aspect of the movie and instead the whole function of the movies existence revolves around the gore and sadistic brutal violence  its just the basic over used premise of horny american teenagers finding themselves in dire peril with the violence being so graphic it started off a new phrase   torture porn ,cruel
im not going to waste my time and yours by commenting much i can only warn you not to see this movie it is the worst thing i have ever seen filmed how could anyone want to watch people get tortured i just cant believe society has come to thisthis movie is so wrong in so many ways it degrades the purpose of filmmaking and entertainment im not some miss grundy type either before i saw this vile piece of trash i thought anything goes in film but not anymore i found this to be nothing more than a sick persons exercise in sadism do not see this film it will rob you of your humanity,cruel
id like to start off by mentioning that is a horrific and grotesque waste of time it should have never even seen the door of the censors office let alone be passed with an 18 certificate the story follows three personality free young boys backpacking in europe trying desperately to find some vulnerable women to sleep with and dump the next day their search for meaningless sex is soon interrupted when one of the boys goes missing eventually after a series of sadistic events two of the boys end up dead the one left played horrendously by jay hermendez escapes death with a few minor injuries including two missing fingers and holes in his chest despite his minor setback he manages to escape so if youd like to sit back relax and watch this unnecessarily violent and sadistic pile of crap then be my guest but dont say i didnt warn you ,cruel
this is just beyond disgusting i mean the concept of scaring people and showing how people get sliced cut hammered and whatever is nothing new but this this piece of crap that a studio spend money on to make and then people spend money to see it just has nothing but absolutely nothing to do with art filmmaking or else so yes there is some kind of story im not not going into it cause it doesnt matter anyway all this so called film is about is bloody and disgusting carnage and i thought doom was the worst film i ever saw cause it mindless and stupid to no end boy was i wrong i just dont know what to say anymore so unless youre into disgusting splatter films dont waste your time with this its just not worth it,cruel
this horror queen has just had the opportunity to see the movie wow what a ride with such an original concept the idea of this whole movie is that it could really be real i feel bad that fangoria slammed this little flick they over analyzed it it was just plain fun and no more people like me dont care about acting styles and camera shots in horror movies just give us the gore and roth delivers i must admit that even though the movie was creepy it did not give me the genuine scare i usually look for however the scare is what goes home with you after watching the film i know im never going to a 3rd world country to stay in a creepy anytime soon for you guys there is enough ta in the first 45 minutes to keep you entertained for us gore whores we get the rest of the film one word eyeball i cant wait for the dvd i know there is more that the mpaa did not want me to see in a public theateri highly recommend seeing this movie at the theater even though an unrated version will probably be much better having an theater experience with a movie like this is just pure fun i thought the people sitting behind me were going to puke eli roth brings a raw new vision in horror something we havent seen in a long time its dark creepy and definitely sick but knowing he didnt have to spend millions to do it is genius i am looking forward to more of his films they can only get better the moral of the story is guys who think with their you know whats get chopped up into little pieces see it,cruel
why in the world would you recommend this to other people this has to be the biggest load of stank  moldy maggot semen i have ever laid my previously unscathed viewing sockets on spoilers  the first 50 minutes of this movie shows the three main characters going around europe screwing every woman they see and smoking every plant they touch personally im a college student if i wanted to see potporn i could just go knock on my neighbors door i seriously have no idea how i managed to stay awake all this time and not scrape my face off with a popcorn kernel seriously that badthen we have what i would like to call the turning point from just plain pointless pornographic weedhead nonentertainment expo to cringing torturous whats the word im looking for whats the exact extreme opposite of orgasm well lets just pretend i know and i put it therethe morning after one of the main characters finally gets laid their buddy who is the only character that i actually remember his name olie disappears we later find out he was tortured before being decapitated fun then we get to see his asian chick get her toe cut off with a pair of bolt cutters double the fun this is the point where i was seriously considering leavingreallyso we get back to the story just the two main guys left and wouldnt you know it buddy number 2 disappears lame we get to see him tortured and then killed where is the entertainment in this if you enjoy watching that you seriously need a psychological evaluation because you have some sick and twisted tendencies that need to be monitored this is actually the point where i began walking out the door but sadly could not as i wanted to see what happened to the main characteras he goes looking for his friends he also is captured big surprise and has began being tortured he manages to catch a lucky break and only gets a few fingers chopped off and kills his torturer at this point i did not care and walkedeli roth learn to writedirect you moron quentin tarentino please dont put your name on another piece of garbage like that ever again please im begging you here man actors i hope you made a lot of money,cruel
this was the single best horror movie i have seen in yearsthis movie was basically everything ive ever dreamed of and i am one sick personthe special effects were outstanding the acting amazing and the movie was just overall the best gore film ever in my opinionim definitely going to see this one a million times before quickly buying it on dvd the moment it comes outthe movie wasnt so much scary as is was disgustingly amazing if you love gore this is the movie i would ditch anyone and anything to go see,cruel
this movie was so awesome i loved he gore and torturei was on the edge of my seati was also glad that the movie kinda turned into an action thriller once he escapedit made it interestingeli roth went to my high school and i think hes a geniusi was wonderingdoes anybody know what the prices of the different kinds of people were was it something likeus 50000 european 20000 local 10000i think that this movie will be very successful in a world where people love this kind of stuff but im not sure that america will like this so much but i totally respect eli roth for taking these risks with a moviethey did an incredible job of making people after the movie say wowthat was something wasnt it,cruel
if you want to be entertained for 95 minutes get to the nearest theater and see i have seen a lot of horror films in the past few years including 2005s hit saw 2 this movie ranks right up there with my favorite modern thrillersthere is a combination of sex nudity violence gore and drug use that is unprecedented aka dont take the kids to this one it is worth going to this movie if only to see the groundbreaking content alone however the story was not so shabby itself you can usually get a good perspective on a movie in the theater by crowd reaction i have to say there was more reaction in the theater for this movie than i have witnessed in a long timego into this movie ready to be shocked and be willing to look past the rrated elements at the excellent story telling that eli roth has accomplished,cruel
is about three young men who are backpacking through europe their names are paxton josh and oli once they get to a slovakian city things start to get weird and the friends begin to see less and less of each other eventually they discover a torture chamber where people come to watch others getting tortured for amusement soon the three backpackers might end up as victims of this chamber and of the unusual people around the city has good direction a good script and good performances by the cast good film editing and good cinematography the film is a real adrenaline rush it has a lot of energy and action especially in its second half in the films first film there is some good humour as we get to know the three characters and as things go along and people start to disappear the film really kept my interest and i was really curious to find out what would happen next this is a well crafted horror movie with a pretty original script and some good atmosphere and style it is very entertaining and full of action it also has scenes that will make you squirm and get a little uncomfortable as well all in all is a stylish film that is an entertaining and action packed film that also has some good horror in it as well is the second film from writerdirector eli roth who brought us 2003s cabin fever a film that i also enjoyed roth does a good job here again and if he continues to stick to his own original scripts and his own direction then i think that he may become one of todays better horror directors because he did a good job with the well crafted and smart ,cruel
this isnt a perfect film but this is far better than ego i mean eli roths previous effort cabin fever which failed at marrying serious horror with zany comedy i guess hes been trained to be a good filmmaker by tarantino himself even the speech about the torturer wanting to be a surgeon seemed like something out of pulp fiction there even seems to be a repeat of the pulp fiction scene where bruce willis spots ving rhames crossing a streeti came in expecting it to be a gimmicky exercise in freaking out the audience and nothing more i was pleased to find that it engaged my interest beyond the simple showing off gore and violence as if to say look what we can get away with on film yes there are character arcs in this the film is similar to wes cravens last house on the left in terms of basic eventsheres the weaknesses the first half feels a bit slow and empty and could have cut out about 5 minutes of underdramatized setupwhile knb gave us topnotch gore the eyeball makeup effect you have to see it to know what im referring to was over the top phonylooking and anatomically nonsensical for the sake of shock valuetowards the end things seem to become conveniently coincidental and all downhill for our hero taking away from the tension the ending could have hadstill i came away rather satisfied once we get into the second half of the film the audience was loudly cheering in satisfaction upon witnessing bloody comeuppance id say this is a good start for 2006 lets hope the rest of the year will wash away the bland aftertaste of 2005much better than saw and high tension go see it before it gets ruined by bad sequels and copycats,cruel
ok well first of all my name is ben this is my cousins accountfor i waited in line for almost an hour for this movie not knowing that the lines started a good hour and a half prior the movie starts out as a teen flick with a lil bit of comedythink of it as eurotrip in a way so to speak as the movie progressed maybe like 45 minutes into it people started getting mutilated and so forth and all of a sudden i felt nauseous and started having this vomiting feeling going through my body and then suddenly i started to have palpitations this is where i can feel my heart beating literally and then mai heart felt like it was being stepped on or even crushed immediately 911 was called thanks to my cousin hence the account user i was checked out by paramedics on the spot and then taken to the local hospital where i was checked by the er physician  i was told that nothing dire had happened to me but i had suffered a panic attack due to the hot ass environment that i was watching the movie in and that the theatre didnt bother lowering the temperature and also what was happening in the movie i suffered this panic attack thankfully nothing serious happened  ps all of this happened at loews theatres at streets of woodfieldpps enjoy watching this movie i bet yall get a kick out of it d,cruel
this may contain spoilers of some element although i have no intentions of depicting scenes in my comment on the filmi just arrived home from the opening night showing of at my local movie theater and i must say i am very let down i cant apply the term disappointed to the film because it was a enjoyable i can however say that anyone who needed an ambulance called for them or freaked out or even got a little more than the willies is pretty much not a horror fan and i wasnt the only one the majority of the audience i sat in was also let down lots of comments like i didnt think it was even scary and man that kinda sucked i was expecting so much more mirrored my own thoughtsi went to see to have my mind bended by graphic and intense scenes of horror and violence and instead the grossest thing in the film was a little bit of puss and some vomiting done by characters on screenthere was lots of female nudity in the beginning and it was actually quite funny while meaning to be not on accident so if you want a couple of cheap boo scares a couple of minor gross outs and a lot of skin flock run hurry to see however if like me you were expecting to be so freaked out your heart raced and your mind was twisted up thinking how can this even be on film you will feel cheatedover all it was a good movie though dont get me wrong just please dont believe all they hypewill not go down in horror movie history as being one of the all time greats and unless it comes out in dvd with an unrated directors cut version i will remain under the impression that the theatrical release was indeed heavily editedi hope this information suits you in your decision to go see this film,cruel
i wish more horror movies were this good roth doesnt hold back hes got the balls to not give in to studio pressures to tone down movies in order to increase target audiences in other words this is not a date movieno way unless your girlfriends like mine and she loves blood and guts literally she works in the morgue at childrens hospital anyway i worked on doing post production saw the movie at least 10x times and it was still hard for me to watch some of those scenes with the japanese girl i had to hold my hands up to my face to block the view when i first saw the movie i knew that roth had a hit with the serious horror movie buffs he doesnt hold back interestingly the movie originally had a different ending where the german guy has his little daughter kidnapped by paxton when they enter the train station at the end of the movie and she goes by herself to use the little girls room but no way that wasnt going to fly so can you say reshoot and now look what weve got for an ending definitely no holding back with roth its nice to see a movie maker turn up the gore rather than tone it down  fifty cent  anyway i would hope that when the dvd comes out it will include those scenes which the editor cut short that really shows off some of the talent in this movie not just the acting talent eitherthe reason i didnt give it a 10 is for precisely that reason ive seen the movie in its longer uncut form and loved it but i was disappointed when they cut it and cut it and cut it and shortened many of the good scenes down to a point where theyre either gone or made inconsequential,cruel
much like takashi miike eli roth wraps biting social commentary in a bloody shroud while audition was a straightforward critique of traditional japanese attitudes toward women disguised as a stalker film and ichi the killer was a brutal response to the category 3 gorehounds need for excess eli roth has taken the opportunity to question our deepest human values ironically in the guise of an exploitation flickpart fairy tale and part nightmare the film asks what could you let yourself do if you did not have to account for your actions what is a human life worthlike another great festival film harsh times which i saw in the same day the film peels back the veneer of civilization we all have to reveal a bloody selfish propensity for the negation of another human beingcomments from reviewers earlier posti havent actually seen this movie so this post isnt really a rating although all of the excellent ratings so far made me give it a 9 but i read the comments of a reviewer from toronto from which the above excerpt is from i wasnt able to put your name is this review  imdb wouldnt let me and didnt know how else to get in touch with themon the off chance that they see this post id appreciate discussing this movie more im a bit of a contradiction because im horror fan with a weak stomach but this movie seems too good to pass up anyway i found their review to be very indepth and interesting and id love to hear from them so my email address is skyelarkehotmailcom,cruel
i just had the pleasure of seeing at the toronto international film festival and it was awesome it had a tight story with great characters and lots of gore galore plus theres great creepy imagery and a lot of hot naked european chicks what else could you ask for if you want to see a real horror film made by a real horror fan go see this film it will make your skin crawl but since its not getting released till november and it wasnt a finished edit i hope lions gate doesnt impose on the film before it gets released if anyone from lions gate is reading this keep your hands of the film its beautiful as it is let eli do his thinglorne,cruel
was one of those movies that came out in the early to mid 2000s and ushered in the torture porn genre you know the type of movie the one that is heavy on gore and seeing people be tortured on screen but is light on story suspense or anything good it used to be this is what lazy filmmakers would put forth when they didnt have a decent story theyd just throw a lot of blood at the project and people would go see it but now its a genre all to itselfthere is nothing worth seeing in this movie at all it uses the most cliche of characters namely a bunch of douchebros go to a small village in eastern europe where the women are hot and eager to do them and they do but to quote an old meme its a trap and theyre all captured and taken to a place where rich people pay lots of money to torture and kill innocents i think its supposed to be a commentary on the fragility of life and how in todays world anything can be bought and sold for a price or i would think that somebody at some point has tried to make that comment in defense of this movie it was crap then and its crap now this movie exists only to show blood and guts on the screenand thats really it theres no story the characters are unlikable and eli roth decided if he couldnt make a good movie at least make one with lots of blood so people would confuse it with horror and want to see itbut it made money and spawned two sequels each of which was worse than the one before it,cruel
it had been a few years since i saw this film following on from saw and saw ii continuing the torture porn or gorno subgenre in a way i knew i had to watch it again for a proper opinion directed by eli roth cabin fever basically american college students paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson are backpacking across europe with their icelandic friend li eyr gujnsson they are in amsterdam and get locked out of their youth they meet alexei lubomr bukov he tells them about a in bratislava slovakia filled with beautiful european women who love tourists they are convinced to travel to this place as soon as they get there the boys start having the time of their lives they are indeed surrounded by hot promiscuous and sexy girls including natalya barbara nedeljkov and svetlana jana kaderabkova from czechoslovakia they indulge in many sessions of heavy drinking and sex but soon after the boys learn of the s dark secret one by one they are taken to an underground surgery run by a sadistic group who call themselves the elite hunting the dutch businessman jan vlask who they met earlier is the psycho in charge li is first to disappear the boys do not think anything serious about it but then josh is next to vanish paxton knows this is out of character and is desperate to know where his friend has got to eventually paxton is kidnapped and falls victim to the torture his fingers are removed by the deranged surgeon however he manages to break his restraints and slowly makes his way out before escaping paxton finds business clothes he is mistaken as a customer for body parts by an american client rick hoffman but he gets away he also finds japanese girl kana jennifer lim along the way but she commits suicide after seeing a reflection of her mutilated face in the end paxton boards a train but then he overhears the voice of the businessman he follows him into a toilet grabs his hand to cut off his fingers nearly drowns him in the toilet and finally lets the man see his reflection before his throat is slit paxton then leaves on another train also starring takashi miike as japanese client petr janis as the german surgeon and eli roth as american stoner it takes a while to get to any threatening stuff it certainly grabs your attention when it gets there with characters cut up their limbs and insides removed and the amount of blood going everywhere but that is all that is memorable really the story is a bit predictable and does not maintain its atmosphere all in all a slightly disappointing horror okay,cruel
2005  12 out of 4 three backpackers hitting every in the area get more than they expect when they go to a small country where people pay to kill other people this here comes as a major disappointment because i really enjoyed eli roths cabin fever technically speaking this film is pretty well made especially some of the cinematography but outside of that the film was all downhill i think the biggest blame goes towards roth and his screenplay which tries to do something different american wise but fails the director said miike and audition were an influence on this film but roth fails to bring the two stories together like that film were led to believe this film is simply about three guys finding girl but then we get to the torture stuff the beaver hunting scenes dont work and the torture scenes dont work the characters arent interesting and thats another problem the final twentyfive minutes is suppose to be full of suspense but none of it worked in the end the film is really slow and boring,cruel
two young american backpackers embark on a trip to europe to have some fun the sights booze drugs and lots of girls are the buffet the meatheads desire to feast on one thing leads to another and the dynamic duo find themselves an offer to the hottest chicks in poor and nondescript eastern europe what theyre about to meet is something straight out of a nightmare from hellwell made for an indie works in all places good acting good direction and well paced the film could have been a blockbuster if not for its subject matter but its not all blood and gore  its hollywood so theres an unexpected turn of events that leads to a thriller akin to indiana jones depicting unflinchingly the dark and infernal reality of this world this is a standout in the horror genre and one film youll never forget,cruel
this movie certainly brought some chills the feeling of helplessness prevails at certain scenes and make you feel part of the movie as you stay connected,cruel
the beginning is very slow picks up and gets pretty decent scary because its pretty realistic especially if youve stayed in a before if you liked saw this is similar but slightly worse,cruel
dont waste your time by watching movie just about torturing people,cruel
featuring lots of guts and gore is a wildly entertaining corpsefilled journey  assuming one is entertained by corpses guts and gore that is,cruel
if youre a seasoned horror fan you will probably think this movie is decent it might be a little intense for some but its nothing compared to extreme european or japanese horror thats out there captures the grim eastern european places still torn from war where people are doing whatever they must to survive,cruel
great horror and gore and a lot of interesting scenes of action which surprised me and a new style of story for this saw style genre however the movie has a serious picture quality and specual effects issuealso because of the budget the acting was floored at times and at certain points the story seemed a bit obvious and showed small signs of weakness,cruel
i remember when i watched it i was like hmm 8 years old so it was freaking scary for me so im making my opinion based 13 years ago,cruel
knew that i would be going into a gory movie so i didnt expect less than that but this plot is weak and uninteresting,cruel
the selftitled torture porn subgenre is not one i particularly enjoy i acknowledge its merits and its appeal to those who just adore mutilation and hanging eyeballs to which i question your definition for entertainment however there are some that are very well crafted and substantiate the very purpose for the scenes of torturous nature this thriller somewhat does but the lack of tension and verbosely sexually frustrated characters made this more disposable than masterful a group of tourists are travelling across europe where they are advised to go to slovakia because the girls are beautiful and desperate rapidly the holiday turns into a hellish experience involving awkward dancing pulp fiction and the surgical removal of organs for pleasure all elements that should be mandatory for any tourist advertisement obviously the film is renowned for its realistic gore that forces you to look in the other direction cutting off toes chainsawing fingers and slicing heels have never looked soummmappetising despite roths mediocre direction he clearly has an eye for blood the issue is that his focus is purely on the torture the characters and story were an afterthought in order to justify the mutilation the underground business aspect was intriguing albeit sickening but the motive for the characters to stay in that was flimsy youre telling me that they travelled from amsterdam to slovakia just for sex surely it wouldve been cheaper to hire an escort at the red light district they didnt think it through and because of their primitive minds they paid the price the fact that they werent likeable either didnt exactly help with becoming invested in them surprisingly the character that was most relatable met their demise the absence of thrills in the first half does mean it takes awhile for the pace to kick in but the toecurling second half will have you looking back and forth in anguish suffice to say i shant be staying in a in slovakia anytime soon,cruel
may show slovakia as a country in backwardness but it doesnt show the whole country it shows those creepy neighborhoods were some psychotic killers live or were the highest criminal rate manifests it is a great movie by great i mean many things such teens behaviour the sexy girls wishes to get stoned and for sex the torture  even if it wasnt so much intense it had to show more scenes like that and of course how ending resolves you will enjoy it,cruel
well this film is alright but it isnt the best the plot and the script is good and the acting isnt to bad but there are more bad points than good firstly to make the surgeon a main guy in the film there is very little back story or information about him or the obvious big scale operation he has going there secondly when he gets his two fingers cut off with the chain saw they dont bleed very much and there is no attempt to bandage them up or stop the bleeding and they dont seem to bother him thirdly when hes in the car and runs over the 3 people theres no way hed get enough speed up to knock them over like that overall not a bad film but could of been so much better,cruel
when i saw the movie at the flea market for a buck i said what the heck its tarantino i had trouble following the movie due to a lack of confusing flashbacks its a jokethree guys are touring europe doing guy things they meet a man who tells them about a in a small isolated town in eastern europe where there is an overabundance of pretty women who have nothing better to do than to throw themselves at anyone with a foreign accent and they love all americans when they get there note pulp fiction on tv it is true women who look like models unashamedly share sleeping quarters with men give them drugs and have sex with themone by one the men disappear as do the japanese girls and are tortured to death aka blood sucking freaks paxton jay hernandez the last of the trio demands to know where his friends are the slaughterhouse was filmed at an actual mental hospital in praguesex nudity fbomb torture,cruel
it was pretty good but the writing kind of sucked director eli roth is not that good of director but actually is a cool dude but when it came to part 2 this one looks better,cruel
this eli roth movie is pretty straight forward in terms of horror and gorefest movies go so dont expect to be blown away by anything remotely revolutionarythe storyline was predictable but still have enough gore and gruesomeness to make it watchablegranted that the movie was predictable and generic then it was well worth sitting through it to watch the gruesome torture scenes and the inventive ways that writer and director eli roth came up with ways of how to inflict bodily harm and pain upon people with scenes such as these then it is a make or break whether or not the scenes are believable and can make the audience cringe eli roth is certainly good at making the audience cringethe characters in the movie were actually quite nicely fleshed out pardon the pun more than others obviously i will say that jay hernandez actually carried the movie quite nicely throughout the entire course of the moviei remember watching this movie when it was first released and i was somewhat impressed back in the day however after revisiting it now some 13 years later i am not all that impressed anymore the movie is still entertaining but in terms of storyline and plot it was mediocre it is the grotesque torture that keeps the movie afloat,cruel
watching all these years later doesnt seem to be so shocking and controversial as it once was but it still packs a punchmost certainly worthy of a watch for the non squeamish the acting isnt of a great standard but thats not the reason for watching,cruel
if im being honest the scary part abit the film was the start as it builds up the intisipation of what could be a good film sadly it wasnt,cruel
171031 a second rate slasher flick nothing really stands out to me not even the story ii however,cruel
unfairly dismissed as torture porn by many critics this terrific horror film plays off audience expectations and takes them on a terrifying ride you cannot predict where it will go the story revolves around a group of three americans traveling through europe staying in s two are obnoxious partyboys and one is the niceguy character when one of the obnoxious guys is lured away by pretty girls the two remaining become suspicious of what happened and begin to investigate all the while since the film opened with images of horrific implements of torture in a dark dank torture chamber the audience has already had seeds planted in their minds of what really happened writerdirector eli roth does an amazing job of playing against horror film tropes and audience expectations particularly spoiler alert when he kills off the niceguy hero of the film marion cranestyle and the audience is left without a safety net after that it feels as if anything is possible which has the impact of creating genuine suspense now that weve seen that all of the characters are expendable roth really knows his horror films his first film cabin fever was a slasher film without a slasher and it completely worked and he uses that knowledge to surprise the audience throughout when the niceguy is killed its as if all bets are off and anything can happen it also helps that the film doesnt feature and name actors because when you cast brad pitt in your film you know brad pitt isnt going to be killed this tension is olstered by roth establishing early on in the film that hes not going to cut away from the violence and that he is going to show the audience the full bloody graphic horror of whats happening and its extreme as with the best horror films has an interesting subtext about americas interventionist nature around the globe and how thats received by the rest of the world american arrogance is a ripe topic for a revengelike thriller especially when its framed around an underground eastern european business that caters to the depraved murderous desires of wealthy men who want the exotic adventure of torturing and murdering attractive youth without consequencesthis film is credited or accused of ushering in the torture porn horror subgenera which it most certainly did extreme horror films like audition or ichi the killer had been around asia cinema for awhile and roth rightfully gives a not to those film with a cameo appearance by takashi miike the likely the originator of extreme horror films saw did come out the year before but it relied more on traditional implied horror instead of showing all the graphic violence unlike its subsequent sequels roth also provides other nods that horror fans will likely pick up on such as the slow tracking shots of the door at the end of the torture hallway as a nice homage to the menacing door at the end of the hall in the texas chainsaw massacre overall is a film that is not intended to appeal to a wide audience and not even to all horror fans but for horror film fans of a hearty nature this film is amazing,cruel
i havent read every review of but from what i have read i dont find a reference to quentin tarantino who serves as one of the executive producers tarantino loves switching gears midmovie and thats exactly what this film does also greg nicotero famous for his makeup expertise in some george romeo living dead films and the hit tv show the walking dead serves as the special makeup effects designer and creator it comes down to this if you dont enjoy plenty of ta for the first half of a film and torture and some gore during its second half dont bother but if you do vodka and red bull,cruel
its really not worth ten stars but so many people are disliking the story for no good reason i felt like i should even it out first of all i am extremely disturbed by people saying they had no sympathy for young men being tortured to death because they didnt like them enough really i would have sympathy for anyone brutally murdered then we have the people who are upset with portrayal of slovalkia or upset that a gay character was portrayed as a bad person get over it gay people can be as bad or as good as anyone else the film is clever enough there isnt much story but what there is fits together very well the reason they were killed is because someone felt like killing them for gratification and they had the opportunity because they are foreigners thats it,cruel
i have noticed that many people not only dislike this film as a whole but tend to point out every single flaw or judge based on elements that a true movie lovercritic would not be focused on when openmindedly enjoying a production i not only think this film is unique a strongly held concept and a situational horror that is not only realistic but actually capable of happening i believe it is a oneofakind edge of your seat wellacted and wellwritten masterpiece when your main characters are collegeinduced vacationers who enjoy the wonderful perks of youth which of course include alcohol drugs and banging hot chicks i believe the dialogue and actions are spot on when it comes to portraying the mindset that the average collegiate tool obtainsi love the idea of humans taking the lives of others for a price it takes you beneath the surface of human nature and our need to attempt anything to get a spark of euphoria what i think eli was trying to accomplish is that some people do drugs some people drink some people have meaningless sex and some people murder its all about what a human is willing to do at the expense of others to receive their own personal thrill i very much applaud the acting the script the cinematography and the concept those who have rated this film poorly obviously did not take from it exactly what it was attempting to say satirically and literally in my opinion it is worth the watch,cruel
if theres one label that has been thrown around way too much the past decade and that i detest with my very being its the current trend of referring to everything as porn a new romantic comedy comes out its girl porn a new stallone actionflick comes out its action porn a new rrated horror flick of course its usually saddled with the inflammatory and unflattering moniker of torture pornthe trend moreorless was set in motion in the mid2000s with the rise of a new stable of horror films that put their focus on extreme situations and circumstances which often included a degree of torture or gore most people seem to point their fingers at 2004s release saw as the start of this trend however inaccurate though this may be its actually quite a tame film in my mind though the 2005 film helmed by goremaestro eli roth is probably when the popularity of this term unfortunately picked up with its storyline based around a corrupt and vile company where the ability to torture and murder can be paid for by the rich elite of the worldit was a controversial film to say the least i remember the tension and the excitement and the backlash that built around it like it was yesterday angry parents condemned it for glorifying violence while filmgoers hungry for something new and extreme offered glowing praise for pushing the boundaries i even remember going into the theater opening night and seeing that there were literally cops on hand to kick out underaged teens who tried to sneak in and being double and triplechecked for id practically every time you so much as turned your head it stopped being a movie it became an event in the world of film audiences something i hadnt ever seen before as a teenager at the timeand yet in the years that have passed this initial rush of excitement has been replaced with a palpable sense of indifference and apathy from those same audience members who had so excitedly rushed to theaters to see it opening weekend the cultural phenomena died down as people stopped seeing it as a special experience and dismissed it with that term i hate so much people now crucify it in reviews as simply being shallow gore for the sake of gorebut i dont agree yes it is most certainly a blatant brutal and bloody film and yes it most certainly is exploitation cinema at its most obvious but i do think theres a lot more going on under the surface than most people will see or at least admit and for me its actually held up quite wellwe follow a group of american college students jay hernandez derek richardson backpacking through europe with their icelandic friend oli eyr gujnsson seeking nostrings fun and indulging in drugs and sex the group are having the time of their life without realizing how corrupt and selfish their actions are making them upon the suggestion of a young man they meet they head to slovakia and stay in a mysterious where they are promised to be met with grand parties and beautiful women but things are not what they seem and soon they will learn that they have been lured into a vile trap now targets of a devious company that sells humans for torture and murder to the highest bidderat its heart is for all intents and purposes a very dark fable about morality and the things we take for granted in the modern world its also most certainly a commentary on american culture and consumerism as a whole and concepts like american exceptionalism and the idea that we as americans are inherently superior or invincible at the time of its release the us was in a very turbulent period in its history with patriotism running high many would argue too high to the point of being blinding and a shaky government at war with various enemies this is very much reflected in the film which is brimming with a lot of subtle satire its actually very well developed and deliveredthe elements of horror and the performances are stellar as well roth has a good slowbuild to his narratives and it gives the film a nice oldfashioned vibe in comparison to the increasingly complex and extreme content presented while it will continue to be dismissed i do think that is far more clever a film than many will admit and i think that for fans of horror or even fans of film analysis in general that it is a journey through depravity that is well worth takingi give it a very strong 9 out of 10,cruel
this is going to be an easy review because the film put me to sleep literally put me to sleep because of how boring it was the acting is lame but whatever we need to talk about the director eli roth after being boring for a while and watching the film i checked my phone because i needed to check out eli roths imdb and that explained everything this the man is a proved failure as a director anyway the film is very forgettable and will make you want to take a nap which isnt a good thing when it comes to a socalled horror movie what a waste of time but at least i got some shuteye out of it but more importantly now i know i should avoid anything with eli roths name on it talk about failing your way up,cruel
is one of the first horror movies ive seen i was eleven at the time when it first came out i saw it only once ten years ago ill try to recollect the best i can since i dont want to see againin fact deals with a pretty serious and hard subject  selling human organs on black market a story goes something like this three friends go to slovakia only to have fun along that way they meet some hot girls who seem to only want to have some fun of course they have another goal in mind and there goes the horroris not a frightful movie its more disturbing than actually scary if someone is not a fond of gory movies they can drop off their watch list is not a gore fest movie but scenes where people are tortured are made pretty convincing depicts a sick world underworld where people are brutally tortured and killed for their organs few people will enjoy watching this one since it deals with the most important topic in a very brutal fashion those looking for some nonsensical violence and cleverly put scary ideas wont find any of those here the closest movie to i can remember is saw but far less originalto conclude theres not much left to analyze if you asked me ten years ago if i would recommend this movie id surely respond with yes today i really dont see why would someone watch or any of this kind of movies is not enjoyable scary nor it creates tension it uses serious topic only to disturb you and i dont see why would anyone want to make themselves feel that way,cruel
this one gets one point for special effects and one more because there is no zero rating on this site three redblooded young american males touring europe with backpacks and sowing some wild oats meet up with a stranger in amsterdam who persuades them that a in slovakia is where they should be where the girls areheck why wouldnt they if they knew what lay in store for them they would have been on the first plane back to the states but alasthis is another sick fantasy from the brain of quentin tarantino the in question is run by people who supply victims for an outfit that offers a service to people with equally sick minds strap him  or her  to a chair and kill him as quickly or as slowly as you like the police are in on it too in fact this is an enormous conspiracy it has to be which begs the question can it really be run at a profit unless its clients are billionairesfortunately this sort of operation cannot exist in real life unfortunately there are plenty of warmongers terrorists and serial killers on the loose doing similar things which begs the question how many of the latter have been inspired by the likes of quentin tarantino,cruel
before i get into criticizing this movie i feel i should admit that i am human i often enjoy seeing movies that involve sexual material and i also often enjoy seeing movies that have a lot of blood and gore shed this movie certainly has both of those ingredients and in great quantity but all the same the movie failed to interest me that much you cant just put great gobs of nudity and bloody violence in a movie and expect it to therefore be instantly great you have to put substance with it as well and that is where fails for starters the movie is very slowmoving  it takes forever for the protagonists to find themselves in trouble and during that long period before the crisis starts what we see of them is not exactly endearing  they come across as simpleminded sexobsessed youths while im speaking of the characters the movie also fails when it comes to the antagonists  we learn almost nothing about them as a result of that there isnt a great feeling of danger to be felt youll just tiredly watch the mayhem and look at your watch to see how much time is remaining until the movie comes to an end a real disappointment,cruel
the first half of the movie is flat out horrible i would have left it at that and not even bothered finishing the movie if it wasnt for the side of me that needs to always see things through to the end theres pointless sex and banter between characters that are awkward and one dimensional you can tell the actors were bored filming this part of the movie because their acting capabilities dont kick in until the latter half  when the gore and torture starts to kick in and then goes from halfass borderline softcore porn to an actual horror movie isnt scary its more cringeinducing as a whole its a pretty bad movie but just for the torture scenes i can see why it was touted as being unique for its time,cruel
im a huge fan of horror movies but this movie is the absolute best eli roth definitely set a new level for that genre what i like is that this is so classical and and the same time so different from any other horror movie that i saw this movie absolute brings something fresh and new approach to the familiar material the structure of the story is absolute fantastic in most of the sciences you fairly certain that you know whats gonna happen next and i have to admit that i was wrong most of the times well after all those words needless to say that this movie is an absolute a must for any horror movie fan out there id guarantee that youd like it well done eli roth you are absolutely genius ,cruel
in case you didnt already know the second major film by eli roth kind of spawned the rather dubious genre of torture porn this is where gratuitous onscreen violence is displayed for our  the audiences  entertainmentand thats basically the premise of the film if youre okay with that youll enjoy it as believe it or not theres also a story woven somewhere in there two american teenagers are backpacking across europe where they hear of a legendary in eastern europe where the girls outnumber the guys and do all sorts of other stuff to put it mildly naturally they head off there and  even more naturally still  they fall foul to all sorts of unspeakable scenariosand if you can get over of the violence its not actually that bad youll like the characters  theyre dumb enough to be believable as your average backpacking teenagers but not so stupid enough that youll be shouting at the screen when they make the wrong decisions plus the threat element is pretty original and based on numerous urban legendsso just to check if youre okay with gratuitous sex and violence and generally like horror films then you should probably enjoy this and part ii even but just dont bother with part iii  it went straight to dvd,cruel
it is somewhat futile to criticize the makers of a movie like this because they are not hearing any of it as they are laughing all the way to the bank mediocre or bad reviews mean absolutely nothing accomplish absolutely nothing here come the sequels and more trips to the banktechnically it is quite professionally done especially for a novice director and a skimpy if not low budget the scenery is attractive and the places that are not meant to be attractive are not the horrible third act is played out in a horrifying dungeon of depravity torture and disgusting human beings are given enough screen time to capture a comatose morality and deliver one of those mans inhumanity to man messagesthe finale is so disgusting bloody and disturbing that teenagers looking for shock on the screen were reveling in its repulsiveness they the same that just cant get enough fart jokes because you know its so in your face embarrassing that their immature minds just find it so funnyoverall its target audience will love it and casual moviegoers and occasional horror fans will be in awe of its audacity others will point to this as an example of cultural degradation and the decline of civilization as we know it a slick looking bit of sickness that should hand out barf bags like in the old days of exploitation but that would cost some money and that trip to the bank wouldnt be as much greedy fun the purpose of the filmmakers was not to make art but to make money pandering to the lowest common denominator mission accomplished,cruel
17 the concept of a slasher movie in which the victims cannot escape or fight back unless the person doing the slashing is clumsier than mr bean or is as incompetent as a nazi jail watchman in a silly ww2 set yarn as it doesnt matter how many chainsaws get waved around or toes get cut off this just isnt as intense as it needs to be mr roth may know how to hold a camera but i doubt the words rewrite or 2nd draft hold much meaning to him i expect hes of the opinion that for as long as there are plenty of onscreen bare breasts then no one will notice the fact that the actors are spouting totally awful dialogue and that the plot really needed a rethink whilst at the same time all likelihood contrivance and normal human sense is bent to breaking point when the last remaining character finds his way into the chamber of horrors by a preposterously lazy manner overall this is a nasty juvenile blackhearted though quite well shot exploitation feature that really has nothing new to offer apart from repackaged ideas and while its vile enough to to upset most normal people its not to the extent in which it gets the dreaded nc17 rating resulting in the produces lose all their money true exploitation money focused trash then,cruel
i dont write reviews usually but when i saw the low reviews i had to express and speak out i am sickly obsessed with movies of every genre i am an academy award fanatic if it won it ive seen it ive seen every horror movie that everyone needs to see the twists in sixth sense and scream are timeless two of my favorites i like very well made movies american beauty dead poets society the usual suspects one flew over the cuckoos nest good will hunting i am a huge fan of all movies as you can see i am very picky about acting and likable characters as far as horror movies go has the creepiest people i have ever seen did you like hannibal lector or buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs i find the characters in much creepier a dutch businessman on a train whom when eats his salad with his fingers says i prefer to us my hands where did they find this guy hes so creepy when 2 of 3 friends have lost their friend olli they are convinced that they are chasing him through alley ways and a building only to find when they catch up to him it is someone else a creepy man who looks like him from behind and wearing ollis clothes when he turns around he looks very creepy when paxton asks the man where he got the jacket the man replies with a creepy accent this is my jacket then smiles the scariest untrustworthy smile showing rotten teeth the desk clerk at the is perfect suspicious and creepy replying i think they left this morning with an obvious lie behind his words this is the most creepy movie ever a suspicious hotel is a great idea for a horror movie what is going on at the very well made very well written very original 10 out 10 horror stars,cruel
in a nutshell  dont bother run away would be more accurate this is a terrible terrible movie not in the same way as horror movies are bad but you still enjoy watching them though it really actually boringly sucks the plot is inexistent theres no suspense whatsoever and its not even scary its just garbage this is only gore bad dialogs and acting more gore and boredom and did i mention the gore is awfully boring and annoying ketchupy gore  again this is the worst movie me and my friends have ever seen hands downplease if you still want to watch this reconsider your life goals first thank you,cruel
the story is about three backpackers on a trip in europe in what they expect to be a journey of illicit sex and drugs abruptly turns into a nightmare the concept of businessmen hiring disturbed men to torture innocent people sounds nonsensical enough but it could of been handled much better than it was the film starts off with 50 minutes of frivolous irrelevant sex and drug consumption when the gore and horror is introduced you are already too disheartened to feel anything the main characters have no substances or character development for that matter so when they are eventually tortured you dont feel any sorrow for them sure a few parts of the movie were interesting for instance paxtons escape wait that might be the only entertaining part and that too was done poorly plot induced stupidity is prevalent in a lot of films but accidentally cutting your prisoners cuffs and then slipping on blood in what is a borderline banana peel gag is just too muchis not worth checking out you will be better offbut what do i know im just a 15 year old boycaesar drake,cruel
although im a huge horror fan i never really got warm with the whole torture porn it was therefore relatively late that i got to see both saw and probably the best known exponents of the genre and both i only watched them because they are so well known and i wanted to know what everyone was talking abouti found saw to be better than i expected which isnt generally saying much but at least it didnt suck as for i read somewhere that eli roth liked saw but found the final twist which i obviously cant talk about to be silly and unbelievable a sentiment i strongly agree with so i had to see this one as well and i was positively surprised with it more so than with sawthe story is that three backpackers tour europe in search of women to have sex with and drugs to consume the first half hour or so introduces the characters and their motivation as they get stoned and rent prostitutes in amsterdam a slightly creepy russian dude they meet tells them of a near bratislava that doesnt appear in any guide book and is supposed to be some sort of insider tip for hedonistic travelers the description entices them enough to cancel their previous plans and travel there immediately at first it appears to be everything that was promised as they hook up with beautiful girls and take lots of drugs in a disco but gradually the atmosphere becomes more threatening until the first of their friends disappearsi wont go into any detail as for the events that follow except that it involves violence and torture as should be expected from the genre both are however not too graphic or shocking especially if you have seen films such as tokyo gore police or pretty much anything by takashi miike who has a cameo here btw a lot of the violent acts are shown in gore discretion shots which makes you wonder why the camera suddenly pans away if youre familiar with aforementioned films in the first part of the film we get treated to lots of gratuitous nudity even by horror film standards which my girlfriend didnt like all that much but as for me personally things could be worsethe acting is generally decent especially considering that theres no big names among the actors particularly outstanding was rick hoffman as the american client as remarked by lots of other reviewers but i also liked jan vlasak as the dutch businessman who was very creepy from the first shot he appeared in also eli roth has shown again that he knows how to integrate dark humor and suspenseful horror  a feat that is in no way easy and can fail spectacularly at times yes im looking at you rob zombie what ultimately sold me however is that he builds up tension and suspense very well and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end this is also what mainly sets it apart from saw which i found kind of tedious at times not to mention the solution to the plot  say what you will about it is a lot more believable than saws silly twist on a side note the beatings takes while saw is generally praised makes me think less and less of the cumulative imdb ratings and is one of the reasons i wrote this reviewa final word to common points of criticism from other reviewers lots of people seem to complain that it wasnt made by quentin tarantino i dont know how they managed to write this in reviews as they must clearly be illiterate the movie starts with the words presented by quentin tarantino followed by written and directed by eli roth seriously have you ever considered how many films and tv shows alfred hitchcock presented without having anything obvious to do with it it is a common device in hollywood also i dont get the complaint by slowakians sure it is portrayed as a pretty bleak and impoverished place but who in their right mind would watch as a source of real world information on eastern europe roth clearly takes artistic liberties here deliverance portrayed inhabitants of georgia as inbred rapist crackers and you dont hear them endlessly complaining about itultimately if you dont buy into the hype and dont expect too much you will find that you could have spend 90 minutes far worse than watching this if you squirmed at the violence in kill bill and somehow expected another tarantino flick this isnt for you if you thought koroshiya ichii was too tame and hope to see a more violent and gory film stay with japanese productions but if youre looking for a nice suspenseful horror flick with a small dose of dark humor and dont mind looking at naked girls in between this is worth a tryfinal rating 710 might watch again but i added a star in the final rating to countermand the plethora of unjustified one star ratings,cruel
one of the scariest and grossest films ever made with a chilling soundtrack and freaky and haunting settings the 1st delivery of the trilogy sets the pace for a world of horror suspense and yuckinessi dont know if most people would realize but the errors in geography were very noticeable and offputting when it comes to the movie it was shot in the czech republicwhen the guys are cruising amsterdam the first glimpse you get is of the streets of prague ams and prg are nothing alike at all then you have paxton speaking german with the owner instead of dutch as it should be in the netherlands then you see how everything in slovakia is read in czech the town used for the movie was the cesky krumlov famous for its music festivals yeah i know for the average viewer this is a whatever comparison but those of us whove been all through europe will find this ridiculousnot to mention the czech train station plastered with german signs to make it look like it was austria yet had czech signs all overgoing back to the movie it is interesting how two americans would get so concerned over some icelandic guy theyve met like 2 days ago like paxton says in the movie this is how people do it here but in america they have that tendency to do that as well anyways the desire to get laid is what get them dead in the first place there is no explanation at all as to why theres a hunting club who manages it or why is the involved that is solved in part 2 spoiler while it is very unlikely that paxton would be able to leave europe after killing 14 people in his rampage we feel happy for him once he leaves fingerless to his countrythis movie rescues something that had been lost for decades when it came to the horror genre after the thrillers from the 70s and 80s the 90s felt to deliver good horror flicks they came across as humorous and tacky while in 2005 rescued some of that including some movies coming out at the same time like ringu the grudge or rec gore sellsanyways despite the horrific geographical errors to sum it up you can certainly tell the difference between the netherlands and germany  both 1st world countries and the czech or the slovak republic which are notoriously poorer and less advanced this is a movie worth watching every time and as the head of the bubble gum gang said worth every dolla,cruel
this movie starts off with three backpackers two american friends and an icelandic drifter they are backpacking across europe smoking marijuana getting drunk and going to whore houses than thy see a russian guy who recommends them to a in bratislava slovakia where the girls there are supposedly the best when they arrive there they meet to gorgeous young women and they start having sex with them and doing all sorts of things with them then eventually bad things start happening and one of there friends is missing they are trying to find out what is going on it is not like those situation films where something happens the first ten fifteen or even twenty minutes and they live up to it this movie unfolds in other words it starts off slow but it gets darker and darker and deeper and deeper and deeper as the film progresses that is what i like about this movie it also made me think does this stuff actually happen in real life this is eli roths best movie to date his first film cabin fever was terrible however he came a long way with this film if you want to see a film unfolds as it progresses and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through from beginning to end i would recommend but be warned this films violence is very explicit and realistic and it might leave disturbing images in your head not for the faint of heart,cruel
i hated this film there wasnt a single good thing about itwhat happened with good horror films now modern horror films are no longer scary just disgusting and sadisticthis movie was unbearable the performances were terrible and the script were quite poor pretentious and annoying all the characters both the victims and the villainswere despicable and irritatingthis was twisted and sick but not in a good way why a good director like quentin tarantino accepted to put his name in such a bad film this i just dont get iti cant believe this atrocious film had a sequel the first movie was bad enough,cruel
i watched this movie last night on the syfy channel i enjoy a good horrorslasher movie now and again and i was quite impressed with this one a much more elaborate story than you usually get with movies in this genre so i came to imdb and slapped an 8 on itthen i checked some reviews and saw comments ranging from impressed with the utter carnage to this is an absolutely horrible film that only sick people would watch having just watched it on syfy i wondered how much horror i must have missed due to editing for tv so i dash up and rent the unrated version not the r rated to see all the good stuff i missedsilly me there was about 3 seconds more movie in the unrated version than the version i had just watched on basic cable one second involving an ankle and two seconds involving puss coming out of a wound frankly the stuff they did show was much worse than the stuff they didnt and of course they blurred the boobies on cable good movie but i didnt see more gore than has been shown in other movies long before thison a side note how about our american morals its ok for kids to see limbs chopped off with a chain saw on basic cable but by god dont let them see a womans breast,cruel
this movie had very unfair treatment with all the reviewsyes its not a big time motion picture yes it has kind of an american pie commercial baseline but not that muchnoooooooooo its not crappy and will rock your socks in some scenesas a matter of fact i would love to see the faces of all these negative reviewers at some point of the moviebottom line is if youre a skeptical critical realistic detail nut this probably wont do for youotherwise if youre part of the 98 of the movie consumers it will do just fine you wont notice any flaw and you wont regret itive seen loads of far worse terror movies being idolized hereits good to watch has got a solid storyline and will involve you the whole time the idea is good and terrifying and for the european reality criticism for christ sake this is an entertaining movie not a documentary,cruel
11252009eli roth is one sick bastard this is exactly why he is one of my favorite directors he is a complete horror fanatic and it his first film cabin fever is an instant classic which will be reviewed on this blog in the coming weeks both films carry the quentin tarantino presents credit which of course adds a little street cred to themthis was one of the first movies along with saw to carry the lame media label of torture porn extreme gore and sadistic violence used to shock the audience seriously you know theres going to be some sick disturbing stuff in this flick so if that offends you dont frickin see it the story revolves around three college grads who are backpacking through europe these are really good guys that you could actually see yourself hanging out with they are played by jay hernandez paxton derek richardson josh and eythor gudjonsson oli the first half of the movie is set up like a skin flick on cinemax with lots of gratuitous nudity and debauchery the guys start out in amsterdam enough said paxton seems to be the leader of the group josh is a little more reserved as he was just coming off a long relationship oli the king of the swing is most responsible for the comic relief they meet a local guy named alex at a club he directs them to bradislava slovakia for all the hot women they can take he states that with all the wars there are few men for so many beautiful women this scene makes a strong statement that most young americans have no idea what is happing in the world today as there actually havent been any wars in slovakia for the past 50 years this movie has a very strong social commentary on the youth of america americans seem to think they have a bullet proof sense of entitlement when traveling abroad while many people in many other countries despise americans and their cockiness on the train to bratislava a small picturesque town in slovakia they meet an older business man the man strikes up a conversation and proceeds to eat a salad with his hands josh freaks out when the man touches his knee a little homophobic and the man excuses himself they arrive in bratislava and check in at the local this place is quite nice but they will have roommates when they get to their room they walk in on two hot foreign girls changing these are the bait girls they invite the guys down to the spa and they instantly pair up and that night party at a local disco josh goes to get some fresh air and is threatened by the bubble gum gang a group of local kids that extort the tourists he is saved by mr saladhands coincidence the guys all end up sleeping with the girls but as morning breaks oli is missing the next night the girls slip something into the two guys drinks paxton gets himself locked into a supply closet saving his life while josh doesnt have such luck josh in brought into a dank dark dungeon like complex and is chained to a chair mr saladhands then has his devilish way with him he always wanted to be a surgeon but has unsteady handspaxtons search for his friends comes up empty and he eventually confronts the now less than glamorous women they been partying with that last few days she leads him to an art show at this old factory where we get a cameo appearance by legendary japanese horror director takashi miike this crumbling building houses the operations of elite hunting a worldwide organization that offers the experience of killing for a price if you want to kill a local its cheap while killing an american will cost you paxton is able to escape his torture cell minus a few fingers he finds out his friends are dead and plans his escape the clients of elite hunting are seen as regular people with regular lives this is part of the plot of the sequel which will be reviewed next the films bring forth a frightening question for wealthy adrenaline junkies that have traveled to world what would be the ultimate high writer director eli roth came up with the idea for this story from a foreign website that offered such services whether this site was legit is up for speculation,cruel
as a fan of horror good and bad and gorefests i was looking forward to seeing when i first heard about it but then two things were putting me off firstly eli roth as director having seen cabin fever which could have been really good but turned out a massive disappointment i was worried the same would happen here secondly a lot of reviews had described the film as 90 minutes of pointless gore and torture and that was not what i wanted to seethankfully neither of these things came to fruition with eli roth has stepped up as a director both in the way the film was shot and how the story was told whilst there are some gaping holes in the plot the story flows throughout and doesnt descend into violence and gore for the sake of it the torture scenes are very cleverly shot showing you just enough to start turning your stomach but leaving some to your imagination if you dare try and think about itthis film delivered what it set out to and exceeded my expectations it is what a gruesome horror movie should be that said it is sill a teen horror movie and wont ever escalate into the more grown up genre of films such as the omen or alien but then i dont think that was its intention,cruel
i found the film to be a brutal  sick horror film it is about 3 backpackers paxton josh and oli who are backpacking across europe they are in amsterdam where they get locked out of their youth while in amsterdam they meet alex a man who shows pictures of gorgeous women to them suggests the three of the to visit the in bratislava slovakia in eastern europe where the women are all hot and have a taste for american men when they get there everything is too good to be true they hear that this is filled with beautiful european woman who want tourists when they arrive they meet three delicious girls in the they start having the time of their lives the next day they find out that oli is missing they then spot a man wearing olis jacket at a museum of medieval torture later that night while having a part with natalya and svetlana paxton and josh fall bad to the effects of alcohol they slowly start to realise that this is hiding a terrible secret,cruel
2005 consists of two parts and just let me say it frankly a first part that could not have been made in a more stupid way and almost caused me stopping the movie and a second part which belongs to the best horror i have ever seen and believe me i am experienced that the director had chosen slowakia as a background for the second part shows anew that eastern europe is not just a cheap place for making a movie with horrible wages for the indigenous stunts and no eastern europeans in the main roles but delivers a scenery of medieval castles kafkaesque towns and widespread farmland as far the eyesight reaches the place where the movie was shot belong one thousand years long to hungary until it had been taken away during the trianon treaty in 1920 since then what has been called slowakia for a few decades has been and is degenerate corrupt and brutal and frankly i would not be astonished if the horror that the movie depicts is been based on true events on the other side slowakia or upperhungary was also the place of the hungarian countess erzsebet bathory who was one of the first known series killers the eastern european earth is imbued with history every pebble tells you a story so it is no wonder that herzog shot his remake of murnaus nosferatu in the slowakian carpathianswhat makes the horror in so powerful is that it is not realistic like practically all horror movies that had been issued in the last decades but naturalistic in the literary sense of the term the camera stands behind the tormentors and turns so long until each angle of the gruesome scene is floodlighted and exhausted the director eli roth does not make the mistake to try to give his naturalistic shots an aesthetic icing by heaving it off the actual scene when you see the acts you are really shocked the movie achieves a hardly ever reached immediacy foreign businessmen travel to slowakia simply and solely because in a decrepit factory amidst the trash that the communists left there are kidnapped young foreign people imprisoned whom you are allowed to torture uninhibited by any moral bond if you just pay enough you even see the pathologic lust dropping out of the slavering mouths when the tormentors finally stand at the goal of their lifelong dreams to get an orgasm from drilling out the eyes or burning through the achilles tendons of innocent peopleis without doubt one of the tophorrormovies of all times,cruel
with all of the hype behind this movie i thought i new what to expect going in but the movie completely floored me it starts off slow and focuses on three guys backpacking though europe two of them are american and one is icelandic for the first 30 to 40 minutes there is very little horror but a lot of character development goes on so that when the horror does start at least for me it made what the characters where going though more horrific this is where i am going to spoil so if you havent yet seen the movie i do recommend it so stop reading go watch it then finish the review when the horror does happen it is being instigated by someone that the guys met on their journey even the girls the where sleeping with at the beginning are in on it from that point on it is about jay hernedazs characters escape there is a lot of violence and gore but not as much as i was expecting and for the last 30 minutes the film turns into an action movie so as far as a horror movie goes i was disappointed because i was expecting more it does have a satisfying ending in that all of the people directly involved get killed in brutal and very memorable ways all of the guys were very good at there parts and they start out as very unlikable but through the course of the movie that changes i definitely recommend it but dont go in expecting a epic horror cause you will be disappointed,cruel
after cabin fever roth became a so called member of the splatter pack so it was time for him to make a splatter movie he did it and is was called the storyline is very simple but what makes the movie is the torturing scenes they are all done in a gory old fashion way and the blood flows frequently were saw delivered a lot of torturing but in a bit of fantasy this story could happen the only problem was that some people said that the gore was overdone here to but the saw franchise down but saw had some good storyline that became a franchise again roth made use of real babes and let them suffer in many ways what we never thought was the fact that it had an open end 2 came surprisingly quick after this one be sure to watch this first if you would like to catch up with part 2 be aware of the burning eye and the station scene,cruel
directed by eli roth it might not be as violent and uncomfortable than it promotes itself to be but is still a fairly entertaining film whilst basic there is in fact a story featured with the torture featured much less than led to believe what it does succeed in very well is the power to get the audience involved you really get involved with the characters that much that you cant help but put yourself in their position not for everyone but can be enjoyable for some,cruel
i have to say the only reason i wanted to see was because it along with saw is what started the trend of torture porn i was anticipating something along the lines of saw but got something way different whereas saw was very much a dramacrime thriller with clever plot twists all around and had more disturbing scenes is the opposite from the getgo it knows it is a horror film it bombards the audience with all the sex and nudity it can it acts stupid and moralless but the film actually starts off slow it introduces these characters that although we know they are unlikeable eli roth knows how to make us care for them i do not think that would matter if they had not been very well developed but it is a plus side is more gory than saw saw actually never had much gore which is a very underhidden fact has a lot of gore but not very realistic which i thought made it even better it reminded me of classic horror films that had loud dramatic music cheesy actions and dialogue but still managed to not be a joke saw was way more intense but that is because it took itself a lot more seriously actually does not have a lot of horror parts but when it does it does not disappoint in gore i was a big fan of roths earlier horror film cabin fever i thought it was fun and funny and is too but is also more likable in a way the performances while in a way look cheesy are still very good and in acting beats sawi very much started to like the film and by the end i loved it there are not this many gory fun and cleverly comedic horror films these days they try to be but not in this way thumbs up for a nd it holds its own,cruel
some films of the horror genre defy explanation just about everything eli roth has made fits that bill after making 2002s remarkably wellpaced and watchable yet sloppy and ridiculous cabin fever which like all other lions gate films wasnt released until years after it was finished roth decided he wanted to make a horror film as shocking as his new idol takashi miikes films audition and ichi the killer were over in asia what roth ends up doing is making a suspenseful but shockingly antihuman film that was seen by the world as just more torture film fodder any great message roth had was lost on the general public which either avoided because they felt it was only gratuitous graphic violence or flocked to it because they just wanted to see people being tortured the film was hugely controversial therefore it raked in mountains of dough for everyone involved controversy had previously made huge box office hits out of 2004s the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 911 and made eli roth a pop culture icon where previously hed just been a beefy punk with his infectious fanboy attitude all over bravos 100 scariest movie moments special following s success he even took his starryeyed defiance on fox news challenging business correspondent neil cavuto which only made him look more callous and gave fox another jewish face on young hollywood and what is widely considered their snotty sense of superioritywhich is what makes s antihumanity all the more shocking eli roth is not a bad guy rather hes a surprisingly intelligent writer and director who understands a lot but when it comes to his own films hes always more thoughtful about how to market a movie than what actually goes into it cabin fever was marketed as a disturbing extreme gorefest and its not if anything it was a forgettably pedestrian film made from a story with potential that turned into a david lynchian series of tableaux that all failed to hit that muchdesired nerve roth is so concerned with the appearances of his films before people see them the films suffer incredibly he also hangs elements on his films like ornaments on a christmas tree that are supposed to make people think they are deeper than they really are in cabin fever it was the perception by backwoods america of anything the city folk did as being not christian and therefore the locals can just shoot anyone they want to and not get in trouble for it i think larry fessendens wendigo was trying to make a similar point years before cabin fever was released  though in all fairness roth had finished writing fever in the mid1990s the point being fessenden did it with much more grace and intelligence than the wellmeaning but bumbling rothand that brings us back to which by all signs is nothing more than traditional teen horror or teen sex comedy taken to the modern equivalent of a concentration camp or a cruder version of the guantnamo bay detention camp now when i say that please dont imagine the american pie crew or harold and kumar hanging out there cracking jokes and having kooky misadventures before finally being sprung and learning a valuable lesson about friendship and common everyday morality believe it or not does have a serious side its just hard to see it through the haze of plastic sexy teen  early 20s characters with their trendy oneliners and dated slang shallow pursuits of casual sex with nameless foreign women selfish drinking and drug binges brainless usage of homophobic slurs and unnatural attachments to their cellphones which should just be grafted onto their hands to save the time of having to whip them out of their pockets as well as less chance of having them be stolen by impoverished punk gangs of local street childrenits hard to see any point to at all especially when the director then makes a sequel a year later which is virtually the same thing only with women and more obvious misogynistic elements in the first film with men being the target of most of the films pretty graphic violence and murder people saw the film as being a portrait of the effects of the shameful behavior of americas military under command of george w bush on international attitudes of american men knowing roth the film was probably nothing more than a style exercise in gritty exploitation just to have people mindlessly being tortured in the name of roths favorite cinematic pasttime watching fed up st with that kind of ambition its no wonder people find a brainless experience i initially bought into the film as a hardhitting piece of horror for my own personal reasonsin fact i still do see the film as a simple morality tale featuring young americans who could easily be any of the random numbs on the e channels wild on television series or the background drunkards in the girls gone wild videos doing whatever they want to showing an apathetic streak toward everyone but themselves and a hateful attitude toward anything considered gay take these fools and drop them in the middle of a country they know nothing about where people are being murdered and pleasureseeking tourists disappear into thin air its like young americans are being bred like pigs for the slaughter if it isnt overseas its right in our own country though not as extreme an example america is overpopulated people are breeding too much our resources are drying up very slowly with fears of terrorist attacks and disease pandemics flying fast and furious its truly like there is no hope for a real future tobe hoopers first season masters of horrors entry dance of the dead glides over similar terrain and would probably have been more effective that all things considered had that piece not been as afraid of the graphic violence bathed in,cruel
2005 is the first part of the surprise horror hit series made on a relatively small budget is one of the many torture horror films that were made following the success of the saw series he movie follows a trio of young guys looking for fun and pleasure in europe after a stop in holland the guys meet a ratty looking eastern european dude who suggest that they go and party in slovakia taking the weird dudes suggest they head off to a weekend theyll never forgeti wasnt a big fan of eli roths first film so i was very hesitant about seeing this one but i was very pleased after seeing it hardcore horror is backrecommended for horror fans,cruel
is a basic horror gore film i really am not a fan of films like this and after seeing this film i still am not a fan of films like thisbasically the story involves three guys who back pack across europe soon they are each taken to a dungeon where they are tortured to death by people who pay to torture people to deaththe idea is pretty scary i mean people who pay to torture people to death is disturbing i have heard that stuff like this really goes on but i do not even want to think about that if this film intended on disturbing people by making them think that it could really happen then it worked on methe gore is bad at parts and not bad at others for example they do not really show people as they get tortured they just show what they look like after they have been tortured however seeing what they look like basically gets the job done as you do not really have to see the process they go through to see the end result the weak stomached should stay away from this one there is one really really really bad part involving a blow torch and an asian girl ill leave it at thatbasically another problem this film had was transitions they would go from guys getting high to guys finding out about a place where they could get laid to guys getting hit on by older guys it just was poorly transitioned at one part they showed a girl about to have her toe cut off and as it was about to be cut off they cut to a scene of a girl cutting her toe nails the flow is pretty bad as well the acting was actually well done though but sometimes a good script is just as important as good actingi know that there are people out there who like films like this but i really did not like this film bad transitions disturbing plot and a little too much gore for me i do not really recommend it unless you are a fan of horror films,cruel
i really cant understand the hate on sure eli roth is a dumb ass sure has a bad setup some crappy acting some awful dialog and a some unneeded nudity but come on what about last house on the left another movie i liked it has very bad acting even worse than the acting in theres a lot of great horror movies with bad acting the evil dead anyone what im trying to say is is not an excellent movie its not great and its not a classic but its not one of the worst movies ever made and its not a torture porn flick because if is torture porn then last house on the left and cannibal holocaust are torture porn too is better than any of those awful remakes that came out in this decade and one one the best american mainstream horror movies of the last 8 years yes i know this is not saying much but,cruel
this film is about three guys who are traveling around europe they are drinking smoking weed doing ecstasy and having sex with prostitutes in other words having a vacation european style but they dont know that this vacation maybe the last for them i wasnt expecting much of this movie because im not a big fan of this kind of films because usually in this kind of films there is only violence and a mindless plot what is ok but still kinda boring i was surprised how good this movie was first of all because they didnt hurry with a story trying to pass to the killing and torture scenes as fast as possible there was many realistic violent scenes and it really was shocking just try to put yourself in their position it made me sick so its kinda worth viewing horror film,cruel
this movie isnt so much horrifying as sickening id been warned that it was of the slasher genre but these days that can mean anythingit begins quite frankly as utter tripe three boring young men engage in one sexndrugs session after another they are seriously hedonistic  i think i get the message this preamble goes on for so long that i only persevered with it to find out how the slashing started it is slow and contrived to say the least the director just doesnt seem to have a clear idea as to how he is going to disclose the plotwhen the slashing does start it is of such a graphic nature that i was moved to mute the volume and look away you can call me squeamish if you like but i think anybody who finds movies entailing torture and cruelty of this kind the least entertaining would very likely be the sort who  given the opportunity  would pay to participate i suspect they would be masturbating as they watchedafter two of these young man are taken and butchered eventually the third gets his comeuppance but he manages to effect an escape at the cost of a couple of fingers and it is here that the plot finally begins to reveal itself and things start to geli like a chase movie and after a few executions of his own our victim now has an opportunity to escape i rather thought that when he went back to spring the oriental girl he was pushing his luck and would be taken again but no the bit with her eye is too gross to describe with the bad guys on his case he and the girl head for the station her suicide in front of an oncoming train is almost inevitable you can see them both coming a long way off such is vanitynaturally i had expected a twist these cheap shockers almost always have em but here it is one of revenge rather than recapturesomewhere in this crude voyeuristic mess there was the basis of an extremely tense and exciting movie if the director had just got on with his story instead of obsessing over the orgasm he would have saved celluloid and plenty of money whilst delivering a far more coherent plot and threedimensional characters we could care about instead of so much gibletfodder by the same token had he toneddown the snufflike brutality and emphasised the tension and the chase this might have been a thoroughly gripping suspense dramahow many times have modern filmmakers got to be reminded that its not necessarily what you show that matters so much as what you dont show imagination will fill the gaps clearly these people assume we have as little of that stuff as themselves they should be compelled to stopover at the bates motel and study the shower sequence theres not much point in commenting upon the technical aspects of production theres just so much wrong with it upfrontfinally rather than locating it in peaceful slovakia perhaps the should have been more aptly set in serbia recent events demonstrate that there is no shortage of massmurdering psychopaths in that merry little land you could almost say it was the national pastime one suspects that their tourist board would have helped fund the enterpriseim afraid i couldnt recommend this movie to anyone for any reason only the last 15 minutes or so begin to measureup and its hardly worth being put off your dinner for that,cruel
for all of you out there who saw and thought it was a bad movie stop and think for a second was it really the movie that was bad or was it just that you didnt like the subject matter i bet its the latter or the two i am a huge horror enthusiast my collection consists of more than 1000 horror films from various countriesand i went into expecting just another piece of crap like cabin fever i was wrong dead wrong not only is very well directed but it it hearkens back to the old 70s and 80s italian horror and giallo films it shares much in common with the works of such directors as lucio fulci umberto lenzi early wes craven and even the japanese madgenius that is takashi miike this film also transcends genres it is not purely horror but a sinister look into the human mind a lot of people comment on how the movie is very unbalanced and gory that has got to be the biggest lie of them all this film flows perfectly it starts you off by letting you get to know the characters you will feel for these characters when they die they feel like friends especially paxton his character is the definition of a dynamic character as he completely changes throughout the course of this film even in the beginning he shows signs of high intelligence how any americans who travel to europe know any european languages and for the gore i have seen many many a film gorier than and most of those films were made in the 70s and 80s to sum it up is a good film that succeeds on many levels its major downfall is attracting an audience that doesnt know good cinema even when it hits them in the face and tortures them to death,cruel
first of all let me say that contrary to what reviews are stating this is possibly one of the most intelligent horror movies out there while foreign horror movies like frontiers get perfect ratings because of theyre not the norm here in america thus seeming superior they lack the intelligence that this lower rated movie hadis essentially a parable the movie is divided into equal 45minute halves that both parallel in every way except they have different subjects sex and violence from the scenery to the events theyre pretty much a mirror imagejust reversed ill talk about bothsex people complain about or enjoy the nudity calling it semiporn being someone who really doesnt like nudity in films i can say that it isnt quite up to porn level because it simply pretends to be porn you can decide for yourself if that justifies it as being porn or not but uses nudity for a reason i think one of the strongest things the film has going for it was to back up the point that all naked women are the same porn your wife some whore your daughter    all the same it showed that amazingly well through the nudity i think i was most impressed that it used the nudity for a reason unlike other moviesviolence whoever says this is more violent than any of the saw movies please tell me youre joking it roughly is just about as violent as the first saw but after that the saw franchise makes this look babyish there are cutoff scenes scenes that simply show none of the gore on screen scenes where it doesnt show the graphic details in no way shape or form way this pushing gore on screen if they took out about a minute more of it id honestly say it could have gotten a hard pg13 because it uses pg13 strategies to try not to show the gore but intelligently it uses the violence to mirror the sex and make its pointoverall it had a trite almost cute way to wrap the entire movie up i got some pussy the other day but i dont even remember what color her tits were man but this this ill remember forever when given the opportunity violence replaces sexive seen a lot of movies that pretend to be smart no country for old men was one of them but those kinds of movies arent smart simply because they lack anything new to saythey repeat trite clichs death love blah blah blah and though lacks any kind of a plot twist i think the major twist was that it did have something original to say about the correlation between sex and violence it said something about human nature ive never heard beforein the end it feels almost like saws brother theyre utterly different but somehow linked by similar gore and their morals id take this over yet another tired old man movie that thinks its so intelligent but just repeated a clich like there will be blood any day910,cruel
there are a few things i love about this movie and most of them are pretty unusual probably the thing i love most about it is the fact that so many people hate it if you speak the words and eli roth in the same sentence so many people crap on about how it is the worst movie ever its disgusting its repulsive i never want to see it again and so forththe funny thing about that is in going on about how disgusting it all is theyre just pointing out what is so good about it this is a genuinely effective horror film and the fact that so many people in this day and age are disgusted by it proves that there hasnt been a horror movie nearly as effective as this in years the fact is that these days people arent used to seeing a horror movie that actually does what a horror movie is meant to do so when they see something like they cant take itanother thing i love about it is why it is so effective think about in comparison to other similar films the example im thinking of is saw 3 because it came out around the same time saw 3 is a significantly more violent film than yet it doesnt have anywhere near the impact that does this is because it relies on straight blood and gore to get it from point a to point b point a being calm audience point b being audience going ew on regular occasions however plays on our biological urges to intensify the feeling of horror many people describe this film as part pornography part gornography its pretty accurate description because the first half of the film does have a lot of nudity and sex many people call this gratuitous and pointless  how wrong they are they obviously havent thought about the fact that the purpose of pornography is sexual excitement is about human beings getting excited by the idea of hurting each other so when the second half of the film portrays graphic violence and the first half portrays soft pornography the result is that by the end of the film the viewer is left all the more horrified by the violent second half because not only was it disturbing by itself it is all the more disturbing that the violence appeared almost attractivei will also just say that when i say the violence is graphic ignore anyone who says that this is a film based on violence its not certainly it is a violent film but it is not an hour and a half of nonstop butcheryanother thing that is great about this film is the setting the fact that the main characters are backpackers in europe makes them appear all the more vulnerable and i love that the film is almost like a light comedy until they wake up and one of them has disappeared theres that unsettling feeling of not knowing what has happened and having no way to find out what happened and the itself which was initially a fairly warm and comforting if still apparently weird place suddenly seems like a claustrophobic inescapable prison furthermore by the end it feels like everyone everywhere is an enemy and theres just nowhere to gothe character development in is also superb the contrast between the character of paxton at the start and end of the film is startling he begins as just another young man in europe following his sexual urges around and i dont want to give away how the film ends but lets just say hes a long way from where he started and the transition is completely naturali could probably go on for a lot longer but the most important thing i can tell you about is to ignore anything youve been told about except hopefully this review if youre a fan of horror do yourself a favour and sit down and see its best entry in many many years if you dont want to be genuinely affected steer clear,cruel
has taken either heavy criticism or high praise from people im just neutral on this though its nothing to get to excited about but you shouldnt hate it by any means the gore is disgusting in this movie but thats also not a reason to hate it what i didnt like about this movie was the beginning and the highly comedicpornographic atmosphere theres a time and place for both those things and when im going to watch a horror movie i wanna see horror the material itself wasnt bad some jokes were hilarious and the hookers were extremely hot but i wanted to see 90 minutes of torture rather than just one hour once the good stuff gets underway i think eli roth the director has a fine horror flick here but it definitely couldve been better some positive things first of all is the acting most everyone did a great job the fact that theyre all pretty unknown caused me some concern before seeing the movie but they were all good jay hernandez paxton was the one i particularly noticed for the acting and i think this has one of the best endings of any recent horror movie i liked a lot although its definitely not for everyone some may vomit numerous times throughout this movie but if its your cup of tea then i say see it for sure eli roth is a very talented director who has a lot to add to the horrortorture genre expect more good things from him in the future,cruel
people say this movie is too gory too bloody too much language etc i say bsyes the beginning i can see people having problems with that its basically half a porno half a horror flick i didnt want to see porn i wanted to see some limbs cut offi loved the effects i cant believe it holes drilled through limbs blood everywhere it was amazingive grown up with horror my whole life  seeing effects like these are nothing new but it feels great seeing some new ones like the drilled arm bitby the way the story was pretty good its a 9 because of the porno opening but its a must see for horror fans,cruel
this movie is full of blood and nudity the first half hour is pretty much a porn if you are into that it is probably the movie for you this movie has no plot plus you dont really get to know the characters at all so when they die you just sit there and say oh another ones dead pretty much every important character dies so this movie is not good i mean i will admit i was entertained just a little but by the end i was literally sick i have seen some pretty bad horror films and this is one of them if you have a chance to see this movie for free go ahead if you are looking for gore and nudity watch it but if i were you i wouldnt waste the money,cruel
i saw trailers for this movie and wanted to watch it because it looked like an awesome horror movieafter hearing things from friends saying how gory it is it didnt bother me i was in for the long haul wanting to watch this moviemy mate lent me this movie to watch and i an surprised with myself for actually sitting through this trash my dad was shocked that quentin tarantino would produce this moviethe first half is basically porn and the second half is just way over the top gore its disgusting how something like this could be made is a question i suppose will never be answered,cruel
a predictable eli roth movie which basically means youre better off watching something else after being boasted as the sickest thing you will ever see by blabber mouth director i wasnt looking forward to this after the disappointment which was cabin fever but me and some friends decided to go and see it anyway maybe we should of thought twice the story is that while backpacking through europe college students paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson seek the ultimate vacation through sex drugs and unforgettable experiences when a friendly stranger informs the two of a in bratislava that offers the most beautiful and promiscuous women in all of europe paxton and derek trek with their new icelandic friend oli eythor gudjonsson to find the that sounds too good to be true when arriving to bratislava the trio found that the was everything and more of what they expected the events that follow are sure to deliver the unforgettable vacation that the two were looking for mystery suspense and fear direct this film to its bloody ending has a great idea sick but great its just too bad it was brought to the screen in with such a shoddy attempti was expecting cheap thrills and i got cheap thrills but those cheap thrills came along with one of the most cheesy tacky and stupid movie i have seen this film is not once sophisticated and not even that gory his movie is completely charmless and probably more of a disappointment than cabin fever the actors arent terrible but they arent anything special the constant boobs are unnecessary and is just a time waster the characters were annoying and you truly didnt give a damn what happened to any of them please just avoid this filmits eli roths exercise in car crash cinema and boy does it crash and burn the only real thing manages to get right is the shameless promotional attempt by putting master director quentin tarentino kill bill pulp fiction on the front cover which is sure to make movie goers part with their money please i urge you this is no more than a rental and even thats pushing its luck blabbermouth director roth has done it againcabin fever still remains one of the dullest duds ever made he promised us blood we got humour now it has a friend to join it is equally unintentionally funny as a run of the mill horror film does no wrong but for reel spills and chills your best off watching something masterfully crafted and even mildly gripping two things lacksits interesting premise aside i cant really say anything productive about this really isnt anything that you havent seen a hundred times this year whats even scarier is the sequel prepped for 2007 meaning roth gets to splash some more blood around its a good money maker so i wouldnt be surprised if this series keeps going much like the highly worn saw series,cruel
some mixed reviews of this flick but if you like your horror and gore unedited and in your face this is the movie for you the first part of the movie relaxes the viewer with some nice eyecandy a bit of simulated sex and some fit eastern european girls showing off their wares before the lads find out they have a free invitation to a torture chamber it reminded me of watching from dusk til dawn for the first time and how the movie suddenly became a vampire flick halfway through pretty boy jay hernandez made for an unlikely hero but unlike many horror films which go all silly just to show some gratuitous gore director eli roth keeps the suspense going to the end and really kept a seasoned horror fan like myself squirming on the edge of my seat this is definitely not one for the fainthearted or a date movie perfect to watch with a few mates after the pub has shut,cruel
i cannot say enough how shocked i am that eli roth is receiving such acclaim as the future of horror roth manages to deceive his audience in the worst kind of way this film barely gets by as a bad softcore porn for the first hour or so but then oh wait look it is horror as the viewer is held in suspense over the fate of characters we dont give a crap about anyway poor gross out effects then pass off as thrills carrying us through to the end of a film whose target audience is most likely operating with a lowered attention span go see texas chainsaw massacre old or new or any of the saw films as titles from either of these series exponentially outclass the miserable attempt makes at sadistic terror and gore,cruel
typical teenage movies with lots of swearing and naked females running around some gross scenes when the actual torture is going on but overall a boring movie plot not really one at all two americans head to europe in hopes to sleep with lots of random women they do and end up in a torture environment rent it if only to see naked women but thats it acting is average if nothing more the only saving grace is some of the torture scenes actually make you cringe but there are not nearly enough of them the whole basis of the movie is the people staying at the get abducted get taken to an old castle and tortured by surgeon wannabes it fails on all levels,cruel
this movie is hands down one of the worst horror movies i have ever seenthe first 40 minutes were so pointless and the 3 main characters are not developed enough so when the torture scenes actually take place you dont care about them or what happens to them youre just glad the movie is almost overeven the set up is so fake night clubs brothels even the s look like obvious studio set ups by the way the torturegore scenes are nowhere near as gruesome as eli rothtarantino would like you to believeif you want a more effective horror flick with a similar theme see wolf creek instead the story is similar but more believable,cruel
any social commentary or message this film was trying to make was lost amid the grotesque and the obscene people can try to convince me that this movie was brilliant but all i witnessed was torture for the sake of torture it was exploitation and an excuse just to see someone get horribly mutilated i dont enjoy gore or the suffering of other people i cant understand anyone who would want to watch this multiple times i guess serial killers who arent all that imaginative can really brush up on their techniques and skills these movies are like training videos for the depraved and insane way to go hollywood how about on oscar night when you stand up there and announce to the world how movies have the power to change the world maybe you should take responsibility for the movies that corrupt it too oh no youd never do that there is no way hollywood would admit that a lot of the crap they produce changes the world for the worst when its something good they take credit and when its horrible its the parents responsibility to make sure their children arent corrupted,cruel
i dont consider myself too pretentious when it comes to film but i have studied film at both a secondary and postsecondary level so i feel like ive had just preparation when it comes to judging the calibre of a film what that being said this is by far and away the worst film i have ever seen evereli roth is the horror genres ed wood the only difference being plan 9 from outer space is awful for all the right reasons is awful for all the wrong reasons and hopefully they wont glorify eli roth with a film about his lifethe film begins with gratuitous pornography dont get me wrong the dimeadozen fake boobed blondes are nice to look at but i could watch that at midnight on cable tv i dont need to spend money to see it so after getting laid often the girls in those scenes may have been the worst actors in the film by the way the boys who i think technically are our protagonists though theres no plot development to warrant that title decide to travel across europe to get with other hot chicks uh oh i smell horror film clich that then turns into gratuitous torture no i didnt skip how they get there the film elaborates on the plot about as well as i did this was when i wretched my guts out not at the incessant gore because while disgusting i frankly wasnt the least bit scared the only thing that frightened me was that everyone around me in the theater seemed to enjoy it what happened to the days of hitchcock or wes craven where the build up was the best part it wasnt watching the person get hacked to pieces that made it scary it was the build up that really got to youthe torture just went from slightly disturbing i will admit that the achilles scene got to me a little bit to flat out humorous after a certain point i couldnt remember if i was watching a horror movie or jeffrey dahmers wet dream at one point quentin tarantino had class or more class reservoir dogs had its moments as did pulp fiction but there was depth to those movies reservoir dogs made an actual point to develop each character i dont want to know what backroom negotiation techniques eli roth participated in to get tarantino to give this piece of trash his backingthe ending had no plot twist nothing unlike saw 1 or 2 i wont dignify the third or fourth there was no intention to wow us at the end although after a certain point of watching i just didnt care the only reason i didnt leave in the middle of this movie is because im too stubborn to admit id wasted 10 dollarswas one of the original movies to follow the new horror film trend which is to avoid actually scaring us and trying to just make us sick theres nothing terrifying about the gore in these films in fact most often the acting is so bad im glad to see the characters getting whats coming to them for taking my money the only thing that is actually scary is that there are people sick enough to want to make these types of movies and sick enough to pay money to watch themim ashamed to have given my money to eli roth and more ashamed that somehow this movie garnered a sequel,cruel
i do not understand what all the fuss is about after reading reviews good and bad i had certain expectations in my mind when i finally saw this film frankly it exceeded expectations and was a pretty decent film  wtf people look at the horror genre of today you have movies like this ie sawcabin fevertouristas etc romero still pumping out cool zombie films rob zombie the resident evil series extiction was the only good movie what do you expect this is a pretty good film for its genre whoever said in earlier reviews that this film was not shot well is an idiot it was fine there is nothing really wrong with this movie it has pretty good suspense not as violent as i thought it would be and the story played out as well as it could again wtf if you saw this film what did you expect,cruel
is no great horror movie it is mostly explicit sex and graphic violenceit is about two friends who travel to somewhere in europe for sex of course in slasher movie style the find something more than just sex aside from the beautiful girls they find a place where people are brutally tortured and killedwhen i first saw this on demand it was free so i thought id watch it after it i thought to myself i want those 90something minutes of my life back the first 30 minutes of it are sex and the rest is all violence this is no horror movie,cruel
eli roth whyis awfulits boring and it has violence for no reasonits 50 violence 35 porn and 15 drugsthe actors were not all that good they just screamed half the timeto make things worse the violence doesnt even look real its like a stupid movie that some kids made in a sewer and used yogurt for pus and tomato sauce for bloodterrble terrible terriblethere is no suspense at all it made me feel like i wanted to set the dvd on firethe best bit was the ending its the only thing that saved this from a 110 but that doesnt make the movie good in any sensenever see it210,cruel
i dont like horror movies because they give me the willies i always get totally freaked out by them but very rarely i get one out when there has been some publicity and it looks like it may be gross enough to be worth watchingi have to say i was expecting from the previews that this movie would be megascary and more freaky than would be bearable but i was sadly disappointed the gore was crap like some 60s horror movie the story nonexistent of course basically it was laughable even though the situation was horrific there was nothing in the movie to portray that horror authentically i am watching the end of this movie now and its just a joke ha ha ha at no point in this movie and i am a squeamish horrorwatcher did i feel anything like fear whatsoever it was just totally lame dont botheri gave this 2 stars only because i was intrigued enough in what was happening to actually watch it till the end,cruel
every few years or so i buy the hype and go out of my way to see a movie i regret now with this great invention called on demand once it becomes clear that a movie is crap i can fast forward and hit play periodic to catch up on the action or plot this movie is bad on many levels and like the other poster i enjoy bad horror this is bad beyond bad bad acting bad dialog bad special effects bad ending the premise is actually not a bad one and in the right hands may have turned out to be a decent movie avoid this one like the plague unless you can fast forward past all the boring parts which is about 95 percent of this swill,cruel
this movie was raved and loved by so many other people that i just had to see it for myself what a big mistake that was i started watching this amazing film by eli roth my first mistake as the movie progressed all i learned was that in slovakia means brothel americans and other cultures alike could enjoy flame throwing a girls eye out of the socket in slovakia every guy and there sister are sadistic murderers little children in slovakia travel in mobs and kill people for bubble gum and learned one of the main guys names was olii would compare this movie to a wet carrot because everyone hates it and its not interesting i knew there were three main guys in the movie but they were either being molested by a weird old guy or being seduced by three girls this movie started to get a little good towards the end but that doesnt make up for 45min of a horrible moviebut i guess this movie is just a matter of opinion and i probably cant see it but i know slovakians must be really mada more then enough 110,cruel
this is a poor mans saw and i mean poor stomach churning but without any intelligencehollow cold  pointlessthe film starts with some promise but quickly degenerates into a typical american dont trust the foreign types movie full of notquitethirdworld clichsfollowing the usual borderline racism were treated to the best in stomachchurning gore for the sake ofgore and thats all folksthis kind of thing doesnt normally get my back up but this is a waste of everyones time  from the actors involved all the way through to the poor punter who suffers it,cruel
im a fan of the horror genre unfortunately there was no actual horror in this filmsure many of the things depicted in this film are horrific but so is a panning shot of the piled corpses at a german concentration camp that doesnt make it a horror moviethe storytelling is average at best and the actors didnt suck unfortunately they werent given much to work with and the actual plot is like something a very disturbed 6 year old would come up with linear and very contrived if this is how bad it is after tarantinos rewrite then i really dont want to know how bad it was originallythis film seems to be a vehicle for roths private visions of fetid gore with no redeeming qualities whatsoeverim going to go rewatch pulp fiction now just to blank this from my mind maybe ill stick reservoir dogs saw and severance on after that all are a hundred times better than this steaming pile,cruel
i remember just getting done eating dinner one night and i came upstairs to watch some tv i noticed was coming on that night so i got excited why because i heard some good hype about this one i figured i was going to be in for a good horror flick man i have never been so wrong in my lifeeverything about this movie sucks its no scares and a lot of nudity and sex if i wanted that i could easily go out a buy a porn or just pop in one i already own how can any true horror fan enjoy this movie its pathetic and its a perfect example of how bad the horror genre has got where such a ridiculous movie would get such hypeif you are a 12 year old child this one might give you the chills to any true horror fan trust me you will be extremely disappointed by this dudsucks,cruel
i gave this pathetic movie a 210 and why the question is morewhy not saw this at the movie store and figured what the heck looks great i watched this with my sister and we generally like to go to the scene selection and kind of preview some upcoming chapters to know what we are looking for i caught maybe one chapter that looked to pass over folks im telling you i skipped whatall of but one chapter just to actually see even a little gore the chapters i skipped had sex scenes or sex references in them ridiculous i was hoping for an overthetop horror film and all i got was a cheap sex movie the last chapter had 15 minutes of pathetic gore in itand it couldve been carried out to whatmaybe the rest of the movie what was the director thinking when he made this oh waitguess he was too focused on the whole sex idea and not enough gore to satisfy its not just the sex and little gore in here that makes this a 210 for me but the acting was downright stupidso folks if you want to rent a horror movie with umsex in it and like 10 gore then go right ahead pathetic 210,cruel
im a man who loves violence gore drugs and boobs so one would assume i would love this movie oh you stupid bastard you couldnt be more wrong this is the worst movie of all time predictable boring a complete lack of ingenuity and not one single moment where i jumped out of my seat who would have thought that all of the protagonists friends would be killed and he would save the day great new story sorry but text has a difficult time at conveying sarcasm on top of being a shotty actor mr roth is a subpar director who doesnt seem to work with his actors well shame on the television network bravo for rating this the scariest movie of all time only reason to watch is for the boobs,cruel
2005 heres a director eli roth a new kid on the horror block wanting to make a big name out of himself by making a linear film that is sick and sadistic both elements which do not deserve praise because thats all there is in this pitiful filmthis is a morally repugnant film an american tragedy in an attempt to create a horror film for a 21st century audience that seems to be fuelled only by empty shallow films with violence and gore because is really just that it doesnt possess any qualities a film could be cherished for alright this is a horror film and it exploits violence and sadistic elements to a high level but come on now this is in no way a good or even average filmthis hedonistic mess of a film is a failure in terms of cinema and in my opinion horror just an excuse for soft porn violence and gore with no meaning aim or point although a lot of horror movies dont is a waste of time except if you are the kind of person that is attracted to garbage filmmakingthis is by far one of the worse films of 2005 and a useless addition to the horror genre all this film can inspire is more films like this and possible worse pointless infiltrations of violence on screen and it is not even entertaining at least films like saw which at best is an average film do provide an element of entertainment with their violence and gore fails to even entertain110,cruel
having had it on good authority that was worth watching and having seen and quite liked cabin fever i decided to stay up til 3am to watch admittedly it isnt particularly awful all in all it is well acted there are some interesting torture scenes and whatnot bearing the target audience in mind there is plenty of graphic violence hot naked girls and moronic drunken antics to all intents and purposes should have been a winnerits just that theres no real point to itthe way i see it it should have gone either one of two ways  a blacker than black comedy or a truly horrifying trip of sickening windwarped mutilation and torture what we actually have is somewhere in the middle a bit like eurotrip with chainsawssome of the scenes mainly due to the reactions of the people involved are pretty harrowing but then when fingers start going missing and eyeballs popping out it all starts to become cheesy and almost parodic of the evil dead and such like theres nothing implied  its all there for you to see nothing is left to your imaginationthe idea that such a place as is featured in could exist is terrifying in the same way that because of deliverance the number of good ol boys going for a canoe vacation down georgian rivers has been in steep decline since the late 70s so could have made backpackers the world over want to stay the hell away from bratislava could have been a truly scary film which i would have liked it isntall in all is no better than your average horror flick neither is it original id recommend severance instead,cruel
others have summarised why this drivel is just that in previous comments but i would just like to clarify the pointthis film is quite possibly the most boring thing i have seen since cabin fever if i had realised it was by the same guy eli roth i would not have bothered watching ithalfway through this film i turned to my mate and asked is it just me or is this boring it turns out it was not just mebrief exposure of naked eastern europeans having sex and tacky gore shots are not enough to make a film in this case it was not enough to even make an average filmlinear predictable and vaguely reminiscent of a film i have seen before but i cannot for the life of me remember what open to suggestionsrentbuyborrow something anything else or ignore my negativity and watch it anyway as i am sure you will then you can realise it was rubbish after all unless you are a 13 year old boy,cruel
i watched this film about half an hour ago and i have been having an urge to warn everyone you can still walk away even if you have already started watching it even after half an hour do not take tarantinos name as a warranty that it is a good movie and it was shot in the czech republicwell at least the train station scenesi expected some excitement from just like from every horrorlike movies i watch it tried to be scary with a kind of mixture of texas chainsaw messacre the psychopath who was impressed by the survivor guys german house of wax the second guy who was captured and a tiny bit of hills have eyes with the japanese girls deformed right eye and also a bit from eurotrip the scuse italian guy on the train this is not a horror or even a mystery but the trashiest crap i have seen in the last few years i was wondering how a great director like quentin tarantino could give his name to promote this whatchamacallit the storyline acting venues are absolutely absurd and unreal even the psychopaths are ridiculous not frightening at allpersonally i hate when hollywood movies are trying to show the 21th century centraleastern europe as it was 60 years ago during communism there are newlybuilt houses modern cars not like ladas and volgas not every second men wears wellingtons and people are friendly disappointing cinematography very bad editing such a stupid conversations that you crave the first two guys to die at least they didmy favourite part was when a group of kids killed all three of the russian mafia guys towards the end of the film i think the second part will make a good base for the next scary movie sequel3 out of 10 is my final judgement2 points for the girls,cruel
with the current stock of the torturehorror genre skyrocketing its brazen rise has given room for plenty of gleeful youth hipsters to stage their own relentless battle of who can shock you more this weeks socalled bad boy is the welleducated director eli roth equal part fratboy and filmgeek who follows up his clever if messy in every sense of the word cabin fever with the far more polished and grisly the latest excuse for mixing grim onedimensional scorn for the human race and tasteless violence to the most lurid degree possiblethis unfortunate outing focuses on tourists in europe two collegeage americans paxton jay hernandez and josh derek richardson and one partyhungry icelander ollie eythor gordsoon as they look for ways to quench their typically hedonistic and lecherous appetites across the continent while the somewhat timid nerdy josh would clearly like to be somewhere else paxton lets his bad manners roam free as he seems to enjoy causing endless raucous and spout juvenile bits of casual bigotry at the locals he plays the ugly american stereotype in capital letters after missing curfew at their hotel after a fruitless venture into the amsterdam nightlife they are lured into the pad of a mysterious young man who promotes a bratislava he ensures with a digital camera of naked photographs to prove it that will undoubtedly give everything their lustful hearts desireand like all idiots in a horror movie they head to this easterneurope slum where apparently the dingy haunted houses and a group of bubblegum hoodlums who seem like the slovakian children of the corn apparently do nothing to warn them of the hell to come and find exactly what they came for unfortunately it comes with a fatal price and if they do improbably escape it surely wont be in one pieceplenty of the requisite gory violence involving various mutilations and anklesplicing ensues but that becomes far less shocking than the films deplorable misanthropism that pervasively roams across the screen one point roth wants to justify the torture the main characters go through apparently being a chauvinistic brat means you should get hacked to pieces and then were supposed to care about one of them in the final act as the film switches tones to an escape from alcatrazstyle action movie while also parading endless xenaphobia practically every european with more than one line is a strange sadist who wants to torture a tourist or assist in setting up a tourist to get tortured and disturbingly puerile misogyny with endlessly raunchy depictions of female carnality as well as taking glee in watching two evil prostitutes and a disfigured female tourist become village roadkill presents just another snidely bleak view of human nature without any logic or texture to justify its already dubious argument and when looking at it squarely as a horror movie its just dull and repetitive in following its rather formulaic routinewith cabin fever eli roth did show some strong intuition to the horror genre with its cleverly derivative teenslasherflickzombieparanoia storyline and its vividly ickysticky visual effects even if it was completely unoriginal as is which borrows the look and basic plot structure of a 70s exploitation gorefest while lifting many of its most violent scenes from the current equally bloody asian new wave its no surprise takashii miike one of that genres posterboy makes a cameo midway through even though those films also existed mostly for staging violence from every possible angle they knew exactly what they wanted to achieve and never tried to overreach their boundaries creating lean and remarkably effective scarefests sadistic sure but they cut right to the bone whereas has many rusty tools that it has no idea how to use elaborate gore and torture certainly has usurped the boogeymaninthecloset theme as the chief scare tactic in film but the latter would have shown a more effective path that the cold confused and entirely unsuccessful doesnt have the common sense to follow,cruel
this movie is about a couple of dudes who go to some european place i think it was sweden or kazahkstan to bang some hot chicks and sight see the movie is kinda boring at first because no one gets killed but there are boobs so its okay anyway because boobs rule then it gets really really boring because its just lots of talking and stuff and no boobs but then the fun really begins because some dude gets his heels sliced up and another guy gets power drilled in the leg and its totally gory and gruesome and stuff then theres this one guy i think he was the main character cause he was played by that guy from torque who is about to be killed by a chainsaw but the chainsaw dude slips on torque guys fingers and the chainsaw lands on him the chainsaw dude that was hilariousthe movie is deep and very thought provoking because it made me think about what would happen if i went to a and was tortured by some crazy dutch bastards yes i know they werent really dutch but goldmember rules so go fk yourself the torture scenes are really gross and totally awesome and the acting is very good especially torque guy i like when the asian chicks eye just sorta hangs out of her socket that was totally awesome although i didnt really understand the ending i heard from a buddy that eli roth made a sequel but i cant see how it could live up to the standards of this film overall this is movie is very good and easily a must see for fans of gruesome horrorbob,cruel
directed by eli roth and produced and introduced by quentin tarantino great horror about a group of young adults travelling to eastern europe with all in intentions of having great fun and great sex turning into a trip of horror the group fall victim to a gang who are payed to set up torture candidates by rich business type people bored with the old red letter day events for those of you that like the horror with plenty of gore  its a must see i felt quite uncomfortable watching this having no idea whats going to happen next,cruel
i saw it first in theaters and years later the unrated dvd as a blockbuster free rental the movie feels like a con job all you heard was how its just way too violent and shocking but then when you see it all you really get is lots of talking gratuitous soft core sex and near the end of the movie some really bad gore effects ive seen troma movies that had a budget of what change they could find in their couch cushions that had far more realistic gore and of course much more creativitythe problems with are that they took a decent idea and didnt even try and go anywhere with it you have some american tourist who end up being kidnapped and tortured by wealthy europeans a big problem is that there is way too much talking and sex and not enough of the horror element there arent very many kills and what you do see looks insanely fake like the blowtorch scene where all you see is the guys back and then they cut to the girl with red plastic glued to her face youll be better of just hitting fast forward through most of the movie since you wont be missing much just lots of long conversations there to pass the time that dont add anything to the storythere just isnt anything worth seeing in very little plot badly filmed soft core sex for filler and some of the worst gore effects youll see in a major hollywood movie do yourself a favor and get something good may i suggest getting a troma movie like terror firmer which has a perfect blend of horror comedy nudity and loads of gore all i can say is that has no redeeming qualities maybe if it didnt take itself way too seriously it could have been slightly more watchable,cruel
if this is the level that tarantino is nowadays being associated with then things are really turning for the worst in usfilmmakingnow i always liked bhorrorflicks buth then you know youd expect cheesy sfx and bad acting usually associated with roger corman but not tarantine but this is so over the top right from the start they hand out so much clichs and factual errors that it hurts more than actually build up the story for instance in the netherlands they speak dutch not german unless mr eli roth still thinks that wwii isnt over yet apart from depicting everyone in holland as a sex craved junkieand it goes on near the end the sfx on the japanese girl with her eyeball flopping about her bloody face which in itself is so badly done that it becomes funny instead of gory look so stupid that you actually start to wonder if this isnt comedy instead of a horrormoviein fact the only believable sfx are when the lead guy drives the car over the group that put him to this ordeal and at the end when he cuts off the fingers of the businessmanthis film is a complete waste of time and money if it had been made in 80s it would be fun but now its just a wasteavoid at all costs,cruel
this is truly one of the worst movies i have ever seen it desperately attempts to be frightening but really just comes off as if it has been written by a passel of thirteen year olds the first half is basically softcore pornography and not very good at that watching the male american protagonists is about as enjoyable as shotgunning a can of drano or consuming a threemonth old sandwich topped with a liberal helping of oven cleaner its rather dull and the more amorous scenes are only cool if the viewer has just started puberty either physically or psychologically the second half is basically a different movie except this one is a snuff film eli roth shows off how creative he can be and by creative i mean derivative everything is a ripoff and its terribly long and drawn out the ending is garbage too in short see this only if you have a very short memory and thus will not recall any of the details of horrible hunk of s,cruel
i will tell you up fronti dont like torture movies the very concept of films like saw and devils rejects make me think that these films are really made for fanboys and closet nut cases and for the most point they probably aretalked into watching this by friends who indicated that this was something more and as some writers here seem to feel the gore is not that bad oh wella lot could be said about this movie but in short it is a bit less on suspense and what there is of it is pretty much drowned out by lapses in logic i liked the whole concept of elite huntingnot that its original mind you but an interesting thought in a place so far away but the direction wavers and seems amateurish the camerawork shifts between well done and rather boringfailing to sometimes pull you into the story there is plenty of gore and anyone that seems to say there isnt enough in herei really wonder about them seriously cut off fingers toes eyes gouged out throats cutbut thats not enough geez some people are pretty weirdkey problems  the city is at once very pretty then suddenly its dark scaffoldings very young hoodlums like 8 years old you can argue that they went into the bad part of the town but the seemed to be there in a moment is the whole town in on what it going on at the factory which appears a few hundred yards away or do they wonder why the smokestack goes off in an abandoned plant the girl gets highly paid to get the last guy into the torture factory she even laughs that she got so much money for him however her meeting him to take him there was pure happenstance and luckhe wandered into the bar further he had to drag out of her and twist her arm to take him there makes no sense again lazy screen writing some makeup is well done some is really amateurish did the guy cut out the girls eye with a torch then when she escapes you can clearly see her eyelid with just a bunch of bad red makeup globbed on top of her eye sure i might sound nitpicking but man that jumped out at me some of the camera work was really questionable and looked like really low grade film or video and i dont mean the gritty torture scenes but scenes outside many of the camera shots are basic setups with little tracking movement or fluidity of any kind much could have been done by using the architecture to create tension and claustrophobia but this is never used the stunts were terrible i especially liked the scene where our hero guns down the girls and the guy that set the thing up first of all how much speed could he possibly have gotten up to in 20 feet to be able to run them all over after they saw him when they get hit its like they had the actorsstunt people just roll off a car when the surviving girl gets hit by the bad guys car they just stuck a dummy in front of the car and dragged it away i wasnt looking again for blood and guts but that was student film quality shotsmost effort seems to have been put in the torture scenes such as they were and that is telling i did like the look of the bald guards the setup and the completely insane american who gave you insight into what the whole deal was and there was some satisfaction in the bad guys getting their due for the most parti cannot recommend this movie too dull too depressing and more gross than scarywhat really disturbed me was the laughing and enjoyment people were getting in the torture sequences in this film not the hollers you get during a gross segment in a zombie movie mind you where people are basically letting off steam no people seemed to actually be happy that people were getting torturedthat was the only horrifying thing about this movie i felt disturbed being in a room with such losers and wondered what has happened to audiences for them to act this waylastly i figured out why this film had an amateurish edge to it and that is after i saw a few interviews with eli roth particularly one on foxthis guy has the depth of cardboard and is full of himself torture movies do well now according to roth because of the torture at gitmo and what the us has done to people around the world and its our collective outrage against that which makes these movies popular then more bush bashing hes a putzso we are not talking about a particularly bright bulb to begin with and if you make the mistake i did and see this film you will see what i mean,cruel
knowing that part ii is coming out i decided to write a quick review of the first first quentin tarantinos name shouldnt have been on this when i saw it i was certainly let down i guarantee that you see more boobs than violence in this movie whether or not thats a bad thing is up to the viewer as others have stated its very predictable not much actually going on second the actors dont exactly do a great job it worked really well for saw but this movie just doesnt deliver like it should it was certainly a letdown and i wouldnt recommend it unless you have to see everything related to tarantino,cruel
i saw this movie after one friend told me it was awful and another told me it was brilliant i figured any movie that sparks such reactions should be watchedthe besides being a sorry excuse for a horror film i mean there is nothing scary in it ppl nowdays seem to confuse the word scary with disgusting is also pathetic i am czech by nationality and the way the east block is portrayed is as clich and stupid as can possibly be living in holland now for the last 8 years i had to laugh at the miserable way the movie portrays amsterdam et cetera the film is full of lousy stereotypical bull to put it in short i found it hard to watch till the end this is probably the second worst movie ive ever seen beaten only by cabin feveralso by eli rothhmmwhat a coincidence i guess its not my type of film or smthinso if ur a roth fan dont take me seriously but honestly i cant recommend this at alli give the film one star because the ending after 90 minutes of crap was slightly amusing,cruel
the first thing i thought when i saw the movie was is this europe as americans see it  sex drugs murder all day long a run down continent  then i knew its irony ha the movie should point out how stupid americans are that think this way by just overdoing it and that the guys in the movie had to pay more for an american to kill wasnt arrogance that was some kind of mirror held up in front of us  kids or was it finally i thought no matter whether the director sees europe like this or the audience he wanted to mess around with  some seem to doso heres my question do any of you somehow believe that the image you are getting of europe in this movie is true in any single way would be interested ,cruel
lesson 1 it pays to do your research the plot of this film is utterly wretched i simply cant find adjectives bad enough to describe it save yourself the trouble and find something else to pass the time having seen tarantino somewhere in the opening credits i felt casually reassured that the film would be worth watching in the erroneous belief that it was he who wrote and directed it monumental mistake ok i thought so this is maybe not another pulp fiction or kill bill  no one can keep churning masterpieces forever can they  but its tarantino and anything coming from him must be worth a lookwhen the film had finished i sat a few minutes in disbelief had tarantino finally lost the plot  delirious with shock i reasoned that hes maybe in a transitional period exploring the boundaries of gore and decency new avenues to shock horror and disgust or maybe past successes have finally gone to his head thus every now and then bored he might emerge from retirement and make a few more bucks knocking out a flick secure in the knowledge that his name alone would get the audiences and money rolling in but of course tarantino didnt write and direct this film as i found out only when i ventured to air my disgust here as i say    do your research in some frighteningly obscure way the film oversteps the boundary between acceptable horror fantasy and a horrific plausible reality it explores incomprehensible sadistic depravity at its most extreme making it effortless to place yourself in the role of the victim there is no detachment the scenes of torture are as graphic as you can imagine in this sense it is wholly irresponsible such is the theme of this film that it conveys a grave and disturbing sense that somewhere out there it will serve to fuel the perverse appetite and imagination of a sick sadistic monster that may go out and reenact exactly what theyve just seenif i had my way i would destroy every copy of the film in existence ban eli roth from ever making another film and fine mr tarantino for his part in its production the makers of this film are evidently devoid of any moral responsibility to society in lacking the foresight to realise that there really are sick perverted monsters out there who could use such material as a blueprint had the torture scenes featured children or pregnant women there would hopefully have been moral outrage as it stands eli roth has sailed as close to that precipice as he possibly could and so far seems to have gotten away with it,cruel
another one of those movies where some low grade director tries to showcase as much gore and bodyparts as possiblethe movie starts like a typical cheap sex comedy flick and then proceeds to a typical torture gorefest it was really hard to watch and i really hate these movies where the actual horror merely comes from disgusting pictures and not from a good storyline psychologyand so much was so freaking predictable i knew from the very start that the salad eating business man was a total pervert just because his stupid stereotypical lines about doing things with your hands and meat etc i knew that a second pair of feet would join the receptionist as you could see her standing at the door i knew that josh would be immobilized when the perv asked him oh you want to go i knew that the japanese girl would throw herself in front of a train when she was watching her reflection at the stationif you are into bloodthirsty cheesy gorefests and can do without an actual story this might be a movie for you,cruel
well i just finished watching and i gotta say wow what a disappointment the commercials claim heart attacks and another user claimed some poor guy was retching in the theater probably from food poisoning bad popcorn perhaps anyways after drudging through the first hour of topless women prancing around well the movie does actually start to get good unfortunately by that time i was so bored i just didnt care what they should have done was make it a 45 minute movie 15 min for story and the last 12 hour as for the gore well there wasnt all that much not a movie for kids mind you but when they brag about people fleeing the theater well i wanna see blood and gore not tomato soup being washed off the floors because that is about the extent of it they should try and claim gore when there just isnt that much,cruel

mild spoilers in the last few years hollywood has made lots and lots of horror movies unfortunately they have been mostly gore and no scare was perfect example there was plenty of gore as well as nudity the nudity wore me out after a while but im a woman and boobs do nothing for me when are these characters going to learn that backpacking americans in creepy backroad villages is just asking for trouble its not hard to guess whos the first to get killed and we feel nothing for these characters josh was the only normal guy the other two were like little horny frat boys who had never seen a breast beforeshesh the torture scenes are very odd we see very little hear a lot and then its over what i didnt get was igor who was chopping up the body parts to toss in the firewhy did he chop them up he couldve just tossed them right in whole anyways i digress there was absolutely no fear factor i never got scared no jump out of your seat scenes and nothing that made me cover my eyes and trust me im a horror flick wuss i spent most of silent hill in my husbands lap with my eyes closed that movie scared the bejeezus out of me im disappointed to hear that they made a second oneprobably more of the same and its sad tarantino is a very talented guy he can do much better than this ill pass on the sequel,cruel
i paid for this dvd albeit only a little nothing advertised was delivered during the subsequent viewing but one i did laughi quote the back of the dvd casing youll laugh youll scream you might even pukeif you want gore suspense or even a background soundtrack youll do better by playing any one of the eurovision song contest losersand to make this worse there is i hear a sequel what a negative and sad first review i am ashamedand this here is the required tenth line which will also be my last given the ten line requirement congratulations me,cruel
when i first heard of this movie i thought it was going to be brilliant since i am a big tarantino fanso when my friend got it on dvd i borrowed it from raring to watch it i put it in as soon as i couldwhen it came to watching it i thought my mate had played a trick on me by putting a porn dvd in the box but no it was the genuine product basically some dudes are trying to get layed around the world but then 2 of them die and one has to survive the horror that lasts only about 15 minutesquite literally this film is a hour and 45 minutes of porn and 15 minutes of gore and horror this film tries too hard to be something like the wicker man even including a song from the original wicker man film this film is a waste of money and is a total rip off of the wicker man if your looking for some good horror stay well away if your looking for some hardcore porn happy jerking offhopefully tarantino will bounce back with grindhouse,cruel
was said to be one of the scariest movies of the year whoever said that must be watching a barney movie this is one of quentin tarantinos worst i dont know what he was trying to attempt the story could have been better and the sex scenes cut down if someone wants to watch porn they rent a porno if someone wants to be scared they rent a horror film the acting was bad and the sex scenes took up more than half the moviei wont recommend it to anyonewait until its free on cable if you dont mind wasting your timei gave it a chance and wish someone had warned me of this waste of filmwaste of time,cruel
ech where to begini went into my viewing of with extremely low expectations i wasnt necessarily expecting to hate it in fact i was hoping to like it but after hating roths previous film cabin fever i decided it was best to lower my expectations had i actually expected to love the film and been looking forward to it its difficult to imagine how much i would have hated it and how let down i would have beeni figured there wouldnt be as much torture as the tv spots would like us to believe i didnt think it would be shocking or disturbing an enjoyable gore fest at best however because of roths own comments about the film i was very surprised in how little torture there was and how lame the scenes that did feature it were as a horror fan i must say i was let down with the death sequences first there is the blonde college student who gets tortured drilled leg barfs on himself cut tendon and thats pretty much it hernandez gets a couple fingers cut off and then is able to escape because his torturer accidentally cuts part of his own leg off in a terribly forced and outofplace homage to the texas chain saw massacre after this hernandez saves a japanese girl from getting tortured and cuts her halfdangling eyeball out of its socket the girl screams hernandez screams pus squirts partially comedic sure gross eh shocking yeah right and finally the japanese girl meets her bloody demise while escaping with hernandez by throwing herself in front of a train after catching a glimpse of her now deformed face in yet another terrible homage to sonos jisatsu saakurudeath scenes aside roth does not get a free pass from creating an intelligent atmospheric or even halforiginal horror film just because his apparent motto in life is gore and boobies what makes a film great just because is a film about three cocky annoying frat boys getting tortured does not mean his film has to be void of any originality or intellect most recently saw is an incredibly overrated film in the horror genre that gets overpraised for its use of violence and self torture however i am quite fond of its at least somewhat original story the film also has a dark atmosphere that makes it fun to watch even in its moments of unintentional comedy the clown on the bicycle seriously however is a film about a few frat boys who mistake a torture chamber for a fun night out and end up getting picked off one by oneroth also said is americas reaction to miikes audition audition is a slowburn horror which starts out a carefree love story then gradually becomes more disturbing until the final scene which is pure insanity on the other hand is 40 minutes of sex and nudity then after the first friend goes missing it immediately shifts into a paintbynumbers thriller until the end the comparison between the two films ends at their torture scenes audition is a genuinely creepy unsettling atmospheric great horrorsuspense film i find it purely idiotic to compare it to generic kitsch like i was originally going to rate 210 only because i dont like giving films a 1 however the only thing i remotely enjoyed about this film was jay hernandez not his character an arrogant ass whom i wanted to die but because hernandez isnt bad to look athowever im not going to rate it higher because its main star is attractive what is there to like i have no idea 110,cruel
could probably the most self indulging movie i have ever seen however it seems that when you get quentin tarantino on your poster everybody thinks it is his film and thats why people went to see it i wonder how much of kiss a it took the director to get tarantino to support such a disaster thats a good trick  have a bad movie get the right sponsor and make money even though one has almost zero talent it makes one thinks about some ways that the consumer movie goer should be protected from such a sham thinking you are going to see ones director movie and ending up irritable if it was a bad movie by tarantino it is one thing  i choose to see it based on his name but the way i and my friends were tricked to believe that it was his movie makes you realize that more research should be done before i see my next quentin tarantino movie,cruel
regrettably this is 2 hours of my life i wont get back quite why i bothered with this film is beyond belief as i was willing to give it a chance because i wanted to make up my own mind about it and not rely on other critical opinions of the film which are often made by film critics who have not watched the film theyre supposed to be reviewingthis film is based solely on one unpleasant premise show enough gore torture and thin women with no clothes on and you will have an audience and thus an income there is no other reason for watching this it certainly doesnt qualify as entertainmentthe plot is basic if at times annoying three backpackers fresh out of college and two from america journey to europe or rather eastern europe and hope to get very drunk very stoned and have lots of guilt free sex with young thin eastern european women who seem to think all american men are great in bed im serious after a series of sexual drug and clubbing adventures they venture into former soviet union territory something unthinkable in the eighties and are lured into an underground movement of europeans who provide foreigners all kinds for rich people mostly men to torture mutilate and possibly kill in the most messy way possible said men pay a lot of money for this privilege what ensues is a lot of nightmarish rubbish involving all the usual equipment of torture chainsaws how obvious cutting achilles tendons with scalpels guns and various other torture gear thats itdont say you havent been warned,cruel
welcome to your worst nightmare this movie really is a nightmarenot in a good way so much i was really amped especially after i found out qt was attached to see this movie when it came out and had expected to see it in theaters unfortunately i was out of state when all my friends went and really didnt feel like going by myself so i waited a while to see it after hearing mixed reviews whenever i hear mixed review about a movie i try going into it with an open mind as i did on this occasionim not a big eli roth fan but i feel like his heart is in the right place he is really just a great fan of the horror genre and feels like he can deliver a pop horror that everyone will love by using the formula he knows and loves he has now proved that he doesnt have the film vocabulary to express his views there is a gross lack of anything that resembles character developmentbut there are boobieswhich is really no consolation at all if you love softcore porn then you will love however you better finish up quick or else youll lose whatever erection you have to the completely unnecessary sht that the second half of the film is comprised ofwhile the violence is new and stylized that really doesnt amount to much in the end you feel no other connection to the character during their prolonged deaths save that you feel their emotional pain but you are generally complacent about the deaths otherwise it makes me sad that movies like these are regarded as art now a days i feel sorry for roth in that i think he is really destroying a genre of film that he truly devoted toi hope that roth will look at the movies that he loved when horror was great and maybe channel a little more evil dead or the first nightmare on elm street into his movies i want to be scared by a combination of great story maybe even some good dialog if its not too much to ask and brutal visuals but the last without the first is what were dealing with herea less then ok 310,cruel
now i understand the idea young people away from home and responsibilities after all tourists have been going away with this idea for eons and this movie could have been good i was not into the sex i liked joshs observation that there seemed to be no dutch in amsterdam as someone said earlier this would have worked much better as a thriller rather than a gross out fest the scenery was great and loved the locations strangers in a strange land although the plot relied 5050 on sex and dismemberment i think the story would have been better with more story i wondered too if those tourists might not have been missed as all roads seemed to lead to rome or that slavic country they where in is life that cheap where noone cares where young women can sell people and find it amusing far more scary than some might realise are we at an age where these things are possible have we created these animal children who will kill for bubblegum now for me it is these that frighten the gore bits although grossout did not scare me as much as seven and some other horror flicks which gave me a sorta general exhibition feel whilst still cringing behind splayed fingers nah this movie could have been a lot more the end not as short and the beginning shorter too much for effect whether it be the sex drugs or total disintegration of society and moral ethics i think they should make it again reduce the above write a better script keep the locations and if one was to be involved with a thing about hunters then do some serious hunting for the cash even though obviously the thing with those with too much cash is that time is money that was like shooting fish in a barrel poor fishes,cruel
this movie is awfulthere is no fantasy in the storylinein the first 30 minutes you can watch an erotic film and suddenly switch over to human torturingstory is weak disgusting tortures and some erotic scenesspoiler on isnt it funny that several kids frighten adults for get some chewinggum or money and where you can find such an underdeveloped pace in slovakia it is really ridiculous isnt it spoiler offi warn everybody for avoid this movievery disappointing,cruel
i only viewed the uncut unrated version of this film so these comments are directed at that version not the theatrical release i doubt it was any worse than this one written and directed by the same guy who made the underwhelming cabin fever the same old horror clichs get the same tired treatment with no surprises and very little to interest anyone but those who are easily entertained made by profiteers who apparently believe that by hacking off limbs and cribbing from every horror movie in recent memory it will pass as an originaleli roth the movies writerdirector should stick to direction and leave the writing to someone else its so thinly plotted with obvious situations and badly developed characters that it threatens to evaporate before the series of incredible coincidences that end the filmon the plus side there is some very attractive location photography in prague and the usual excellent makeup effects from howard berger  greg nicotero the fact that roth had the guts to employ real makeup artists instead of using cheesy cgi is to his credit and that is what earns this movie a 3 instead of a zero,cruel

i have a select group of friends whos opinions on horrorgore films i value highly this group of friends found this movie to be very entertaining and very brutal so naturally when i bought this film i had high expectations going into watching it and i must say i was not impressedfor starters the acting is god awful like these actors arent even trying the only credible acting scene in the entire movie is when josh wakes up chained to the chair in the torture room and starts freaking out because he has absolutely no idea what is going on i felt he did a terrific job in that scene showing true fear when you are trapped and unaware of what is happening around you however other than that everyones acting is subpar even by horror movie standardsthe movie also has no plot i remember reading somewhere that eli roth was trying to display through this movie americas ignorance of the outside world so what are you telling me that everywhere i go outside of america i should watch out or else ill be drugged kidnapped and brought to a warehouse where someone will pay money to torture and kill me it makes no sense i wouldnt doubt that something like this actually does exist in the world there are some truly sick people walking this planet but this business seemed a little too high profile complete with business cards a ticket booth and tattoos for all their customers for the general public in the surrounding towns to not know about it nothing is really explained nor does it get tied togetherim not even sure if i would say this movie was brutal maybe my standards are getting too high when it comes to gore in movies nowadays but i did not cringe or jump once in this film sure it had its moments like kana getting burned but so much more could have been done with the tortures that it left much to my imaginationand that may have been the downfall of this movie for me i dont mind a horror film if it has minimal violence so long as there is a gripping and suspenseful storyline and viceversa if you make a film thats strictly supposed to be disturbing and grotesque by all means as long as its done well had too little of both there practically was no plot to this movie i wasnt given a reason to care about the victims and there wasnt enough brutality to make up for it the only positives of this movie was like i said that one scene where josh first wakes up and discovers hes been kidnapped and also the movie had more than its needed share of hot naked women prancing around totally not worth buying,cruel
must admit that these new age horror movies like cabin fever and the saw movies really make me laugh if stanley kubrick were alive he would laugh too these movies are not difficult to create nor do they exhibit any real talent on the part of the director and certainly not the actors nevertheless i found somewhat entertaining in more of a dark comedy kind of way than a horror flick lets face the fact that there is nothing scary or horrifying about this movie its gruesome and makes you want to recount your fingers and toes to make sure they are all there but its not a horror movie in the classic or traditional sense of the genre the fear scary if you will and atmospheric elements are completely lackingwhat stands for is the new age of horror movies if you can even call it that that focuses more on torture pain suffering and gore more than anything else and is largely unimaginative invoking no sense of fear in the audience but a sense of dread more than anything else is indicative of the fact that the horror genre is undergoing a kind of metamorphasis probably because of a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of the creators of such flicks for the life of me i dont see how anyone can call the saw films cabin fever or scary in the true sense of the wordis primarily about a group of sexcrazed young men who decide to go to amsterdam to pick up girls mostly prostitutes and have a good time well they end up at a place where inflicting suffering and pain is sold to those who would pay to indulge themselves the problem is that our sexcrazed young men are some of the most prized tortureobjects of these sadistic individuals insatiable desire what proceeds is simply a tale of torture pain and suffering which is basically what is all about if this appeals to you is right up your alleyif you are looking for a scary movie or traditional horror movie you need to stay clear of as i said i found entertaining from a dark comedy standpoint and thats all however i think its significant to the viewer that not only is the acting extremely poor in this movie it is also worth noting that there really arent any characters in this movie of any significance worth sympathizing with except for maybe the oriental girl but shes not a main characteri do not want to give any moral credit as that would insult the creators of this fine flick but one could look at from a variety of different ways perhaps we should look at the irony in in that when you are on the hunt for something you could also be the hunted as well especially in lands that we know little about and where we are also not protected by the laws liberties and rights that we have in the united states a great example of a movie where this is true is the midnight express starring brad davis while the parallels may be weak between the two i think the reader can see where im coming from in this regard all in all i mildly enjoyed but not for the reasons that most people liked it truth be told this movie does not deserve two 2 stars as a horror movie but for its entertainment value ill give it 15 stars after having seen eli roths and cabin fever i think its safe to say that mr roth would not know a horror movie from a cheerio,cruel
i went to write down own review but i have found comment of user named tomas it fits so well to my opinion that i will just quote him my english is not very good and im sorry for that but this movieis one of the stupidest i ever seen low budget movie with stupid simple and awful story about 3 guys going to bratislava capital of slovakia to have some fun with slovak horny girls and they get killed by unearthly brutal people of small country slovakia this movie shows slovakia like some kind of backward poor and dirty country if you know slovakia you know that this movie was filming in czech republicthere is a lot of signs with czech language on it also the language they speak is czech which is lovely country with beautiful history you can see kids robbing these guys on the street by daylightwhat is that this is not kosovo afganistan or iraq they are not in the war or something you should check some websites about this everybody who knows something about eastern europe and saw this movie know that this is degradation of this two countries and the producer eli roth is moron it is a shame that they earn money on this lame full of lies rude stupidity i agree 100 i would just like to add that tarantino is recording im really shocked,cruel
why oh why are there no good horror movies being made anymore did we use up all of our collective creativity inventing the segway hooray for the gore and all although dr giggles has it beaten in that department but this movie has the weakest plot line ever the special effects really werent that great and the acting was on level with a kindergarten graduation skit not once did i wonder whodunit there was no slow buildup of tension or fear no indepth character encounters just 94 minutes of mindnumbing iqdraining nonsense i realize that there will never be another shining exorcist or rosemarys baby and maybe those standards are unfairly high but surely filmmakers who probably make more money than god should at least try to earn some of it,cruel
ive had recommended to me by a number of people for a variety of reasons having just finished watching it i find myself wondering whythe movie itself if you like slasher flicks is not bad its more intelligently done than others of the genre such as the texas chainsaw massacre however when the movie ended i found myself thinking whats the point even the rather anticlimactic ending fails to wrap the story up properlythere were also a number of glaring errors some for the sake of those who still wish to see it i will simply say fall under the heading of physical reaction to bodily damage others include language and location discrepancies though these may be deliberate eli roth claims that it was done deliberately but i believe this may have come to his attention after the film was finalized and unable to be editedi feel very sorry for the slovakian people as im sure their tourist industry took a nasty hit over this despite comparisons ive heard to the aforementioned texas chainsaw massacre it is important to note that texas is located prominently in the us which always has a booming tourism industry where slovakia is a very littleknown country in comparison if youre looking for a horror movie with both a visceral thrill and a serious psychological point i would recommend you see the saw movies instead if however you prefer mostly nude women mixed with torture for tortures sake then this may very well be up your alleyfinal rating c,cruel
ok the film was rubbish but thats merely my opinion however it was shot mostly in cesky krumlov cz which is not near praha prague at all try walking from one city to the other neither is it sited in slovakia mr t seems to have used the worst of city slums and mixed in a little beauty to create a film worth forgetting rapidly i accept that there is poetic license and that the film is merely entertainment but mobs of vicious kids beating up on folks just doesnt happen over there in the czech republic the film comes across as a gothic version of american pie with a dab of texas chain saw pathetic perhaps mr t has a typical usa mentality and thinks all europeans are backward primitive morons the contrary feeling is prevalent over here and with all due respect mr t should stay home pleasesorry tarrantino your film stinks,cruel
okay i wasnt a big fan of cabin fever that much at all which was also made by eli roth but i heard that was a much better movie for roth and that you should watch it so last night i go and rent it and after watching it i dont know how this can be considered a horror moviethis movie starts out mostly contains as teen sex porn fest and through this movie that is pretty much it there is only 23 cool torture scenes which was good but obviously we wanted more 98 of this film was porn and the other 2 was not the plot was also very thin and the acting wasnt that great either if there was more characters and a lot less porn crap and more torture scenes then i may have liked this film this movie makes cabin fever look good so it will be a while before i look into a another film made by eli roth again,cruel
to put it bluntly this director should have been stopped after cabin fever and kill bill 2 although kill bill 2 does have its credits and a fantastic story line continued from kill bill did it ive never seen such mechanical and monotonous rubbish what was the point where was the story line take the first half of the movie a couple of really perverted young men womanizing seeking prostitutes and using women at there will so did the director the start of the film shared the resemblance of a really bad porno and pointlessly maybe the director could have made it necessary i understand that they were seeking the thrill of girls but never have i seen women being portrayed so relentlessly as a tool for some weak willed and obviously poor natured young characters the sexual content of this film should not be likened to american psycho american psycho had a story line a plot and a reason although still it was poor if i want to watch porn and not something with substance ill get some but when i want to watch a movie i want to watch a movie that has some sense to its contents i think this really paints a revolting picture of young america the second half of the film is blood and guts and really its a horror but there is nothing as displeasing as watching effects that are really quite good but knowing that its all for nothing pointless and meaningless completely unmoving there is no reason for it needless slaughter and without a single reason but these people like killing people it doesnt even broach the topics of life and death or living freedom of cause of morality of heroism of need it was not thought provoking in the slightest it was complete nonsense its a wonder there is anyone watching it at all the 18 restriction baffles me as it is not worth an adult audiences time it is aimed at 15 year olds and thats giving credit so if you can tell me what the point of the film was how it made you tick and think i seriously believe that it might be time for you to find meaning in something worthwhile and where there actually is some if the point of the movie was to be pointless then there shouldnt have been a movie at all and it really did succeed quite frankly if i had rented this movie i would have stormed back into the video store and demanded my two bucks back it was that bad instead it was loaned from a friend and i almost think less of him for owning it it was absolutely fruitless i should have spent my evening reading a book with no words,cruel
to be honest i was expecting something really excellent about a friend and i rented three dvds to watch and he specifically wanted to see one movie while i kept bugging at him to watch eventually he gave in and we started to watch the movie im a big fan of horror movies not directors not actors and so none of that influences me none of what im saying is influenced by whoever wrote directed or acted in this movie i dont give a damn who wrote the thing or who he was or who the actors were all i know is it was just not well composed he left about half an hour into the movie thats rounded up more or less he stuck around for about twentytwenty five minutes then was just so bored with it that he went off to play a video game instead thats always a bad sign for one if a horror movie doesnt grip you right at the start then its not going to turn out very wellit took way too long to get anywhere to be honest i was just confused during most of it and i didnt understand why anything was going on until paxton found the business card then finally after a good hour into the movie i somewhat get what is going on by the way i didnt even catch this guys name at first i had to check it out on wikipedia they may have used it one or two times for this guy and he suddenly becomes the main character where the hell did that happen another bad move these three american jerkoffs whom we dont care anything about and dont know anything about are the protagonists here in order for the horror film to actually frighten you youve got to feel like you know the characters if you just feel like your seeing strangers killed you may think hmm thats awful and move on with your life i admit im very intrigued with the possibility of people actually paying someone to kidnap tourists and torture them to death that both frightens disturbs and fascinates me this movie couldve really gone in a better direction last minute revenge horrible i was actually amused and laughing at the socalled revenges said friend came back in just when natalia noticed that paxton was the one driving the car and as he began to run them over he started laughing by the time the bubblegum gang started attacking the idiots who were chasing after paxton we were both just laughing hard at the absurdity of it i especially loved that revenge scene involving crazyguywhokilledjosh oh im sorry did we never hear his name either because it was again so absurd and why exactly did kana commit suicide conveniently creating a distraction so that paxton could get a ride on the train unnoticed its tragic she no longer has an eye at least shes alive and not still being tortured she looks deeply into her reflection in the mirror how often are there fullbody mirrors set up around train stations exactly decides shes ugly without an eyeball and leaps in front of a train just as convenient as running into the three main antagonists while driving a car no or finding the man who killed your friend who justsohappens to also be on the same train as you that kind of suicide just sounds like a touch of vanity to me or if one might argue that its because she was in such pain she couldnt take it and she figured suicide was the best option i wonder why if she was in such pain she was capable of calmly walking around without any indication she was in pain and throwing herself in front of the train how did paxton manage to walk around so calmly and without any major bleeding problems when he killed namelessdudewhokilledjosh there was blood everywhere in the bathroom big dripping obscenely gory puddles of blood just from cutting the same two fingers that paxton lost yet he just walks around with gloves and doesnt seem to have any problems with blood not to mention manages to think clearly enough to come up with a semibrilliant plan of escape for himself and kana while only flinching slightly to put on his gloves even after being struck in the chest with an extremely sharp somethingorother twice though these puncture wounds seem to be absent or forgotten afterwardanother thing there were no subtitles some people actually would like to know exactly what these people are saying in german thank you its a fabulous touch to have these people speaking in a foreign language but subtitles would be niceim definitely going to go watch 2 when it comes out most likely ill be going to laugh at it and see what poor excuse for a plot they strung together this time most likely a lesbian orgy scene ooh more sex and drugs lets give this film a high rating,cruel
since when are films that ought to be labeled sniff among the horror cutting what our attention span ability to digest certain images guys you ought to find a bit more human ways of entertaining the public and even worst the film critics and i have met manywill swallow nowadays almost anything and call it cool art great the responsibility of the filmmaker should be a bit greater than that of just seeking to shock and terrify thats what wars and nightmares are for and even those dont come close to this film call it a compliment because some need horror to fell alive thats what this films is about the viewer should ideally be exempt this rule has been broken now i felt petrified that our society has come so far as to make and swallow such films and call them cool define life again and art or film for that matter too,cruel
i really cant imagine any redeeming features of this movie there is no story whatsoever nor do the main characterscaricatures hold any interest or earn any sympathy i guess the nudity is appealing for those who have yet to actually see a woman naked in person but otherwise the early scenes ie in bars bedrooms add nothing to the story or character development as for the horror itself this movie provides about 110 of the scares of saw i ii or iii with none of the tension when the gore finally gets going theres no rhyme or reason to it and then it all ends just as quickly with no wrapup total waste of time,cruel
oh dear eli roth what do your parents think of your new graphic imagery torture film perhaps some jewish holocaust organization might like to shed some light on exactly what they think of a foul mouthed poo and scalpel jester jewish boy like you see s making of dvd section actually choosing to write and then film torture imagery that degrades the actors film industry creatives and lastly the cinemas and audiences what is the point of apart from wanting to show screaming 20somethings slashed and drilled and being physically destroyed what does it say about you eli not anything good i suspect like australias similar abomination wolf creek directed by first time movie business vandal greg maclean this is the tourists getting hacked to death imagery maybe roth maclean and tarantino are actually the axis of evil exists for no other reason that to celebrate tarantino and roths delight in human mutilation imagery like the cruel businessmen depicted in the film they perform the same act on the audience giggling hifives all round yes it makes money but so does war to be so young and to have already sold your soul to tarantino is the greatest horror about the fact that good young actors like jay hernandez and heather mattazzaro in 2 are reduced to appearing in this ugliness is an equal disappointment maybe to fill in his time better some jewish holocaust organization might educate roth and pals in the value of human life that it is not as the nazis gleefully enjoyed a thing to be degraded and mutilated as entertainment apparently according to industry paper variety roth is thrilled at how gore audiences have embraced his new horror film and that 2 will contain more graphic torture especially on the new torture train  gee isnt that just great for the impressionable teens of tomorrow go feed your grandmother eli do something useful clean your street take some disabled children to see a real movie one that is creative not destructive actually i just had a thought wouldnt it be funny if tarantino and roth were both crippled in a car crash and had to spend the rest of their lives being fed by old jewish people in a nursing home,cruel
really theres no need for words here this movie aint nothing but pure crap and whoever feels like spending 90 minutes feeling sick should see it ive seen a lot of sick stuff but i think this was worse than anything ive ever seen if youve seen salo and thought that one was weird disgusting and bad after watching the youll think of salo as a romantic love story same goes for the saw which compared to the is a really sweet story with plenty of good laughswell the first 25 minutes was ok the parts containing nude ladies partying and having sex also that tells a lot about the moviethis is not a first datemovie or a second or a third or whatever,cruel
when we first meet our pair of backpacking holidaying american students and their excitable icelandic travelpal they could be displaced from the american pie franchise loud and foulmouthed they look to europe as a means to sate their lusts before flying headlong in the rigours of adult life all they went from eastern europe is to get backed boozed and bonked they are in short pretty obnoxious intensely dislikeable for their blinkered hedonism overall stupidity and neanderthal attitude to womenthus when they are told of a mysterious nearmythical in deep slovenia by a fellow daytripper they cant resist finding out about it early signs bode well buffed nubile women deck the halls and are liberal with their bodies and the alcohol and drugs appear to on tap however they also start to missing one by one becoming increasingly desperate in his search for his errant mates paxtons worst fears are met when he wakes up handcuffed to a chair in a veritable charnel house an unwilling subject for some wealthier tourist to slash upborn out of a mixture of hardcore horror a seemingly intelligent philosophy on the spectacle of pain the current climate of global fear memories of fratboy ramblings and some dubious european postwar climates certainly stirred up the press a bit and also the boxoffice outrunning king kong and the chronicles of narnia  no mean feat for a lowbudget sicko horror flick with racy material and no major stars so kudos to eli roth for pulling off a minor coup he directs with gusto throughout clearing enjoying this opportunity to make a film that it is once commercial it clearly aims to take advantage in the postsaw thirst for sadism and also smart the film raises themes about americans abroad the nature of tourism and also the reason why we feel drawn to watching violence on screen note it raise these themes does not examine is a failuretechnically its put together with some punch and if not very distinguished its still a slick competent package roth also wisely places some confidence in an intelligent narrative device the first forty minutes of the film are larkish and funny despite the obviously sinister undertones having put the audience on the back foot roth lets rip with carnage and guts sadly the film never rises above its initial success for one the scenes of torture are purely visual and not psychological theyre nasty to look at but not horrible to think about because roth and tarantino never offer intelligent discourse on why people pay to hurt others we certainly come away thinking theyre sick mothers but we knew that already  and they fail to develop a potentially promising allegory on the similarity of real life and cinematic spectacles of violence also the last quarter of the film fails to be very atmospheric with roth his cinematographer and design team failing deliver a compelling environment predictably the bloodshed all takes place within a dank rotting former factory and one that has no character there are hints at some sensitivity for the fallout from wars and the ussr but again these are never developed worse still the final third of the film turns in a runofthemill escapeandheroism story which trivialises everything that has preceded it and might leave some viewers yawningtheres been some interesting debate about whether or not the film is an extension of fear or xenophobia on the part of american filmmakers and though roth has said that he made the film partly to demonstrate americans ignorance of the world around but what are they ignorant of is it that theyre wealthy tourists who blunder into dangerous situations after failing to research properly in which case theyre no different from anyone else or that they just didnt know that slovakia has a profitable torture industry and they should avoid it is it a parody of american attitudes or a warning i cant make up my mind and that ambiguity is a flaw the film becomes disgustingly selfrighteous in the closing scenes and indulges in stupid bit of revenge violence and while the survivors appear to have changed theres no hint that that theyve become wiser to the ills of the world and theyre place in it theyll be just be more afraid when they travelthat said there are a number of moments that do work very well one character killing themselves when they realise theyll be scarred for life another mocking the hero as hes dragged off that makes you my bch a torturer gagging his victim when they realise he can speak his language or a pack of marauding street urchins wholl bash heads in for sweets but those are the only moments that really made me flinch or sit up and amount to about five minutes out of an hourandahalf film,cruel
from the triviathe movie was written produced directed and released theatrically all in a twelve month period which is three times faster than the average hollywood filmguess what it shows badly written badly shot badly acted badly edited bad makeup bad effects its just plain bad where was the jump factor the chill where was the horror if it werent for the sheer laugh factor its amazing what you can do with mustard these days i would have fallen asleep too slow at the start too laughable at the end too boring except for the boobies and there were plenty of boobies in the middle,cruel
i was expecting to watch a dark disturbing horror i had even delayed watching this film because i thought it would leave me with a nasty aftertaste like all well crafted horrors do even though i hated cabin fever i was prepared to give eli roths follow up a chance  afterall the devils rejects was such a vast improvement over rob zombies debut  maybe this could do the same what a let down its not scary disturbing funny clever or even action packed we get about ten minutes in the torture chambers and none of this is psychologically interesting the eye cutting scene which i had heard so much about  maybe that was the problem looked like an effect from the 40s this was an interesting idea but it stops at about that soft porn and sadism  thats what i read in one review how wrong a few breasts and an mtv style torture scene i wanted to see something that conjured up the visceral thrill of texas chainsaw massacre or the forbidden pleasures of italian splatter movies but this was glossy unfocused and without any memorable scenes or iconic moments but what does mr roth care the cash tills are ringing here comes the sequel,cruel
if ever there was a film that was designed for teenage boys ready for pubertythen this is the onei had heard things about this movie and i wasnt very confident that i would like it at alli wasnt wrongfull of topless womenblokes making their way around europe in an attempt to screw everything in sight and a batch of really annoying charactersthe guy from iceland wound me up as soon as i saw him and he wasnt the only onethen there was the so called horrorits just an excuse for blood and gore and isnt scary in the leasti can imagine a group of young guys watching this and having a right laugh as they gaze at the bevy of boobs and level of sicko thrillsi dunnomaybe im getting oldbut this movie was a drag and even though the dvd i watched conked out ten minutes from the endguess whatit didnt spoil the film at all,cruel
this movie totally sucks i really dont see what is so great about it people say that it was really gory but it wasnt even close to being extremely gory at all it was really boring and i dont recommend it to anyone if you are looking for a gory movie see toxic avenger 4 citizen toxie or one of my personal favorite foreign movies battle royale i did not find anything good about this movie at all i was expecting a lot from all the hype that i was getting from people who saw it my basic thoughts about this movie was it starts out slow and goes pretty slow through the whole thing and never really speeds up it just stays really boring and doesnt really do anything that sweet in any of the scenesso my final thoughts are do not watch this movie,cruel
idea inspired by the grim horror of texas chainsaw massacre fails miserably in every sense to even vaguely emulate that classicid heard a little about this movie  such as the extremely squeamish gore levels and pain contained therein and always enjoying dramatic and edgy cinema decided to give it a spini have never regretted watching a movie more in my life this is up there with those luminary shambles such as resident evil cabin fever and darkness falls if id known this was from the hand of eli roth the same man responsible for the dire and truly pitiful afforementioned cabin fever there is no way id have committed myself to wasting 2 hours on itis set out in the eastern bloc of europe namely the small nation of slovakia after initially being set in amsterdam the netherlandsa group of 3 friends are enjoying the hedonistic pleasures of the flesh offered by the seedy districts of hollands capital before a chance encounter with an apparent pimp sets them on course to travelling east where a hosting the most beautiful and sexually precocious women is apparently situatedunfortunately for them it is also the location for a torture chamber and they have no idea of what visceral depravity and horror awaitsas one can clearly tell this is inspired by the style of texas chainsaw massacre  a group of conspirators try to lure unsuspecting victims into a dungeon in which vicious and unspeakable hells lurk carried out out by psychotic lynchmenregrettably it shares only that similarity with tcm and nothing else a truly appalling shallow and thoroughly disjointed plot which commits the cardinal sin of being fundamentally boring completely undermines this movies chances of being half decent there is simply no point here once the first sequence of torture is over you find yourself wondering why the hell youre watching this drivel i was very close to quitting entirely but it switched elsewhere deluding me into thinking there might actually be a moral or purpose concealed withinbut there simply wasnt this mess was a monumental hash  implausible pointless bereft of originality and poorly conceived plus if you only watch the first 30 or so minutes youd think it was practically soft pornthe one saving grace is that the acting was actually ok and nowhere near as pitiful as cabin fevers for exampleeli roth clearly cannot do horror and i plead with him to refrain from trying again,cruel
sadly eli roth thinks he knows how to make horror moviesbut with its obvious he dont know jack if you havent yet rented this awful movietake this timesaving advice to heartff it to the 43rd minute and begin watching it from that pointwhy you ask because there is nothing that happens before the 43rd minute horror fans will enjoy the 2nd half of the film which is filled with some decent grossout moments and revenge scenes for our hero too bad that by this time in the film the audience feels no emotional attachment to the hero character whatsoever unfortunately eli roth is making a sequel to this movie fortunately for me having seen this total mess of a filmi know better than to spend my 10 on any eli roth movie ever again eli roth has the dubious honor of having two movies in my top ten worst horror movies of all time the other cabin fever bravo eliyoure one special filmmaker,cruel
all is in the title this movie is utterly despicabledozens of b horror movies are infinitely better than this heavily advertised sophomoric work that is as imaginative and tasty as a cheap hamburger and morally offensive at that from its idiotic and malechauvinism views on sex women and teenage culture not counting its disgusting antieuropean agenda heewww heeww quite smellyeven the violence itself is colorless formulaic and derivative is it on purpose if so i couldnt find any reason other than exploitative oneswant shocks here are some shock movies with at least some intelligence or artistic values last house on the left  braindead unrated version  irrversible  seul contre tous  deliverance  videodrome  sal o le 120 giornate di sodoma  pulp fiction,cruel
is a twilight zone for slackers with a limited vocabulary and an even more limited imaginationwhat lacks in plot continuity cohesiveness and interest it more than makes up for in boring gore and mindnumbing mayhemis what happens when you have a bad idea terrible acting and an even worse story linenext time quint send me half the money wasted on and ill make a home video that is just as goodactually betterthan this poor excuse for a horror filmi was more interested in the porno one of the henchmen was watching than i was in what was happening in the torture room,cruel
help me out here i have been a horror fan pretty much as far back as i can remember i love the cheesy gorefests as well as the creepy pieces full of atmosphere and ambiance i just dont get the torture thing it doesnt shock or disturb me it is just so bleeding boring i feel like i am the one being tortured i just sit there twiddling my thumbs waiting for the the torture scene to end so that the story to move on i actually fell asleep in the theater watching house of a 1000 corpses normally i am the last one to come on a board and spew venom at a movie if i dont like it i ignore it however torture flicks are becoming more common i would like to know what people enjoy about them is there something that i am missing,cruel
of all the movies ive seen this year is second only to date movie as the worst movie of 2006 might have come in as the third worst movie had i actually went to see little man but who in their right mind would actually pay money to see that movie  anyways back to i saw quentin tarantinos name on it as the promoter for the film and the ads for the movie looked slightly promising so off to the movies i went at least the popcorn was goodso first grievance about fifteen minutes into the movie i get a general feel for the characters i hate them and cant wait for them to get killed im honestly not sure if it was intentional or not but the characters come off as some of the most unlikable people ive ever seen in a movie ive seen movies plenty of movies where i just plain did not care about the characters because they werent developed properly or i just found them extremely uninteresting but these charactersgod what the hell second grievance i guess this is supposedly based on true occurings but could they have at least gone the texas chainsaw massacre route for those of you who dont know the actual events had almost nothing to do with the events of the movie should have just used the basic premise and done something i dont know interesting with it instead the story is extremely runofthemill a bunch of horny stoner teens want to get laid by whores so they make a trip to a and hey they get laid but oh no bad things start happening one of their buddies is missing theres a message that he left but hmmmm thats strange isnt it oops hes dead blah blah blah they start getting tortured and killed one by one until only one of the unlikable characters is left alive bleh the end not a single shred of originality is exhibited by this film not even any neat camera tricks or anything to keep someone at least slightly entertainedthird grievance when i became aware of the insanely lackluster plot and unlikable characters i also noticed something else it seems as if when coming up with the concept for this film someone said hey lets just make it really gory then it wont matter how lame and predictable the plot is i like gory movies butthe gore in this movie even seem uninspired theres no technique or anything applied to the way the gore scenes are shot to make them seem more disturbing theyre justhey look a guy getting hacked up be disturbed its hard to explain but i think big horror fans should get what i mean you have to do more than just show something happening to get an effect from itso yeah my conclusion this was definitely a turdps anyone who saw this movie and writes a negative review saying that it was bad because it disturbed them is an idiot considering thats the entire point of a horror movie to horrify even though this one didnt i just wanted to get that off my chest i hate when people do that,cruel
wellno storybad actingno twist cheap effectshey guys the chinese girl with half of the face missing is so cheapyou can even see how it was placed on the girl many people were fascinated by the moviethe reasons they are sickprobably the spank the wiener to this movie ive seen plenty of gruesome horror flicks ichi is one of my favoritebut i like to have a story and not only titts and gore for the sake of itif i wanna see titts i rent a movie by jack the zipperby the way squealer is more frightening than this yeahit wasnt even a horror movieno shocksno moments of extreme tensionthe revenge plot in the end is stupidthe only thing i thought was amusing was takashi miike really playing himself coming out of the basement of the mad butcher societyif you know miike and his films and the scenes he himself acts in this is a parody of himselfnice ideawell the restdont even give it a tryand tarantino sacrificed his namea shamebig time,cruel
personally i thought this was the worst movie ever made i liked eli roths past movies but this one just didnt do it for me i mean yeah the blood and guts were alright but it was slow getting into the story and the beginning of the movie at least the first 3045 mins was like watching a mild porn movie the torture scenes were awesome they did awesome in those scenes but as for the rest of the movie it just felt like they left a lot out they didnt really explain anything before jumping on to the next scene i went to the theaters to see this movie myself and everyone else walked out of the theaters wondering what we had just paid to see not to mention the theater ended up giving everyone either refunds or rain checks cause no one was satisfied with it it was so not worth the money and the commericals for the movie was nothing like the movie itself at least in the commericals the movie looked good,cruel
i have to say i came to see the film with high hopes which quickly were dashed i enjoyed cabin fevermr roths other film but for a certain other directormr tarantino to call this film one of the scariest films hes ever seenmade me laugh hystericallythe first hour consisted of college blissdrugsbeer and sex but the routine of the film became boring and i almost gave up on the movie the last hour basically saved this filmbuilding an emotional intensity that i was finally pleased to see the conclusions revenge scene with jay hernandez seeking justice on one of the psychotic participants of the service brings an all too quick ending to the filmwhich was only beginning to flow i wished the film had focused more on the actual locale of the murders and the folks involved i suppose that will come in iiin some ways the directorwritermr roth seems to borrow his style from other directorstobe hoopers pacing from texas chainsaw massacre cronenbergesquire effects which i hope hell outgrow soon he has a good instinct for ideaswriting but the actual filming process is still lacking,cruel
if you want to see a great gutwrenching film then do not see this movie i watched this movie because a friend told me it was good and now i want to slap them across the face since i heard about it from word of mouth i kept my expectations very low and expected it to be somewhat stupid but i was hoping it would be better then it really is i was left feeling a little confused from the is that all wheres the rest ending and a little angry for how retarded the rest of it was the gore is kind of cool but since everything else about the movie is lacking is certainly doesnt make up for it the only people who would enjoy this film is adolescent kids who dont know any better so please spare yourself the headache and watch something else,cruel
well unfortunately i put on this film to see something before i go to sleep what happened is that i lost my sleep and worst for seeing this stupid film the first half is a nice soft porn with some good looking babes and full of clich about europe the next half is full of scenes with people torturing people in the nastiest way this was no horror movie cause you dont get scared at all you just get disgust by the torturing scenes the funny thing is that i described the plot to some friends and they found it very interesting the plot in few words is this sex and blood thats allit sure does sound intriguing but its not i have to admit though the production is good if you are in this kind of movies go for it but if you still got some working brain cells dont waist your time on this,cruel
this film was just so disappointing how could anyone label it the goriest movie of all time it was just plain and dull and uninteresting i tried to enjoy it but how quentin tarantino master of film could actually allow his name to be used in the same sentence as and good utterly beggars belief the gore is almost nonexistent and poor at best and the story line is like a needle in a haystack if you can find it let me know how utterly catastrophic and shakes my faith in cinemawithout spoiling the film the ending is like a punch to the back of the head you arent expecting it and afterward you can only think what just happened and not in a good way in the least,cruel
i hate to do this but i am voting not so much on the film making in general but this storyline of this movie this is by far the most disturbing movie i have ever seen im sure there are many more out there like it but because of the widescale release of this picture i went to see it the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it raises peoples awareness of the horrible things that people can do both from a killing standpoint and a storyline standpoint i realize that this is a movie and that sometimes people use movies as a way to escape the realities of life but i would never ever suggest that anyone see this film in fact i have and will continue to steer people clear from this movie i really wish i had something relatively intelligent to say to make people avoid seeing but im afraid that i will only have hope to rely on to help me get the word out not to see this i would gladly give the people who have the rights to this movie 10 to wipe this movie from my mind ew,cruel
ive come to terms that grizzly violence can be entertaining i admit im a fan of the saw films however lacks a certain quality i deem necessary in any film worth my time intelligence the only redeeming quality of the dvd is the making of documentary where the audience is introduced to the brains behind the scenes where we discover how such a waste of a movie was produced let me break the film down for you it could be considered a double feature the first feature being a lame porno shallow characters hiking though europe to fulfill their sexual fantasies whoop dee doo they get stoned get a little frisky theres a club fight and then the film climaxes with a coed fantasy then begins the second feature people slowly disappear theres some blood some gore people scream because apparently its pretty flippin scary i sit amused but sort of nostalgic for the coed fantasy theres more blood an then oozing eye socket a revenge bit by this time i begin to wonder when its going to get good then the credits begin to roll and i begin to feel betrayed by that video rental store associate who recommended it that and benchwarmers i should have known phshwah one may argue that i have misjudged the quality of this movie that it was actually a very well done comedy i must admit i love an optimist when it comes to the occasional outlook on life but urine doesnt taste good no matter how thirsty i am and there was no humor in this film one may defend the acting but im sure acting like youre making sweet sugar with very attractive gals isnt that difficult and almost any joe schmo can act hysterical you scream yell whimper a little drop the eff bomb and wala youre a star okay so maybe its not that easy but come on it aint that difficult try it go ahead and in fact take a camera crew get a little naughty add a little blood get all hysterical then send your tapedvd to hollywood if films like can make it im sure you have a flying chance,cruel
this is a horror movie ive seen more gore in a nine inch nails video the only reasonably scary aspect of this movie was the screaming which was really great i spent almost the entire span of the film alternately yawning and checking my watch i got a kick out of cabin fever so i was expecting a lot more from mr roth i was really disappointed and yes there is quite a bit of nudity  i guess that was supposed to make up for the total lack of horror in this socalled horror movie if youre extremely faint of heart and are grossed out andor terrified by most disney movies see this film otherwise dont waste your money,cruel
i put off seeing this movie for some time not because i thought it would be poor which it is but because it seems that 8000 horror movies come out every month these days and hardly any of them are worth mentioning i finally rented it it earlier this evening with the hopes that tarantinos connection and roths humorous touch would make it at least a halfdecent viewing unfortunately neither proved to be true on the plus side the picture does have the hard r gore that has been lacking in horror movies for quite some time but it all feels utterly inconsequential because the writing is so thin that it is hard to give a damn about what happens to the characters none of the bizarre yet entertaining humor of cabin fever is present instead we get a good deal of nudity and sex followed by a dragging center concluding with some fairly gory violence none of which has any real impact due to the slipshod writing in all honesty i found saw to be a better film and that wasnt exactly a mindblowing movie either it seems no one is interested in putting out good horror movies anymore there seems to be only two good types of horror movies those with elaborate death sequences and campy humor or that rare breed of psychological thriller whose fear inducement lies not in bloody scenery but sharp writing which creates tension is neither save your money and watch the descent,cruel
theres not much about this film that hasnt been adequately ripped to shreds by other posts and deservedly sohowever i would like to take issue with one comment that suggested this film would only be enjoyed by stoners im a stoner and proud of it and i thought the film was appalling for one the opening scenes in amsterdam are so uncharacteristic of the place its frankly offensive in fact its portrayal of european culture in general is so ridiculous and inaccurate it makes me wonder if roth has ever set foot outside his own country or ever read a book about it for that matterthe film is divided into two halves and they may as well have been separate productions for all the connections they share the first half parades as a tittyfest with the occasional chuckle the second half is an aimless gorefest without much gore admittedly the second halfs psychological impact is somewhat effective by using suggestion instead of inyourface splatter the sense of suffering and depravity is enhanced still the whole thing still comes off as much tamer than any of the previews suggested though i think my gf may disagree with me on this one clues to the plot if you can call it one are thrown at you constantly while actually believing its being subtle i was expecting some sort of twist at the end  when it didnt happen i had to wonder what the point of it all was unreasonable coincidences abound usually as a method for the remaining character i struggle to call him the lead to exact his revenge he becomes what he was running from you see oh yes how clever and ironicthe characters are uninvolving deserving neither support nor pity you just dont care what happens to them only one character who was still so vacuous i cant be bothered to remember his name promised any depth and he was killed off quickly once the horror started leaving nothing in his placeeven the score is badly done with crescendos of ominous music suffocating scenes of little importance ooh sounds like something big is going to happen no wait it didnt in fact thats the impression of the film as a whole  promising lots and ultimately failing to deliverthe 4 stars is given for the premise of the film and because the acting wasnt dreadful it could have been a great thriller but in the end it looks to have been made for shock value alone pity it couldnt even do that,cruel
i only recently started watching horror flicks because they never really interested me ive seen quite a few good ones lately but this is not one of them i kept waiting for the plot to go somewhere and it never really did there was enough gore but it just seemed really slow i dont know if i am the only one that feels this way but it just seemed to be low budget dull and boring when the movie first started out i thought it was just slow because it was building up to the main event but it never got there even when it was over i felt like i was left wanting more id have to say that this is one of the worst movies ive seen in a very long time does anyone else out there think this was slow or is it just me,cruel
who told eli roth that he was a writer a director id like to know who gave him the money to produce such crap this is so bad and stupid the sex scenes dont fit and most likely put there to get teenage boys to spend their money viewing it the acting is plain horrible no story no plot nobody cares what happens to the actors they have the nerve to use a music track from the wicker man old version during a sex scene mr roth should go back to guarding doors for people like howard stern hes not at all talented its a crime that he has been allowed to produce such trash such a waste of everyones time and money,cruel
if everyone is telling you that its awesome and its a gorefest then they are wrongthere isint many killings the story is a little bit hard to follow its not very gory and i recommend you rent it out before buying it i bought it today watched it and was kind of disappointed the ending was kindof good i have seen better if you want to see a real horror movie watch brain dead by peter jackson it is far better than saw 1 2 and im not really sure if this is a spoiler but the movie isint goodlol if you want to discuss this more with me add me on msn its pretty much about 3 backpackers that get lured into a town then somehow into this big building where people pay to kill people in gruesome ways,cruel
watching has been one of the worst mistakes in my lifewhen it starts and you see quentin tarantino product you think that it might be a surprise and you could have a good time but you realize that tarantinos name is the way to sell a film that has nothing interesting to showthe film starts with three stupid guys in holland that decide to go to bratislava during their voyage they meet a man in the train with a curious behavior has anybody realized that it is a copy of some of the scenes in the humor movie eurotripthen we arrive to bratislava and there is when is when you find that youre watching a stupid film the city that appears in the film is not real bratislava is a fabulous city full of tourists however we find a city where there is nobody in the streets where children kill people if theyre given chewing gums where the police is blind sorry for mister roth but if he doesnt know anything about bratislava or even europe he should not imagine a city following the american imaginative ideas of europe please investigate a little bitso finally when you think that the action has begun and that it may interest you you see some stupid gore images as the one when the killer falls and cuts himself or when the main character decides to come back after being free to save a girl by cutting his eyeto sum up i must say that nowadays directors have decided to show blood and stupid characters instead of making a well written script that could have made this film an much better one,cruel
when i saw this movie i was expecting extreme heartstopping gore because well thats what i had heard this movie was basically all about i rented it with my friend because i didnt get a chance to go see it in theaters both my friend and i were excited and expectant we watched it and were completely disappointed this movie is just stupid the first half of it is just a lot of sex and when youre completely disgusted and tired of all the sex it finally shows us some gore there are such clichs as a severed head a chainsaw and cutting the scene just as something truly bonechilling is about to happen the ending is only kind of satisfying what with paxton our protagonist played by jay hernandez killing our psychotic antagonist known only as the dutch businessman played by jan vlask but i was still too confused as to why yuki a torture victim played by keiko seiko threw herself in front of a train to really be glad the only good element of this movie is that jan vlask delivers a pretty good performance compared to everyone else i think that this is a movie only suitable to be played in the background,cruel
it seems that most of the comments posttiff are much more favorable to the film than all the negativity which swirled around earlier this year that does reassure me about the general filmgoing publicanyway overall it is really not a bad film i liked it about as much as cabin fever which i do recommend for cable viewingfor those people that get hung up on the image of slovakia here is some clarity this no more more a realistic portrayal of slovakia than the texas chainsaw massacre is a realistic portrayal of rural texas again it is just an off the beaten trail nightmare story so please to the slovaks who have been offended  the movie is not meant to be taken seriouslyi do like the comment from one slovak who suggested that perhaps a better setting would be in russia beyond the urals i have to agree but i do not think you would get very many backpacking young tourists out there maybe one could have had had the protagonists kidnapped in slovakia then a train ride taking days followed by truck lorry then barge etc until they arrive at an abandoned factory in the ural mountains where all the ultrarich are constantly ferried in and out via helicopter that may have added some extra dimensions of fear and anxiety including what would have been derived from the difficulty of escapei suppose what i am getting at is that there were some good ideas here that could have been better developed this is no horror classic and falls short of high tensionfinally to those people that absolutely hated this movie for the reasons referenced below a anyone who turns to horror movies to validate notions of geopolitics is just an idiot  this is not hotel rwanda nor is it meant to be b if you have the type of girlfriend that would be shocked to see scenes of fake torture when you tell them that you are taking them to see a movie about torture then she is an idiot and c people that take umbrage on the use of the gword when discussing a film depicting brutal acts of sadism and inhumanity probably also are more shocked when gangsters use the nword than when they are robbing killing and dismembering people i guess you hated goodfellas too huh talk about having your priorities bassackwards do you have any fun at the movies,cruel
the core idea revealed only at the end is interesting but the script is awful not even up to par with your average slasher movieif the story is this bad at least show more sick stuff instead of dragging on with bad dialogs and even worst actingone of the comments on here compared this with a bad version of eurotrip in its ignorance and mystification of eastern europe it is really astounding how unbelievably all the cultural ignorance in is meant literally as opposed to humorously in eurotrip in my opinion this should have been a straight to video production most likely successful in your average midwest redneck towns why oh why did tarantino produce this,cruel
i was actually really looking forward to seeing this though it isnt really my genre but i was hugely disappointed when i realized it was more a scavenger hunt than a story chicks check sex check drugs check blood and gore check mysterious old man check wild escape check corny american young people check all the typical elements thrown together in a storyline that challenges that of a bad porn moviethe movie could easily be the fantasy of a dim witted psychopath that hates europe also the imagery was very unimpressive it looked like the only thing that any attention was payed to was the authenticity of the wounds torturesound effects and attractivity of the actresses all in all a movie i recommend not spending any money on,cruel
lets be honest when you really look at it its like a porno gone bad it starts out with 3 guys going to europe to have lots of sex and they do but then they start to be killed in a sick twisted game going on where they are its these girls that they are having so much fun with that turn out to help aid these killers in the murders so just like i said its a porno gone bad the only reason i would give it 2 stars is because the last 20 minutes have a good scarytorture scene and thats about it im sure if youre a guy you might like this but for girls who would rather not watch stupid gross and totally unnecessary sex then i would avoid this movie go rent a different scary movie that actually is about terror and doesnt rely on sex for a plot,cruel
i love horror movies but not this onethe characters are just dogs on heat in a bad soft porn movie an hour in and i just wanted to take to them all with a shotgun myselfthe film didnt scare me once but it was pretty revolting to watch these boys just trying to shag anything that stopped still long enough they were completely loathsome and far too old to be backpacking i found myself thinking good another one has gone missing hurry up and bump off the last one it was a shame really because the actual plot is quite clever and could have been really scary but it just wasnt it must have taken a lot of effort to turn a good little idea into such a tedious piece of filmsome of the gore was done well but i finally lost interest when a key piece of gore near the end was so badly done that it made the old b movies look like makeup masterpiecespity id been looking forward to seeing and have been left just feeling disappointed i cant see this ending up being a cult classic there was nothing new in there nothing clever about it even completely wasted opportunity in my opinion,cruel
obviously catering to the younger audiences hostile has some teaser scenes that appear to be overthetop but are nothing the plot you see coming a mile away and you know exactly who is going to survive and who is going to help who escape sets look just like any number of recent horror movies eg saw which is in a different league than this movie one or two gratuitous non sexy sex scenes with some decent looking women a couple of suggestive torture scenes and a whole lot of redundant boiler plate plot in betweenthis was a big disappointment i would have thought something with qts name on it would have been better but this one simply doesnt measure up,cruel
i saw this as a sneak preview i dont go much for slashers so i wouldnt have bothered otherwisethe basic premise of the movie sale of tourists to be tortured by rich people looking for the ultimate kick i cant criticize although as i said wouldnt draw me to the cinemathe story is set in present day slowakia and sadly here the director makes himself guilty of a shameless lack of knowledge of consideration or any form or respect for slowakian people this is not because the movie is set in slowakia its because he wants us to believe the crude facts presented are common in that country and everybody living there is somehow or other involved in the unspeakablein a way this crude and ignorant superficiality is laughable in another its not especially knowing that slowakia is a country filled with normal and mostly very kind people rather on the poorish side who can use the extra income from tourists,cruel
stupid racist offensive movie ever made well its clear that roth thinks that every person who lives in slovakia is either an assassin or a bitch or both no police no army its unspeakable why lots of young touristss going to place where there is no anything to see and to do im really scared in which way can show we italian in the second episode hes about to shot just in italy beware to yourself roth what else the players are very bad you dont even trust they can feel a real pain them faces doesnt show grimaces of pain but only grimaces full stop i cannot understand the reason tarantino could to accept to produce a movie like this in a few words to avoid,cruel
hmm this movie doesnt suck but i like about 2 hours of action and some gore so thats why it doesnt suck to me people who expect to see gore watch something else people who wants action go see something else this is a mixture with not much of it in it some blood and a car chaseit gets a 2 from me since i was really hooked up by the buildup thats where this movie gets it strength but it didnt really get any stronger when any of the main characters were tortured i was waiting for more and to be honest i really hate torture scenes if you want torture go see saw it gets into your brain because that movie makes you feel the characters anguish over some choices which they have to make this one doesnt in this movie people are just tortured physically it seemsi wish i could be more positive but i cant sorry,cruel
this is the worst movie ive seen in a long time its a lame story without suspense it is not frightening at all and there is no real plot at least not a good one anyway you can really see its a low budget movie for example when they arrive at the train station in bratislava the camera moves like it was filmed by some amateur im from belgium and we speak also dutch but what the actors were talking in amsterdam in the movie was german certainly not dutch they make it seem like europe is some kind of poor continent when i saw that quentin tarantino had something to do with this movie i thought it was gonna be great but it turned out to be a big disappointment short 3 guys wanna get laid in europe and they get killed 1 at a time in bratislava without any real reason go see it and see for yourself its lame,cruel
by the end our lucky survivor has gotten revenge on a character he couldnt possibly have known was involved and we wonder exactly what is the point of  that is not correct when the survivor pakstonis dragged into the art gallery by the brunette he sees edward salad hands sawing josh up because he always wanted to be a surgeon otherwise a really good review i didnt like the movie but thought it was better then saw that movie was disgusting from start to finish this one had a storyline that did not start bloody also i liked that the survivor got his revenge did you notice how pulp fiction was playing in the hotel later in the movie the survivor could have escaped by himself but he came back for the girl kind of like bruce willis comes back to save marcelus wallace in pulp fiction what i would like to know is why did tarantino produce this piece of crap,cruel
how can you with any sensibility call this a movie i dont even know how it has rated over 5 this movie was simply put senseless gore and a god awful story line it was so obvious that everyone was involved you would have to be ignorant to not know that everyone was in on it i couldnt believe i actually sat through that movie i am so glad that i didnt watch it in the theater because i would have been angry come the end when it was time to leave and demanded my money back yank this garbage off the market and dont subject the poor citizens of this planet to trash like this all in all i give this movie 1 out of 10yuck,cruel
spoilers the first act quite rightly is a slow moving affair that tries to set the scene and introduce the characters unfortunately characterisation is virtually nonexistent the main characters are broad unengaging stereotypes that the audience may find it hard to believe in and root for the main idea that there is a place where the rich and jaded can go to inflict suffering on their fellow man is an interesting one but themes about the nature of man and his place in society are not developed instead you are left watching someone you dont know very well and dont care about in a nasty onedimensional situation the inventiveness and grittiness of the torture scenes is to be applauded but it almost seems like a waste of effort the final nail in the coffin is a forced contrived and deeply unlikely finale that leaves you wishing a better writer had been given the task of fleshing out the genuinely interesting premise,cruel
i was all excited to see this movie because the preview looked really good i guess all movies are like that preview looks goodmovie sucks wellmovie started off ok i guessthen went stupid about guys just going trying to get laid i know boys will be boys but it was really unrealistic and stupid american guys can get laid anywhere in europethey dont need to go to some deserted place and find some just stupidit was kinda like the movie the beach only that was worth watching and the actingoh god thats another comment all in itself no time for thatbut go ahead make the popcorn pick a movie but for crying out loud dont waste your time on this one,cruel
in the dvd commentaries for this film the artists involved congratulate each other on the quality of the screenplay are they serious   have they never seen a film written and directed by preston sturges if they ever saw a sturges film or citizen kane then they must be totally oblivious to the inferiority of their dialogue  and quentin t goes along with this charade  do these aholes have no shame eli says he wants to be typecast as a horror screenwriterdirector  put that man in a room and force him to watch the classic 1930s horror films with all their ingenious stylistic references to expressionist german drama,cruel
does contain spoilers 2nd warningwas never meant to be a great movie its bgrade pulp on the same level as saw and for the first 23 of the picture i disliked it nearly as much as that movie  though to be fair saws greatest failings acting cinematography direction editing  writing arent as evident here the cast is fine  mostly convincing the editing is brilliant  when the story comes around its better than mediocre the story however is my main beef though not my only one shocking brutalitarian films like texas chainsaw massacre work because after a brief introduction the movie gets to work shocking  grossing out the audience for the next hour or so gets bogged down showing the main characters obnoxious european sex adventure without the requisite atmosphere  its just a drunken european adventure eventually were given hints that something is wrong and then  whoop  someone goes missing then all hell breaks loose for a bit but without much gravity even worse we arent given the right clues as to what were supposed to be thinking or guessing about the plot our group agreed that we all hated the bulk of the movie because the evident story was about a wealthy crazy man who has paid a wartorn village to get boys for him to torture its not until the 3rd act that we find out the far more clever  shocking facts is this on purpose a good twist ties up fascinating  perplexing elements in a film ie sixth sense but this movie is just stupid until you are told bluntly what is going on its not a twist as much as a clarification and i dont really think it was meant as either were supposed to know that its somewhat random chance that josh is tortured by the same man as they meet on the train rather than as we assumed the man had intended josh all along so the movie succeeds sort of eventually but even then there are still major flaws makeup effects were nearly on the level of old troma films where i think the film industry is currently capable of convincing effects either in make up or in digital post production the corpses that paxton hides under appear to weigh a few pounds  bounce in a silly way the japanese girl appears to wear a taffy eyepatch and why in hell does paxton cut off her eye the plot holes undxerstandable in any corny horror flick are so completely stupid you have to wonder if there might have been a lesslame hole that could have been written in the most annoying element is the supposed payoff of the main torture scene its just too much its not entertainment there is minimal build up its hard to watch and then its over the director has used his strongest scene up and the movie dosnt benefit much tarantinos involvement brings up an obvious comparison to the similar scene in reservoir dogs when the ear gets cut off arguably not as shocking yet dramatically stronger joshs fear is plausible his agony nauseating yet once i knew what was going on the business end of the situation the slovakina mafia apparently running the scam the local involvement there is an air to the film that is satisfyingly odd  unsettling unfortunately it is an unsalvageable mess by then there is a good movie here but the writerdirector just cant quite get it out,cruel
ive read many of the comments on this page and everyone seems to be complaining about the sex aspect of the film i feel that roth may have been trying to lull the audience into a false sense of security but was there any real need we know were watching the scariest film of the decade right the site of so many boobs ultimately was the only thing that made the film worthwhile in my view the story line was of course interesting but implausible the wholesale disappearances of teen backpackers in europe would raise a few eyebrows would it not and the whole town seems to be in on this murder for pay scheme that building must have had 12 rooms at least with people being tortured if that does add up to 12 people a day thats 4272 teenagers murdered in one town a year and if the yanks are going for 2500000 a pop this is a big money business ultimately the film was not scary at no point in the movie did my heart start to pound did i feel fear for my own safety etc etc at times i felt a little sick to the stomach because the film is filled with gore and i did feel a little happiness when a few of the bad guys got their just desserts in the end especially the annoying dutchman but at no point in the entire movie was i ever scared so much for the scariest movie of the decade in short i am very disappointed with eli roth cabin fever was a pile of putrid nonsense and was only marginally better i would suggest that the studios stop giving this man money and also filming greats like tarantino should be very wary of endorsing roths worki look forward to 2 although i do not look forward with parting with my hard earned money to watch it roth should be paying us to watch his films i say i only look forward to 2 to see the progression if any of the story line if its going to be more tits and gore then ill take a skip,cruel
the main problem with this film is the fact that the socalled heroes are extremely unlikeable homophobic morons you hear them use the word fggt so many times in the first few minutes of the film that i was rooting for the villains before we even meet themdirector eli roths excuse for his frequent use of homophobic characters is that people talk like that well if that is true how about making a couple of racists the main characters in his next movie they are out there as well unfortunately and also use insulting language but i doubt that would be acceptable to a film studio homophobic morons on the other hand dont seem to be a problem its a strange worldbut if you can look past the fact that the main characters are insulting and alienating 10 to 15 percent of the audience of this film and im sure there are quite a number of people who are glad about the homophobic insults and praise roth for being nonpc i wonder how theyd feel if those characters were racists and not homophobes you still wont get what the commercials promised while the film is very brutal and gory at times there are much less scenes of torture then you might expect and considering how much i disliked the characters i wanted to see them suffer much more the most unlikeable character even survives leading to a very unsatisfactory endingthere is a very undeveloped plot about josh one of the annoying backpackers possibly being gay but that doesnt lead to anything is this maybe roths way of trying to make up for all the homophobia did he get scared how his target audience would react to this and abandoned this plot therefore making it pretty redundant it wont come as a surprise that one of the main villains of this films is gay and gets a very bloody death scene at the end im not saying he doesnt deserve it but considering the prejudiced attitude of this film it makes you wonder what roths fascination with homosexuality and homophobia is all about im not really sure i wanna know,cruel
is eli roths followup after the ubercreepy cabin fever it even follows the same theme when people make incredibly bad choicesin this case we follow the exploits of paxton jay hernandezoli eythor gudjonssonand josh derek richardson 3 college grads that are determined to have sex with every woman in europe it is during one of their barhopping tours that they meet alex lubomir bukovywho recommends a in slovakia where all of their sexual fantasies will be fulfilledas the saying goes beware of greeks bearing gifts it seems that the guys soon become nothing more than an experiment in sadism people are kidnapped and brought to this in order to fulfill the twisted desires of their incredibly rich clients who can kill another human being in which ever way that they want and it can get incredibly nasty and bloodythe film starts off slowly it doesnt get bloody until about the second half of the film and many of the scenes of torture are suggestive in nature one unfortunate soul is about to get their toes clipped but the viewer never sees this incredibly unsettling and will make you hide behind your hands an awful lot i freely admit that i had to do this several times what makes it unsettling is that there may be a real possibility that situations like this existthis will creep you out,cruel
i had good expectations with the director was eli rothwho directed the very entertaining cabin fever and the trailer made it seem like something brutally violentwhen i finally saw the film i can say that its not bad but not as good and as violent as i expectedthe torture scenes came in the second half of the moviethe first one kinda bored me because nothing very interesting happenedthe torture and killing scenes are the best moments of the moviebut it isnt as violent as everybody saidthe violence is graphic but not so much as i expectedlike i said beforethe movie is not bad and roths intention was really goodbut i feel that it could have been much better and that the screenplay is not completely solidif you are a sensitive persondont watch this moviebut if you like horror filmswatch this moviebut dont expect something extraordinary,cruel
stay in your good old motherland it is safer the outside world wants your skin try to avoid cabins too if you want my advisethe movie depicts a european machination from amsterdam to belgrad via praha against visiting backpackers its not particularly exciting full of clichs and the constant question of nationality how american victims are more valuable than their foreigner counterparts makes it a bit pompous a bit irritatingoverall visually softer than expected is still able to deliver some cheap gore from time to time hahaha remember the eye scene definitely not a must,cruel
i started watching this movie without knowing anything about it the only thing ive heard about this was that it had hard torture scenes in it i never saw any other eli roth movie either beforewell the story starts in amsterdam where 3 friends are trying to get laid with european woman right at the beginning we start noticing that this isnt probably the best movie to was one and a half hour in itas the story continues the picture keeps showing us hot chicks constantly during probably half an hour with pratically no substance in it  but i must admit that the girls are really really hotbut everything else really sucks the plot is stupid the acting is dumb at certain points and the music is even worse it never fits to the scene and the torture scenes arent that disgusting as ive already seen written around here a few minutes ago sometimes thanks specially to the music i was almost laughing due to the stupidity of it still i must congratulate the special effects for some scenes that they managed to make it here at the moment i can only think of the scene where the 2nd of the 3 friends is tortured probably because its the very first torture scene that we watchother than that this movie sucks in every way it seems like it was made to scare 12 yearold kids and to make teenagers horny by watching breasts and breasts and breasts,cruel
ive been looking for an excuse so i didnt have to write about this film but i couldnt find it yet so if this doesnt say much if because there is not much to say about eli roths last cinematographic project frankly the movie is awful you know when they say you should get a lot with little eli roth got it but he got a lot of the wrong elements and little of the good onespart of this horror renaissance presents a small amount of characters in a maximum of two important environments its a matter of short time before the characters arrive to this so called and they live the most terrifying experiences of their livesunlike neil marshall and his the descent characters here are not developed or even detailed roth doesnt seem to need that for the development of the picture josh and paxton are two friends who just want some good pot and some good sex with some beautiful girls nothing else and they are portrayed by derek richardson and jay hernandez with more conviction than the bad movie deserves mostly by hernandezso we also find the enigmatic and weird characters that are not just common people in a film like this one we find the receptionist in the hotel who doesnt even speak or answer questions then what we find is just what has to happen so we can at least see something of content in the picturewhat happens i could say is not plenty but its enough you get to a point sometimes when youre watching a movie where you dont know how you got to watch it until that point because you know that youre not watching anything may be appealing for the horror fans because it respects horror and gives horror what it needs and i understand thatthe part i couldnt understand has to do with the plot and i dont know if the fans care about that lets just say that eli roth has an amazing eye for the genre but a regular eye for storytelling his camera moves expertly and explores without limits but his scripts doesnt make a move when the main explanation arrives to our eyes and ears its so pointless that it becomes funnywe accept it as it comes but the explanation is followed by a last scene that is actually terrific and a minimum reason to watch the piece however the power of this scene and the impression it generates comes too late to compensate the other stuffwhat else can i say well just dont bother,cruel
it somehow is a shame that this movie is promoted with quentin tarantino presents because all the time you dont feel anything of the atmosphere of tarantino movies most things you see are naked women and violencethe movie starts off like a teeny movie everything is about drugs and sex i thought this was just an introduction with some irony and parody and the movie will get more serious and perhaps even ambitious later well later the movie is about violence and sex senseless violence absolutely stupid but it remains a teen movie just a little more brutal the actors are awful except a few and the selfproclaimed humor is absolutely shallowbesides the movie makes the impression of slovakia being a barbarian and corrupt country where every town makes what they want toso what remains a few nice scenes and a coupe of good looking women he he but thats all the rest is a boring sick movie not even recommendable for fans of movies like house of 1000 corpses or the devils rejects which i really enjoyed believe me i do like violent movie if they got a nice plot or a pack of great dark black humor but this isnt the case here violence pure violence nothing more,cruel
this movie had pretty much no plot at all it was just a shock value movie for sadists its pretty much just scene after scene of torture trying to be really dark but theres no substance to the movie i guess the move could be trying to reveal the horribleness of torture or to make a political comment on how republicans want torture to be legalized for terrorist suspects the plot is this torture in a guy tries to escape no character development no changes no plot death and torture should be the name of the movie or just dont see this movie that one would work too overall the only reason to see this movie is to desensitize ourselves to violence so rent this movie before you see your first real horror movie and youll be all right,cruel
the movie itself does not impress very much as the actors do not perform very well and it has a big stereotype on the back young usa kids who go to europe for sex drugs and fun which is difficult to swallow thinking about what i just wrote down i realize that the script starts with a stereotype above and ends up with something fresh the idea that it can actually happen nowadays something else to take into account is that male actors performance specially jay hernandez is kind of poor and with a hero sort of looking which does not match very wellyou will have to watch it and find it out by yourself i dont want to spoil it for you,cruel
so i watched the movie last night with my mother big mistake the beginning is like a freaking porno oh my goodness the beginning of the movie turned me on more than anything i cant really decided if i enjoyed this movie or not i cried after watching it because i was so disturbed but i think i would actually watch it again the blood and tits what a combo right im not quite sure why the movie had to follow the story line that it did i would have been ok without all the ta im a lesbian and i still dont wanna see girls tits all the time especially when im trying to watch a horror movie i want to be scared not wet frankly i think the writing could have been a whole lot betteri will say it is worth the money i paid for it,cruel
after hearing all of the hype for this movie a friend and i went to see it in the theater we were ready for some really good scary blood and gore what we got was 90 of the movie was the backpackers having sex with locals in a the few scenes that did show some blood and gore was very mediocre in comparison to other movies ive seenbasically it was a teen horror movie bumped up a level friday the 13th was much more scary in its time than this was today finding a movie these days that is scary and gory is just not possible and this is another disappointmentsome of the story was okay and buyable but for the most part it was pretty hokey,cruel
id heard numerous things about this film before i watched it mainly focusing on the violence and gore but the other being quentin tarentinos involvement so i watched this film expecting a slick well produced and fast moving film however what i saw was a slow bogged down movie with very poor representation of any kind of truth  ie amsterdam  i lived there for a few years and know it extremely well and ive never seen such a red light area and more to the point since when have the dutch spoken german this turning it into a typical hollywood we dont care if its accurate depiction or not film the first hour of this film is supposed to be trying to build a story however the quick cutting between leaving the s in amsterdam normally have a name to coffeeshop to disco to appearing another room with the alex character is very disjointed oh on another note no in amsterdam ever have curfews they fully well understand why people go amsterdam the party capital of europe  just another point that makes the film so unbelievablethat said the general arrogance of the american in europe is capture well enough something if you live in amsterdam and see day in day out youd understand that commentback to the film so once the action has moved from amsterdam to the train on it way to slovakia  couldnt they be bothered to stop in germany or the czech republic which they would have had to cross before reach slovakia the scene in the train carriage was toe curling cringe worthy  who told these actors they could act i dont know they then appear at the and more wooden acting and poor direction we suffer the embarrassment of the sex scenes   at this point i was ready reach for the stop button on the dvd player   but i suffered on so the last 30 minutes the movies actually picks up and bit and story regarding an organisation which people pay to torture and kill people plot idea  good but very badly executed the gore isnt as bad as people have made out and why people dont pass out from pain and stop bleeding even after having two fingers cut off is something else the finale is pretty poor also you left not really knowing anything about what actually happened or any backgroundso in short save yourself an hour and just watch the last 30 minutes thats the interesting part of this film and you wouldnt miss anything it isnt a thriller its not a horror film its just a mess its the kind of film id expect from an american who has never left america in there life,cruel
after viewing it was clear that the film serves only two purposes to act as a template for how a film should never ever ever be made and as a confirmation that cabin fever was not just a fluke eli roth is indeed that bad of a writer and that bad of a director for a man who uses the words bad and ghettoized to describe the condition of the horror genre today roth seems to be doing overtime to make sure it stays that wayfollows two american backpackers jay hernandez and derek richardson and their drifter friend as they waste the first hour of the film which is only 135 stumbling across europe doing drugs trying to get laid cracking jokes your little brother would think were funny and more or else making it impossible for us as an audience to care anything for them as characters after the plot decides to get moving we see that the travelers of slovakia are starting to go missing and we find out that the girls our american protagonists have been busy ogling over are in fact dealers of sorts to sadistic businessmen and wouldnt you know it they happen to pay top dollar for american subjectsmakes me wonder what eli roth is really trying to accomplish there is not a single moments worth of innovation in the films entirety is roth trying to become synonymous with awfulness is he trying to give uwe boll a fight for the worst director in cinema history if you take each aspect of and compare it to the worst movie you can think of im almost certain you will find is just as bad if not worsefirst the acting this is the only true horrifying part of the film you may not end up seeing the whole film if youre anything like me because i spent most of its duration hanging my head in pure disbelief that any director would send his actors to the silver screen in such disgrace hernandez who may not be an alist actor but surely not a bad one is sent to a sadly stupefied level it is impossible for to work as a film because of the characters from the very first few minutes i couldnt care at all what happened to these stoners hell i was actually waiting to see them tortured we are not given any developing or background information on our protagonists especially our hero hernandez point being theres no point of relation between us and them and certainly no reason for us to care at all what happens to themand then we have the dialogue oh good god the dialogue if this were a silent picture or even if the dialogue consisted of only faggt drugs fck sex then the film would have gotten itself across all the same because there isnt a single line of important exposition in the entire barrage of triteness that coupled with countless scenes that are entirely null and void and you have not a single plausible aspect of well ill actually give roth credit that the idea of itself is intriguing but as ive stated above he made sure we forgot about thatas far as the torture scenes are concerned which i can only imagine are the reason people decided to venture to the theatres to see they are too little too late what is hyped up to be one of the most disturbing films of our time adds up to nothing more than some quick cuts and a dangling eyeball i must admit i was extremely let down for i was hoping to be satisfied with at least once part of the film the scenes were not long enough to create tension and edited so poorly that what we did end up seeing we actually didnt really get to see with this being the second monumental disappointment coming from eli roth it is beyond safe to say that this man is incapable of delivering the goods on par with the horrendous efforts of cabin fever i cannot recommend to anyone it does not work as a horror piece it does not work as an entertainment piece and it certainly does not work as anything that we should remember few films are less desirable than ,cruel
even though i have seen many movies i have never written a review because i think everyone should judge a movie for his or her self however this movie is so terrible i had to try to warn anybody waiting to see it please do not waste your time this movie contains absolutely no plot it uses nudity just for the sake of nudity the main characters are demeaning to women and an embarrassment for americans i expected a psychological thriller this movie held no suspense the socalled horror scenes were medically unrealistic and were not even scary just disgusting like the rest of the movie so unless you consider gratuitous nudity and sporadic gore an avenue of entertainment i would definitely skip this movie if this is the caliber films that tarantino will be making he should do us all a favor and retire forever,cruel
this film is just a pointless display of sick extreme violencethe plot line is inexistent and there are a lot of inconsistencies such as the guy having two fingers cut off by a chainsaw and then instead of bleeding to death going around for hours full of energy saving the japanese girl and then killing the dutch businessman not to mention when him and the japanese girl who had an eye removed by a sicko wander around a busy train station without anyone noticing the two of them in a horrible messtheres no irony or a vibe as in tarantinos films shame on him for involving himself in this crap what people wont do for money  its just pure violence without the storyline really making any sensei think this is the kind of films humans do not need to see with all the sickos already around and all the sick news we hear every day we really dont need a like this movie encouraging and inspiring this kind of sadistic violencethis is the kind of films that should be axed by censorship rather than those with some sexual contentsdont waste your money on this crap ,cruel
its not a bad film its just not a particularly good one either wehenever i examine new horror objectionably i like to view it from the standpoint of an both ardent fan and a mainstream viewer i found that failed to deliver on both levels simultaneously trying to satisfy one then the other as a true horror fan i found much to admire  the setslightingsounds of the torture chambers were handled impeccably and offer a real sense of dread the characters natural reactions to their impending deaths are eerily portrayed and do ask some rather cathartic questions of the viewer the effects work while standard stuff are heightened by their application and in true texas chainsaw fashion the implication is often more appalling than the grue on display however whilst i enjoyed the first half of the film as a piece of characterisation it is still a little dull the setup a little too set up and the unnaturally accommodating im not suggesting that the owners take notes from lord summerisle or tubbs and edward but i have stayed in many s and never once have been offered a sauna with two naked slovakians ive tried setup aside the natural progression is to reward our patience with a second half that delivers on all counts which it does for ten minutes and the results are truly horrifying not because we are being offered anything new in the way of gore and suspense which are both competently handled but because and not wanting to put too fine a point on it  this sh1t is probably happening somewhere as we speak and that in itself is enough to give the most ardent fas a shudder down their spine if only this level of energy could have been maintained for the following 30 minutes but alas after the initial escape from the chambers and the improbable and illconceived reentry the film simply gives up as a film in its basic sense its a polar opposite to cabin fever roths earlier effort the contrast is phenomenal and im fairly certain its self imposed i cant imagine there were many if any studio pressures on the production as that would be like asking shakespeare to write a play only using a handful of words it seems to me as though there may have been fears as to the films release or content if it didnt offer retribution and moreover closure however the very nature of the film should have dictated its conclusion which is this if these underground killings are taking place it is likely we will never find out about them a true end to a film of this nature would have seen the second victim never leaving his chair i understand that this would repel many audience members and it should one should not leave the auditorium with a sense of hope or closure after viewing a film of this nature if anything it should promote unclean feelings of dread fear the film did promote a fresh ideal  not every horror film has to be some selfreferentially postmodern cravenimitation to garner box office success see wolf creek also along with a few other touches it was refreshing to see the weaker of the travellers die as such and not continue this ridiculous trend of creating heros from victims by the end of the final reel see alexandre ajas hills have eyes  then rent out his vastly superior haute tension to see another director with a clash of purpose and apparently talent in addition whilst the stronger of the 2 characters does survive we dont not envy his success in any way and although the murderrevenge he commits is there to satisfy a mainstream audience it is carried out with enough ill will that it almost convinces the rest of us when you accept their rather coincident train journey and the vocal repetition which brings the two protagonists together in conclusion a great premise handled competently where required but ultimately falling short of its own hype and unwillingness to see the events through to the bitter end best scene  the shot of our third victims hands as he grasps the chair hes chained to when the chainsaw starts from behind him pure gold,cruel
the worst film i have ever seen completely fails the aim to scare you instead it glorifies criminals stupidity gratuitous violence the film has got no plot there is no excuse for any of the violence that appears this movie should be banned from all over the world and the people that made it that is quentin tarantino and eli roth should be arrested do not see it it is a movie that will not show you nothing new or valuable to your life it doesnt scare anyone whereas showing a negative feeling towards humanity and all the human values i just cant believe how a movie like this could be done this movie is a disgrace to the industry and someone should put an end to its commercial releases in all forms foreverim throwing away pulp fiction and kill bill and i will never see a movie again by any of these persons,cruel
ive always been a fan of quentin tarantino but was extremely disappointed with first of all there is nothing at all realistic about the three guys travels through europe its hard enough to suspend ones disbelief when watching a horror flick but when the nonhorror aspects of the movie are equally as ridiculous its just laughable furthermore you have to watch half the movie before you get anything violent or shocking shockeffect is the main reason for watching a horror movie or a quentin tarantino movie the ridiculousness of the plot the characters and the surroundings increases exponentially from start to finish the cleverness present in reservoir dogs pulp fiction etc was 100 absent in this movie,cruel
what im going to say about this film contains spoilers thats the fact but if you asked me id tell you it didnt really matter anywayi must admit this movie is scary and it may not be boring as people have told about the story is way from realistic i dont really care however the film is shot pretty good with scenic views and good lighting three young men traveling a long way to visit a chicky they have been told thats like stephen kings stand by me with a different goal boobs are necessary after all those are what the characters really hunger for right torture things are necessary too i mean thats the whole idea of the film a creepy torture house for captive tourists if you didnt see the torture how could you know that was a exhibit for arts show and you know what i think i think the first 30 mins are for the viewers to finish up their jumbo popcorn before they move on to the open gut thing cant say its a bad thingthe sad thing is the thriller is not well balance begins at the scene when the 2 characters find out their friend has gone missing ends at the scene when paxton is through the torture the thriller last for roughly half an hour out of an hour and half after paxton has made his way off the torture chair everything seems to be rushing to the credits so what is the chance that in 25 minutes paxton can 1 get out of a strong hold filled with many armed guards and 2 run into the 3 guys at the same time how convenient who have set him up on the way of fleeing killing them without any damage or leaving blood stain on the car and3 sneak out from an alerted road block and land on the getaway train safe and sound and 4 run into the man who is behind everything without being spotted first and 5 get in an empty restroom of a busy train station i know that sounds impossible but im pretty sure this is really happeningyou tell me,cruel
i just watched this film and i hated it what the hell is with some of the criticssome saying it was better than the saw moviesmy ass sure it maybe more gore but wats the point its desistingthe first 30 minutes is just plain dumb and pointlessall in europe bout getting laid which was basically the whole film was boutnot that i got anything against wit tits but come onif you wanna see good horror films go see the saw movies anyone agree really if anyone thinks this movie is a master success then what the hell yall tripping on like i saidso i give this film two thumbs way downits just plain retarded,cruel
this time its not an suv breaking down in the middle of the ozarks or the australian outback in a littleknown place called wolfe creek but the siren call of sex drugs and partying all night of course  the premise is again as new as the latest category romance novel you will see in your local drugstore but stories have to come out of somewhere and this genre only has a oneway lane with little room for variation and the knowledge that it will not produce greatness but popcorn products aimed at violence queens and eager teensanyway eli roth and quentin tarantino two guys who have a special loving bond with violence taken to extremes have teamed up to produce no its not a travelogue depicting the breathless landscapes of europe where its based but more or less a straightforward template of young people getting caught in a situation where they have practically no control and in which they will have to resort to the same grotesque inhumanity in order to escape and never mind the missing bodypartsthe setup sequence is slow it is a little unsettling to see a faceless man humming tunelessly as he mops a bloodsoaked floor but this short prologue is over soon enough not so soon as to make you wonder what has taken place in this unknown place but that comes later in the meantime eli roth sustains a good hand in building up his story in which the moronic playfulness of the three twentysomethings  paxton josh and oli  in quest for sex with available women is on full display i dont think roth was looking for sympathy from the audience as much as just showing in his own way the mentality of boys who want to have fun so anyone looking for a character to hold on to may need to look elsewhere because its not herenow there are some elements that stick out as unnecessary or at least plotquestionable in cabin fever there was this one boy who was insane and had a thing for karate moves now supplies an entire gang of them and theyre pretty mean even though all they want is bubble gum i dont know if this was meant to be comic relief but it stops the story dead in its tracks also unnecessary the requisite antigay jokes but thats probably not as relevant even when it was a little off putting theres also the misogynistic element in which to me is all but invisible  unless some women were offended at seeing so much female nudity and decided that women were being shown as bait  which they are and later we learn quite willing to be sois an okay film  good but not particularly memorable for me it continues to help the genre survive now that the haunted house and monster movie are all but rotting cadavers its much more disturbing to me to see the evil within man and one of the most nightmarish sequences involve the man we hear at the start of the movie the german surgeon who seems to be in a sort of ecstatic frenzy as he gets ready to torment paxton jay hernandez it was reminiscent of dennis hoppers extreme moment of sadism in blue velvet and that scene has more homoeroticism than the lame scene between the dutch businessman jan vlasak and josh derek richardson there is also a cute injoke with director takashi miike as a customer the man who brought odishon a classic of this genre it made me wonder what his character might have been up to within the torture chamber that he felt he needed to tell hernandez to be careful or he might spend all his money in there considering the fee these clients pay for their extreme entertainment that would have been an interesting movie in its own right,cruel
this looks like a pretty promising movie im looking at the promotions with tarintinos brand reviews for being terrifying and people be taken out of the theaters the idea of being able to pay to kill someone however you want was interesting and couldve made a fantastic movie sadly this isnt it when we popped the dvd in i knew it was going to be bad in the first 5min 3 guys in europe looking for the almighty sex how many poor horror films in the last decade have started with this premise i thought itd get better but for the first half i was just watching a really poor porno film with music to boot when the gore finally came i found myself laughing uncontrollably rather than even beginning to be scared or creeped out the only part of this movie i remotely enjoyed were the group of kids straight out of oliver twist romping the life out of the pursuers i got a kick out of thatunless youre a huge fan of fangoria bfilm blood and gore movies please please skip this even for those people that get kicks out of seeing boobs and sex get a porn and watch that instead while waiting for a better horror film to come out chances are the story and action will be a lot better in the porn,cruel
the idea i had about from what i had heard and from all the marketing that was made around the film was that it would be an extremely gore movie one of those we just watch blood flowing everywhere and mutilated bodies on the floor ah i also heard it had lots of sex some people even call it pornographic i wouldnt go so farwell has actually all those nice things for a gore movie of course but it also have three features that are not so good the first one is the nationalist crap which i really didnt expect for a movie like this the pride of being american thing is so deep at some moments of the movie that i felt even sicker seeing those scenes than the gory ones the second a good american movie must always have a hero a guy who does the divine justice and revenges all his dead friends its so typical the third the portrait of slovakia man if i was slovakian i would be insulted with this film all that is showed is filthy buildings old cars abandoned kids on the street in one word misery and free sex i know slovakia isnt a rich country thats for sure its a new democracy and they are reforming many important issues of their society but i think the portrait done in this movie is the typical description of the civilized guy whos coming from an occidental industrialized country hes there in the eastern country just to search beautiful women and have some cheap sex its so typical too it would be a fantastic tourism advertisement slovakia land of misery wild sex and butchery but there was one detail i really appreciated in in spite of being truly sick it was something that i had never seen before when the hero guy was escaping from the cell where he was arrested he gets into a room that seemed more like a bathhouse and suddenly enters a guy who asks him if it was goodif he did it slowly or fast if he liked to kill his victim then he realized he was in a kind of a butchers club those guys were paying to calmly torture and kill their victims as they were going to a gym to do some relaxing exercises its so sick weird and cruel that i wouldnt even imagine that someone could create a thing like that sick sick sick globally i think is fine but it could have been much better if the three issues i mentioned before didnt exist i would give it 7 out of 10 butbecause of those reasons it will be just 6 out of 10,cruel
hey i just saw this movie 2 hours ago in a cinema and it was nice some people left in the middle i can see why and some went to the end and all the tickets were free so this is not the typical teen movie but its also a little bit predictable i cant blame the all nudity screams in the posts but what do you care anyway at first glance it even looked a playboy movie but i believe it was made so people would relax with some kind of soft music that looked a lot like a kid show music after that the movie gets really violent with lots of gore that showed the brutality of mankind what do you care if the actor were 20ish just for that is a teen movie and deserves a 1 star i dont recommend it for the sensitive people actually i only recommend it for who really know what is going to see that is a lot of blood and human pieces hey i just went cause i got a free ticket wasnt planing on it and i would do it again ive seen lots of scary movies and this one is a creepy one not too scary to say the truth but a nice way to spend an evening or dawn,cruel
i think i built this one up too much in my mind i loved cabin fever so i was expecting big things from roth for his second film on a heavier budget i missed when it zipped in and out of the theatres and finally got a chance to check it out tonightbasic storyline trio of frat guyish twenty somethings carousing through amsterdam get wind of a little eastern european area where the babes flock to americans like nobodys business one in particular is a veritable treasuretrove of puy so theyre told off they go and everything about this little country seems great at first but all is not as it seemsgreat premise great great great love it any guy who has ever been to college knows about these little european backpacking tours nudge nudge which are basically excuses for dudes to get away from girlfriendsresponsibilityreal life etc so they can party and pick up hot euro chicks chicks and live it up before settling into an actual life its a frat guy tradition for someone to make a horror film that preys upon such hallowed ground is like watching someone spit on your grandmothers gravestarts out awesome the two ugly americans are accompanied by an equally ugly icelandic they smoke hash insult people act like rude idiots have sex with hookers all that good stuff the only minor problem in the early part is that these guys may be too ugly but its a minor quibble cause the beginning is great a creepy twitchy which can adequately describe many people in this film local directs them to the eastern european off they go things are still rolling along nicelyi think the problem starts to set in when they actually get to the things there are just like the guy told them lots of conveniently available easy women and so forth but for me this is where roth kind of got into trouble for some reason the air of dread never surfaced i dont know why but i actually felt it more when they were still in amsterdam nothing in the town radiated any sense of danger the roving bands of kids didnt look scary the girls just looked like a bunch of models i never felt any palpable menace the buckets of blood and the gore were fine but by the end i felt it was just a distraction i wanted more scares gore is great if used well like in cabin fever but not when it actually detracts from the sense of menace i guess i wanted the film to disturb me more than it did i wanted something that would make me really not want to go to bratislavahowever i should say that i did enjoy this movie quite a lot i think roth is an awesome director i was expecting a great deal from too much probably and when youre anticipating a film so much sometimes it just cant live up to your expectations some great scares definitely a lot of blood and guts what i actually liked the best was when roth was more reserved and let the creepy characters take center stage like the weird alexi and the freako american near the end then the film really came alive for me,cruel
this is truly a lovehate movie i watched it hated it and yet can see why some people would love it the plot is very poor and the film has little or no point until the last half an hour and even then it is silly the violence is to a level where it is just not believable and at the same time pointless really as you can gather im not a fan of this movie and yet i loved roths cabin fever which to me is a great spoof horror although im led to believe it was supposed to be a straight horror oops well anyway i will be staying clear of these type of movies from now on especially any movie that has a famous director presents quentin your stock has gone down in my book like he could give a damn what anyone says after his great films,cruel
i can not actually believe how bad is i never ever thought that a single film would stand out in my mind as the worst i have seen changed my perception sat in my local cinema i wondered why the hell i had offended my senses by watching this rubbish it was poorly directed abysmally written and the acting was below par to say the least the film is like some kind of pornhorror that tortures you almost as graphically as the victims in it from start to finish it is so bad really it is tasteless and cheap the gore is overthetop and at times very cheesy do not watch this film it is utter rubbish there are no positives to take from watching this except for the fact that you werent banging your head against a brick wall,cruel
maybe i expected too much about this movie because of having the tarantino name in it but lets face it there is no plot in the movie the movie is about boobies boobies oh how much fun blood blood blood no mind tricks no interesting arguments like shown in saw for example i think poor tarantino loose some card game bet with the director to produce that piece of shit the plot is so clear from the beginning that seeing the movie is uninteresting in every way the only horror part of the film is when you realize you paid for seeing that amount of  frames talking about a movie here is overrating it,cruel
i was positively salivating at the prospect of seeing ive heard megabuzz about it for months and the synopsis of a first half of t  a followed by a second half of proper horror  well this type of stuff just dont come along too often problem is im still waiting for it to come alongits ok the opening is bland fairly inane you dont give a stuff about any of the lads but i personally dont see that as too much of a negative when the intenser stuff starts all i can say is that you us of a boys who were fainting hurling and running out of screenings well youre a whole load of tarts its unpleasant and i wouldnt wish it on me or mine but it wasnt overly yukkyso a decent effort but overhyped  overrated,cruel
just because eli roth hit the jackpot with cabin fever doesnt mean hell do the same with this one what starts out very promisingly sadly just degenerates in to a disgusting display of blood guts and gore courtesy of special make up wizards at knb efxthe extra star is for the eastern european ladies who display their fine ample charms other than that gore hounds will be pleased everyone else will be disgusted its no cannibal ferox which initself is a masterpiece compared to this their are references to many other and better horror films in this most notably willows theme from the wicker mancrops up in a somewhat dance remix and the red raincoat scene from dont look now,cruel
listening to interviews with roth among others it seemed like this film would blow you away but alas it failed to deliverrather than just ramble on ill list my dislikes of the film 1 zvetlana should have got all her kit off  ok ok  ill start again1 the film was slightly disjointed for example when paxton is brought to the art show and is about to walk down the tunnel to see whats inside he is suddenly half was down the tunnel there are 10 rooms that are proceeding in torture yet we hear no screaming he then sees his friend being chopped up and is captured himself as he is being captured he is dragged past some torture rooms suddenly there is a mass of screaming  did it suddenly start when he was captured unlikely2 same scene as number one my complaint this time is that as he is being dragged past each room we cant see what is happening in the room it just looks like more blood and guts a slower drag would have done the trick3 paxton running around outside with the japanese girl as they attempt to escape i dont know whether its the camera angle its shot at but how the hell could the slovakian armed men not see them running about towards the car same at the train station 4 why did they have to kill zvetlana the best ending would have been paxton boarding the train with her them going off to live happily ever after and setting up their own  eamonn,cruel
just watched ok it was a bit nerve racking but not that scary the action all went to fast and i thought they spent to much time  at the front of the movie before the horror started dont get me wrong i enjoyed it but it didnt really scare me like the scene in reservoir dogs where they cut the coppers ear offwhen watching there was to much quick camera workjust didnt think it workedps as i come from england and been to europe quite a few times i have yet to see girls who throw them self at you  soon as u walk into a bar by god i have lookedanyway is there going to be a 2 that should be more scary and bloody dont you think,cruel
i saw when i hadnt enough money to do anything else on a recent trip to edinburgh ive never been more disappointed with a trip to the cinema ever this film has the worst most ludicrous attempt at a story line made all the more painful by the pss poor attempt to cover this with excessive nudity and explicit gore the first 25 minutes or so was like a cheap softcore porno which ultimately led into a tenuous link whereby people were seducedabducted and murdered in horrible ways good scary movies tend to have a slightly better script than this drivel this waste of film just went for all out gruesomeness in the place of any logical script utter utter smack do not go and see this movie,cruel
considering the high pedigree of screenplays that weve come to expect from quentin tarantino this film is an incredible letdownif i jumped out of a window once i wouldnt be a stuntman in the same sense as the five or ten minutes of violence in shouldnt make it a horror filmespecially when just as a chainsaw begins doing its job the camera cuts away to a unconvincing screaming facethe acting in this film is definitely second rate this appears to be confirmed when the majority of the film is second rate pornography its as if someone was thinking damn these guys cant actquick throw in some heavy sex scenes to distract everyone after seeing adverts that called the film the scariest american movie in a decade i was very excited especially when you consider how good saw was when it came outcould this film top saw in the horror stakes sadlynowhat could have been a brilliant film has been reduced to a low budget low horror low quality soft porn flick thats about as scary as an angry badger,cruel
i saw cabin fever i hated it i went to see not knowing it was an eli roth film and the second that i saw his name on the screen i knew it would be bad i didnt know it was worse than cabin fever save for the eyesnipping scene most of the horrible parts were shown in the trailer the plot points were so ridiculously weak and illconceived there was little driving force to the film just lots of horrible drawnout parts that replaced substance with nudity seriously when a film has to distract me from its plot with naked chicks its pretty bad and i have seen many many horror films i know that sex and nudity are very common however this movie wasnt trying to be a bad horror film as in so bad its good and if it was it missed by a long shot it was meant to be seriously disturbing but i kept finding that instead of being led down the dark path breasts were thrown in my face to confuse me or throw me off meaning to be a disruption to the tension but only served as a cheap ploy to show more mindless nudity ok after the nudity which by the way would have been just fine had the rest of the film been worthwhile at all i cant think of anything more predictable than the outline for this movie of who is going to die nextwhen is that personplot point going to resurface at just the right moment i could make out basically every connection that does not build a suspenseful film other than the suspense built by the hope that the movie would somehow magically get better additionally the driving force behind this concept was just idiotic i liked how it sounded in the trailer but once i learned of the whole scheme where an entire nation was supporting this gruesomeness i had to laugh and stop myself from getting sick all over the person next to me not because i was horrified by the gore but because i was horrified that eli roth was allowed to make another one of his movies and that i was lured in by the quentin tarantino presents tag which has now made me lose respect for tarantino because he helped finance this atrocityif you are looking for suspense horror and mystery of any sort do yourself a favour and rent something else this film was so unimpressive that i can barely remember the scary elements after only a few months,cruel
this was the most boring film i have seen in along time there was nothing disturbing about itit took to long to get started and didnt keep me entertained at all i was very disappointed as the trailer for this film made it seem like the film was a complete gore fest but in fact there was nothing interesting about this film it was a waste of money to see it and i would not recommend it to anyone in fact i would go as far to say that the film could do with a complete face lift and a new script this film just seemed like a cheap euse for a porno and there was no plot the only good part was when josh was finally killed as he wouldnt shut up,cruel
went to see on saturday with my girlfriend neither of us were bothered by the n nudity that seems to be upsetting a lot of people what we were bothered about was the fact that it was so bad the sentence i uttered at the end was the same exact sentence i uttered at the end of cabin fever what was the point of that the first half does drag on a little bit but it was far more enjoyable than the ridiculousness of the second half i imagined that the first half was supposedly grounding us in the characters so that the later scenes were more emotive but we really learnt nothing about them they easily couldve been lifted from any teen road movie there were some yuck moments but the idea of what was being done was far stronger than the dodgy effects they employed badly plotted if you can say there was a plot poorly written directed and acted what tarantino wants to put his name on this for i dont know and why miike takeshi was willing to be in it too surprised me this film really wants to be shocking and confrontational but fails on every level the trailer and press on this film is misleading its just crap very much one to avoid,cruel
one more time this is a film that lives of the advertising the appearance of tarantino is just for show and he should be ashamed to participate in a movie like this in the reality it is not nothing of special with a lot of blood but with specialeffects that sincerely had not convinced me at all with some funny moments good babes the remaining portion is idiotic and stupid history until has its joke but it sins very strong in its concretization i hope that the americans do not come to the europe thinking that is everything like the movie very hot babes always ready for the free party and drugs go and have a disillusion and in the alive end the total coincidences its just too much,cruel
just seen the film and i cant see how i was supposed to enjoy it its just gore porn gruesome scenes for the sake of it but dont make an assumption about meim not offended by violence and can happily sit through the video nasties of the past couple of decades just as long as they are good films but this film had few redeeming features about it yeah it was shot and edited competently but take out the pointless gore and the tarantino badge slapped across it and what is left not a lot if this is what is left of tarantinos creativity then please tarantinocash your millions in and retire there are many other talented people out there who would use an opportunity like this to showcase a thoughtful well constructed piece of cinematography not this poor excuse of a film that rakes money in from a pointless gimmick,cruel
i saw this movie today and was quite surprised of its brutalityi havent seen anything like that since saw movieim big fan of horror movies and this one roused my curiositywhat struck me most was a brutalsickbloody scene when this humpbacked cageork was throwing human parts into incineratorit was so nasty and disgusting that id barely hold myself from throwing upfor me it seems that negative sides of this movie overweights positive sides i find the plot quite interesting and designingthree guys traveling around the europe seeking for nice chicksplot unfolds steadily and until the halfway we dont see any gore actionsit seems like roth prepared the surprise for the endthe main feature of this movie is not to scare you but to make you feel sick of watching so brutal and disgusting scenesfor me this movie is not so scary but brutalsickand bloodyespecially when it comes to the torture scenesas for its negative sides there are plenty of themthe main flaw is the realism of this moviewhere the hell did you see a whole town involved into such kinda businesswhy didnt the authorities know about this townor roth supposes that the whole slovakia is corrupted and there is no law in this country and their state exists only by the income of this animal businesshow could be nowadays such a big town not indicated on the mapall this seems pretty far from realityanother problem of is that it doesnt correspond the realitythe main mistake that hollywood directors make while shooting a movie about soviet countries is that they dont rely on real atmosphere that takes place in that country but make up an image that they got in usa about soviet countriesin fact this image has nothing to do with what really happens in such countriesand when people from soviet countries watching hollywood movies portraying the life in their countries in absolute different way they just get angry on usa for turning the real facts into fake onesame story with this moviesvetlana and natasha are 100 russian names so why did roth use them to introduce slovakian gilswhy he couldnt come up with native namesanother scene that struck me is the car sceneim not living in slovakia but i doubt that in modern slovakia you can find soviet cars like volga and moskwitchanother question that stuck in my head is about the surviverwhy didnt he after watching and witnessing such an awful scenes just get his ass as quick as possible from this placeif he was so horrified and shocked why did he turn back to save an absolutely unknown for him girl and how could those gangsters standing near the cars didnt notice him getting into volgain my opinion any normal human having a chance to escape from this hell wouldnt come back but d use it to get out of this place as fast as possibleall doubts and questions that come up after watching make me thing of some weaknesses dismissed by the directori wouldnt say that its not worth watching but because of these flaws i cannot say this movie is a great horror moviefor those who likes gore and brutality this movie is worth watching but if you are to sensitive for blood you better leave this one out,cruel
not hard to see what genre this film fits into pointless titillating gratuitous violence targeted at the late male teenagerif the point of this film was to shock it certainly did that shocking bad storyshocking bad acting and shocking bad stereotyping of both european and american touristsif i was near an exit i would have leftstoryline was very explicit if you like to see some not too imaginative but graphic torture clips mixed with some gratuitous sex scenes then this is the film for youcharacters were very poorly developed and in the end you dont really care if they survive or notin fact for some of the characters you were glad that their screen time was cut short to save you from some truly cringe inducing acting,cruel
well personally in my humble opinion this film could have been produced on your local farm and the animals used as the acting casthowever i do see how certain viewers who just like bad acting a few scenes of gore and mild pornography could like this pictureactually waitnoi really cant see how anyone who has ever watched a decent film or possesses any form of imagination would rate this movie anything more than a 3the dialogue is too clich the acting poor and honestly the so called sceens of gore have been found wanting in many areas if you are a fan of the film beyond the limits then you may be able to bear this amalgamation of visual sleeping pills coupled with some of the poorest acting youve ever seen these low budget films if they are to stand out needs a good plot which this particular film lacks entirelymy advice is to watch this flick in order to protect yourself from overhiped films like this in the future however if you have to choose between watching this film and doing the dishes to please someone in your familytrust methis flick can wait,cruel
wellif youve heard all the comments and gossips and trailers on this movie youd be just like i was absolutely eager to see itthe whole publicity stunts quentin tarantino as the producer and supporterthe thing is ive seen movies that are much better than this one it fails to deliver effective mesmerizing horror and most part of it its just about 2 drunkass american guys trying to score chicks thats not what i had in mind when i bought my ticket ive spent the whole movie waiting wishing begging for some damn horror but when it finally comes to that part yes ive said part as in  its not all horror it has comedy in it too  all i can say is this isnt enough what happens there youll know if you go see the movie could be resumed to a pair of sentences best movie in decades what the hell if this is the best we can get ill just stay at home and watch tv its disappointing to many many levelsnote to quentin youre better than this dont support movies like this one just to help someone it has its moments but thats about 2 or 3 scenes of barely average horrorif youre a true horror fan youll be disappointed if not youll poke your eyes out and think this is the best horror movie youve ever watched but then youll be wrong its not and if you do think it was then you just dont know horrormy rating 310  not enough to even make me feel nervous ,cruel
i saw it and i miss this hour and a half what the f was this just a joke with almost every horror movie which was produced that year im becoming more and more disappointed from the american directors first of all  why the east european countries should be the place for the garbage of the world first euro trip and then present them as a place where the girlswomen are whores you dont need money and the only thing which american citizen can look for there is crazy vulgar and wicked sex furthermore the children are a potential terrorists they are ready to kill for a cigarettecan you imagine what will happen when they are 15 orormy hands are shakingor18 oh my god the world is going to disappear is a movie which is nothing more then an farbelowtheaveragelevel horror movie the movie gives nothing new to the audience just another poor story of a crazy psychoguy who loves to kill dont watch it,cruel
quentin tarantinowhat the hell were you thinking when you agreed to attach your name to this moviedid you get a substantial amount of money for it the movie is a combination of american pie road movie eurotrip and saw and im telling you that aint a good combo being from amsterdam i was offended about the way we were portrayedall the men in holland and in slowakia were terribly ugly and retarded and all the chicks had silicone boobs and wanted to have sex all the time and walk around topless the marketing of this moviehas to be saidis the most cunning in ageswith the quentin tarantino presentok the sadomasochistic elements are typical quentin but the rest a like the most dumb teener slash horror movie everdont spend your money on this,cruel
it is incredible that this kind of movies can be done everything and i mean everything is ruined by the lack of a minimum knowledge about eurpe and eurpeans spoilersapparently dth people talk in german apparently dth girls are like whores apparently in slvakia you can find girls and casinos its our own las vegs apparently the director must be one of the most ignorants directors in the world but he doesnt know it if you ignore these things then youll have like 15 minutes of a gore movie trying to imitate you know who style serve yourself,cruel
this movie is total crap theres really no good thing to say about this but what else can you expect from hollywood horror if i see elis lineup of movies hes involved with then i can not believe to find a supreme movie like donnie darko in there and what the hell has tarantino to do with this crap big disappointment now about the story right from the beginning the main characters are as annoying as can be and totally not get any interesting sentence out of their pubic faces you just cant wait for them to get brutally killed so the shocking is more like a relief most scenes are sooooo unlikely to ever happen that you cant even talk about story most is based on coincidence nothing makes you feel with any of the characters and of course the sudden soundrush has to do it again like with the kids stealing the nerds cellphone what an old trick eli now about the ending the only survivor gets his chance for revenge actually another most unlikely part of the story he cuts off two fingers of one of the psychos  wow thats it plain stupid crap to see some kickass movies better watch something like dawn of the dead 2004 you might have a very good laugh ,cruel
probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen very bad acting and a script that looks like to been written by a loner who never has been out of his state or country amsterdam is as you should believe the movie a hellhole where everybody smokes dope and speaks germanhahahahaha the name for hotel in dutch is hotel so why theres a sign outside an amsterdam street that says i dunno  and really after seen all that crap i realized it was a waste of time to look a second more to this dumb and very amateuristic made thing u might ask yourself who in the hell produces a z movie like this send the scriptwriter and the director to europe for a year or 5 so they really know what they are talking about is an attack on peoples intelligence,cruel
i hadnt seen a horror film at the movies for a few years and eagerly went with my wife to check out wow what a let down i left the cinema still not having seen a horror movie occasionally funny sometimes gory but never suspenseful the premise was fine the acting ok the movie well made but it was just boring very matter of fact we knew what was going to happen to the victims just not howi have not seen roths other work however i have heard much about it i wont be rushing to the video store to check it out after this effort if you want something a little unsettling and fresh check out house of a 1000 corpses insteadif i had seen this movie when i was 15 or 16 i probably would have loved it boobs bums and blood what more could i ask for but i am no longer 15,cruel
as former reviewer said this is complete waste of time money and good mood its a movie about worst of deviations pathology and aberration and i swear that it is not scary it is simply disgusting noxious and awful you wont be afraid much while watching it you wont be enjoying it too if you are ordinary not sick guy i warn you after watching this you will most surely confirm my words and youll regret that you wanted to check by yourself if im right as former reviewer said this is complete waste of time money and good mood its a movie about worst of deviations pathology and aberration and i swear that it is not scary it is simply disgusting noxious and awful you wont be afraid much while watching it you wont be enjoying it too if you are ordinary not sick guy i warn you after watching this you will most surely confirm my words and youll regret that you wanted to check by yourself if im right as former reviewer said this is complete waste of time money and good mood its a movie about worst of deviations pathology and aberration and i swear that it is not scary it is simply disgusting noxious and awful you wont be afraid much while watching it you wont be enjoying it too if you are ordinary not sick guy i warn you after watching this you will most surely confirm my words and youll regret that you wanted to check by yourself if im right,cruel
well what can i say i mean this movie left me shaking my head with disappointment poor story poor acting poor editing poor twist  just when i thought lionsgate had redeemed themselves for a fantastic award winning production crash i was reminded about previously released industry atrocities such as open water  saw 1  2 this film does for eastern european tourism what rats did for the black death gave it a bad reputation not that i am from eastern europe but still i can see floods of american kids going to europe looking for hot assed euro chicks dude ok confession timei gotta admit i speak several languages including dutch  german which where laughable bad in this  i know that the average person would miss that fact but you just need 1 person who does know what he is talking about  i know it will take millions worldwide sales but i just get so tired of seeing things rammed down my throatlike  the most horrifying horror movie ever   it will scare you out of your cinema seat come on lionsgate after making something so breathtaking like crash stop making kiddie movies  pumping 100 million bucks into advertising or if you need to keep doing this make something worth while a jaws or exosist for example but i think it is wasted breath business is business  millions of dollars world wide speaks louder then whispers of admiration from great people worldwide in a nut shell could be worse i guess if you do watch it dont expect much  if your a horney american teenager stay away from eastern european hostals with half naked euro trash girls hang around doing nothing but flirting with americans boysbecause this happens all the time really  is based on a true story oh yes its so real now if you will excuse me i have to go take the tooth fairy to the dentist now coming to a theater near you this summer it will scare her out of her little wings  theater seat aa,cruel
ive just watched and i am very very disappointed the concept has potential but the result is so poor not a single character is developed the plot has almost an hour of unuseful premises the kidnappingtorturekilling business could have been made plausibile but it has not and it looks like a public fair without any need to keep it hidden from any possible investigations the whole context is totally unrealistic finally the end is very predictable and banal as regards the core of the movie the torture scenes are not disturbing as you would expect from a movie like this last week i have seen syriana there is a single torture scene which is enormously more effective than all the gore if takeshi miike and quentin tarantino are eli roths torturescenes masters well he hasnt learned the lesson,cruel
reading all that hype around this movie i have realized that i shouldnt miss it well but i am at little bit different position than average spectator from usa this film was shot at my homecountry czech republic many places and actors that appeared in movie are wellknown to me so when i was watching it i had a feeling that i am watching some kind of freaky parody czech locations was presented as slovakian and many things said in movie was really odd and ripped off the reality for example there arent much men in slovakia after that war heh last war on slovakian territory was the second ww prague locations are shown as bratislava etc nevertheless its really good horror movie and i should recommend it to every horror fan but dont take this movie seriously,cruel
i go and see most horror films that make their way to the australian mainstream cinema and so far wolf creek is hands down the best one ever insert hometown pride here but has made it to my list of top ten for no other reason than it left me feeling queasy for hours afterwards which to me is the mark of a good goreslasherhorrorthriller or whatever you want to call iti unfortunately saw cabin fever and actually asked for and received my money back at the cinemas but roth redeemed himself in my eyes with this film simply by giving me another place on my list of travels to never go toi cant review without spoiling so all i can say is go and see it before you give an opinion and dont go if you have a weak stomach or dont appreciate horror movies for what they are horrible,cruel
two friends paxton and josh are backpacking across the european country in paris they join with icelandic traveler oli now the trio are resting in amsterdam these three have one focus drugs and sex with t  a filling every scene possible you could call them misogynistic but they are just acting out what basically every backpacker does while at the in amsterdam they receive a tip on a in the town bratislava in slovakia beautiful women and drugs await them in this place of paradise hitting with the local women at the the three cant believe their luck the following day oli disappears no indication of his whereabouts soon josh disappears with paxton revealing a dark spot in this town held in a dilapidated factory people can pay to fill their wildest more to the point disturbing fantasy to torture and kill people preying on the tourist that flow throughunashamedly we are thrown into this dark disturbingly sick world by eli roth the torture unleashed upon the victims are slow and painful through such emotional primal screams that fill the halls of the factory violence and disturbing images have always been apart of horror with directors pushing the limits as time has moved forward though it has been moving slowly into the main stream market while the violence is raised the film loses that psychological edge where subliminal violence greatly enhanced that psychological mind set eli roths previous film cabin fever worked on the psychological tension using subtlety and unknown elements that never reveal themselves which worked much better than just being served everything up front it takes the mystery awaylacks a lot of suspension and builds no real tension the town bratislava has so many small streets and tightly close together builds yet it doesnt feel suffocating nor any ominous mood the tension only rises during the torture scenes perfectly joined by the dark and grungy rooms with endless tool of painwhile the suspension does lack there is an element that eli roth does tap into with there is a reason why these people spend so much money on the pain of their unwilling victims the primal entity that resides in all people that adrenalin that shows through the tortures eyes showing the pure ecstasy what made this element hard hitting is the one conversation that procured it from a man about to take part of this fetish while this does say is based on actual event though it isnt it does provide much food for thought constantly thinking that this may actually happeneli roth has craftily created this disturbing place while his script does fall in a lot of the dialog the situation is made disturbingly the acting doesnt give us much empathy jay hernandez gives an average performance though shows great arrogance in paxton in the early scenes derek richardson shows the best of all the actors though by no means great eythor gudjonsson is wonderfully irritating as oli giving much relief when hes picked off earlydoes has its disturbing moments and takes a disturbing look at humanities darker side snuffing people off for an adrenalin rush like no other relies to heavily on the confronting violence and lacks a lot of suspension cutting itself short for a great horror film,cruel
if you couldnt hold your lunch after watching saw will be far worse but its also far worse than saw from a plot and horror perspectivetells the story of two americans and one european paxton josh and oli who are traveling through europe drinking partying and sleeping with as many girls as they can they are the stereotypical characters paxton is the alpha male leader josh is the shy sensitive one oli is the big honest fella in amsterdam tired of all the tourists and the sex for sale they meet young alex who tells them of a country thats full of young women without any virile young men and theyre all beautiful and looking for americansoff they go to what looks like paradise a posh hotel with young peers and theyre even forced to room with two gorgeous and sexy women natalyz svetlanaof course this is when heaven turns to tell and their goes from bondage to tortureif we had more empathy for the main characters wed care for them during their struggles but instead its only the gore that we care for and enjoy,cruel
one of my favorite horror films of 2003 was cabin fever so no doubt i was a little psyched for eli roths return to film i also found it the unmatchable cinematic god quentin tarantino was producing so i was all the more psyched when i finally saw it i was a little letdown but not by much it isnt as genius as cabin fever but it does garner some hilarious yet sick quips and some bloody awesome sequences of carnage it isnt as violent as they say and i suspect they had to cut a sht load of the violence out to escape the dreaded kissofdeath nc17 rating is nothing brilliant but it is one of the better horrorslasher flicks in recent years i recommend it grade b screened at amc deer valley 30 11305,cruel
this movie is definitely an experience for anyone the reason i only gave it 5 stars is because the constant softcore porn scenes yes it fits the storyline nicelybut otherwise i didnt think it was necessaryon another note if your friends are telling you this movie is going to be crap you should definitely put some knowledge in their heads to let them know these types of things happen and are not just thought up in some directors head it would definitely make people think differently you cant really expect much more in a movie like this more blood no more nudity hell nobefore you listen to other people think about itdo you believe these types of things have happened if you say yes you have no reason to complain about the movie besides it not being your taste,cruel
well in a word interesting in a sentence not entirely good and not entirely badit was nothing like i expected it to be mostly because the preview didnt show anything other than scenes of people being tortured basically i expected to sit through a movie entirely composed of disturbing events the first scene of the movie however was in amsterdam and involved lots of drugs and sex i was puzzled but found it all amusing so i didnt care thats how the movie continued for about 45 minutes lots of drugs and as many tits as one sees in a pornstill i found the movie funny so i didnt mind then of course people finally start getting tortured you dont see a lot of it though and the only thing that really disturbed me ive actually seen in other movies before so nothing new nothing special i didnt really care about any of the characters until pax jay hernandez put a suit on suddenly i was invested its strange how a nice black suit can make the most boring of people suddenly attractive and badassthe movie was also really short i couldnt believe how fast it went by but being that there were only three main characters and a plot that really only belongs in a short story i can forgive that the movie would have really reeked something awful if theyd tried to carry it any longerall in all good movie ill probably buy it on dvd but i wont be seeing it in the theatres again ls,cruel
i caught this one on a whim and a few spare hours between shifts at worki could have chosen betterfrom the random bits of hype id read or heard i gathered the film would have some dark underground edge to it guess i gathered wrong a step up from cabin fever yes still full of oh cmons like when these three boneheads ingest unknown chemicals at a nightclub at the behest of these two bimbos theyve barely met pun intended or when our hero blithely runs down three of his antagonists in an audience paroxysm of righteous retribution including backing up to finish off the one he somehow didnt kill outright and manages to get away scot freeits not nearly as frightening as it could have been because theres little sympathy built for the three ostensible protagonists they pretty much blunder drunkenly into the web of torture awaiting them without ever having revealed much in the way of a redeeming traitstill they dont deserve what they get do they well maybe not but at any rate the cinematography is very good the acting gets better as the film moves along and theres plenty of gore for the splatterhound if the storytelling had been more artfully crafted i might have given this a better rating this one just played like a bad fairy tale,cruel
eli roth called this film his masterpiece a dark disturbing gritty take on modern horror unfortunately he somehow forgot he was making a horror movie and instead made a movie that is more like road trip meets an action movie with some dark horror synthesizers and a little gore thrown instrangely this movie is paced almost identically as wolf creek which came out about 2 weeks before this the first 40 minutes pretty much nothing happens okay there is tons of nudity and drugs but all that got old i think roth watched a few too many 80s bhorror movies and was like oh there are boobs in these well let me put six times that amount in my film however he forgot that in most of these films the nudity added to the adolescent feel and humor of the movie in this case this is one of the biggest problems with is not funny it is not scary it is not gory it is not wellpaced it is pretty much nothinganyway after the first 40 minutes there are a few lame gore set pieces thrown in and the movie turns into a ridiculous action movie after a few minutes this got annoying pretty quickly as action movies are known for totally unbelievable character situations and elements of revenge well you get all that here and its all pretty lameroth seems intent on making a masterpiece by design by taking his influences and somehow raping them and turning them into a mess of alienation by having so much language spoken in this film without any subtitles whatsoever the viewer quickly becomes angry that was probably roths point and by promising this gritty dark horror film and instead delivering a druggy sex action movie with a couple lame gore pieces the horror fan quickly learns to despise the filmisnt a bad film in fact its very entertaining the first time through the revenge elements and the kid street gang and random stuff like that is actually pretty interesting to watch but upon repeated viewings you realize this film is actually pretty stupid roth seems like the type of guy who i would love to talk about horror films with but he seems completely incapable of realizing his vision people can blame the studios messing with his film or the mpaa or whatever but it seems that roth basically screwed up his own movie by having such stupid pacing the first 40 minutes of a film not devoted to any horror whatsoever would usually typically mean that we have plenty of time to get to know the characters in the least something major could have happened that would have been important later nope you could have taken the first 40 minutes chopped it into 2 minutes and you would have had the same film pretty much a waste of celluloidsadly enough this is probably one of the best nuhorror films out there and its about a hundred times better than cabin fever so yeah roth has failed to impress me yet again but hes getting better and at least he is trying to do something different even if he is failing at it sometimes failures can be just as interesting as successes,cruel
im not sure now what i was expecting the first time i walked into the theater to see but i know it didnt deliver i think i was expecting to be sickened until i puked or so disturbed id never set foot in a theater again but those are unrealistic expectations in this day and age of media overload and desensitizationwhat i did end up seeing was one of the best adventure movies i have seen in years vin diesel eat you heart out paxton ended up being the best american action hero since indiana jonesnow ive got to get busy writing nasty reviews of every horror film that is based on rural farmland and misrepresents those of us that choose to dwell in such areas im going to be a busy man,cruel
it wasnt particularly my favorite ive seen euro trip and ive seen saw the concept was over done roth should have held back a little used lighting and good camera work to show the audience fear and he did the scene in which our so called hero was drug to his would be death chamber passing other victims was absolutely the most brilliant horror moment of this film though i must say it reminded me an awful lot of the opening of irreversable problems i have with the movie only one really i didnt expect a masterpiece even though i already now it had miike and tarantinos seal of approvalasian eyeball scenegrowl closeups of unrealistic overdone poorly lit makeup the only time in the whole world i would ever say that the asian girl scene should have gone to the editing room floor the raw disturbing vibe of the film was great it was fun kind of cheesy and loose at points side characters even reappeared as you see mostly in comedies which was different for a horror but sheer creepy and disturbing at others very well balanced almost teen horror but too intense to be catagorized as that up until that point where he ehem our so called hero goes back to rescue a one dimensional asian girl character who i guess was thrown back into the plot because without that scene the film wouldnt have been long enough to show in theatres the establishing shot of the rescue was great a well lit man ramming a blowtorch in the girls eye and her out of view in black in the backgroundthat was great but closeup to where ovbiously its fake skin over the eye and her walking around in public like the elephant man then plunging in front of a train for the sheer reason just to have yet another cheesy blood splatter effect on background characters was poorly written and just plain bad taste and not the fun peter jackson bad taste either but im planning on buying the film and checking out eli roths other work like cabin fever he seems to show promise and the fact that takashi miike is in the film well if you dont know who miike is or what type of films he makes check some out i highly recommend them then you may see why roths film has a certain vibe to it even though i barely enjoyed the film i am planning on buying the dvd because the master of asian horror miike cameos in the film,cruel
directorscript eli roth cast jay hernadez paxton derek richardson josh eythor gudjonsson oli barbara nedeljakova natalya jana kaderabkova svetlana jan vlasak dutch businessmanwhen i went to see this movie i honestly did not think i was going to be able to make it through the characters are so unlikeable and arrogant its no wonder half the world hates us americans they were such a bunch of loudmouthed jerks i was hopping they would all get cut up however watching the film to the end i can see why the director choose to depict the characters that way the horror in this film really sets off in the second half when they end up at the torture chamber in that hell hole of a village in slovakia really the only jerk in the movie was the paxton character however one develops respect for him by the end of the film and are actually glad that he survives when his friends start to disappear oli being the first we can see that he truly does care for his friends when he finally escapes from that dreadful place of torture he is able to find a car that by chance has the keys still in the ignition he could easily have left but he risks his life and getting tortured again by those sadistic freaks to save that japanese girl when he hears her screaming knowing she is getting torturedby having this film start out as a typical teen sex movie and gradually regress into extreme horror these people are not so arrogant anymore but fearful beyond anyones imagination it is probably well known by now that eli roth was inspired to make this film based on a thai web site that advertised the torture of humans for a price that was shown to him by quentin tarantino the web site was probably a hoax but who knows maybe their is such a place in this world their is certainly enough sick fks in this world to support such a place roth did a very outstanding job of making the events in this film seem real i must admit that i felt rather unsettled after leaving the cinema this is without a doubt a more intense horror than is normally shown in theaters when this comes out in its uncut form on dvd it might be an nc17 i thought the theatrical version was close the character of natalya was quite the evil bitch barbara nedeljakova did a great job portraying her i agree with another commenter that described her as the ultimate femme fatal it will be interesting to see if see gets cast in other films,cruel
this movie is visually jarring and in many ways disturbing at the same time it probably points to a truth that similar hunting operations do exist in some odd pockets of this world for the ultrawealthy so i dont consider this horror story pure fiction it has a share of nudity mainly women why not also some of the men but the nudity is not really gratuitous because it adds to the plot line that is the main problem with this movie thoughthere is a very thin plot here basically you know the plot from the advertising and there is no character development no strange twists or turns relatively speaking no revelations epiphaniesnot even the seeds of a sequel i think amsterdam gets a slap in the face as only a place for sex and soft drugsamsterdam is a lovely city to visit has a great deal of culture and is a place to experience just for the free attitude of its inhabitants i thought it interesting that this movie was set in slovakiakind of hearkens back to the frankenstein dracula horror moviesperhaps the movie is stereotyping that part of the world too the guts and gore are not as bad as i heard but they are still not for the faint of heart this movie would most appeal to teenage boys i think this movie is not a salo which had a plot and some artistry to it despite it being as disturbing as more on the order of a caligula i went to see it out of curiosity wouldnt see it again,cruel
as a horror movie i would say its tame as a disturbing pschychological warped inhumane and totally crazy movie i give it one finger and a thumbs up the finger because humans are freaking sick and the thumbs up because of the beautiful russian babies in it oh god the humanity it was a little slow in some parts but i forgive eli again the best part is the the girlie girls but i was thrown for a loop when i learned the what was really going on most people are so uptight they need to see movies like this because it plays with your sanity damn i have to go to amsterdam whether or not this does well does not matter im sick and tired of the big budget movies that play with just your eyes and ears the mind is the biggest piece to screw with and to leave a theatre after watching a movie like this and say what the fk was that i say lets make more,cruel
im from slovakia i think the whole movie is a kind of reflection of peoples worst expectations of unknown parts of europe today and thats very cool i think especially for a horror fan usually most of movies about europe are made in or around prague they say its like many other places in europe they decided to capture it in some czech city as says speaking czech voice at the train station or czech titles on the walls as for me it would be difficult to set such a story in real bratislava because it would not match to the script because of the size and i think it would be hard to make of it such a terrifying place today everybody knows that name which is a picture of entertaining violent and intellectual work mr tarantino and his movie led me to a particular question where is the story set those who have seen the film will more likely uncover the background of the location after seeing some website containing panorama views from the city,cruel
although i found this movie original and i appreciate the revival of horror films with the essential sex nudity and violence i grew accustomed to with the great horror classics of the seventies and eighties this film was a disappointment to me as welli think my biggest disappointment was that there wasnt a single main character i found the least bit likabletrue i felt a little guilty to watch such senseless and cold violence but i felt guiltier that i didnt really care and i was even relieved at times when the supposedly good guys in the movie met their grisly fateit also bothers me that the most annoying character of all is the only one who makes it out albeit semiintacti admit that one of the main reasons i went to this movie was that tarantinos name was associated with it but only as a producer this movie bears nothing in common with any other tarantino directed or written movies ive ever seen i would never have guessed he had a thing to do with its production had his name not been in the credits and advertising for this filmon the plus side the locations for this movie are spectacular and eerie i confess too that it rekindled my lust to travelthe most realistic aspects of this movie are that there really are people out there that evil and sadistic no need for made up monsters in film except that they are much funner the other is that people from the united states are probably the most hated people on earth right now for reasons that should be obvious to all but those in the worst state of denialill probably watch this movie again on a pay subscription service or on dvd with a curious friend but i will never rave about it or consider it a classici will always be a little embarrassed and annoyed at myself for liking it at all,cruel
i knew i shouldnt have gone to see this movie i saw it a week ago and still have a hard time getting some images and sounds out of my head it was the mention of tarantino that was advertised on commercials that made me decide to go i really didnt research the movie much as it was a date movie and i wasnt paying for the ticketif you want a good old fashioned very freaky and gory horror movie this is for you has a vaguely interesting storyline although i cant say that id put too much deep meaning into it also the setting is intriguing but as one other review said this is a very common general formula for a thrillerhorror movie i did see quite a few holes in the plot which seemed very obvious to me but my date didnt notice at all to say the least i dont think this is a meticulously made movie i prefer movies that are actually directed by tarantino i find that they have a sense of humor even in their violence and they are put together seamlessly in contrast i feel that is humorless and has gaping holes in the plotto me this was certainly not a great movie at best its just another horror movie and possibly this is even a film that somehow wakes our alltoohuman tendencies toward sociopathic violence although had my adrenaline flowing heavy i think in the future i will just take a good trailrun to get my adrenaline flowing in a pleasant peaceful and productive way and ill just wait for the next real tarantino flick,cruel
i dont get why everyone made such a big fuss over this movie from reading all the posts on here i expected the worst movie ever made its not a porno the nudity is no worse than your average road trip or american pie the violence is nothing new and mainly offscreen although it is gorier than saw although thats not saying much there is vomiting for those of you that dont like that kind of stuff but even that isnt too bad if youve seen high tension unrated than this is a walk in the park its not as bad a movie as people make it seem i think they were just expecting something great because qts name was on it although im not a fan of qt people should just enjoy it as a horror flick it couldve been scarier more intense and had a better story the trailer is much much betterspoiler i didnt really care much for the main character getting revenge yes if i was in his situation id feel the same way but the movie didnt make me feel his anger although it is satisfying to see the torturers put in the victims place breakdown does this much betterend spoiler there are many much worse horror films out there there are lots of better ones too i can see how one would be disturbed and horrified by the subject matter for its obviously not very light the scenery of the basement is darkly reminiscent of session 9 some images could haunt some viewers dreams if dwelled upon at night particularly a shot where paxton walks past several doors with people getting tortured really though youll probably forget about this movie after you watch it but its not a waste of time torture barely takes up much screen time at all maybe less than 2 minutes if it wanted to be more disturbing it shouldve placed the viewer in the torture chair and shouldve been relentless instead of a quick 1 minute clip and then the torture is over with most of it not shown real life is much worse than this,cruel
dont let the trailers totally mislead you this film is very suspenseful and frightening heightened by the fact that its based on actual events where it is flawed however is in the prolonged time wasted on the hedonist lifestyle of these travelers in europe i know the film makers pour on the t  a to entice a certain demographic but i feel real horror fans would rather if the film had to lean one way or the other lean toward time spent on the horrific instead of drug use and sex wait a minuteyou can stop throwing rocks at the computer now some decadence is good but keep the film true to its genre bottom linethe film finally hits the mark and is definitely worth the cost of a matinee ticket im positive i know the folks who will hate this film the most its the tourism boards of any eastern european country whose name ends in solvakia or istan no offense meant butthat area is just plain creepy creepy people with creepy habits creepy places and creepy forms of entertainment see for yourself but bring some bandaids youll definitely feel the urge to use one or two,cruel
the movie was good i cant get the images out of my head but it was not all that is was hyped up to be imo there was far too much porn the first half should be rated xi expected a little more gore because of all the commercials but it had enough special effects to make me squint and say oeehhhww like nick in 10mm i thought it had a great plotunless your a yuppie on the bashwagon how can i go on for ten lines without making a spoiler i am going to see underworld evolution tonight i think that movie will get a 10 thanks for reading my crap overalli recommend itif you you dont bring a date,cruel
wearing the chevron of quentin tarantino eli roth has created one of the first gorefilled horror films to hit mainstream theatres in recent memory the latest film from the writerdirector of cabin fever 2002 has an advertising campaign that makes it come across as a filmed abattoir on steroidsfor those who have asked ive summarized as follows 1 take the most gorefilled painfilled dismembermentfilled scene you can remember that makes you flinch just by thinking about it i for instance use that 5 minute scene from the end of the disappointing audition 1995 now repeat that for about 40 minutes2 now take an hour of american pie 1999 and drop it in the front in hindsight i probably should have told everyone to take eurotrip 2004 insteadwas an intensely gory film which was poorly written very very poorly acted and ultimately only moderately executedin fairness the premise was actually superb i dont want to give too much away but the premise was reasonably believable and while not an entirely novel concept it was given a fresh spinhowever the story was structured in the worst possible way the first hour was nothing more than pointless nudity and i dont even mean entertaining i just mean utterly boring and cheap humor sitting through the first half was tedious and had us wondering are we in the right film this is the great horror film thats been hyped the film then takes a drastic right turn and delves headfirst into gore explicit gore and lots of it for about 40 minutesi can only assume that when writing the film roth tried to go for maximum contrast really funny and lighthearted and then wham what the hell is happening the failure lies in both the pacing of the first half insufferably long light on suspense total lack of atmostphere and the horribly written characters in many horror films the protagonists are annoying and youre just waiting for the big bad to kill them here theyre so annoying that you just get bored waiting for it to happenthe gore however is delightfully extreme if youre into that sort of thing lots of puncturing slicing laceration dismemberment good times for those who enjoy but that make it a good horror film no no it doesnta good gore scene will make the average person wince 20 gore scenes in succession just kind of dulls the senses if not used tastefully see saw 2 2005 gore for gores sake just becomes another load of special effectson the bright side the gore miraculously managed to escape an nc17 for reasons that ill never understand with the more liberal r rating and a limited release will likely be considered a commercial success this is good for two reasons 1 maybe 2 will be to what saw 2 was to saw a dramatic improvement in writing and ambiance that greatly enhances the rewatching of the original2 a commercial success for could conceivably drive the industry away from these atrocious pg13 teeny slasher flicks and back towards some more serious disturbing dark material look i dont care what you did last summer and quite frankly i likely never willdo i recommend not really if gore really does it for you have at it otherwise just watch american pie and the first 20 minutes of saving private ryan 1998,cruel
from all the interviews ive watched and read from eli roth and quentin tarrantino they both appear to be bright and well adjusted nothing i have read from either one of them could have prepared me for the unrelenting homophobia and misogyny of their film it has often been said that horror films really need a female protagonist to work the movie appears to subvert that convention by appearing to be about an extremely sensitive young man perhaps even a closeted one on a trip through europe the standard horror film treatment of this topic would be that he would have to shed his more feminine attributes to survive and in the process would develop more selfknowledge instead we are treated to an abrupt shift in protagonist halfway through the film no sympathetic characters an incredibly xenophobic tour of europe female characters who are at best whores and at worst murderous sadistic whores and a man who we are led to believe is a homosexual being drowned in a toilet filled with his own excrement the one character we could have sympathized with is killed and the one we are left with is impossible to momentarily like his late conversion from boor to hero is singularly unconvincing the film is so busy subverting horror film tropes that it ceases to be one and is instead a glorified snuff film and not a particularly interesting example of that either,cruel
this movie was so boring i was expecting a really disturbing horror film and instead got something reminiscent of a mix of eurotrip meets pulp fictionthe torture scenes seemed so fake and the whole scenario was so ridiculous it just wasnt scary at allthe plot was so loosely thrown together and the dialog    was actually comicalwhat a piece of garbageif you want a really disturbing movie see ichi the killer stay away from this crap i wasted 1050,cruel
another torturous gratuity of some of the most repulsive hacking jeffrey dahmer could conceive plays calculatingly and chillingly well as a gore fest cum revenge flick with an anarchic signature tarantino twist to boot cautionaries like not for the squeamish and seduction kills are splattered all over the wall of this malodorous if irresistible concept of a film like the mutilated body parts and bloody carnage which inevitably ensue yet unlike countless other slasher flicks that are impetuous in presenting shock and awe builds its terror casually and methodically allowing plenty of exposure to the clichd tobemutilated party animal teenagers who unknowingly become seduced by a fatal excursion and offering up plenty of gorgeous european scenery and babes galore the films anticipation of horror is consequentially profound you anxiously hang around and wonder how is this going to play out and once the neon ecstasy of the becomes the darkest and most bloodcurdling dungeons of despair imaginable if you dont find yourself gagging and shying away from the punishing grotesqueness that eventually blackens the screen you might want to ask yourself if youre a sadist at heart and you thank your lucky stars that your life isnt under the knife of one of these trigger or should i say blowtorch chainsaw drill happy maniacs at times its a bit too excruciating and mindnumbing to absorb and the pace is a bit drawnout in places in the end theres a sore lack of empathy for any of the socalled characters the bludgeoned or the bludgeoners because as usual the victims play right into their killers machinations and the killers are strictly capricious madmen just when you think one of them has the heart not to finish the job or the privilege however you want to put it its simply a convulsion of their manic nature and they turn out to be the ghouls we figured them to be after all these elements would usually make for tripe horror and would fall into the category of yet another recycled morass of a gore fest yet one has to keep in mind that at the helm of this production is the everindustrious quentin tarantino and you had better believe that everyones going to get whats coming to them this is not so much a chilling and horrifying film as it is a cold and unflinching trip into the darkest places imaginable for the price of admission youre going to get gore gore and babes galore and if that isnt enough the last drop of blood will be shed until the credits roll is bloodsoaked soberly crafted horror featuring the most gruesome images you wont be soon to forget could you expect anything less  out of ,cruel
i enjoy horror movies so i was quite excited to go see this movie after reading reviews here i regret to say i wanted to get up and walk out of the theater the acting was pretty good though the plot got a little shaky at times with events that did not really tie into the story later on making them pointless if you want to go and see human suffering beyond your imagination then i would recommend this movie the portrayal of human suffering in this movie makes texas chainsaw massacre seem like a tom  jerry cartoon i was literally covering my eyes in some scenes and left the theater with a nauseated feeling i could only hope that no unstable individuals get ideas from this movie and dont waste your money on any refreshments because you wont want them once the terror starts,cruel
fried air is what the should have called this movie not a typical american bad effects movie which doesnt compare with good thought through movies like for example the first episode of the saw installmentits terrible to see how yet again the americans think everything over here in europe and eastern europe is the same minorspoiler the movie starts off in amsterdam where im living myself and yet again just like in eurotrip and other movies the do not film in amsterdam and the residents all seem to speak german instead of dutch which trust me doesnt sound the same at all im 12 dutch and 12 german myself and come on people amsterdam is a beautiful city with loads of culture and friendly people all the americans seem to think about us is that we smoke pot all day long and visit the red light district trust me all of those things were invited to attract stupid american tourists back to the movie i heard people say this wasnt going to be a horror movie which would look away when something terrible was going to happenand indeed the camera doesnt look away it just goes blurry near the end of the movie youve seen so much blood that you dont buy it at allso saw lovers like myself this doesnt compare to saw at all it has a weak to no story at all and if you watch the trailers and spots youve seen the best part of the movie anyways,cruel
eli roth is back this time with endorsed by quentin tarentino although i have no idea why he would want to be involved with this project roth has improved on his first movie cabin fever albeit not by muchthe first half of the movie does not seem to relate to the second act the introduction consists of gratuitous t  a while the conclusion shifts to over the top gore i have heard people saying that the violence was so realistic but i think that sometimes less is more especially when it comes to horror films i actually found the violence to be so over the top it was comical also the makeup was terrible you will know what im talking about when you see it i found the movie to be mildly entertaining but i was fairly bored by the slow pace of the opening act,cruel
before i saw i heard mixed reviews about it but since tarantino was involved i had to go see it i mean the movie is insane and if you are into that type of movie then it will be great even though the plot is not the best i think the acting is good based on the fact that there really are no huge names in this movie i really enjoyed the concept behind the film because even though it was disgusting at times only people like roth and tarantino would explore such areas and consider to bring it to the big screen overall i feel that is definitely worth the money but this movie is not for everyone and you should know that before going into the movieps i am never staying in a ,cruel
this was a movie that did keep me at the edge of my seat and surprised me a lot the first half was a lot of ta and wasnt that gory then it picked up the scene where the toenail was ripped off kind of surprised me you saw the pliers grabbing the toenail but not the nail being ripped off which really surprised me yet it added to the suspense roth is yet another hitchcock wannabe but knows how to tell a story people were turning away especially when the japenese girl was getting burned then cut but not me i thought this was going to be a total gore fest but is was done in sort of a tasteful way which proved effective to me this is the best horror movie i have seen in a while and would recommend it if youre going to see it with thoughts of it being tarrnatinoesque you will be disappointed but roth knows what hes doing,cruel
i really really liked this movie i didnt think i would in the beginning when all you see are some dumb guys chasing around women just so they can score that got old quick but it establishes why these horny idiots would travel for some tail i wasnt sure what to expect with this movie since most other reviews seem to only focus on the obvious things like gore and torture yes the movies does have these uncomfortable gruesome moments in it but it is done in a way that i dont believe glorifies the violence but shows how sick and depraved people can really be i mean the idea that people would pay to torture and kill innocent people makes you sick to your stomach the fact that its a club where you get a tattoo once you join is so gross the moments that truly made me sick and nothing to do with the actual moments of violence its the moments where the guy says to be careful you could spend all your money in there gross the moment when the nut job is asking him if he should do it fast or slow awful those were the moments that will leave a knot in your stomach the joy that these monsters get in torturing people is just awful i would recommend this film but not for the weak it really has some gross moments in it and it leaves you feeling very uncomfortable but i still recommend it,cruel
pg13 horror crap step aside finally a real horror film for those of us who dont mind watching people getting butchered like pigs with many different kinds of tools the squeamish obviously should stay away from this flick and go back to their quaker families virtually every bodily organ or limb imaginable is severed at some point in this flick to the point where it becomes somewhat cheesybut a lot of fun nonetheless is it scary not really but its a blast to watch so long as you have a strong stomach the characters are likable the dialogue is realistic and the story is about as strange as youre gonna get this is a kind of holy grail for us hardened horror fans lets hope theres even more stuff on the dvd,cruel
i must say after seeing this movie i am doubting there will ever be another good horror movie again after all the storiesrumours i heard about this film i figured it would amazing but i soon found out that it was nothing more than a pornpartyalmost scary film there was 10x more nudity than tourtue and blood in this movie which i have no problem withif i was paying to see that most of the torture scenes were cut and didnt show anything or were too dark to see them sure there was one or two good scenes and the acting was outstanding but this movie was all talk to get people to go see it what do you think about it,cruel
this movie is ok well its not as good as saw 1 and 2 though this movie is kinda boring a little bit not much to say except the bloddy scene and sadistic part its hard to believe though there are this kind of person who is rich and sick they love torturing people killing people and there is one part where one of the guy toturing the asian chick with the fire bah that is really disgusting and there is part where the butcher butchered human part just like butchering a pig or a cow euhh really sick i dont why but quentin tarantino seems like this kind of things almost all his movie is contain brutality and sadism good thing i dont eat anything when i watch itotherwise i will throw up in the movie theater well i hope place like this didnt exist,cruel
has such a brilliant concept for a horror movie sadly though i found the execution to be lacking it was like sex romp comedy and horror thriller film shoved into one film with the first part of the film being porkys and the second part of the film being i have to say as a woman that i found the constant references to the p word a female body part to be tiring i felt that the filmmaker was portraying female sexuality in a degrading and sensationalistic manner lets face it the girls in the film were all sluts but apparently the filmmaker thinks all women are sluts anyway since they all run around nude in front of strange men and offer their bodies out freely like halloween candyi think eli roth is a very cool guy from what i have read about him i just think he needs to quit making films on the junior high levelon the positive side jay hernandez really blew me away he truly carried the filmsome of the horror scenes were good but i thought he could have pushed them further the ending was terrible and anticlimactic there were too many convenient coincidences used to resolve the story in the 3rd act,cruel
in my years of movie watching ive seen too many movies involving college kids going to places they shouldnt be and ending up in them getting chopped to pieces example of which are house of 1000 corpses and wrong turn the plot was good enough enough to keep me involved and even applaud the hero when he dispatches the person responsible for bring him and his friends upon the whole mess but it still wasnt anything new to me the ending made we raise my shoulders in a kind of what the fck motion but overall it was a good experience for anyone that can stomach the actually small amount of gore and the more common swearing then id totally recommend it i give it an 85 out of 10,cruel
like wolf creek s reputation is horribly overhyped as i was told was the beall endall of disgusting bloody horror and mayhem so naturally i had high expectations what i got in exchange for my nine dollars was an hour and a half of what the hell is this without going into detail ill sum the movie up the characters are boring and one watches them do their thing for a good solid fifty minutes before anything interesting happens if youve seen eurotrip youve seen the first fifty minutes of this movie by a certain point in you are guaranteed to stop giving a care in the world to the main characters and wish only for them to be subjected to painful awful things like you were promised in the trailers you saw on tv or the internetsurprised me unpleasantly i expected to see brutal torture and plenty of material worthy of making me put down my bag of popcorn lest i vomit in it what i got instead was an urge to tell my mate to wake me when we get there if youre looking for a movie to satisfy the sadist in you youre looking in the wrong place avoid unless youre dying to see a mediocre saw with watered down violence and a sleepinducing story,cruel
is filled with a lot of great gore and some ok violence but it lacks the awesome narrative character building that movies like evil dead ii texas chainsaw and halloween have yes the director has a great eye for creating gut wrenching sequences when he finally gets to them but like other modern horror directors mr roth seems to pay too much attention to effects and fails to create truly horrifying story without giving too much of the movie away i will attempt to explain what i mean for starters the opening before the gore was much too drawn out mr roth could have summed most of the opening up in backstory learned when they reach the the intro might have been more effective and moving if mr roth had focused on the the main characters childhood experience with death and failure anyway with the length of the intro decreased there would have been more time for the meat of the movie to commence i would have liked to see more character development in the main character ie something more dramatic than what actually occurred in the movie wouldntt it have been more fun if he had started to lose control and go psycho a little sooner than in the last set of scenes in the bathroom take for example ashs character transforming from college lover to insane villain and finally to the most awesome evil butt kicker of horror movie history except for maybe the father in exorcist has great bloody messes but they are smashed at the end of a narrative that could have been much more terrifying gore is great but give me a movie that scares the ever living crap out of me so that i cant sleep at night and i am afraid to look into dark corners a man with no emotions crashing through my closet door bent on killing for no reason is much more horrific than the best special effects gore with a weak and slow plot seemed more like a second draft to me rather than a polished final print,cruel
this is a film that kept me watching but i never really identified with the protagonists or their dilemma although i found myself squirming a number of times i didnt find myself racked with tension or fear and unfortunately the visual displays of torture were a bit overdone suggestion works the imagination much more than graphicness i cant put my finger on it but i just wasnt put in the characters place as a good horror movie will do the feel of the film is nice in the good gruesome way of good horror filmsdark and foreboding but there is something too familiar about the movies plot it tends toward the formulaic and never goes beyond the puritan shadow cast by hollywood which makes it im afraid unmemorable,cruel
this could have been a much better film first of all the main characters were so annoying you didnt care if they were killed then having them scream four letter words at their killers was just plain ridiculous if someone is swinging a power drill at me i am not going to scream fk over and over it got interesting when they showed why the killers were doing what they did but then they dropped the ball on that aspect and went right back to a silly chase scenei was expecting more from quentins production team i guess teenagers like this kind of stuff but i need more than gore and foour letter words to keep me interested sorry i didnt like this film at all,cruel
as usual in horror movies people are really stupid roths characters walked into a situation that was very obviously a setup and even when people started disappearing didnt get out of it they were exceptionally gullible even for horror movie fodder  i mean to say charactersthe concept for the film is that three friends are backpacking across europe and catch wind of a where exceptionally desperate but hot women will for free have sex with anything with a penis one of them gets hit on by someone that reminded me of a gay hannibal lecter but thats not really important yetthe first weird situation occurs when the morning after this fantastic night one of the three goes missing they get a text message from him that says i go home another guest a japanese girl generic asian actress notices her friend has mysteriously disappeared as well she then receives a picture message from her friend that has both missingasiangirl and missingstonerguy in it with a caption of we go out both people in the picture have exceptionally lifeless stares but well ignore thatso therere now two missing people and what do the token american kids decide to do go take more drugs and get completely wasted in a place where there are most definitely people going missing one guy is abducted and killed another guy in his drunken drugged stupor accidentally locks himself in a closet he lives for the evening but returns to the to find that missingasiangirls friend has vanished and so has his remaining american buddy around this time hes mugged by children and loses his cellphone yep a bunch of kids steal his cellphone from himthe movie continues to reveal that the guy who let them know about this and the women that seduced them on the first night that they arrived are actually making thousands of dollars by selling tourists to a business that allows people to kill other people survivingamericanguy or sag as ill call him now since i cant remember his actual name learns this as he follows an obvious trap in order to find his missing friends after the trap is sprung sag is handcuffed to a chair and proceeds to beg for mercy in not one but two languages to the man who begins assaulting the helpless frat boy with scissors and a metal stick this proceeds to have the man gag sag who is now much more tolerable to have in the moviesag has two of his fingers cut off by chainsaw and that somehow allows him to escape his handcuffs his assailant slips on a pool of blood and injures himself with the chainsaw which gives sag the necessary time to grab a gun and kill the man long story short sag escapes and finds a change of clothes where he meets another deranged man who unknowingly explains to him the situation sag almost escapes when he starts hearing random outbursts of japanese he decides to go back for the girl and try to help her and ends up killing the maniac he spoke to earlierthe face of the japanese girl is quite possibly the most graphic scene gorewise of the movie the man had pried one of her eyeballs from its socket and had used a blowtorch on her face possibly a reference to pulp fiction since tarantino produced this work heres where i was confused sag obviously didnt understand japanese my elementary knowledge picked up it hurts and help me but somewhere along the lines she must have asked him to cut the dangling eye off or not since she screamed like hell after he did it anyway they escape in a car from the complex with another vehicle in chasethe movie gets slightly more satisfying at this point the guy that told them about the and the two girls that seduced the friends are standing in the middle of the road closely together and dont notice the car slowly pull closer to them sag notices them though and he hits them dead on the chase car which didnt catch up despite how fast it was going and how slow sag was driving before he hit them runs over the survivors later the kids that stole sags phone earlier in the film attempt to block his cars passage through an alleyway rather than running them down like he did the other people who wronged him he bribes them with a bag of candy a few seconds later when the chase car comes through slows down and stops as this candy checkpoint when the kids get in their way however the kids proceed to bludgeon to death these men yes trained killers with guns were easily defeated by a group of not more than 10 childrenthe end of the movie shows currentlysurvivingasiangirl jumping in front of a train after she sees her horrific reflection in the mirror this distraction allows sag to catch a train that gayhanniballecter who happened to be the one that killed sags friend happens to be on sag takes revenge on him at the next stop and the movie is over hoorayi really really hated this movie it was boring as hell and attempted to placate me with topless women which really only worked but so long the characters fell for continually more and more obvious traps to the point that i was sad to see that any of them survived it attempted to shock and disgust me with images such as people being stabbed or having fingerstoes cut off but all horror movies nowadays do that and it isnt innovative or scary its kinda sickening but most horror movie goers wont even be slightly shocked by itavoid this movie like the plague dont go to see movies tarantino produced if hes not writingdirecting them himself,cruel
after all the hype and reading harry knowles pretty rave review of this movie i was relatively excited for it not giddy excited like i cant wait but in anticipation of i wonder what this movie has that makes everyone talk about it so much honestly the clincher for me going to see it was an ad i saw that said scariest movie in a decade aintitcoolnews i trust harry knowles and his reviews so i decided hey it must be incredibly worthwhilenow i was expecting something absolutely horrifyingly scary i am not a huge horror movie fan but ive seen quite a few in my day there have been many movies that have shaken me in my seat event horizon being the one that sticks out most in my mind only on the big screen though even texas chainsaw massacre had moments where you got freaked out and you could feel the tension in your chestlet me just say that i was not impressed with this movie i knew it would be really really messed up but i thought that would be combined with extremely tense moments moments that rip your from your seat and make you look away because you dont want to see what happens next had none of that it was just really really messed up the beginning was too cheesy with no drama then once the drama started there werent any teeth clenching moments just moments where you said to yourself wow thats just not right i just felt such a strong absence of the marriage of gore and tension the two go hand in hand and while you can have extreme tension with no gore gore does improve it in a horror movie a movie with no tension but lots of gore just leaves you a little white in the face not wanting to eat bbq sandwiches for a week and emotionally youre disturbedlet me clarify what i mean by tension i dont mean tension between characters or emotional tension of an individual i mean the tension between your psyche and the action on the screen those moments when you feel a knot in your chest and there is a 10 second pause in the movie where youre left waiting to see when someone will jump out those moments where the camera slowly zooms in on someone and you know something is about to happen that is the tension i am talking about and the tension that i feel really makes a horror movie what it is where movies can scare you worse than youve ever been scared in real lifein summation this movie was made to gross you out with really really fed up scenes dont expect a great plot or character dynamics or even a great ending if you want to see people die in graphic ways without clenching your teeth you can either go to a torture museum or watch this movie this is a goreor movie not a horror movie,cruel
i was really looking forward to this movie i loved cabin fever and i am a big fan of gore so i thought would be great there were several things i did not like about the movie the first of which were the charactersthree guys off in search of girls to sleep with is fine but that is as far as their character development went when people were being hurt in this movie i didnt have a reason to feel bad that they were being tortured it obviously sucks and is not comfortable but i didnt have a connection to them to make me hope they got outthe music choice also bugged me as they are arriving at their destination to find the hot girls this music is playing as if its an adventure it was something i would have expected in lord of the rings or some other great adventure movie as they come up on a beautiful landscapei feel that i built this movie up to be something really great and it fell short the idea for the movie itself is phenomenal i just wish it had more depth see for yourself,cruel
although there were some obvious problems with the story line and what i saw as a lack of what could have been really great psychological horror moments overall i thought this was one of the funniest movies i have seen in a while i like a good horror flick but this film seemed like it didnt really know where to go most of the time and ended up leaving me laughing at the bloodiest scenes that squirming in my seat like when josh was all tied to the chair and was screaming like the bitch he was as he got drilled by the dutch businessman all over his body or the way paxton ran over the three betrayers in the road how convenient that they were all standing right there at the time on his way to the train station i thought it was outright hilarious that once the asian chick saw what that dude did to her face with a blowtorch in her reflection at the station that she decided that there was no alternative but to throw herself in front of the train resulting in a very unrealistic yet very funny blood shower of the people on the platform like i said this was one funny movie,cruel
is one of the more gruesome movies you will ever see but it is one of the most effective at displaying a sickening and horrifying desire fetish need that is more than likely buried deep within a lot of people being 43 myself these young guys kind of ticked me off at their behavior near the beginning of the movie  backpacking across europe with only one purpose hooking up with women there is a lot of nudity in the movie but it never felt gratuitous to me and with all the naked women traipsing around the s and spas it makes this slovakian city seem like a great place to visit  until you find out what some of these women are up to near the end i was a little bothered that there seemed to be no point to what was happened but when the shoe dropped i was shocked and horrified the ending to the film is brutal and shocking cabin fever was a decent movie but  i think  vaults director eli roth in the category of directors to watch out for i cant wait to see how his prospective movies the box the bad seed and scavenger hunt turn out,cruel
i went to see with a friend who insisted we go personally i was a bit afraid after hearing all the hype about this flick and comments like the goriest movie ever made and bla bla was i wrongthe story is pretty ordinary and predictable its more a return to slasher movies of the 70s like texas chainsaw massacre it does play on a common fear of being helpless and at the mercy of a sadist but it does it in a very lazy way without any originality it also reuses the 1970s clich of showing boobs without much connection to the storythe characters are sympathetic but they are offed so fast that we dont really have time to empathize with their fate its a lot of building up a capital of sympathy only to see it written off in a minute or two the main evil female characters are twodimensional bitches and no justification is offered for their actions except pure greedthe story is also very thin and would have easily fit into a 60 minutes tv formatin summary this movie is part tobe hopper part russ meyer and part run of the mill bmovie seeing it made me appreciate the originality of saw and saw ii,cruel
i debated over the weekend whether to see this movie my dilemma was that this was a horror movie about torture and why did i want to see that especially if it was as graphic as the info presented to me declares anyways i like horror movies like kids like candy inside joke for moviegoers so i went to see it tonight since i felt ridiculous at the objections i had it is just a movie after allverdictpretty good flick not great not haunting and there is no way possible it could have caused someone to vomit the nudity is no big deal but is nice i liked the characters everyone of them do not get your hopes up too high and just go see it and have fun the movie is no big deal it is just a fun movie i probably read every review on this site and others before i went to see this movie i have a real issue with men harming women so i wanted to make sure about that no problemsin finishing i kept reading about people laughing and cheering in the audience well they actually were good timesgood times,cruel
as 2006 opens up so does ill say this what i got was what i expected and at the same time not what i expected after seeing the preview for it in saw 2 i figured i had to see it i also immediately figured that there was going to be a lot of comparisons of to saw 2 and thats perfectly understandable to those who havent seen this yet in my humble opinion makes the gore in saw 2 look like a walt diseny movie this movie is absolutely brutal the movie in the first half hour however leads you to believe youre going to be watching another girls gone wild video instead of seeing brutal scenes of torture the nudity portion of the movie is consistent with the gore portion three friends are traveling around europe looking to get stoned and get laid after taken in by a guy in amsterdam theyre told about another country where theyre going to get laid pretty much for free they take a train over there and get exactly what they came for soon one of their friends disappears and then another until were left with one character sorry im bad with names desperate to find out what happened to his friends he goes on a search into a run down building to find that for a price you can do anything you want to anyone thats the basic summery overall the movie is 45min of smoking pot and naked girls and 55min of torture the story isnt that strong but keeps the movie going the scary thing is is the fact that this is based upon true events id recommend this to horror movie fans saw fans and gore fans which normally all run in the same category,cruel
contains spoilers i saw on opening weekend and it disturbed me just the way human nature means entertaining yourself by torturing somebody is justdisturbing the scene that most disturbed was when the girl gets her eyeball drilled out and then takes her own life that bothered mea lot it starts off with three friends that go on a eurotrip to get some chicks and end up being seduced and tricked into being tortured for a local underground exhibit its sick jay hernandezs character is the main character who goes in search for his friend whos already dead and gets tricked by this prostitute into following her to a human slaughter house where he is kidnapped and literally dragged into a dark torture chamber where he is tied up to a chair and has a gagball roughly shoved in his mouth as he is being tortured by having his two fingers chopped off with a chainsaw as his hands are handcuffed behind the chair he sobbbbbbs anyway if ur not into gore masochism and claustrophobia then dont watch it,cruel
eli roths managed to lull the crowded theater i saw it in asleep before anything of interest took place in the film once the movie got going the characters were so uninteresting the feeling of conspiracy was so obvious and the demand for violence and gore was so high that perhaps roth could never have met those expectations which he himself created this movie really needed some energy where the filmmakers opted for suspense and failed to deliver i imagine the people that got the most out of this movie were the ones squeamishly covering their eyes through the torture scenes at least they were able to fill in the creative gaps in roths with what they thought was happening as opposed to what really was which wasnt worth opening your eyes to see in the first place,cruel
first off i must state that when i saw previews for this movie i was very excited this movie looked sick and therefore very interesting i told people how i was going to go see it and everyone told me how horrible it looked in a good way and how it would be way to scary for them to see it i brought my friend along with me and we were both very nervous but excited about viewing this movie we sat down with every intention of being scared out of our minds we wore hooded sweatshirts and big baggy coats so we can curl up into balls when the movie got too intense i hate to be the bearer of bad news but this movie was the most disappointing movie i had ever seen the first 45 minutes of the film closely resembled the movie euro trip which is not a horror movie at all but a comedy about a few teenagers taking a trip all over europe and having a good time this movie resembled euro trip down to the silly scenes on the train and with the fanny pack i felt like this movie was not only a rip off of a dumb movie but it also had terrible acting finally when they got down to the good stuff i sunk into my chair with relief pleased that the movie will now start with the gory good parts the first scary scene was about to show the man torturing someone and they just cut to a black screen they also had some deep plot points explaining how one of the lead characters witnessed a young girl drown and he wasnt able to do enough to help her come on quentin tarrantino give me a break i sat through that movie for and hour and a half waiting very impatiently for some decent part to come on which it never did i prayed for the main character to be killed so the movie would end i eventually look up at my friend who is just sitting there staring blankly at the big screen and i say do you want to just leave this movie sucks and she says yea lets leave i thought this was going to be better i continued to stay in my seat and give it one last shot then when the scene came up with the main character getting out of the building i was excited because i figured it was almost over he ran to the car and was about to get away when he heard a girl scream of course thats where that plot point from before comes into play at this point i was seriously done with this movie i grabbed my things and walked right out i must say i have never walked out of a movie especially one that i was so very excited to see in the first place thank you very much for ruining my day off i thought kill bill was good though barbara vetri,cruel
if anyone has the brains for it they should realize that theres going to be nudity and sex in this moviea lot of itif youve seen roths other film cabin fever you should know what to expect gore mildly attractive women looking stoned being naked constantly and the gratuitous use of bloodi was a fan of the movie but what got me were two scenes in one a character has his achilles heels cut and tries to stand up complete with sound effects the other thing that bothered me immensely was another scene in which a young japanese woman had a blowtorch on her face and her eye was dislodged from its socket the main character then proceeded to use surgical scissors to cut her eye from her facei wasnt too big on how the movie ended so abruptly but i did like the way the main character was seeking his revenge on the villainin my opinion wait until the movie moves to a smaller theatre and bring someone to cling to because youll need it,cruel
i heard the film festival version was pretty good but this past saturday afternoon i went with my friends to see the theatrical version at my local cinema will very high expectations and walked out of the movie unhappy and wish it was as good as it was presented it to be this is the first time tarantino has let me down the story left wasnt fantastic and i figured out what was going to happen before it did it had its moments tho like when the guys was pummeled with rocks at the end by he little kids thats another thing whats with those kids and when paxton hits that chick with the car ok in a nutshell titties and death,cruel
i must say first that the first half of this movie relates to a bad teen comedy the second half of the movie is just senseless violence the story is horrible predictable were you can figure out what will happen then you brace for the shock of what will happen next the acting is the worst i have ever seen with the one exception of the female lead finally the directing was brilliant eli roth made the story flow to his vision dont confuse this great directing as meaning the story was good i think this is the very first time i have seen a movie were i felt the story was a complete failure the acting was painful and the gore was too much however i still found that i was entertained i give this a 310 and recommend it for violence fans,cruel
well i saw the movie and i really enjoyed itcabin fever not so much i never really paid much attention to this director beforebut im glad quintens name was tagged with this movie because i wouldnt have seen it otherwiseits the little things in that movie that made it great many people dislike all of the nudity but i think it is fitting to create a better understanding of the characters and what their reasons were for their tripalthough i would not say it is for everyone if you like dark comedies and gore go ahead and watch it,cruel
everything was there to make it a great horror film but missed on a few marks not even close to being as graphic as advertised just watched friday 13 pt 2 much more graphic should have followed oli to his torture and death after all he became the lovable character when pax ran over that girl at the end it was cut too fast that he could have been driving over the typical watermelon cart how did paxton know that the stranger from the train was one of the killers when every intimate experience with him was with josh pax also wasnt the one to see the skull tattoo on the killers arm only the american killer,cruel
saw wannabe been there done that the hardcore nudity for the first hour puts you to sleep and actually witnessing torture for the second hour is a real bore tarantino only allowed his name to be connected to this movie to help sales for the writer director mr rothits no wonder this movie was not allowed to be screened before being releasedthey didnt want critics to pre alert the audience the brutal torture in saw was mostly impliedhere in it is shoved down your throat and visually impossible to detect due to poor lighting during most of the sceneswait for video then dont bother renting,cruel
is a dumb movie if you thought this movie looked worthwhile from the trailer go see saw 2 that movie had a lot better violence the gory scenes in that were grosser more inventive and saw 2 had superior plot is a piece of crap those trailers you saw about audience members needing emt response were such bs i mean there are scenes with torture but any one strong enough to even sit down for this can handle it i was actually disappointed at how tame the violence was compared to what i expected it ended so quickly that me and my family looked at each other and went thats it seriously is it just over all ready i give credit for attempting to develop the characters a bit before killing them and i did feel compelled to root for the likable jay hernandez but the set up was more lengthy than the goods the only real strong aspect of this film was the 20000 tits in the beginning and the jokes in that section but honestly if i wanted to see guys bang foreign chicks id see eurotrip again or rent a porno and being the most obsessive tarantino fan ive encountered i must say that if i could id take the chainsaw used in this movie and use it to cut his name off of the credits oh there was another good part the car chase scene and i started getting excited during it that the movie was picking up but that was actually the climax,cruel
generally speaking i was disappointed by because of the lack of connectedness to any of the characters in order to have a context for the violence the film would have benefited from some sort of an understanding as to how the victims or aggressors end up in the dark underground world that provides the tension in the film of course too much of an emotional connectedness to the characters may have made the film a little too intense yet some sense of humanity beyond simple statements of future plans would have provided a context beyond the shock of violence and torture that being said the scenes of violence were well crafted and seemed to evoke the desired response in the audience if movie violence is your thing you may not be disappointed do not take these comments as a statement against films with violence as a theme or backdrop as a fan of natural born killers i get how violence can play a role in a film as far as roths films are concerned i enjoyed cabin fever but felt like this movie didnt evolve past the violent surface and would recommend it as a rental or matine,cruel
this movie was so weak it did have some torture but all of it was shown in the preview quintin tarentino definitely disappointed me hellraiser had a lot more violence and torture this movie had more boobs than blood it was more like a violent porno than a horror movie what is wrong with hollywood every movie has to have nudity what the hell is wrong with us the internet has enough porno and the torture was good but it needed a lot more the ending seemed more like an action movie than a horror movie please make another good movie with violence like kill bill volume 1 and 2 resivor dogs etc thank you for reading thisa,cruel
i advise anyone that thinks this movie might turn out good to not watch it i was so pumped up and ready to see this film and was disappointed the script and acting was terrible i actually found myself laughing at most of the movie because it was so ridiculous now as a guy i cant complain there was a lot of nudity and just great scenes a guy would probably enjoy the ending was pretty good director eli roth also did a pretty good job i just dont know how he was able to direct a movie with such a bad script one of the lines in the film spoken by jay hernandez is i dont want a drink i want to see art terrible line the acting was terrible i knew in the first five minutes that it was going to be bad ive never seen so much nudity and bad words in the first ten minutes than i saw in this film i wish i would have seen something else very disappointed,cruel
i was going into this movie to see some blood and guts but instead i saw a lot of nudity dont get me wrong the nudity was good but i wanted to see torture and blood the movie took a while to heat up and towards the end there were some overdone gory scenes i found this movie humorous and in the theater i heard more laughs than screams you can not go into this movie thinking it is going to be be scary it is a horror comedy and by horror i mean gory not scary overall i enjoyed the movie but was disappointed because the movie could have been a lot better there were many unnecessary scenes that just dragged out the movie you will be disappointed if your expecting a good scare there are some cool brutal scenes but you have to be patient to see them the trailer does not do a good job of previewing the movie,cruel
two american friends and an icelandic buddy take a backpack tour of europe before settling down to the rigors of grad school their constant pursuit of booze babes and dope in amsterdam cross their paths with a local who tells them of a in slovakia where the women are amazing and do it all when they get to slovakia it is everything they had wished for but when the group starts disappearing it becomes clear that something devious is going on and their little slice of heaven becomes hellis a very decent followup to the directors debut cabin fever it does take a bit of time before the action really kicks in but one may be distracted by the ample flesh to not take too much notice to it the ending is nice and sick with a nice amount of gore theres even a tense bit or two solid r rating stuff thank da mans10 says acting 7  10 direction 7  10 writing 6  10 photography 7  10 production design 8  10 the sound 8  10 music 7  10 scares  thrills  the gore zone 8  10 fun value 7  10 overall 7  10 score 72  100,cruel
this movie just did not do it for me at all it had all the elements and should have been scary  people out of their element scary old buildings blood and gore everywhere and all that however it was not scary at all no one around me seemed to be scared at all and they never jumped and i was at times bored with the whole thingit was plenty bloody for all you gore fans but i was more on edge and scared watching war of the worlds it had the potential to be a horror classic but it just did not live up to all the hype it could have shown more of what happened to the other travelers and it was a bit of a stretch to think that that many people disappeared there and no one ever knew about it this movie will make you rethink your backpack thru europe fantasies,cruel
i think ive seen this movie before i saw previews for this movie like 5 months ago and i couldnt wait to see it i went to go see it tonight and i wish i saved my money to go bowling cause a 710 split is far more suspenseful than anything i saw in this movie i really want to meet eli roth and slap him with an open hand and say cabin fever was better so seriously if you dont mind wasting money go for it but if you like to save your money for something worth while then dont see this movie i mean seriously horror movies now a days have way to many naked girls and way to many nude men  i love men but lets all admit a mans butt is not a beautiful thing dont get me wrong there are many funny parts but its suppose to be a horror so good luck,cruel
rumors are going around where i come from that people are literally getting sick and puking in the theaters because they cant handle the gory scenes in the movie i havent seen it yet but im debating whether i should wait until it comes to videodvd because i dont want to be there when someone decides to empty their stomachs on my lapwith a vicious rumor like that going around i trust people with weaker stomachs will reconsider their plans to see this movie sorry if i scared any of you away from the movie but remember it is just a rumor enjoy,cruel

is nastysometimes very hard to watcharguably sickhorribleyou name it its also a near masterpiece by its director ruggero deodato who never came near the quality of this film again its a horror film in the most literal sense its not scary in the slightestit doesnt attempt to make you jump despite its scenes of horrendous violenceits not even a simple gross out a la braindead what deadato attempted with this film is to disturb the viewer provoke a reaction and make him or her think the film has a powerful message about mans cruelty and violenceand deodato just tackles it totally head on thisand the fact that it is so well madelets face itsome of the socalled video nasties seem laughable noware probably why the film has had so much censor trouble even if you hate itit sticks with youits horrifying images staying in the mind for agesand they are indeed many people being ripped open and eatenincluding even a penis being partially torn off a woman having a foetus torn out of her and it buried in mud another woman raped with a dildo and than having a mudball with nails on thrust between her legs too a brief fake documentary showing disturbingly realistic executions the list goes on you would be forgiven for thinking that this is just exploitative nastiness however and this is just one of the many things that separates this film from the many other films of the cannibal subgenrewe are being shown this stuff to get us to thinknot just about mankinds violence to each other and his ignorance of other races but also about violence in the news and oddly enoughthe glut of realityshows on tv today also make the film pertinent and it also toys with our sympathies in a devilishly clever way cannibalism seems horrible to most of us but at the end arent we almost pleased to see the protagonists eaten by the natives when they have spent the previous half hour mistreating and abusing themthe film is oddly structuredwith the second half being basically the film which the characters in the first half of the film find the second half has the most powereven if there are shots which couldnt actually have been taken by the filmmakers deodato actually shows great skill in many of the gory effects scenes by showing just enough of the effects to be effective but not dwelling on them so the fakery starts to showand the climatic orgy of cannibalism is all the more shocking because much of it is only partially glimpsedmaking more of an impression riz ortolanis often bleakly beautiful score is superb and even the dubbing of the good if not greatactors is not badthe one thing about the film that is hardest to defend is the animal cruelty unless you see the uk dvdwhich removes it in one particularly notable scene a large turtle is dragged out of the water and in what seems like real time is disembowelled it probably is sickening that animals were killed for a filmyet this is how the natives of many places surviveby killing animals and eating themand is this really any more sickening than the way chickens are couped up in factories stuffed with food and basically bred to die answers on a postcard pleaseis quite simply essential viewing not just for fans of extreme cinema but for adult fans of cinema full stopas long as of course they can stomach it,cruel
professor harold monroe robert kerman aka porn star richard bolla travels into the jungles of south america to try and discover what happened to a group of three documentary film makers who have been missing now for some time after locating a primitive tribe monroe manages to strike a deal and salvage what is left of alan gabriel yorke faye francesca ciardi and jack perry pirkanenthey say there is a fine line between genius and insanity and i think in director ruggero deodatto made that line as thin as possible to call this movie depraved and sick would only give it half the credit it deserves because is meant to be sick as it shows how sickening our own society is but in the most morally corrupt way imaginable featuring numerous repulsive acts such as a real live turtle flaying a foetus being ripped from a womans body rape castration and impalement the film sets about to portray the civilised documentary filmmakers as no better than the primitive cannibals even though the actors are barely competent enough to do their job it becomes almost enjoyable in a very sadistic way to watch them suffer at the hands of those they have wronged however from a moralistic standpoint even watching this movie is wrong i dont think this is the type of movie you either love or hate on an entertainment basis but you either agree or disagree with how it presents its case is certainly nothing short of an endurance test in viewing as the senses are raped by the foul imagery constantly portrayed within filmed on a shoe string budget with virtually no production values evident has a disturbing realistic grittiness that is almost unparalleled by any other movie and a huge influence for the blair witch project almost twenty years later i feel that because the movie is so badly made and the very fact it was produced is more damning to society than the events portrayed within many people feel that it is nothing more than a senseless bloodbath with no redeeming features and a hypocritical storyline  and to an extent they are probably right whether the viewer appreciates or despises this movie is totally dependant on the viewer and it is unfair for anybody else to make judgements on that person based on their opinion of this movie is not about a sharp storyline great acting or superb special effects though the unsimulated effects are generally good instead it is about humanity in general if you believe you can cope with violent and repulsive imagery and scenes of unbelievable cruelty then go ahead and watch it but otherwise it is certainly one to avoid some people will probably find the moralising over such repulsive subject matter offensive and i cant say that i blame them however there is a message there and this movie makes an extremely bold statement the question is though whether it was right to make the statement in this way from an artistic standpoint it holds no real value but remains an interesting movie my rating for  610,cruel
is not the campy little horror flick i expected its a serious and wellmade movie and its an experience youll hardly ever forget according to imdbs trivia section the movie can only be seen completely uncut in the ecultrabit dvd which means that ive seen a tamed down version and that my friends is insane is easily one of the most graphic movies ive ever come across the violence is incredibly realistic its no wonder that director ruggero deodato was taken to court to prove that he hasnt slain real people for his motion picture i still think the real animal slaughtering in the movie was unnecessary screw you for that deodato its hard to tell if there really is a message or if the moral is just an excuse for all the gore in a strange way the violent scenes somehow speak for themselves and do deliver some kind of message but thats open for discussionif ever a movie deserved the label disturbing its its controversial but totally worth watching if you can take some seriously sick images,cruel
i cant believe some people have scathed this great film it deserves a lot higher ratingi got this movie out thinking it was going to be a brainless splatter fest but after watching it in completion i was bowled over i wasnt expecting to be challenged by its visuals as well as with the sociological lessons and questions it raisedthe film is real genuine and honest to the subject topic barbarity can be innate in all humansit can be argued that humans coming into the homosapiens stage of evolution survived and expanded because of what is now considered barbarous savage ways savagery was a survival tool we came from barbarityand to an extent we still are savagesthough the acting is poor in most places the film director portrays cannabilism and barbarism and portrays it rather intelligentlyobvious connotations can be made to blair witch project im sure the crew that made bwp was inspired by this moviethe film follows a professor investigating the disappearance of an american film team 3 guys and girl that went into the jungle of south america to film a documentary about the native cannibalsthe professor with a couple of jungle assistants venture into the jungle to trace the lost americans footsteps he manages to get on the trail and slowly uncovers the grizzly ways of the jungle tribes by carefully befriending these natives he captures the lost film reels and returns back to his skyscraper clad conurbationin amongst the film there is the media business cogs turning the dilemma of tv executives battling with the professor to air the once lost footage on tv for the viewing public the professor is reluctantthe professor seems the only person possessed with moral understanding and compassion throughout the film everyone else it seems is after ratings fame money or bloodthe film commences its ending by playing back the raw footage of what the expedition team filmedand it is shocking questions arise who is committing the real evil savagery hereas for the animal cruelty scenes yes they are real and shocking but should it be anymore shocking than the beef burger that is served up in mcdonalds cows are slaughtered everyday perhaps one needs to watch a bovine neck getting slit before they take it for granted they are eating a nice juicy steak on their plate the film portrays the reality of human meat consumptionand yes all kinds of animals are killed for the human appetite especially in the wild  someone will do it for those who dispute this film on these grounds can you handle life this stuff still goes on regardless of whether u see it happen or notthis film is absolutely brilliant a cult classic i can see it making a revivalbut dont know whenperhaps in some years time,cruel
was first and foremost a disgusting movie with more violence than i have ever seen despite this it is also one of my favorite movies it gives a feeling of blair witch done right even though there are some very obviously contrived scenes in which nobody is holding the camera but despite some small cosmetic problems this is the best horror movie i have ever seenunlike most shock films such as the guinea pig movies has a very well written plot and a definite progression the focus is still on making the audience ill but we dont even see any violence until fairly late in the movie so the emphasis on plot is much stronger the story told is a deep one showing the lengths at which people will go for some goal the example given being fame and fortune the theme is reflected in parallel story lines through the second half of the movie as alan and his crew go to more and more desperate lengths for fame and the professor struggles against a big media company to suppress the release of their footage even in a meta sense we see the theme appear once again in the lengths the director of itself went going so far as to kill and butcher four animals on camera,cruel
is very deserving of its controversy but it is definitely not tacky and for pure shock value something i half expected i discovered this movie while reading about the august underground movies and was way more intrigued by a controversial movie with meaning and plot its in your face it at least seems real and is real in some parts never have i ever seen such convincing special effects in a movie and this was a lowbudget 70s movie cgi will never recreate it but beyond the special effects there is a message and meaning and very engaging storyill break down the review into sectionsplotstory 910 think of the blair witch project except not trying to put itself off as real a group of 4 documenters go into the amazon jungle to film the savages and cannibals that live there they do not return and it is up to an anthropologist to find them or at least what was left of them throughout the movie we learn of the documentary crews tendency to push and bribe people into committing extreme acts of violence through actual footage from people being killed by soldiers in nigeria the movie portrays it as if it was a documentary shot by the crew in which they payed the soldiers off to kill innocent people execution style as the story progresses the viewer is forced to try and comprehend who exactly are the real savages not to mention the social overtones of how modern society ties into all of this it loses a point though because the dialog sometimes is very iffy even though you can tell they were trying to be realistic but this hinders the actors especially with their lack of experienceacting 710 this is where the movie suffers it gets better as the movie progresses and things get more intense this may be do to the actual moralities of the actors and how they felt about the movie showing through in their characters but when it starts out im almost reminded of campy bmovies the cinematic presentation and pure intrigue is what kept me going again though the script writing obviously provided some challenges for the actorscinematography 1010 speaking of cinematic presentation this movie does it beautifully even from the opening shot from a helicopter flying over the rainforest the studio and moviestyle aspects of the film are very convincing and very welldone hollywood couldnt do better with a 10 million dollar budget the creativity and use of closeups really pulls you in and you begin to question the reality of even the part of the movie that is presented as fictional and that doesnt even cover the great mockumentary work the directors understanding of how documentaries are made and how they work is extremely convincing the use of normal scenes of the crew kind of doddling around really help to present a feeling of reality and the aspects of limited film and the amateurishspontaneous filming style are almost convincing enough to make the viewer think they used real footage to build a fictional movie aroundaudio 1010 again im reminded of apocalypse now the music is melodic and somewhat peaceful adding a real eerie tone to the serious and macabre theme of the movie it is very 70s though and i would not expect to here the same soundtrack in a new movie although some of the musical flavors are indeed timeless and there are some more intense scores in the film but they are not overintense like most hollywood today then we get into sound design which is very convincing the tearing and the screaming all sound real or as i would expect them to sound the new mixing with stereo is well and really helps immerse the vieweron the animal violence this is something that i thought would disturb me the animal scenes in amorres perros disturbed me even though they were not real but this was real and i wasnt that perturbed by them people have said that the killing of the animals is useless and doesnt help the plot of the movie but i feel otherwise it brings into light that you do have to kill to survive the documenters kill 6 animals one is a spider which some may not count i do on screen and 1 is killed off screen and it obviously irks the actors a little bit note when you see vomit it is indeed real but the animals are eaten and all of this adds to the reality of the documentary it would have been hard fake some most of that plus think of the meat industry today hundreds of thousands of cows and pigs slaughtered and millions of chickens and turkeys slaughtered every day in gruesome ways just so we can eat them just because you dont see it doesnt mean it doesnt happen our society frowns upon killing animals but that burger doesnt magically appear blood had to be spilled for our dining pleasure,cruel
yes this film was banned and heavily censored in a few places for being disturbing it does have some really well done gruesome scenes but the real censorship came from the cruelty to animals lets just say this film doesnt have no animals were harmed during production scrolling the end credits the animal killings include a pig being shot in the head from close range a muskrat being slit open for no reason a giant turtle being split open in an overly long scene and a monkey getting his brains bashed in which required two takes so two monkeys were killed during production these were real killings and not faked a lot of the actors on the set protested this but the show went on in fact one of the lead actors feared for his life thinking this might be a snuff film and might meet the same fate as much as this bothered people is it really that different then buying meat in a supermarket at least it made me think the movie centers around found footage of a group of documentary filmmakers the filmmakers are in south america searching for a tribe of flesheaters hoping that this documentary will win them fame and fortune the movie was marketed in a way that made viewers believe all the documentary footage shown in the movie was actual footage of a group that really went to south america to do a documentary some questionable acting gives it away and you thought the blair witch project was an original idea didnt you,cruel
is a truly charged viewing experience in all its 20 years of existence no other non mondo film until maybe men behind the sun had such a reputation to shock even today it is believed by some at the uks trading standards to be an actual snuff film ch is not the goriest film ever made but in terms of themes and narrative its still the cruellest most fascinatingly harsh piece of filmaking in the horror genre ive seen all the traces of death the men behind the sun films and the guinea pigs and i still think this is king  it is simply so well made acted atmospheric and the brilliant score by riz ortalani sets the scene so well the fake documentary style never slips up but perhaps the most unsettling thing about ch is that it is an exploitation film and the scenes of animal cruelty and even human unsettle because they are being shown to promote a responseshould you look away or notlike i said is a truly unique experience not some gory novelty like cannibal ferox and in this time of increased media coverage of true life atrocity maybe its pertinent maybe its just nasty cruelty maybe it even dissapoints youyou just have to see it to gauge youre own response for me at least its a classic,cruel
what havent i heard about only that its one of the most disturbing movies of all time and still to this day manages to shock its audience honestly im surprised that it took me this long to watch it but i found the film on google because i was cautious on paying 20 dollars for a film i never saw thankfully is much more than just shocking but actually has a great message to it the film isnt as shocking as im sure it was when it was released but it is a jaw dropper mainly due though to the real killings of the animals which is a bit too much to handle at the time the director was also accused of murdering the three lead actors talk about motivation however he made the actors break the contract of silence since he wanted the audience to think that this was a real film in order to prove his innocence before the blair witch project there was no film like i dont think a film has even touched its ground since thenthere is a television documentary about a missing united states film crew who disappeared on an expedition to the amazon to make a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes the team was alan the director faye script girl and two cameramen jack and mark harold monroe an anthropologist has agreed to lead a rescue team and flies to the amazon to meet his guides there the team meets hostility and learn that the film group had caused great unrest among the people the yanomam invite monroe and his team to their village where they are treated with suspicion a group of yanomam women take him to a shrine which he learns holds the bones of the missing american filmmakers monroe confronts the yanomam about this after playing a tape recorder for them he trades it for the first teams surviving reels of film back in new york executives invite monroe to host a broadcast of a documentary to be made from the recovered film monroe wants to see the raw footage first finding out who might be the real savages after alldid the animal killings bother me the turtle scene definitely did i understand that the meat was used for meals but it was a bit too much for me to handle the brutality of the killing i wont go into details just if youre an animal lover like i am then fast forward through that part too however what i did appreciate about the film was how realistic it did look the director did a great job of finding locations actors and the over all feel of the film as you feel dirty and embarrassed watching such horror on the screen while i may not agree with the animal killings this message of who are the real savages really got to me i loved that this wasnt about just grossing people out but showing how crazy people can get over money and power its really sad and its weird to think that the documentary crew that went into the project that you thought were originally the victims of such violent tribes were actually the ones who are wild animals and in some sick way deserved the justice that was served to them while its a hard movie to watch i would say that it was worth it again not for the faint of heart but a true classic and im sure will still shock for many generations to come810,cruel
i first heard about through the internet my initial curiosity and desire to see the film was because it was supposedly the most violent and gory film made which is a subject matter than can be debated but when i eventually got a copy of this i was blown awaythe opening of the film has probably some of the most beautiful music i ever heardwhile filming shots of the amazon from birds eye viewi was surprised to see that this film was much more than a violence fest i would be lying if i said that the violence in the movie is insignificant to its underlying message because its not there are real animal killings which are pretty brutal to watch but on the lighter side the animals killed were eaten by cast and crew after filming so they did not die for the viewers entertainment or whatevercan be called ahead of its time due to the fact that makes you question watching reality as entertainment and where to draw the line also themes of consumerism the media and what it means to be civilized are present within the killingsflesh eatingrapesexual assaulttortureand other such extreme things filmed i would compare this to clockwork orange in the means that there is a message in the madnessand it was quite obvious where the blair witch creators got their inspiration from this movie,cruel
directed by italian maestro ruggero deodato is a haunting beautifully filmed masterpiece  deodato known for a spattering of mostly laughable erotohorror hit the mark with a few wonderful pictures notably house by the edge of the park jungle holocaust and this his greatest film  contrasting powerful horrific imagery with a gorgeous melodic soundtrack by composer riz ortolani  the most impressive aspect of the film however is its remarkable superrealism  i have seen very few horror films if any that are acted with such passion and naturality  the film is exploitative extreme brutal and marvelous see it,cruel
the second word in the title is important ruggero deodatos 1979 metasnuff movie far more than a chichi trinket like the night porter is the real holocaust porn here the trigger is not frights or even shocks or even splatter atrocity is the name of deodatos gameand the genius of this monsterpiece is that deodato horrifyingly delivers the goods at the same time he coruscates his audience and himselfthis is a hard movie to recommend to any but those who would find it anyway but it must be said that deodato here created the most rigorous critical almost philosophical movie in the italian horror canon the audiences lust for third world exoticism and envelopepushing violence are gratified and held up to the painful light of dayand not necessarily in that order the overwhelming feeling of this picture is of a pornographer pleading stop me before i shoot againthe conceit of the moviean academics journey into the amazon to find the remains of a western film crew devoured by cannibalspermits deodato more pirandellian boxes within boxes than a double bill of blowup and the player but the atmosphere of the movie despite scenes of cruelty so extreme you sometimes want to put out your eyeballs is relentlessly elegiaccapped by riz ortolanis theme music it can be said with certainty that no romantic ballad was ever used underneath what deodato stages hereis the farthest edge of extreme cinemaas in extreme sports it feels stuntlike yet the combination of amplified bloodlust and worldweary regret is unique like lucio fulcis even more personal cat in the brain its an affecting enactment of an exploitation artists conscience tearing apartit might make good viewing for y2k eve it puts together the centurys two salient wordsholocaust and entertainmentas no other film did before or since,cruel
a group of 4 filmmakers and their guide take a trip to the rain forest aka the green inferno to shoot a documentary about the native cannibal tribes after a short period of shooting they discover that the footage they have shot so far is not spectacular enough so they decide to stage the whole thing their misbehavior is put at an end when they come across one of the real cannibal tribes of the region when the home front discovers that the crew shows no sign of life they decide to send out a rescue mission these people an anthropologist and his guides retrieve the original footage that the missing crew has shot and they bring it back to the usi decided to wait for the uncut european version of the film because i am not a fan of censorship each individual should be able to decide for himself what he wants or doesnt want to see but this can only be the case with fiction this film however contains actual footage of animal killings a snake is beheaded a spider is squashed a monkey is scalped a turtle is beheaded and afterwards eaten a pig is shot in the headand this is not the essence of a horror film horror movies are supposed to be fictional stories with great special effects and effective story lines that entertain or scare you with their originality movies like this one give the horror scene a bad name and why this film is famous for its great special effects the special effects in this movie are so bad that every scene that contains one of these so called effects is shot out of focus the filmmakers get away with it because they can use the excuse that it has been shot using small portable cameras the only times the gore is convincing is when they use actual guts from real animals and make it look like it came from a human body the story line of the movie is completely unbelievable with footage of rape and torture that are just thrown in without adding any originality whatsoever the mere reason they put this in is to shock the viewer even more they didnt succeed the makeup effects are weak just some guys painted white and wearing wigs made out of straw and the acting is probably the worst acting in the entire history of cinema the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it contains some great images of the untouched fauna and flora of the rain forest this is however not the reason why i have bought this film it is said that deodato regrets that he has made this film and he should be it is a total waste of time and money,cruel

what you have in is a story about a group of people from nyu that go to document a culture of cannibals and never come back not that the story matters having watched i think three cannibal movies now this is three more than the average healthy adults lifetime recommended dosage it has become clear to me that they are nothing more than exhibitions of movie violence and sickness and in that area the movie succeeds brilliantly it is so tasteless and so disgusting that its amazing that things like this ever get madeand not just for the animal mutilations or the feces flinging yeah that really happens in this movie its not just a tshirt for smartass teenagers or the orgies of misogynistic violence but of course there are tons of naked natives in the movie many of them obviously underage but i guess that is just not a concern in whatever country the movie was distributed from i am guessing we are meant to be impressed by the feeding scenes since logic would lead you to believe that that is what a cannibal film centers on if so maybe that explains why all the natives must smear their food all over their faces before they eat it although i am at a loss to explain why women are regularly mutilated dismembered fornicated with and then eaten it becomes clear early on that surely someone in the group of nyu people must snap unable to take what theyre seeing anymore and of course it does happenone guy since the natives distrust them maybe it was all that shooting decides to strip naked to become like them evidently this man has never seen the whiteness of his naked self before but the island girls dont seem to mind as soon as this awkward white guy strips off his khakis a whole group of naked girls run up to him and start grabassing for a little while hey maybe cannibals arent so bad after alloh but minutes later the group are forced to eat human as is to be expected the natives gleefully shove entrails in their faces as they inexplicably turn into savages for the purpose of this bizarre plot why the instant and total descent into barbarism i have no idea the movie isnt intelligent enough to explain such a thing all it knows how to do is show you something that you would be much better off never seeinga giant turtle is torn apart alive with bare hands while the cameraman zooms in for an extreme closeup so as not to miss a single revolting detail a monkey gets its face cut off a backwoods amputation is cauterized with a hot machete and when the poor amputee immediately dies the rest of the crew forget seconds later laughing and joking in the subsequent footage this is of course all documentary footage that theyre watching of a past film crew it seems that these mental giants went into the village and started screaming and shooting their guns and burning the village and then wondered why they were massacred it is not exactly a massive intellectual surge when one of the new crew says these people probably think were the savagesyeah what tipped you off the burning of their village or the fornicating in the ashes clearly this is meant to be the movies thinly disguised message white people are savages at least as much as the people that we think of as savages oh and in case you didnt happen to catch that message when it smacked you in the head numerous times like a ton of bricks at one point the civilized people grab one of the native girls and rape her trying to show her the errors of her ways cleverthese people are nothing like any manner of civilized people they are absolute degenerates and should be imprisoned they even shout for joy when they find a woman impaled on a pole what the hell is this garbagebut in watching a movie like this it seems to me that it is the people that would make and distribute something like this that are the savages at least horror movies are fun even bad ones and this is not a bad horror movie its not a horror movie at all i dont know what you would call it but it is truly horrible a mother gives birth to an infant in the movie for example the baby is taken away from its mother drenched in blood and then buried in the mud while the mother is beaten to death with rocks there is a point in the movie where the utterly talentless writer evidently unaware of how breathtakingly obvious his story is has one of his characters spoonfeed you the real meaning of the movietoday people want sensationalism the more you rape their senses the happier they arethis sentence betrays a staggering lack of understanding of filmgoing audiences but at least it is a flawless description of the thought behind the movie too bad you have to watch it to learn that you should never have watched it,cruel
although no people were hurt in the making of this film a number of animals were unnecessarily torturedthis film should therefore be banned we cannot permit people to make entertainment from the pain of our fellowcreaturesa rat was skinned on camera squealing in paina turtle was decapitated dismembered and eatena monkey was trapped and had its face cut off with a machetealthough i have no problem with the depiction of violence in films and i do not believe that free speech should be subject to censorship this film indeed goes to far free speech does not include torture,cruel
and im including krakatowa powers and the geyserettes 1997 in there has always enjoyed that special sort of notoriety that comes from been banned in various territories but whereas some movies get the cull for reasons of selfcensorship or cultural sensitivity a clockwork orange for example holocaust is a thick soup of voyeuristic demented violence and gore  censored despite the fact that the sort of people whod want to see it more than once are precisely the type of malforms that will get a copy anyway whereas most others would either chose not to watch it or start to and realise that its a load of old crap indeed its got internal organs galore but curiously no brains banning it serves no purpose other than to give it an aura it doesnt deserve it is when all the hype is cut away say like the guts of a giant turtle a supremely souldestroying pointless experience artistically worthless the only reason to watch it at all is to see how much worse its going to get and im not spoiling anything for you by saying that your looking at quite a scale and the journey is long and tough the story or hook if you like is that some movie makers go into the jungle encounter a tribe of base savages who eat their fellow man and get horribly brutalised murdered and consumed but luckily for us the whole thing is captured on film this is preblair witch stuff with a great deal more calories conceived by deodato the wouldbe snuff peddler when those directors were chestlunching to say that ol holocaust is hard going is just ever so understating the case many movies claim to be a difficult watch but in this case the real holocaust might have been a preferable experience men and women have equal reason to fear its many stomach churning sequences for the boys itll be the scene in which some poor sod has his penis excised from his genital space and eaten while the baying mob disembowel him alive girls sit back and look forward to the woman mounted vaginally on a spear scene and lets not forget the animal snuff pigs monkeys turtles  you name it they get it if youve always thought that babe was missing the scene in which he gets the bullet or that finding nemo might have worked better with a display of turtle guts then this is the flick youve been waiting your whole life to see scalped monkeys are the perfect antidote to all those cutesy born free type movies weve had to suffer over the years but the directors a brave man because if the alf ever see this hell need to be checking the underside of his car with a mirror for life there was a lot of nonsense when this was made about it being snuff and those sensitive italians didnt like the animal slaughter this is the nation that invented fascism but the authorities may have wondered why youd release a film that portrayed you murdering your cast its damning evidence after all  why not just murder them in the end the only people who really get slayed are the audience but not in a funny way  if its this or while you were sleeping its still the bullock moviebut only just of course,cruel
i hate to talk about the films that i hate but a person who loves movies dont have any alternative for that reason as i enjoy talk about the movies that i love i think that sometimes i can talk about the films that i hate but this time is the hated film until this moment i dont think that anyway suppers this piece of garbagecannibal holcaust is about 4 filmmakers who do documentaries 3 men and a woman who go to the deep jungle in south american to film about the different hide cannibal groups that i think that now are extinct the supposed filmmakers dont appear time later a doctor go in their search only for found that they are eaten by the cannibals but they found too a tape then back in the city the doctor try to convince then to others that the film not must be showed and we going to see whyfor much this film is one of the best ever made  for me and for much others this is just a exploitation film that go to the extreme disguised as a social film if you see the real intentions of ruggero deodato it was only to make a cannibal film but not as a social commentary if only as a horror film i can say that this film is not even bad of course that its wonderful that movies treat social topics about different cultures about media abuse and domination for that you can see shock treatment or network seems to bring that message but really dont its only another gore film that dont have any intent more than give repulsive moments the film dont have any intelligent horror this film dont going to scare you it goes to make revolve your stomachfor me is trash is not cinema and is not art not even a regular soundtrack by riz ortolani can save it and much time i get surprised seeing all the people who defends a movie like this of course is likes and i respect them and believe me i always try to dont say bad commentaries of films so quickly but i dont see any reason to save itat all if you want to see an horrible film totally inhuman with real animals which suffer until death it is worth to clarify that all the polemic of real human deaths was just rumors and is not truth this is the film for you if you want real art a real social commentary a real horror film or just a good film dont even think about it dont watch itsoldier warned dont die at warsorry for the mistakeswell if there any,cruel
is garbage at its absolute worstfirst off this film is commonly referred to as disturbing truly the only two things truly disturbing about this flick are the animal killings and the appalling atrocious acting directing and writing first there was absolutely no need to have actors kill real animals this is hack work both literally and figuratively at its absolute worst at the sacrifice of defenseless beasts watching a turtle get decapitated and eviscerated does not fall into the category of enjoyable viewing for meas for everything else in this film what a crude barbaric amateurish attempt at filmmaking people talk about the special effects as being so convincing i was so convinced in fact when i saw the cannibals blatantly miss stabbing the girl with their spears that i would have laughed had i not been so awestruck by just how pathetic this movie is and why oh why are these documentarians out to destroy villages kill innocent villagers and rape women arent documentary makers supposed to avoid interacting in the fates of their subjects the four filmmakers were so obnoxious and downright cruel and evil that i actually enjoyed when the cannibals killed and ate themdeodatos masterwork is a cheapjack con job which in the hands of a talented director could have been disturbing im only disturbed that i took 1 hour and 37 minutes to watch this atrocious garbage when i could have been saving a turtle,cruel
its pretty sad people call this art this was just disgusting im not a person who dislikes gore i can stand it and i like it im not some animal rights pusher i support it but if it were me or the dog the dog would die now this was just truly disgusting and cruel they did things to these animals that is so i want to cry horrible i just think what was the unimaginable pain of that muskrat or the turtle or the monkey and fing a vgin with a wooden stake wtf who sits down and comes up with this and if you do you dont film it i love artistic movies like the tracey fragments and the blair witch project but this was by no means art this was a journey through a disgusting slaughterhouse what saddens me is that you people act as if it werent real well honey those animals died for you entertainment now thats what i call art,cruel
truly is one of the most disturbing and uncomfortable films ive ever had to sit through released in 1980 has gained a reputation over the years as being one of the most controversial films ever made and rightfully so its hard to recommend a film like this especially considering all of the brutal onscreen violence rape dismemberment genital mutilation and real animal killings however whether youre a fan of it or not you have to admit it is a very well made film from its shocking visuals to its griddy realism is a very effective film that successfully gets its point across it shows us a very ugly dark side of humanity which most people would like to believe doesnt exist the movie also has quite a sporadic fan base with famous directors like oliver stone quentin tarantino and sergio leone all supposedly being confessed fans of it if youre looking for a fun horror film to watch with friends this is definitely not one of them its very unsettling and makes you feel horrible after viewing it this movie is not for the squeamish faint of heart or easily offended only recommended to the most hardcore of horror fans you have been warned,cruel
ruggero deodatos repulsive masterpiece in horror is probably the most controversial horror film in existence ive heard and read about it for about five years before finally sitting down and watching the uncut version the delay was through my own fear of not having a strong enough stomach to be able to sit through the endless scenes of barbarity and sadism the film strongly divides audiences and i too am divided in my opinion of it as a piece of entertainment it doesnt work at all because the downbeat nature of the narrative and the graphic gore can hardly be enjoyed but then the film must work as a horror film a true horror film that can evoke feelings of anger disgust even sickness and fear undoubtedly the novel filming methods after the deliberately slow pacing of the initial setup the latter half of the movie becomes a mock documentary as in the blair witch project and just as horrifying make it the best of its bunch and the most effective of them all its the only cannibal film that comes close to resembling a mondo movie and the final events involving the student filmmakers are truly and horribly believable the only way to watch this film is to live the lie and the result is a challenging and disturbing but somehow rewarding viewing experiencethe movie is professionally made in that the filming seems unprofessional lacking gloss and shine and therefore more realistic the various expeditions into the jungle simply convey the humid atmosphere the constant danger from deadly wildlife and hidden tribes the first half of the film is slowly paced and gradually builds up to the horror with glimpses at a maggoty skeleton the camera zooms into the grubinfested eye sockets of the rotting skull and a tribal rape which is effectively powerful stuff however in comparison to the last half an hour this is childs play the supposedly real video footage shot by the students is harrowing and disturbing but doesnt engage the senses as much as one might think  mainly because the students themselves are far worse than the cannibal tribes they seek their actions are a catalogue of torture rape and even worse as they impale an innocent girl on a spike a painfully realistic  but simple  special effect and burn down a whole native village for the hell of it actions which of course act as a catalyst for the ugly conclusionevery five minutes something pops up which is likely to offend or shock a viewer somewhere whether it be graphic moments of sexual violence possibly the hardest parts of the film to sit through or at least the most uncomfortable or cheap but realistic gore effects of people having their legs sliced off and the like the cannibal antics of the finale are the most powerful part of the film as the filmmakers keep on shooting for the love of their documentary this is as horrible as the film gets and will have most viewers breaking out in a cold sweat blurring the border between fantasy and reality includes a segment of real news footage showing africans getting burnt and shot which is very hard to watchharder still to stomach are the scenes of animal cruelty the bane of this particular genre nobody can enjoy watching such scenes but they do add considerably to the films false reputation of being a snuff movie and their inclusion adds to the powerful impact that the film has on viewersproductionwise the quality is topnotch director ruggero deodato proves himself at the pinnacle of his career and directs the film he will be remembered for forever the camerawork is authentic and the acting works especially in the case of the student filmmakers who fill out their roles very well indeed muchneeded light relief comes from robert kerman eaten alive as the pipesmoking professor monroe who acts as the audience in viewing the discovered footage and who gets to utter the immortal line i wonder who the real cannibals are at the films conclusion the most effective aspect of the film is undoubtedly riz ortolanis emotive score which really adds to the overall impact that the film has its frankly brilliant like it or hate it is a film with a lasting reputation and i personally think its an original and deeply disturbing slice of almost reallife horror its a wonderful exploration of the medias obsession with violence and the lengths to which theyll go to exploit it and in this sense its like the 80s version of the controversial thriller natural born killers,cruel
lies within the annals of the horror genre with an immense reputation looming over it i like many had heard various things about the film over the years with the most general common threads being that it was disgusting and utterly abhorrent watching it for the first time i actually didnt know what the film was about and my assumptions of it being a mindless splatterfest were slowly eroded over the course of the film aside from being utterly shocked by its raw depiction of violence i was simultaneously shocked by the density of its social thematics and the skilled presentation of its imagerythe film essentially focuses on an nyu anthropology professor who travels to the amazon to observe local cannibal tribes and comes back with footage from a group of young documentarians who filmed there several months earlier before disappearing ruggero deodato presents the film in a framed narrative which tells the story of the anthropology professor as well as the persons whose footage he has obtained which is presented to us in its gritty 8mm format cinma vrit style the double narrative is just one of many unusual and interesting things happening in this film but its worth noting because its remarkably well balanced as has been noted there is a jarring sense of realism to the cinematography comparisons have been made to national geographic pictorials which i believe are apt comparisons as i at times felt like i was watching a national geographic documentary gone terribly terribly wrong narratively there are shades of joseph conrad lurking under the surface which come into play particularly during the problematic last half of the film in which the social commentary comes to the forefront its up to you whether or not the message is lost in its gratuitous translation and even then the message itself is problematic and loaded with historical implications that run deeper than the film can accommodate but it is no less a noble and impressionistic effort in forcing its audience to think about what they have just seenthe violence oh yes the violence its gruesome no doubt but i think its actually less graphic than most people believe it to be the reason it is so disturbing is because it is presented so unflinchingly and the special effects themselves are shockingly impressive far more grit and realism than something youd see in a lucio fulci film of the time period there is actual filmed murder of animals which is an entire issue in and of itself and something that did irk me as someone who has a moral position against killing animals did i like it of course not who would in a film of such horrendous subject matter though it is oddly fitting problematic in so many ways yes but i do believe there is a significance to seeing actual death on film of animals considering how removed most people are about what killing a living creature actually looks likeoverall i got way more than i bargained for with its a film whose moral implications run far deeper than the gorefest reputation it has attained and that was something that caught me completely off guard its uncompromising and often scarily realistic and above all else makes a confused albeit profound statement about what it means to live on this savage planet 910,cruel
the original purpose of the video nasties list drawn up in the uk in the 1980s was to assuage media driven hysteria originating from movies in the unregulated video market and with explicit and exploitative depictions of gore andor sex and which as a result were seen as a threat to public morality these days it all seems ever so shrugworthy as stripped of the hysteria most video nasties invariably fail to have any effect on the viewer and are revealed to be the bad films they are bucks this trend in a major way in both having an intelligent point to express about humanitys savagery as relevant then as much as now and doing so in a manner which despite some patchy acting and directing retains the power to challenge and shock even the more jaded modern film buff ie methe plot of the movie sees professor monroe travel into the south american jungle to find out what happened to a group of three documentary film makers who have gone missing he eventually finds a primitive tribe who seem to have the documentary crews lost film reels and through befriending the tribe manages to retrieve them back in the city the filmreels are shown to some executives and the full horrors of the expedition are revealed so far so typical exploitation video nastybut both the realistic depiction of some of the horrors via the found footage format which this movie basically started and which would go onto to spawn the likes of the blair witch project 1999 and cloverfield 2008 are so well done that there is a story that upon finishing the film and returning to italy the director was suspected of actually killing the actors in the film and had to track them down to prove that it was not a snuff film apocryphal or not the story captures the mood of the film and indeed the animal cruelty scenes are actually real and may sincerely disturb some viewershowever the violence is not for no good reason the movie is not about entertainment in any respect and instead sets out to provoke the audience into looking at society with a critical eye as well casting the same critical eye on our own dirty reflections the film does this by playing with the sympathies of the audience and showing that rather than the cannibals being the primitive savages we imagine them to be at the outset the civilized filmmakers and executives are equally if not more barbaric and heartless furthermore the film avoids the trap of heavyhanded moralizing and instead shows the sickness and brutality inherent in us all heavy stuff and really not for those of a nervous disposition or those who delight in typical video nasty splatterfest romps,cruel
i really loved aspects of it was far gorier and shocking then any of other of the so called video nasties ive watched so far and it was put together with aplomb although this wasnt the first film to use fake documentary footage its incredibly realistic and undoubtedly bought the technique to a mainstream audience influencing if not directly the last broadcast the blair witch project and cloverfield much like the blair witch project it was deliberately implied during promotion of the film that the four documentary filmmakers were not actors and that the recovered footage shown in the film was real unlike the blair witch project this claim is slightly preposterous as half of the film is shot in a traditional cinematic waythe gore in is at times incessant but still manages to maintain its realism and shock factor one infamous scene shows a woman impaled on a tall wooden stake the spike protruding through her mouth the effect was so realistic the filmmakers had to explain how it was achieved in court to avoid a murder charge the marketing trick of blurring the line between fantasy and reality obviously worked on the italian authoritiesis a damning criticism of the medias tendency to focus on horrific images when covering war and violent conflict at the time various news agencies had been accused of faking such images to improve ratings more broadly the film questions who is more uncivilised the cannibals with their unusual and primal rituals or the civilised filmmakers who exploit them for ratings and cheap shocksalthough often lacking in subtlety s script makes its point well especially during the last half of the movie when the viewer is shown the recovered reels of films these scenes are narrated by the disapproving professor ensuring that even a ten year old can understand the underlying point of the film the documentary makers not only exploit the tribes by filming their day to day rituals in a lurid manner but they also interfere terrorise murder and rape the tribes people to elicit responses for them to film when the documentary makers discover the woman impaled on a spike the cameraman has to tell one of the men on film to stop smiling he cant help showing his glee at finding something so horrific to capture on celluloidthe original cut of the film lingers on a depressing amount of animal cruelty presumably because its a cheap way to make the viewer question what is real and what is fake after all these crazy uncivilised tribes will cut anything up for some wacky ritual or a quick bite the films just showing what happens in the real world rightand this alludes to my problem with how can one point the finger at media for exploitation when the filmmakers themselves think its acceptable to film an extended sequence of giant turtle being caught decapitated and gutted just for a cheap thrill how can they justify cutting a live monkeys face off twice to get all the shots required in the name of art or to make a political point the filmmakers are either completely naive or worse making a film they know is exploitative and immoral using the political message as a getout clause something to excuse the barbaric and stupid stupid stupid animal cruelty its heartening to read interviews with the directors and actors expressing remorse for using animal cruelty but this doesnt excuse itis in parts a fun film but it cant escape its own hypocrisy its a shame that the animal cruelty happened because without it the film would be a sure fire classic,cruel
what can i say  i would like to rate this movie a 20 out of 10 for the pure horrofying shocking heart devouring impact it had on me and a 50 out of 10 for its attempt to approach the reality of a documentary  because at first thats what i thought it was  but then i read somewhere that in the making of this movie the animals were actually tortured and that this part was no se work in total six animals are brutally killed on screen  a large screaming coatimundi often mistaken as a muskrat is stabbed multiple times in the neck by an actor  a large turtle about three feet long is captured in the water and dragged to shore where it is then decapitated and its limbs and shell removed the actors proceed to cook and eat the turtle  a large spider is killed with a machete  a snake is killed with a machete  a squirrel monkey is captured by a native actor portraying a tribesman who cuts the monkeys face off with a machete while it is struggling and then eats the brains  a pig is kicked and then killed with a rifle when shot in the head by an actoralthough im the kinda guy that likes to be shocked now and then and have his blood being pumped faster through his veins by a film this is not quite what im looking for when i consult the horror section when i found out a couple of years ago that ch was not a real documentary of people molesting hammer smashing killing and eating each other that was a relieving thought and a weight of my chest and heart however i will not support any film that includes the intentional harming of a creature in order to capture its screamings in pain on tape sickening  no thanks,cruel

i wont go over the plot for two reasons one the less you know about a horror film going in the better and two the plot is almost legendary by now so youve probably heard about it already with that said heres a very quick summary to get you started some people film a documentary they disappear the footage is found later and watchedthis movie was disturbing the deaths are realistically shot and the grainy stock footage quality plus the believability of the situation makes it truly shocking and horrific but that didnt warrant the 1 i gave it horror films true horror films are supposed to be shocking  thats their nature films that make people take that force people to participate in debate because of their extreme nature always are a good thing movies are there to provoke reaction anything less is failure on the part of the filmmakersso in that respect it was a stirring successhowever there are scenes of animals being tortured then killed now this alone would have been fine and would have added to the films horrorhad it been faked like the deaths of the people it wasnt every bit of animal torture and death is real the animals died all for a movie and thats shocking for all the wrong reasonsso i was forced to give it a 1 and if it was possible a 0 people have made the argument that the pain and suffering incurred by the animals were warranted because of the pain and suffering that goes on in the wild everyday amongst the predators and their prey this is a bad analogy predators kill and eat their prey because they have to they need to kill and eat to live the filmmakers tortured and killed these animals to make a 70s horror movie see a difference the fact that the tribe ate the animals afterward is inconsequential  it wasnt necessary and if its not necessary theres absolutely no excusehorror movie lovers will undoubtedly like this film for its uncompromising brutality logical minds who think about the real deaths wont,cruel
this is a bad movie do not believe anyone who claims any of the followingthe gore effects are so realistic this movie has a powerful message the music in this movie is so haunting its amazing the acting is so excellentthis movie falls apart under the weight of its own pompousness filled with an annoyingly high sense of selfimportance and selfrighteousness the entire movie plays out like some twisted morality play that takes itself far too seriously the acting is pretty terrible from start to finish particularly the doomed film crew yes i know that italian films are filmed without sound and dubbed in post it doesnt matter ive seen many italian films using that method that featured excellent performances there is not one performance in this movie that comes anywhere near acceptable much less decent the performances are so bad that i couldnt even be compelled to dislike the film crew i just didnt care the music is annoying phil glasstype garbage and it sounds like two pieces were written and deodato alternates between the two anyway the same music is featured over and over again with no variation another element inspiring apathy its one thing to have a theme that plays throughout a films score but to use the same piece of music ad nauseum is another completely the music becomes gratingly annoying by the end of the film and when the movie ends the end of that awful music is just one reason you are glad the movie is overapparently im the only person to ever see this movie and think the gore effects are incredibly unconvincing the gore effects fooled me never for a second nor did they even inspire me to suspend disbelief or become squeamish like the eyesquishing from kill bill 2 as for the animal slaughterings im no member of peta but these are completely unnecessary the muskrat killing is particularly hateful purposely drawn out for no other reason than for shock purposes perhaps deodato was sending a subliminal message about how watching this movie will make you suffer like this unlucky muskratin the end after watching this movie the only reaction i experienced was that this movie was two hours of my life that i will never get back,cruel
political correctness is not something i usually expect to see in an italian cannibal gutmuncher flick and theres none to be found in but the filmmakers would like you to think theres some in there and that in a way actually hinders what could have been a really powerful movienot that isnt outrageously violent and extremely disturbing at times but like so many other serious exploitation movies eg salo men behind the sun the filmmakers go so far over the top depicting the spilling of blood and guts that whatever points they purport to want to make are drowned in their own gruesome sensationalismthis is especially counterproductive in because it is the very thing that director ruggero deodatto claims to be satirizing the movie lacks the sophistication of george romeros dawn of the dead or stanley kubricks clockwork orange two similar movies which tackle their social commentary with wit and styleits similar to and better than oliver stones natural born killers in that it claims to be a satire of the medias passion for presenting violence and depravity to audiences who eat it up while its really just an exploitation of it deodatto like stone smacks you over the head with a bludgeon making his points so obviously and selfrighteously that they go right out the window and the movie winds up being little more than a freakshow of eyepopping special effects and nauseating live animal slaughterthe animal slaughter in is especially offensive more so than any other of this odd subgenre because most of it is perpetrated by the explorers and not the supposedly real native cannibal tribe in cannibal ferox and jungle holocaust one can make an attempt to condone the violence against animals only because it appears to be committed by jungle dwelling people as part of their natural routine one cannot make the same excuse for but if youre looking for outlandish sleaze and carnage look no further than its definitely a mustsee for any selfrespecting cannibal movie fan everyone else should steer way way clearit was obviously an inspiration for both the last broadcast and the blair witch project,cruel
stay away from this poorly directed and acted snuff film if you like watching real animals being murdered for on screen entertainment then you should have your state of mind reviewed this film crosses into snuff territory for the sake of failed attempts at hyperrealism but unlike the french film base moi and pornography where you assume all participants are willing in scenes of extreme violence or sex the director deodato crosses the line and films the screams of an innocent jungle creature as an actor rips its guts open other animals are killed later but i couldnt be bothered watching such cruelty for the sake of what this film discredits the horror genre and is an actual cause for censorship something that doesnt sit well with any lover of films and especially horror films do yourself a favor and dont part with any money towards grindhouse realeasing who are making money off this vile maggot infested mess,cruel
going into a film like its difficult to know what to expect anyone who has any interest has read all the hype  the most disturbing movie ever made banned in 60 countries real animal killings director ruggero deodato had to go to court to prove the human killings werent real etc what i didnt expect to discover was such a wellmade film parts of the film are indeed very brutal and at times difficult to watch there are images in the film that i wont soon forget the story is incredibly compelling because it is so real tribes of indians similar to the ones presented in this film did and in some cases do exist in the south american rain forests i suppose that if someone were looking for a deep meaning to deodatos film they might point to the man vs nature aspects of the film where nature is represented not just by the animals but by the natives as well i suppose one could find something in the notion of who the real savages are  the natives or the filmmakers who exploit them but the most amazing thing about is that somehow deodato has made it very beautiful,cruel

youve got horrorand then youve horror with a capital h and surely belongs in this last category its a misunderstood masterpiece that yet has to find an equal unlike the savage and schlock title leads you to believe theres much more to discover in this film than just gore bad dubbing and shocking rites in the very first place its a portrait of extremes the socalled civilized world versus the savage tribes in the columbian rainforest in a subtle way ruggero deodato asks the question who the real cannibals are in this filmthose whore just following their traditional and ancients lifestyles or those whore full of disrespect and willing to sacrifice everything in order to shoot a controversial story the basic plot handles about a young filmcrew who mysteriously vanished while shooting an anthropology documentary their footage is retrieved by a university professor robert kerman and hes given the chance to broadcast the documentary after all butthe horrible and inhuman truth as shown by the recovered footage explains the crews disappearance more clearly and it questions severely whether they deserve a tribute or not a funny detail to this movie is that it more or less spoofs exploitative filmmaking while its practically an exploitation film itself nonetheless the film is surprisingly professionally made with a terrific cinematoghrapy and good editing the most barbaric sequences become unforgettable thanks to the magnificent and intense musical score by riz ortolani enjoys an immense cultstatus in cinema and its one of the only films who deserves this for a 100 im not going to debate whether the vicious animalkilling scenes are real or not because frankly i dont care and they contribute a lot in the breathtaking realism and effectiveness of this film should be avoided by the fainthearted whining moralists and easily offended pansiesall the rest of you watch deodatos greatest achievement and acknowledge its power,cruel
why everyone say so good things of a worthless garbage as this it is just pure sadomasochism and shows that some sick people should never be able to direct moviesthe gore fans hail this movie and keep saying that it had a deep story we should add hypocrisy to the bad things of this moviebecause if the message of this movie is against sensationalism then why this movie just feed it with morbid publicity the big deal of this movie was the fake rumors that the people in this movie were really killed that wasnt true and only the animals were killed that cruelty doesnt not make this movie to be more realistic it only made it more disgustingthe acting is mediocre just as the story i guess thats because most of the cast only worked in porn movies before the script was incredibly pretentious and vainis in my opinion nothing more than overrated garbage directed by one talentless hack ruggero deodato a filmmaker who never made a single good filmi just dont understand why some people could say that this disgusting trash was something beautiful  yeahsure if you consider rape or see how a idiot open a turtle and show his organs in a full frontal scene as something nice to watch this is one of the worst movies ever made,cruel
ive watched this movie after seeing all the good comments reviews and the trivia section saying that the director was in prison and all i was mislead into thinking this might be a really good moviethe acting is bad i dont know why there are so many reviews saying that it is good the camera shake makes it look like its real but you can tell at the first glance that it is notthe plot is weak and the violence is not what i expected it is not brutal its just something that might look brutal and have an impact but in another movie with a different crewbasically if you would take aside the animal killing which is for real it doesnt bring anything to the movie and is just disgusting  i dont know how some people can enjoy watching that you would end up with a movie that doesnt make you feel anything no tension no disgust no fear no nothing just a waste of timeavoid at all costs,cruel
follows a film crew as they delve into the amazonian jungle and end up discovering the true meaning of horror this plot line sounds remarkably similar to the 1999 travesty the blair witch project but im pleased to say thats where the similarities end as the crew in the worst film ever made may well have found a true horror if thats what you consider a few sticks and stones to be but even so it doesnt even nearly compare to actual horror which is what the film crew in this film found is a remarkable horror film because unlike the majority of the rest of the genre this film depicts events that actually do take place in the world as the film claims towards the beginning theres so much we dont know about our own planet and the dense jungles of south america represent one of the greatest unknowns and therefore makes for a great setting for a movie it has to be said also that ruggero deodato makes best use of his location and as the actors venture into the jungle a constant foreboding atmosphere hangs over them which does the film no end of favours in the tension departmentone of the many things that this film is notorious for is the fact that the animal killings in the film are real this is something that i definitely dont like as i can honestly see no reason why animals should die just because ruggero deodato decided to make a movie its also shocking that the perpetrators of this animal cruelty werent sent down of course the animal deaths help the film because it adds to the atmosphere but really special effects would have sufficed the violence in the movie isnt all senseless however as the director does have a point to make at several points during the film comparisons are made with the cannibals and our society and the question that surfaces most often is who are the real cannibals this is where this movie comes into its own as one the surface its just a violent exploitation flick but beneath that its a rather potent comment on society the gore in the film is brutal and very realistic which is always nice for a horror fan such as myself to see if youre not a horror fan however is a film that you should stay away from but if you dont mind gore youre in for a rare treat with this movie its controversial for a reason and it really needs to be experienced,cruel
civilized mans heart of darkness is explored in this predecessor of the blair witch project about three young men and a young woman plus a guide who trek into the south american jungle with ulterior motives for a documentary and successfully find cannibals but with lessthansuccessful results  how about cannibal apocalypse for this one vs deodato comparable jungle holocaust unlike in the terrible blair witch however we see most of the characters most of the time and although they are distasteful they are certainly dramatically compelling there are juxtapositions of the goingson back home and the group of people that later track the expedition party but the search for and confrontation with the cannibals are the principal focus   deodato combines extremely graphic displays of depravity and violence torture and mutilation on men and women people and animals for their own sake with his efforts to communicate who is really the savage and succeeds on both counts  the explorers are young greedy and egomaniacal willing to do the ultimate in damage to living beings as a means to their own fame and fortune  the cheap highschool character and mindset of the explorers creating a false stage for themselves magnifies the presentation of the worst whiteman stereotype  they are just jerks and you enjoy disliking them  expectations and failure of the expedition are mirrored back home in civilization where presumptuosness and greed are also prevalent but then shattered as for the acting specifically the main three and partially the usually hidden camaraman it was amazingly convincing  it may be that the camerawithinthemovie contributed to this and was used skillfully in terms of distance and angles and selection to contribute to the realism of a relatively uncomplicated situation of people passing through a jungle but make no mistake about it yates and his companions are as believable as natural as they are repugnant  and the overall cinematography as well as the music was excellent  yes all this but paramount is just the opportunity to watch the scenes in the last part of the film unfold  you will not forget them,cruel

its not a film for everyone for obvious reasons but it is a film everyone should consider watching its very graphic and raw and well made thats what makes it so good at delivering its messagethe film ends with a question who the real cannibals arei think its referring to cannibalism as a way to take something from someone for your own benefit or amusementit can be literally eating people causing harm and suffering to get good footage or using that footage despite its moral contradictionsits a film about journalistic integrity difference between civilizations and similarities in the nature of man,cruel
is it real or is it fake no matter your view its realistic as hell your stomach will turn in this film there is no denying that but for some they can see past the blood and gore to reveal a truly iconic film i am one of those it does get full on more full on than its good for but without that extremity of violence and rape the film would be a monotone adventure through the amazon and no one wants a pg cannibal film expect to be grossed out and stunned as you watch real animals brutally ripped apart and male genitalia removed entertaining as hell to the people that can handle it and if you can handle there awaits a glorious expedition into the darkest areas of the secluded human race,cruel
its impossible to talk about without mentioning the blair witch project blair witch is wrongly labelled as inventing the found footage genre when in fact it simply rebooted it did it almost twenty years previouswe hear at the beginning how four young filmmakers travelled deep into the jungle only to never be heard from again a professor curious as to their fate retraces their path and finds their footage what you have here is two stories in one you have the more traditional hollywood storytelling of the professor talking to tv executives about showing the found footage on network television and the footage which was retrieved from the jungles first person ala blair witchi only got to see the edited uk version of this film but the footage both from the professor who follows them and the filmmakers themselves remains as shocking today as it was at the time was banned at the time of release and even had claims of being a stuff film ie one where real people are killed on camera this maybe untrue but viewers should be warned that although the people who die are all just covered in fake blood and prosthetics real animals were killed for the making of the film those with strong views on this may wish to steer clearhowever the animal cruelty is only fleeting what you have are pretty strong scenes of torture which make the hostel franchise seem tame in comparison the footage being shot in the eighties and on non professional cameras gives the film a deliberately raw feel about it which even the blair witch project cant even match plus you have the music which is both creepy and tranquil at the same timeas you have probably guessed the filmmakers on film meet a grisly end at the hands and teeth obviously of the cannibals in the jungle although where we probably felt sorry for those behind the camera in blair witch and other such films here the filmmakers were pretty horrible some may see that they got what they deservedits hard to enjoy this film in a traditional viewing sense yet it remains a deserved lynchpin in the horror genres historybottom line for those with strong stomachs onlyhttpthewrongtreemoviereviewsblogspotcouk,cruel
four college age kids disappear their footage is found what was once thought to be an amazing documentary ends being the most brutal representation of human monstrosityis shockingly brutal and gruesome if you didnt know the animals in this film were actually killed during filmmaking hence why its the most controversial film of all timeit feels completely ahead of its time with amazingly realistic images this is probably the most brutal film ive ever seenthe acting was very realistic the music and camera work help add to the eeriness of it allthis is basically the birth of the found footage subgenrewhile i agree what they did killing the animals was horrible and unforgivable i feel the director and actors should be held accountable but the movie itself should not be considered trash due to thatit has an amazing story thats really quite poetic questioning who are really the monsters if you can stomach it its a must see an american horror classicrecommended rating r for disturbing brutal violence including rape and animal cruelty graphic nudity and a strong sex scene,cruel
finding entertaining may well come down to personal boundaries of taste for is an uncompromising exercise in exploitation filmmaking about as far as you can take it it contains scenes of real animal cruelty which are far more sickening than the rehearsed acts of violence in the film it seems a common ingredient in a lot of cannibal films which have understandably been criticised and black listed because of it but for anybody to suggest it has any redeeming social commentary to make maybe looking too deeply into something that is simply not thereadmittedly deodato the director deserves his dues for an exploitation pic is a lot more crafty and manipulative than most and is certainly the better of a pretty awful bunch of movies but that doesnt mean its all that good in its own right either despite its shortcomings it does manage to effortlessly attract the curious like a bad roadside accident and has the same strange unclean and hard to ignore quality which ultimately becomes a nauseating experience leaving the viewer wondering why the hell they are watching this sickening display something a few of the video nasties have in common the other being that most of them are plain trash recently has collected more of its fair share of attention with people pointing out similarities with the blair witch project and its use of lost footage and a storyline of a film crew ending up in st creek down in the woods or in this case the jungle unfortunately this is giving the cannibal film a bit of cheap publicity riding on the back of the more recent genuine bit of clever student film making that blair witch is personally i believe should remain an obscure oddity because a film that delights in animal torture has no right to be more than even that  like i said in the beginning i guess its a question of taste or lack of it if you are on the look out for some kind of queer cheap thrill some may find in the carnage of an autoaccident which lets face it can be pretty horrific if youre into that kind of thing or perhaps you are simply intrigued by so many peoples comments you may be suckered in by attempting to find this movie but on the other hand if deodatos disregard for both human and animal life sickens you and i hope it does as much as the director relished putting it up there on screen i can only hope youre choice in whether to watch is more of a thoughtful than voyeuristic one,cruel
i pretty much saw here what i expected to see in a cretinous cheap italian exploitation horror film mutilation rape cannibalism of course authentic footage of animals being killed for the camera killing humans is still illegal so the filmmakers didnt do that as well decapitation a pointless sex scene with a flatchested italian woman and other idiotic stuffto all the losers on imdb and elsewhere who found social meaning in this id say keep in mind 3 things 1 this is an exploitation film and such films by definition pretend to have a higher moral agenda as an obvious excuse to help the viewer indulge in the basest of nonsense 2 this is a dumb horror film look no further than the violence and gore for meaning and 3 youre a fking moronwell we have the usual problems idiotic plot bad acting inept dialogue lousy photography stereotypical characterization clumsy editing etc the only surprise came in the form of the professor coming back to ny ie the unexpected change of setting but thats also when things took a decidedly imbecilic turn just so we can enjoy the eventual brutal slaying of the 4person missing crew they are presented to us as the worst kind of barbarians imaginable like a bunch of immoral immature criminals shouting and giggling like apes half the time  no strike that all of the time is this the horrormovie answer to animal house one might wonder who in the world would finance such a retarded bunch to film each other tying shoelaces let alone make documentaries in remote regions of the world in the end these 4 imbeciles actually end up filming each other getting slaughtered  instead of running for their lives  just so we can see each of them die its just too stupid for words severely retarded not to mention the fact that these 4 have no fear about invoking the wrath of remote tribes they know nothing about by raping their women and burning their huts and yet theyre supposed to be professionals who worked together for years ie should know better than to behave like degenerate dumb schoolkidspredictably the professor gets the last line with his ultrapathetic comment who are the real barbarians here i guess this line made all those morons think this movie had an intelligent message how easily suckered some people are into believing anything they see or hearthere was nothing shocking here because all the parts that show violence perpetrated on people are so fakelooking totally unconvincing the exceptions are the real footage the bozos who made this junk included of various executions in africa footage which is ironically referred to as fake by one of the ny characters however i was disgusted by the authentic scenes of animals getting butchered that sort of material shouldnt even be used in crap like this but left for faces of death and some such junk,cruel

an excellent film and by far the best of the cannibal genre the first half chronicling monroes journey to find the lost filmmakers is typical jungle survivalist stuff combating the elements and assorted wildlife while snorting a few lines of coke and frolicking naked in the nearest river it is the second half of the movie in which we see the documentary footage shot by the missing filmmakers in which shines the shaky handheld camera the straighttocamera delivery the choppy editing the varying focus and poor framing all add to a genuine sense of authenticity the whole thing makes blair witch which copied the conceit 20 years later seem extremely staged and phony by comparison the visual effects are outstanding and made all the more effective due to the realism of the filmmaking techniqueperformances despite others criticism are surprisingly sound and well above the norm for the genre only francesca ciardi possesses that laughable and vaguely embarrassing bad acting quality but her real purpose is of course to wander around naked which she does very well the script is linear and makes sense with none of the usual surreal leaps of logic and cavernous plot holes the music in cannibal movies is often unusually good and of a quality far beyond expectations s score is brilliant ranging from mellow 70s easy listening to traditional full orchestra suspense to modern abstract soundscapes while i miss the raucous chords of donatimagliones score for mangiati vivi and cannibal ferox theres no denying that riz ortalani is a far more talented composeras ever there is the usual moral message with characters spouting pseudoliberal nonsense whilst gazing profoundly into the middle distance this is of course as much a part of the genre as ritual gang rape and mud wrestling but in it is particularly hypocritical considering the obvious amorality of all involved while condemning the on screen filmmakers for encouraging acts of cruelty and violence deodarto encourages his actors to indulge in similar acts of cruelty and violence towards animals in the name of entertainment without the usual moral justification of observing tribal acts of survival whilst such scenes dont really harm the movie they make a mockery of any message deodarto may claim to convey and ask some serious questions about the ethics of both him and his castreally a very good movie that were it stripped of its scenes of animal cruelty would enjoy far more popular success isnt just good for the genre but a good movie in general and far more original and entertaining that anything seen in cinemas of late,cruel
what a surprise i sat down to watch a splatter film on a saturday night after the pub and found myself having to think and form an opinion i knew my thinking was not that straight after the beer so i watched it again the following day stone cold sober and i found i really liked this film it was not what i had expected the acting was not that bad the sound and filming acceptable in fact i really liked the music but it was the story that held me you really do side with the cannibals actually i would have made the film crew suffer a bit more they become more savage then the savages the savages do not break their societys codes the film crew leave very few of their societies codes unbroken this is a good film watch it if you must for the gore then try again as i did for the story and moral,cruel
has the name of being one of the most shocking movies ever made although it sure does live up its name of being shocking im not sure if its the most shocking because i never saw that many shocker flicks but i bet some mondo flicks are worse but the gore isnt really what make this movie so powerful and shocking the rape is worse but that isnt really he key element neither this movie isnt all about the gorerape it tries to shock you by putting you in the jungle with the crew and showing you what they did how purely evil they actually were offcourse it is fake but sometimes you really believe its all realone of the most shocking scenes had no gore or rape in it it just showed you how far these people would go for some images the most direct criticism of the movie was directed towards the makers of mondo cane shocumentaries ironically the makers did sort of the same by slaughtering a total of 6 animals in front of the camera even though this is offcourse gross and shouldnt have happened you should realize this is nothing at what happens on daily basis in our civilized community i am a vegetarian not without reason even thought the animals in this one are killed pretty brutality they died a quick death compared to the animals in the bioindustry but im rattling and probably boring you so lets get back to the movie the movie is about a crew of 4 3 men 1 woman who decide to go into the jungle of southern america the green inferno to search for 2 cannibal tribes in war they never came back and a rescue expedition is organized after a subtle progression in the green inferno they find the remains of the crew and the cans of film back in nyc a big tv company wants to air the material but the professor that was on the expedition knows what the material shows and tries to convince the tv dudes by showing them the most gruesome footage this includes a total of 5 scenes of rape a shtload of gore mutilation and other stuff that would surely gross out the average personthis movie isnt something you watch with a cup o tea with your parents you should realize before watching it that it does have some very intense and graphic images make sure you can take it and watch it it will be worth it very powerful intense and very well made movie never mind the acting its terrible with maybe an exception here and there it will leave you thinking about it for the next few days810,cruel
rugero deodatos controversial masterpiece of 1980 is without exaggeration certainly one of the most disturbing films ever brought to screen and an utterly brilliant and stunning cinematic experience that no one who is not too sensitive for this can afford to miss gruesome disturbing and brilliant but often misunderstood is not the average 80s cannibal exploitation flick one might expect but an utterly unique stroke of genius that can not really be compared to any other movie begins when new york anthropology professor harold monroe robert kerman is sent to the south american jungle in order to investigate the disappearance of a team of documentary film makers known for their hazardous journeys in order to achieve original footage filmmakers alan yates carl gabriel yorke faye daniels fraqncesca giardi jack anders perry pirkanen and mark tomaso luca barbareschi have disappeared after traveling to he amazon jungle in order to make a documentary about the green inferno where the last cannibal tribes are reputed to live i dont want to spoil the most brilliant moments of this masterpiece so in case you havent seen it i advise you not o read on but to rent or even better buy he uncut version and watch it as quickly as possible it is impossible to explain why this movie is so brilliant without giving away parts of the plot sowarning spoilers ahead  is a stunning film from the beginning but what makes this movie such an outstandingly brilliant masterpiece is its second half in which we become aware that it is actually not the socalled savages who are the monsters but the ambitious film makers who dont have the slightest scruples to murder rape mutilate and commit all sorts of abhorrent atrocities in order to get shocking footagesince its release this film has been one of the most controversial maybe the most controversial and widely condemned films ever made moralists have condemned it for the violence and because they misunderstood the movie furthermore the likes of animal protectors who probably dont give a damn about human rights but who scream murder as soon as a rat gets hurt keep complaining about the real animal killings in the movie this is debatable of course but i find it to be legitimate the animals were actually eaten by the crew and the scenes do add a raw and shocking mood worst of all ruggero deodato was even accused of actually killing human beings for his movie which was of course proved to be absolute nonsense and which is even more outrageous regarding the fact that it is the main aim of this film to criticize the unscrupulousness of some mediaend of spoilers  the raw and unique atmosphere in is built by the shocking story and documentarystyle filmmaking as well as some great camera work and the mesmerizing score by riz ortolani the performances are furthermore great and very authentic i can understand that this is too brutal and disturbing for many people and those who are easily offended should definitely avoid this film but to all others this is a mustsee director ruggero deodato created something incomparably shocking brilliant and unique and as far as i am considered alone makes deodato a genius all said is a stunning disturbing brilliant and absolutely unique masterpiece of filmmaking that not only horror fans but every serious lover of cinema who isnt too easily offended must see brilliant 1010,cruel
going into i was anticipating an exploitation movie with really nothing to share besidesbasically what everyone hears about the movie i did not expect the movie to give you options on how you feel i was expecting to be disgusted and disturbed i did feel both of those feelings but i felt much more the movie takes itself 100 serious with its morals its production especially the music everything this movie unfortunately is looked down upon by people just because of what they hear about it i also was tentative to seeing this movie because of a certain aspect  the animal killings they are killed for a purpose which they say in the movie they even have a scene where an actor is repulsed by the death every killing was done fast except one which was the one that bothered me most it was not the turtle one that still bothered me thoughwhile watching a movie sometimes you know that this could be about as perfect as they can make it this is one of those times it is a masterpiecei think sometimes that if they only had a different name for the movie more people would see it personally i love the title i find it to be badass but its such a hardcore title all you have to do is say it and you will see a cringe on someones facethe last line of the movie was exactly what you were supposed to think to yourself i have my answer thats for damn sure im again surprised that this quote is not as popular as it should be,cruel

someone loved it someone hated it ethically was a really well made film its not a gore fest or an animal dismember show it showed us that sometimes civilized guys like us could be worse than that senseless cannibals the plot and the cameras of this film made it a masterpiece just think about blair witch project and all the others horror movies that got the deodatos idea of the film inside a film the cast isnt exceptional it was a really low budget film starring some of the italians cabaret guys like barbareschi and sometimes it can be tasted by the viewer saying that this film is pointless just for some gore actions its stoopid in my humble opinion timing is perfect cameras are wonderful scenarios are great and the art direction is quite perfect even if you dont like it was a masterpiece many newer films copied it badly,cruel
i am not going to sit here and type out the reasons why this is not only the best cannibal film ever made one of the best horror films ever made and basically just a damn good film if youre reading one of the thousands of reviews on here chances are youve seen it and know why it is such a masterly structured and excellently made film and therefore you dont need me to tell you why it issuffice to say that this film is simply stunning the music direction camerawork plot and atmosphere are practically faultless and i recommend it to anyone who is a fan of horror or a fan of well made and clever films,cruel
one of the oddest pleasures in life is witness the work of a filmmaker who not just satisfies himself entertaining the audience achieves that after this trip to the deep corners of the savage nature of man its hard to forget ruggero deodatos masterpiece as a cyclic process in the late 70s and early 80s italian creators made for horror the same thing they did for the classic western in the 60s in 1974 tobe hooper created a savage tale inspired by ed gein murders the texas chainsaw massacre massacre shocked the audience for its raw cruel vision of the world but the ultimate piece of cruelty in film reached the surface some years laterruggero deodato was an exploitationdirector he could pick a movie of gladiators spaghettiwesterns or horror movies but for some strange design he ended up directing one of the most extreme violent and gritty films ever made and maybe to be able to make movies out of profit helped deodato creating this massive work of desolation despair and cruelty yet is not only a collection of brutal scenes one after the othersome calm and quiet music introduces us to what the world has come to name the cornerstone of civilization new york but if the movie is comprehended as it should be after the final titles close well have not only to feel disgust of how an inhabitant of the amazonas eats raw meat the first thirty minutes of holocaust work as introduction to the world of the tribes of the jungle in a semidocumentary style after minutes pass we see more and more of the brutal human nature at its best its a crescendo of blood and death that crushes the senses of the audience more and moredeodato uses nudism and a wide range of cinematically avoided elements to transport the audiences to a dark cornerstone of the mind we know but we refuse to accept inside this distorted view of reality we recognize we are not as civilized as we claimed to be we are greedy we kill for fun money or lust uses gore which is as realistic as it could be to be the ultimate lesson of how the self imposed habits of society create the ultimate butchery thats the reason why this could be made once and worked perfectly once finally holocaust is a moral tale it can be a real enlightening experience there are little chances that someone remains unchanged towards this work whether you define it as good or a bad movie,cruel
actually it is hard to even call this a horror movie horror movies tend to be about scary monsters that dont really exist the monsters in this movie are for real and the cannibals arent the only monsters in this movie after viewing this movie i felt like i had just witnessed something really bad like i needed to talk to a counselor i dont even know if there is anything i can say that hasnt already been said better this is not for the weak stomachedfor those who were offended by the animal killings yes it was hard to watch but from what i gather these animals were not wasted but eaten by the local people this is normal for many cultures for those who thought this movie was cruel to animals and are also meat eaters go visit a slaughterhouse sometime i love eating meat of all kinds by the way mmmmmmmmso for serious horrorexploitation film fanatics this is a must see but you have been warned this isnt nightmare on elm street,cruel
less gory as time goes on yet more influential hampered by special effects of the day the directory wisely chose to view the gore both from a distance and with quick implication we all know this was a statement but the statement pales as the years pass except for cinematic historians caught in this rally against ugly and genuine news delivered daily to those having dinner and the selfrighteous condemning films depicting fictional atrocities a mini gem was delivered to horror cinema history it would be easy to pass this off as a mondo somethingit aintthis offering to buffs has atrocious acting right on target acting colliding score and an unsettling fusion of documentary and movie the killing of animals on screen has been widely condemned but for much of the worlds population that understands the meat on our plate requires the killing of an animal unless you intend to cook an animal alive you must kill it first thats how it works want a hamburger you gotta kill a cow like bacon or sausage a pigs gotta die and someones gotta kill itthere is no chicken strip farm folks chickens are killed their carcasses divided into sections and you wind up with strips two piece snacks and family dinners or turtles or muskrats they all have innards that must be done away with and heads heads dont show up on menus youll find them if you look deeply enough in lunch meatscreated atrocities sensationalism over truth maybe the director had a point maybe he made it and in the meantime he created an uncomfortable cinematic venture to boot one that a full generation later is still capable of reaching inside us and grabbing us by our collective throttleswow,cruel
i never saw in my life such a disgusting and boring film like this there is nothing good about this horrible film i hated everything about it everything about it is horrible the music score which is corny and doesnt fit with the disgusting scenesthe performances that are even worse than in the blair witch projectthe characters that are ugly unlikeable and despicablethe story which is only muddled and pretentiouseverything about this film is sick and wrong dont see it it is easily one of the worst films ever made,cruel
despite all my love for violent gory films i can barely tolerate this movie not because it shocked me but mostly due the contradictory and nonsensical message of this we the viewers are supposed to believe that this is a criticism of how the media makes the public hardhearted and indifferent toward the violence but deep inside is just a vulgar exploitative film that only wants to shock the audience there is absolutely no beauty fun or joy in this film it is ludicrous and disgusting but it takes itself way too seriously to be unintentionally funny or interesting ruggero deodato shows us the most shocking and disgusting scenes but unlike filmmakers as david cronenberg who are able to make the ugliest and most grotesque situations beautiful and poetical those scenes are just plain ugly and tastelessthe title of the movie promises us a cheesy gory bmovie and yet what it delivers is a dull pretentious and heavy handed tale of human cruelty without any kind of originality nor art is a complete mess it tries to be way too hard to be solemn and poignant and instead of that it ends being just nihilistic and boring yes there is a lot of blood sex and violence in this film yes the animal cruelty goes beyond anything that i had ever seen before but it is a good horror film i dont think so there are thrills no mystery or anything that should be considered as horror material just mindless graphic violence without any beauty thats all this movie was a huge disappointment to be especially after all the good things i have heard about it i simply hated it from beginning to end,cruel
is gritty intense and disturbing sadly it effects you the same way off screen for many days onwards this is the type of film that is tolerated on a gut level but should be by no means enjoyed whilst on the most part the animals slaughtered in this film were killed in true hunter gatherer fashion the treatment of the south american tribes depicted on film is truly something unforgivablethe directional style of this film isnt really direction in a conventional sense and the acting for most part seems entirely improvised this alone would make for an interesting pseudo realist picture but combined with the blood curdling violence and the unnecessary rape scenes and i will include the abortion of foetuses with that comment becomes something entirely different this is quite frankly a film spawned from the pits of hellsure one can argue that ruggero deodato and his crew of merry men were showing us a metaphor for our own westernised society but i beg to differ i can see no thought at all put into real life debates on consumerism war or gender roles this is exploitation at its pinnacle a loathsome experience by any standard the only thing more disturbing than watching is the thought of those in our existence who can frequently watch it with enjoyment,cruel
what a lame friggin movie i cant believe everyone going on about this like its the most disturbing thing ever put on filmgrow up watching this nonsense is a definite feat indeed not because of the content but because its so damn boring like i had to chain smoke just to keep my eyes openso it was banned big deal its not shocking its not disturbing its just stupidand yes i saw the uncut version like i kept waiting for these appalling scenes to come and they just never did then ten minutes later id be wondering if what already passed was one of those parts that was supposed to do what exactly make me feel sick close my eyes feel the horrorwhatever i mean everyone goes on about some rape scene oh its so shockingare you people for real its some guy motioning on top of some tribe girl like its almost laughable at how ridiculous the scene looks coupled with the fact that there is zero acting or emotion i mean it just comes off like a goof 90210 portrays stuff like this more realistically and im not saying i wanted the scene to be more realistic my point is on just how far from being actualized the ideas the incentive to shock or basically the whole damn movie really is total crap,cruel
im often interested in seeing a film to find out what all the fuss was about and usually to discover that once again a film has been unfairly criticised for its content without any thought being given to the points that the film was trying to makewas the exception with a title like that i should have known better but nevertheless i was staggered by what i sawi had the misfortune to get my hands on an uncut version of this disgusting film and i was amazed that it was possible to get together a large enough group of sick individuals to make something so appalling and on such a scalethis whole film is basically a fantasy for those who get sexual gratification from images of rape murder and animal cruelty and it presents it in the most unpleasant and lascivious tone imaginable then to make matters worse and in order to get around the censors the film makes a pathetic attempt to appear to condemn all the atrocities it has shown usthe awful and inappropriate nostalgia for the past hope for the future music merely adds to the depravitythis may sound melodramatic but i watched this film wondering if it would change me as a person as i looked upon it as nothing more than a series of purely evil images i should have turned it off but my habit of never leaving a film once ive started meant i sat through the whole thingthis movie is quite simply evil and only disgusting and seriously twisted perverts could have anything good to say about it,cruel
spoiler alert spoiler alertif youre a horrorexploitation fan you will eventually hear about all roads lead to it you will hear that its an intense experience full of carnage cruelty and unparalleled viciousness in a horror flick believe the hype is an experience worth having anyone who claims that this movie is weak or that theyve seen worse is lying nothing has topped it yetis a movie that will bring conflicting emotions out of you it pretends to condemn the violence that it shows when it is clearly reveling in it a professor ventures into the jungle to find some lost reporters all he finds is the film they left behind he takes it back to new york to screen it we get to see the film in parts and every part is brutally violent this is where the movies power lies the scenes in the reporters film are shot very realistically animals are actually killed which adds to the illusion of reality there are scenes in the film which show the reporters as being a corrupting influence on the tribe and stirring them up enough to warrant the tribes vengeance the last scene in the reporters film is intense this is what will stick with you after the movie is overso is an exploitation film or a brutal horror flick the answer to both is yes it is while the last scene is brutal it also flashes back to the professor watching the tape and has him and his fellow movie watchers acting revolted at what theyre seeing does this mean that we the viewers should also be morally disgusted or should we be thrilled to be watching such intense violence the movie offers no answers people who would watch a movie called want to experience some violent thrills and perhaps be disturbed as well pulls out all the stops when it comes to jungle carnage but then proceeds to condemn it like its disgusting filth why the movie wants to have it both ways is unknown it probably has something to do with the censorship at the time but it still leaves a bad taste in your mouththat said still must be seen it is certainly the greatest cannibal movie ever made it is also on the top five best exploitationhorror flick list a must see,cruel
refers to the uncut versionhaving seen this version i can understand why both the bbfc in england and the mpaa in the us have always had a problem releasing this in its uncut formunlike many other films that fall under the art category but are still shocking nonetheless guinea pig the devils experiment  salo to name but two this film has no purpose on this planet other than to put in front of you a nihilstic vision of the world and to purely and simply shock you into oblivion though on the other hand what do you expect when you send a bunch of people with cameras into the jungle thats populace is made of cannibalsbasically the version that many people all over the world have seen is the 86 minute cut in britain anyway almost everywhere else it has either been banned or is still under considerationin this version you seeless cruelty to animalsthe killing of a muskrat by the jungle tourguide the complete evisceration of a large turtle the kicking of a pig that is tied up the headslicing and blood drinking from a monkeys headless violence both sexual and well beating up and stuffan angry native dragging his adulterous wife through mud and forcing her legs apart the same angry native raping and humilating her with  what seems to be  a large wooden phallus the same angry native putting nails into a mudball and placing the same mudball with nails in the womans groinal arealess of the rape scene between the female camerawoman and her colleagues less of the female camerawoman being raped by the natives after they are overpoweredless nudity throughoutall in all the film has 5 minutes and 44 seconds worth of cutson one hand i can see after viewing the uncut version why these cuts were made to the british video release on the other hand i dont admire censorship and believe that people should choose whatever they wish to watch no matter how horrificthe question is  will these cuts be made to numerous other releases of the dvdlaser discvhswhether they do or they dont this film is still as shocking today as it was whenever it was first released so bear in mind that its not very pleasant whatever the version still you have to watch this film just to notice why just about every selfrighteous moral guardian in the world wore sandwich boards upon this films release,cruel
i first saw this film through a bad copy and since then am to still recover from the effectsto call this film beautiful or wellmade is insane there has to be something wrong with humanity if we can call castration animal killings and rape beautiful  this film in so many words is ugly and awful i got no enjoyment out of it at all just came out the room feeling quietly discustedi am a huge fan of the horror genre and respect such early works of directors like peter jackson a god and george romero but this isnt even a horror its the nearest thing to a poorly done snuff filmi understand that some quite sick people may find this picture remotely interesting for some unknown reason there are people who enjoy seeing a rare giant turtle being ripped open alive or a woman being raped and having her head smashed in by a rock on the aftermathif your after cheap thrills through real kills then this is the film for you but personally i feel youd have to have a screw loose to enjoy this poor atempt at film making,cruel
i first became a fan of the horror genre when i was around 14 years old and so i became fascinated to discover all the classics of the genre i started viewing films such as halloween and the exorcist and became obsessed with all the old classics i then started moving my way in on more violent and disturbing stuff for me at the time such as the saw series and eventually seeing and loving hardcore horror from other countries particularly france with inside and martyrs however one film was popped up on disturbing movie lists and that was reading how horrifying it was i decided to wait until i was over 18 i finally summed up the courage to watch it yesterday ive just turned 20 and was pretty bloody appalledis an uneasy mix of campy 70s naffness and utterly repugnant violence i fail to see why it is considered a classic of the genre let alone a masterpiece of film reviewers lead you under the impression that the entire film is done in a found footage manner when actually its only the final forty minutes which dips in and out of lost footage being watched by other characters the first fifty minutes is the more tedious although less repulsive half which follows a team going into investigate what happened to a bunch of nave students who went onto an island overrun by cannibalsits difficult to believe that was released in 1980 because it comes across as so dated as with most italian horror movies at the time the acting is absolutely atrocious it doesnt help that the dubbing doesnt quite match with their mouths and every line is delivered in a wooden manner i read somewhere that one of the actors was actually a porn star so that gives you an idea of the calibre of acting you can expectthe direction is almost as bad at times it came across as a parody especially when the natives started blowing poison darts at the group it comes across as extremely rough and amateurish which i suppose prepares us for the final third where were shown footage from actual amateurs the music was also pretty awful with an illfitting romantic main theme and another piece of strange electronic music which sounds like someone pressing random keys on a cheap keyboardwhat absolutely turns my stomach is the actual real footage of animals being killed is obviously renowned for this however i still wasnt prepared it is completely vile and totally unnecessary the image of two men pulling a giant sea turtle out of the water and slicing its head off whilst its legs are still kicking will never leave me the image of a man cutting its shell off with its organs and tissue spilling out will also never leave me the descriptions you read of the scenes will never prepare you for the actual graphic content which is shown on screenthe worst thing about it is that the film has absolutely zero artistic merit the only reason why animals are killed on screen is to shock it has nothing to do with the story which is barely there i would recommend that you think really carefully before watching the film because ive never actually felt so upset or sick whilst watching a filmthis film is obviously the work of a sadist and i find the films message of sensationalism in the media and the psychotic nature of human beings absolutely laughable the entire film is the perfect example of hypocrisy at its worst how dare a sadistic director lecture us about human nature a man who is quite happy to torture and kill animals for shock value should not be making a film about how civilised people can be more barbaric than cannibals apparently the director was also vile towards all the native extras and was particularly nasty towards the ones who couldnt speak italian or englishi rarely get angry about films but this one makes my blood boil i cant stand films which are only there to shock people and is just a string of shocking scenes some of them look laughable the rape scenes however some of them are just repugnant the forced abortion scene and totally cross the line real animal torture i didnt even realise i had limits until i watched and that is not a recommendation the sheer level of hypocrisy in the films heavyhanded themes is beyond laughable and it is just not made well in the slightest people who hail this film as a masterpiece are either delusional or sadistic maybe bothread more weird and dazzling reviews at wwwasdamanwordpresscom,cruel
wayyy overrated i went into this thing expecting to be shocked disgusted or even traumatized in some way and instead i was bored i read all of the reviews commenting on how great and intense this movie was only to be let down completely the acting is pretty horrific the entire plot is a mess and the violence is mostly laughableif you enjoy fake rape or the totally unnecessary killing of real animals this film is for you im a little more interested in story acting and directing none of which can be found here ignore any and all reviews praising this as some kind of cult classic with special artistic value or hidden meaning only the truly gifted can comprehend its a poorly executed attempt at shock and ends up falling well short of being anything less than an hour and a half of your life wasted,cruel
a gratuitous pseudosnuff film that tries to pass itself off under the guise of social commentary  unfortunately the film displays neither the intelligence nor insight to be anything more than sensationalist tripe this isnt even a horror movie  its faces of death with a plot and even thats a bit of a stretch since the story is strictly bare bones pardon the expression  the acting is pretty much nonexistent and by the time the end credits rolled by i found myself wishing that director ruggero deodato had been devoured by a tribe of cannibals himself thus sparing us from such amateur fairnow let me be clear that i am not a squeamish type when it comes to movie gore  i think directors such as george romero peter jackson and david cronenberg to name but a few have raised blood and guts to an art form but its painfully apparent that all deodato strives for is shock value there is no artistic vision evident here  just plain ol exploitation it boggles the mind why would appeal to anybody except aspiring serial killers who might get a kick out of watching animals being tortured and slaughtered for the sake of a dumb movie,cruel
where to beginthe plot as other reviewers have stated is probably already known to whoever is reading this so i wont waste words explaining it suffice to say that i was wholly unimpressed with it it was not creative nor original i was not compelled to think about society and its morals rather i was compelled to think about society in regard to how one could possibly call this amateur attempt at filmmaking a movie acting what acting i am all for attempting to capture realism and so forth in a movie but i am appalled that some other reviewers deemed the acting anything more than abysmal it felt as if the actors were reading their lines off of a teleprompter rather than having memorized them and recited them with passion and conviction dialogue let me start out with this statement i do enjoy 80s action movies and so forth and as such i dont mind corny oneliners somewhat cheesy bad dialog and what not this movie elevated the definition of cheesy to new extremes the dialog sounded like a fourteen year old who has a d for a grade in english class had written it normally in a decent movie the dialog is meant to illicit some form of emotion serve as a vehicle for character and plot development and so on in this movie i would say it detracted from the experience whenever one of the actors though i find it offensive to put them in the same category as credible actors reads a line and spews it forth it comes off as contrived and unbelievable not that it isnt to begin with but that is beside the pointspecial effects well if you enjoy movies that dont even qualify as b grade horror than you may enjoy this i was looking at the display to see how far into the movie i was because though some scenes were brutal i found them utterly ridiculous and boring the special effects if one would go so far as to call them that as they lacked any semblance of special and barely qualified as effects were fairly atrocious i wont spoil the killings for the reader but i will say that as stated before i found them banal and ridiculousentertainment value seeing as i am an individual and tastes vary i wont make any broad claims but i found the movie to be nothing but an exercise in pointlessness watching this movie is like watching a child pull the wings off of a fly and then burn the fly and watch it writhe in agony before finally stepping on it to anyone who finds that entertaining its like watching a group of adults who are drunk play scene it and act out the scenes from the movies then drinking some more and attempting to hack apart a chicken after hacking apart said chicken they then proceed to play with the organs and laugh hysterically whilst trying to appear serious and menacingthat is what i experienced when watching this movie some may see this as a masterpiece but i see it as nothing more than a black hole that sucks viewers in and spits them out 90 minutes later wondering what just happened and lamenting the 90 minutes of their life that was wasted,cruel
while it may be the most controversial film of all time as many hail it to be  remember that controversy does not make it necessarily good did not scare me at all it just made me sick there is no acting no trace of the director trying to elevate this film above the gore element and spoiler no reason for the 4 scientists to behave in such a way if this is the way the director tried to tell us that even civilized people are still savagewellhe failed miserablyon a sad note influenced quite a few directors eli rothfor example who think that gore carnage and blood are enough to make a good horror movie as you might probably tell i am not a big fan of hostel either those 3 elements might scare me in the real life but as far as a movie goes it takes a lot morei give a 1 out of 10  spoiler  oh and the rape scenes that shows a serious lack of good taste,cruel
group of very annoying people go to the jungle of veneuzuela or wherever to make a doc about a tribe of cannibalsat first it goes ok until they start raping woman in the tribe killing they cattle and stuff of course you understand whats about to happen next seriously this movie was crap at its finest freaking boring shizzle as for shocking moments there arent any except that there are some animal slaughters  only thing that was real and some guy who gets his privates cut off  but that looked so lame you wouldnt believe  now for the more basic stuff the acting was horrible at bestno known names in this turd of a movie the directing was bad as well but the worst part besides the acting and the plot has to be the cinematography which seriously made me wanna hurlso what else can i say except avoid this garbage unless your one of those social rejects who gets his kicks out of animal slaughters,cruel
so lets get this straight in the name of showing the irony of violence covered by the news and other mainstream media outlets deodato decides the best thing to do is to make a film where they kill every animal they can get their hands on so what we are subjected to is the torture of a muskrat the disembowelment of a tortoise two monkey killings the shooting of a pig and a spider and snake killing why why kill real animals this is a movie use props or better yet imply the killings this disgusting show of violence towards other living things is enough to make someone pukethen as if that isnt enough you have four of the most unlikable characters ever created they rape villagers torch their homes enslave the same villagers and of course murder them how exactly is this a film that has any redeeming values to it is the most vile and disgusting film i have ever seen we all know that people kill animals for food and clothing but doing it in the name of art is very sad and has no place in this world110,cruel
i saw this at a screening in the cinematek and i was surprised by the amount of people who went to see it it was packed i still felt like the odd one out since half of the people there had seen the movie before and looked like rockers bikers and rob zombie lookalikes the guy who presented the movie gave a 30 min speech which i didnt mind because he went through the history of the genre and interesting facts of the making of it but he did talk for maybe 15 minutes too long an old man sitting in front of me gestured with his hand in a get on with it way the whole time then when the presentation was over he pointed his middle finger at the presenterhalf of the movie is shot in the traditional cinematic way and the other half is found footage there are some gruesome images in this that i have no words to describe theres a lot of horrific things happening and at the same time its self aware it critiques the medias way of fabricating stories and tinkering with reality those aspects are interesting but the movie is still hard to watchthere were times were i had trouble keeping my eyes on the screen i was actually expecting someone to walk out whenever they showed an animal getting killed in closeup i will say that some bloody images went on for too long bloody in the sense that they were violentits a movie im happy to just see once i dont need to watch it again the subject matter is something you can discuss and the way it was made was before its time dont expect a full found footage movie though since its a mix of things the last lines were really good and sums everything up nicely horrific images and a clever critique and then happy music plays in the creditssome people will call it a masterpiece and others will be disgusted and horrified its a little bit of both for me but judge for yourself if you decide to watch it,cruel
is a 1980 italian horror movie directed by ruggero deodato which is shot in a documentary style it sounds campy by the title but it is anything but it has been often titled as the most controversial movie of all time if you measure controversy in terms of international legal action then that might very well be a true title if it wasnt outright banned in a country it was almost always censored heavily due to its graphic violence animal cruelty and allegations of murder of some of the actors with the murder charges dropped only now did the original uncut version become available for consumer viewings and its no surprise to those that have seen it that it still shocks and disgusts to this daythe premise is that a group of film students at nyu go to the heart of the unsettled and uncivilized south american rainforest dubbed the green inferno in order to shoot a film about the natives there and their customs they never return however and an anthropology professor embarks on a rescue mission to discover the fates of the students i dont think this is much of a spoiler given the title of the film but surprise he discovers that they were eaten the film they shot however remains intact which he takes back to new york and is viewed by the film executives who were responsible for publishing the original film despite the preconceived notions the viewer probably has about the savages vs the civilized filmmakers it becomes apparent upon watching who the real savages were murder and rape of the natives along with the brutal animal slayings performed by the students with smiles on their faces all for the sake of filmmaking will disgust you to your core as the professor says at the end of the film i wonder who the real cannibals arepersonally the most fascinating aspect of the film for me is that i consider this one of the most revolting films ever made but not because of the actual violence dont get me wrong it can be bloody and horrific but strictly speaking in terms of gore its not bad compared to modern torture porn films the real reason it sends shivers down your spine is because of the incredible disregard for life and a lack of basic humanity in people that surround us every day i wont spoil these horrendous acts because honestly they need to be seen to be believed as to how terrible they are another reason the film is so brutal is that it never lets up and never pulls a punch the horror is nonstop especially during the sections set in the green inferno even the ways that the film producers shrug off much of the horrifying acts shown in the recovered footage are sickening to methe most controversial aspect of the film is probably the genuine animal slayings portrayed on film even though i am a meat eater this is where i feel the films biggest blunder is the point of the film is that us civilized people can be extremely savage but actually killing animals for the sake of a movie even one with a message such as that is hypocritical to me even the director later regretted the decision to kill these animals if youre of faint of heart you will be horrified as to what you will see in what is probably the most infamous scene a large turtle is decapitated has its exterminates cut off and its shell torn off followed by the removal of the entrails all shown in graphic detail another scene people tend to point to is one in which a small monkey has its head chopped down the middle to me however the most disturbing animal killing is one in which a coatimundi a type of raccoon is stabbed multiple times in the neck while it shrieks until it finally succumbs to its wounds all the more horrifying is that the actors do these acts with smiles on their faces im not sure how someone can do something like that and seem so ok with it unless they are just as morally corrupt as the characters they portray despite how disgusting and sickening the film is i still recommend it but with caution this film is not for everyone and it is likely you may be sick to your stomach nonetheless it is well acted well shot and well executed animal killings aside the political message behind it is refreshing even though it will make you depressed and degrade your hope for humanity you can find the original uncut version on youtube but know what youre getting into,cruel
like hannibal lector in 1991s silent of the lambs there is a thin line that between genius and insanity i think cross that line to insanity this movie could had been really smart but end ups being unpleasant to watch directed by ruggero deodato known for a lot of cannibals film and written by gianfranco clerici is the first film to use the found footage structure that works similar to a flashback the films notion of recovered footage has influenced the nowpopular genre of found footage horror films such as 1999s the blair witch project 2008s cloverfield and other works the film tells the stories of two parties of explorers and how they dealt with an amazon rainforest indigenous tribes one of the parties treat the tribe to the best of their ability with respect while the other party end up being chow down because they were being jerks to the tribe the party that treat the tribe with respect leaded by new york university anthropologist harold monroe exporn star robert kerman end up with the rescue mission of looking for missing documentary film crew and to learn what really happen to them is notorious for its graphic violence that aroused a great deal of controversy to the point that some people thought it was real and the director was charge for a crime people really thought it was a snuff film due to rumors that claimed some actors were killed on camera in my opinion it is there is old footage filmed during the crisis in uganda in the 1970s where real life people were executed by a firing squad in the last road to hell that scenes alone is disrespected for the family of those people that die in that crisis to see that footage be used for entertaining purposes for another fake horror movie is horrible although deodato was later cleared from the crime when he show that his actor didnt die the film was still banned in several countries due to its disturbing portrayal of graphic brutality sexual assault such as rape and animal violence critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society making the real life yanomamo tribe look like vicious cannibal man apes in truth the yanomamo people are some of the friendly smart civilize tribes in the amazon they are not truly cannibalistic although the yanomamo do partake in a form of postmortem ritual cannibalism another thing while people might see the animal killings as the biggest complaint of the film because how brutal they kill it and how long those scenes were like the insidious turtle scene at less it looks like they ate it or the natives ate it the biggest complain for me are the rapes scenes not only on the team raping native women but the native raping the team women for revenge it was just unpleasant as hell i couldnt watch any further for a while after those scenes until i took a long shower i felt dirty watching this movie it was just sick to the head i have to give the movie so points here they were really going for shock value and i have to say they deliver on that for sure it work because of the cinma vrit technique that the director learned from his mentor roberto rossellini a style which people called hyper realistic i just didnt like the shaky handheld camera work it really make my stomach turn i doubt i will watch it again because of that fact it makes me hurl not only the camera work but how graphic it is but as less i can say i watch it and it did deliver on the hype in a way i would deeply interested in seeing what the piranha scene that was cut from the final film would have look like it is a scene where group of yanomam cutting off the leg of a shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranha in the river the underwater camera did not operate properly and the piranha were difficult to control so the director reportedly dropped the scene due to its graphic content there are several different versions of in circulation which are edited to certain degrees the movie was barely made due to tension on set due to the exotic location and how much the actors were jerks to each other these tensions were further heightened by unscrupulous payment practices the actors barely got their money for the film the film really misused the native extras they basically were slaves and work for free as they went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes thats ugly while the movie was trying to make a theme that show how bad modern society morals are in italian media in this film by making the lost film crew heartless jerks behind the film the director himself was treating the natives and his crew like trash its hard to take a director serious about talking about good morals when he himself doesnt practice good morals did the movie deserve to get banned not really there are worst films than this but this is high up there plus banning it only speak more people interest to see it censorship only works for a little while as the internet gave more freedom into seeing sick films such as this if a person wants to see it i dont think all audiences who went to see this film are mental disturb i can see people seeing it for curious reasons does it make them psychos for wanting to see this film not always now if you watch this and you find it not disturbing then you might want to see a doctor right now for treatment,cruel
id toyed with the idea of watching for a long time before actually taking the plunge i suppose i was wary of the films reputation as a piece of extreme cinema and subconsciously kept putting off seeing it having finally viewed it  and whats more in its uncut version containing all the animal killings the longest available road to hell footage and all the other gory moments  i must say im rather surprised surprised that i admire the film when i expected to hate it surprised that in parts the film is remarkably well made and surprised that an italian cannibal film of all things manages to be so prescient in its depiction of media sensationalisma group of four young filmmakers vanish in the amazon while making a documentary a few months later anthropologist harold monroe robert kerman sets off to find out what happened to them after various adventures monroe and his guides eventually find a group of natives the yacumo tribe who have had contact with the filmmakers they push on further into the jungle to the unexplored regions peopled by much more dangerous and isolated tribes like the yanomamo and the shamatari where monroe eventually locates the barely recognisable remains of the film crew amazingly the movie reels they have shot are still intact and monroe manages to persuade the tribesmen to let him have them in exchange for a tape recorder the recovered footage shows director alan yates carl gabriel yorke script writer faye daniels francesca ciardi and cameramen mark tomaso luca barbareschi and jack anders perry pirkanen journeying into the depths of the jungle where they use increasingly unethical and violent methods to get the footage they want eventually the yanomamo tribe turn on the filmmakers and brutally slay them their horrible deaths captured on film as the documentary crew desperately try to escapefor its first half is not particularly good this part is a standard jungle expedition adventure with typically bad acting wooden dialogue and bursts of gruesome violence where the film suddenly and unexpectedly makes you sit up and take note is in its second half referred to in the film as the green inferno segment using an effective cinma vrit style director ruggero deodato shows the exploits of the film crew in the jungle he uses scenes of real animal cruelty to shock the audience and knock them off balance then moves onto realistically simulated human horrors such as rape impalement beheading cannibalism and more these simulated scenes have added believability because our senses have already experienced the onslaught of real cruelty and death deodato relentlessly shows how unscrupulous and corrupt the filmmakers are and how they will commit the most horrific acts against animals and natives just as long as they get their film made the problem is that becomes the very thing it tries to condemn  a piece of sensationalism its hard to accept this fierce assault on the immorality of the media when the film itself resorts to the same offensive immorality nonetheless this is an effective and disturbing horror film which should be seen at least once if only to experience the raw cinma vrit sequences which surely inspired later lost footage movies most notably the blair witch project there isnt a single moment here that will make you jump but there are many appallingly cruel moments that will play on your mind for a long time afterwards tough viewing,cruel
i had truly mixed feelings about this film i knew about it being banned i several countries and that it was the center of the video nasties collection as i am a fan of horror films as well as euro shock films i decided that i would ignore the warnings and watch it for what it truly isan exploitation filmi had trouble watching particular scenes in the film mainly because of how real all of the effects and acting skills are i now see where films like the blair witch project got their inspiration the only difference here is that shows literally everything the first half of the film built suspense and laid down the story for the rest of the film to follow the native tribes were very realistic in their portrayal of primitive and violent people the disturbing parts of the film are in the second half and build up the almost unbearable tension until the devastating brutal climax where my mixed feelings are about the film is its multi layered characters i do feel that the journalists were savage and brutal and deserved what they had coming to them but on the other hand i did not feel that i had to see it in such horrifying detail if you want to see a scary movie i highly recommended this one although it is nearly unwatchable not due to its direction or action but more its content and realism be warned that there are real animal deaths on film which added to the extreme controversy upon its release but i only feel that this made the film seem more real and it succeeds in making the viewer uncomfortable and ultimatelyafraid but thats hat horror movies are supposed to do this one certainly holds up to the hype,cruel
is a masterpiece never have i watched a movie that was repulsive yet subtly poignant it was way before its time blair witch even ripped some elements off of it this movie completely captures the media induced stupor that was 30 years in the making you can see shots at reality tv in this movie and it had not even been conceptualized yet the things that were done in this movie could not happen today and that is a shame in the fact that if there was ever a time when a movie like this was relevant it is upon usdisclaimeri do not condone animal cruelty i just think that this films impact would have hit harder if it came out today then in 1979 why was i born in that year maybe thats an omen or probably just sheer stupid luck anyways check out this film if you want to be challenged not only visually but morally as well,cruel
this film was disturbing on so many levels in fact i could not even sit through it all at once i had to take a break and come back and finish it the next day i have not seen a film as disturbing as this since i spit on your grave one shouldnt be disturbed at seeing animals slaughtered if you eat meat after all you have to kill it to cook it but the animals slaughtered in this film seemed still alive when they were being cut up the chopping of the monkey head to get at the brains was especially harsh it made me want to join peta and become a vegetarianthe punishing of a native woman for adultery was hard to watch it would have been easier to just stone her and not have to go through this rituali felt sorry for the four adventurers when i saw what happened to them but i changed my mind when i saw what they did in the village just before they met their fate good riddance to such trash watching the last few chapters today was even more difficult with gang rapes disembowelment and decapitations this is the ultimate cannibal movie and the only one that anyone needs to see to experience this type of film making,cruel
opening with a spectacular aerial view of the amazon accompanied by a score as lush as the tropical foliage depicted ruggero deodatos infamous cannibal shocker begins innocuously enough however by the time the end credits roll the viewer will have experienced one of the most gruelling cinematic experiences ever to have been filmedwhen a team of documentary makers go missing whilst filming in the amazon a professor his guide and an assistant attempt an expedition in order to discover what happened to them they discover that the jungle where the filmmakers disappeared is ruled by two rival tribes of cannibals they make contact with one tribe and after gaining their trust they stay a while to experience life in a stoneage society at first hand they even witness savage rituals and are invited to stay for a spot of lunch bloody entrails anyone after discovering the remains of the missing documentary makers fashioned into a strange monument the professor manages to retrieve cannisters of undeveloped film and returns to new yorkupon viewing the film he discovers the shocking truth about the filmmakers they were vicious sadists who deliberately engineered violent events in order to spice up their footage after killing and raping some of the tribe members they are eventually set upon and end up being mutilated in front of their own cameradeodatos movie is an expertly crafted film and is undeniably powerful and unforgettable stuff the last fortyfive minutes or so which comprises mainly of the recovered documentary footage is extremely disturbing featuring graphic and realistic gore fx animal mutilation and violent sexual abuse perpetrated by both the natives and the filmmakers deodato forces the viewer to reevaluate how they feel about their own society and asks the question are we really any more civilised than those we call savages whilst hard to describe as entertaining the revolting animal scenes are particularly hard to stomach is a cut above most cannibal films it is a relentless attack on the senses that should be seen not just by fans of extreme horror but by all serious movie fans who appreciate innovative groundbreaking cinema,cruel
real animals were afflicted and killed not only one but about 7 without the outtakes which sure caused them to kill several more this is not only a perverse act of killing this is insane illegal inhuman dreadful and just everything but right id like to see the director going into jail for this foreveri love animals but even if id not id still never accept thisi heard that the director was fined for this but only a few thousand dollars this movie should have never been madeeverybody who wants to watch this should think about that first and if you still wanna see it even only because youre curious about it then download it or whatever dont buy it010,cruel
like others i cant believe people relate to this vomit in a manner that offers the excuse of art its exploitative trash plain and simplethe copious amounts of animal torture serve no practical purpose and exist only to garner a measure of controversy to help titillate the films jaded audience to argue that this type of cruelty is no different from that meted out  no pun intended  in the butchery trade is risible as this sort of snuff is done exclusively for the entertainment of the viewer and offers no redemption for the act of killing other than to satiate the bloodlust of your average voyeurleaving the animal torture aside what actually exists in the body of this film to justify such overblown praise the acting is abysmal the soundtrack is monotonous the story line is sophomoric and the dialogue is laughable and oh yes it wasnt even scary  not at all not even in the remotest sense of the word it certainly was revolting and amoral ill give it that but frightening not a chance,cruel
this movie is hands down the worst piece of horrendous trash that i have ever had the misfortune to see it will make your stomach turn repeatedly due to unnecessary violence to both humans and animals the scenes depicting torture of humans were acted but the scenes depicting animal dismemberment were real the words to describe this movie are shocking graphic disgusting disturbing depraved and ultimately unnecessary some reviewers have given this movie ratings ranging from 710 and i cant see any reason for such a score reviewers have written that this movie is a social commentary of evil and that it shows depravity and disintegration of human society people have also written that animals are slaughtered for food all the time as if that excuses the slaughter of animals in this movie some have written that its all right since the animals were eaten after the filming i completely disagree with all of this knowing that animals were killed to film this atrocity will make you feel even worse if you decide to watch it and i strongly recommend that you donti want to point out that i dont consider myself squeamish and have no problems with watching gory horrors which are filled with movie violence but this piece of trash is where i draw the line this should not even be placed in the category of horror or category of movie for that matteri will not go into too many of the details of acting directing and the script because you can make up your mind if you ever make a mistake of watching it i will also not go into those details because the acting is horrible and the script and direction worse still the premise of the movie if we can call it that is that an anthropologist finds film footage which a film crew shot whilst going through the amazon rain forrest and filming the primitive cannibals that live there it turns out that the footage was mostly forced since the film crew terrorized and abused the natives in order to get the shots that they wanted this was due to the fact that the footage that they obtained naturally was not exciting enough for them the anthropologist takes the film reels back to new york and watches what the film crew did to the natives and ultimately discovers their fate as well you might guess that cannibals dont react well to being tortured and murdered basically the film crew sinks deeper and deeper into depravity until their behavior is as savage as it can get they become worse than the cannibals that they describe as savages and there are scenes of human and animal mutilations galore a turtles is ripped apart in detail and women are raped and tortured one woman is impaled on a stake and her body is left hanging on the stake there is also disembowelment and obviously cannibalism of various body parts and appendages just plain horrible i guess that those who described this film as a social commentary of the disintegration and depravity of society were right they were right in the sense that those responsible for this movie are depraved savages who shouldnt be allowed near cameras ever again again i advise you to stay away from this at all costs it is absolutely horrible on every level if i could rate it into the negative figures it would receive the rating of 10 alas i have to rate it as 1 since that is the lowest rating allowed on this site,cruel
recently seeing a documentary about the moral outrage about the infamous video nasties that were on the market i thought id try and track one of the nastier nasties and with a title like it doesnt sound much nastier than that  lets not forget this is italian exploitation horror cinema and these italians really know how to push the boat out when it comes to this gore laden genre  add to this an infamous marketing image on the original video cover and an even more infamous reputation since the film really does feature real life animals being killed and youve got a film that someone who has even the most vague interest in horror films wouldnt want to missthe film starts in a rather pretentious self important manner with quotes from thomas jefferson and others pointing out the importance of liberty and never forgetting the past  the first filmed sequence takes place via a television broadcast that while we now live in the space age we know very little about whats going on in the more remote parts of the world  as i said theres a pretentious and self important element to all this especially when the tv reporter comes out with hyperbole that the human race are about to conquer the universe which would be difficult enough achievement for a highly developed race like the daleks  never mind humanity in the late 20th century but despite all this it doesnt really seem to harm a film that is merely exploitation cinema and exploitation cinema it is and its not long before the film starts nailing its colours to the mast by having an intrepid tv journalist leading an expedition to darkest south america to find out what happened to a previous news crew  now its at this point you realise how easy it would have been to have the story to continue with intrepid tv journalist suffering the same ordeal as his prior peers but doesnt happen  he finds the film cans of the previous journalists and takes them back to nyc to find out their fate and how it happened of course the films marketing took over on its initial release and the film was being touted as real life footage and if you read the trivia section on this page youll find that director ruggero deadato was arrested by italian police and accused of murdering the actors in the film  im sorry but im calling bs on that one  as unpleasant as some of the scenes might be it would have been fairly obvious back then as it is now that only thing going on was acting  okay its not great acting and its filmed in a grungy manner but its impossible to believe anyone would be taken in by this  as one character spouts as a man on the street i find this documentary footage dishonest this is all a pity of sorts because despite its infamy which is earned where the real slaughter of animals is concerned and the infamy that is unearned  cast members being murdered for real indeed  there is a very serious subtext in the heart of the film and white people venturing in to a remote jungle  upsetting the natives and coming off second best reminded of ill fated colonial campaigns in general and vietnam in particular  as someone says makes me wonder who the real cannibals are ,cruel
you know that feeling when you watch a really tough movie i had that feeling after watching only a few movies and the worst were sal or the 120 days of sodom and lars von triers antichrist but i was not prepared for the cruelty of ive read a lot about the most controversial sequences of the film before seeing it but it was too difficult for me to not feel shocked with all the violencegore of the film was definitely one of the toughest movies ive ever seen its more than just an exploitation film its a like a free ticket for your worst nightmare its a ride you wont forget for a long time sequences like the impalement scene and the murder of a large turtle were to cruel and nasty to watch and for a 1980s film i have to confess that im shocked how real it seemed in the film six animals are killed and those are really intense and gruesome scenes its a crazy rude and cruel ride where you will ask yourself sometimes why are you watching the film but at the end of it after all the evidences of this crazy journey are finally destroyed you will understand that this is not just a simple horror movie shows us the cruelty of men and leaves us with a really interesting quote i wonder who the real cannibals are its a really graphic film and its hard for me to advise you to watch it but despite all this things ive said manages to deliver and accomplish everything a true horrormovie fan really wishes violent cruel gruesome graphic will maybe force you to close your eyes in the toughest scenes it was definitely one of the best and toughest horror movies ive seen,cruel
is one of the more controversial of the once legendary video nasties partly due to its scenes of actual animal slaughter and any number of faked rapes beating stabbing and in one particular scene a violent ritualistic abortion the plot prefigures the successful blair witch project in the respect that the second half of the film is supposedly made up lostfootage from a film crew who disappeared whilst making a documentary in the heart of the amazon rain forest the first half of the film involves a university professor retracing the steps taken by the film crew in order to retrieve this lost footage juxtaposing the lush forest landscapes against the lingering spirit of evil in such a way as to recall the works of werner herzog with the roving naturalistic camera work and drifting shots of rivers swinging treecanopies and locals positioned ominously amongst the tall jungle grass leaving us illprepared for the onslaught still to comethe second half of the film is where the nastiness begins with director ruggero deodato revelling in every moment of the violence and gore yet failing to offer anything approaching character drama tension intelligence technical proficiency or depth the saving grace of the film in this respect is deodatos moralistic message  which really arrives far too late to take on any kind of real relevance  in which the natives  who we expect to be savage  turn out to be benign welcoming peace loving people called into conflict by the filmmakers who surprisingly turn out to be morally bankrupt opportunists only there to torment and torture the amazonian natives in order to create heartwrenching social propaganda the director further reinforces this idea by showing us the crews previous film snappily titled road to hell which features actual shockfootage of reallife political executions bodies and decompositiondeodatos concept of a morallybankrupt media in love with ratings and awards at the sake of human suffering is an important one a prospect still very much relevant today what with the overabundance of reality tv shows atrocity websites and the concept of violence as entertainment however for me the relevance of the debate is dwarfed by deodato shocking treatment of animals to my mind any film that uses violence in order to comment on the violence in the media or indeed society in general leaves itself open to questions of hypocrisy in depicting the violence in such a glorified and exploitive way the film becomes just as appalling as when such material is used to sell newspapers or to illicit sympathy during the six oclock news you may disagree with this particular criticism and see some sense of truth in deodatos subtextual ideology but either way you have to ask yourself why are you watching this film instead of creating an intelligent and emotionally moving depiction of media manipulation and the doublestandards of war which here includes the most successful aspect of the film with the allusions to vietnam  the depiction of the american film crew apparently the heroes invading these small peaceful villages and causing a great deal of damage and offence in a manner that recalls the massacre at my lai  deodato instead creates a sluggish vacuum of attention seeking setpieces and overthetop goreas a result the moral message of is diminished and the film instead becomes a work of morbidcuriosity like most of these oncebanned features the film is one that anyone with an interest in film should see if only to gain a greater perspective of the ideas and ideologies of that particular time its also likely to attract an audience who just want to see how violent the film is or to revel in the excess and the continual sense of cruelty i watched it to see if the slant magazine review was accurate when they referred to it as artful enough to demand serious critical consideration yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering they could be right overall i dont buy the validity of the moral message here anyone with so much compassion for the human race wouldnt feel it necessary to chop a monkeys face off or cut off the head of an endangered turtle before waving it around in front of the camera theres also a lot of sexual violence particularly involving women and blunt objects being inserted into various orifices this kind of leering voyeuristic excess renders the antiwar anticonsumerist antimedia message obsolete you can say the same about man bites dog to some extentthe people who have written about this film as if it were some kind of important social document or worse a horror film that is actually scary must have been watching a different film even the notoriously dodgy zombie flesh eaters was more disturbing than this for me is an interesting film but also an interesting failure one that clearly had an underlined message and sense of intent that is muddied somewhat by the over the top violence and disregard for life if you really want to see how violent this film is then by all means give it a try if only to satisfy some greater sense of morbid curiosity,cruel
this film is hailed as the mother of all cannibal movies and has been dubbed the most controversial cult movie i certainly agree with the controversial part the version that was released by vipco recently had 6 minutes of footage cut out of it so when i saw it for the first time i wondered what all the fuss was about that was until i got my grubby hands on the full uncut version from ebaylet me just warn you all that certain companies these days release films that claim to have been banned in several countries for decades however the versions they release are butchered to a much greater extent than the characters in the films themselves bare in mind that these films are mostly only available now because they lack the footage that got them banned in the first place the internet is an invaluable source of original uncut gore movies but many of them are not region 2 uk so be carefulanyway back to holocaust banned in over 50 countries since 1982 and rightly so the uncut version of this film is considered hugely offensive very disturbing extremely graphic and im inclined to agree but of course i would add highly entertaining to the list there are infamous scenes of animal killings which are horrible not only because of their gruesome nature but because they are very real and very pointless the turtle scene made me cover my eyes and look away which doesnt happen often if anything these scenes make the simulated acts of rape and human butchery easy viewing for me the hardest thing about this film to stomach was the appalling soundtrack,cruel
does the world need another comment  maybe not but ill add one anyway    this is easily the most disturbing movie ive ever seen  not the goriest that would be dead alive or terror firmer or the most violent hard boiled perhaps but definitely the most disturbing  why  because unlike putrid trash like cannibal ferox or i spit on your grave this movie is actually pretty well made  the dialogue is reasonably intelligent the acting at least by the documentary filmmakers ranges from acceptable to good and the handheld camera keeps all the nastiness looking believable on top of that the score is curiously haunting  it sounds ridiculously childish at first but provides a strange counterpoint to the action that is quite effective especially in the hut burning scene if you read enough of these comments youll hear more than you need to know about the animal deaths  they should never have been allowed to happen the poor harmless young boa constrictor being hacked up was especially disturbing to me but thats just because i have a pet boa  for another thing id like to know what kind of turtle is killedits one big honkin turtle  ill bet it was an endangered species to boot  the turtle killing is probably the single most disgusting thing ive seen put on celluloid makes day of the dead look like an episode of iron chefindeed the outrageousness of the cast of in killing these animals recalls the outrageous conduct of the filmmakers within the story who rape  kill the natives  deodato hammers into our heads over  over that the filmmakers are the real cannibals the real savages because of what they did to the natives merely for the sake of their film  but didnt deodato do much the same thing to the animals merely for the sake of his film  i think this is either an incredibly stupid oversight of hypocrisy by deodato or a brilliant touch of irony  overall i cant say i enjoyed the film  honestly i hope no one enjoys it  i dont want to see it again anytime soon  its effective and interesting like dissecting a frog in biology class but id be a little wiggy about someone who called this one of their favorite moviesi would warn those of you probably most of you who are reading these comments and want to see this film because of its reputation not to build up your expectations too much  if you learn too much about its shocking scenes they might lose some of their shock value  and frankly the true horror would be watching this movie without being shocked,cruel
possible spoilers lie withinok first things first this is a bad movie but had the potential to be great to say this is a blueprint for the blair witch project is a joke blair witchs filmmakers were innocent people exploring a legend and it was just about them and their psychological rollercoaster ride through the woods s filmmakers are as savage as the cannibals theyre out to exploit and get what they deserve and the movie makes a half assed attempt to exploit them as figures of how corrupt our society is and most important there is nothing psychological going on in this film it was said best by another reviewer all thats going on here is just the film pushing the violence as far as it can go in 90 minutes it also disturbs me to read that the animal deaths in this movie were real it wasnt so much watching the deaths themselves that troubled me but that theres so much of it and for what a stupid movie i was also impressed by how realistic they made the human death scenes seem and even the cheesy stock footage music added to the horror giving it a faces of death feel to it i recommend this movie to no one since youll probably have to go out of your way to find it and its really not worth it it is definately entertaining in its own morbid way and the violence doesnt disappoint at all im just waiting for a film to come along to combine the violence of and the psychological terror of the blair witch project now that would be something,cruel
four cocky americans go into the rain forest to document a cannibalistic tribe other crews have tried and not come back but this group mocks such losers when it turns out the quartet isnt heard from for two months a new yorkbased anthropologist sets out to find out what happened when he returns with the doc crews rough cut he learns their fate and resolves to burn the filmthis last fact is one of the weaker elements of this exceedingly hard to watch but profound film professor harold monroe robert kerman is the anthropologist who presumably strives to understand the human animal he discovers some horrible truths in his probe  so why on earth would he want to destroy the evidencesure there is a lot in the sensationally titled that is hard to witness however the movie is exceedingly welldone and has important things to say i discovered it while doing a little internet reading on foundfootage films during which i learned that is the granddaddy of a genre that includes such other fine works as the blair witch projectthe movie takes us to a border zone spanning brazil and peru a nomans land in which tribes armed with spears blow darts and a taste for human flesh have occasional encounters with the white man and his superior fire power the westerners shortcoming is a far inferior knowledge of the junglewhen monroe treks into the rain forest he has a supremely experienced and nononsense guide who critically understands and knows how to treat the native peoples effectively as a result this guide and his entourage manage to survive the expeditionin contrast the documentary crew loses its guide to a snake bite early on and does not know enough to turn back and quit while theyre ahead rather they are spurred on by dreams of winning an oscar and getting rich they show themselves to be utterly amoral as they taunt and abuse the native peoples with absolutely no compunction for what they have wrought karma follows shortly behindyes there is violence against animals in this film but all of it serves a purpose a muskrat is slit open but its organs feed a native youth captured and managed most effectively by monroes posse the documentarians capture a large river turtle and we must watch as it is taken apart while alive but the animal serves as foodsome extremely sorry truths about human nature arise from this film along the way it dawns on the viewer that the film crews arrogance cruelty and mayhem are likely part of our very own history after all native peoples once ruled our homeland and it doesnt take much of a leap of imagination to guess that many of this movies abuses likely tainted our own home turfimportant questions arise as to who is civilized and who is primitive the natives in this film were not looking for trouble they wanted to be left alone to live their lives in peace which is not to say that they did not exact horrible penalties for criminal behavior and did not battle their own native adversaries with ruthlessnessthere is a lot here to ponder and i do not think this movie should be shunned because of its excesses that would be like mimicking the anthropologist ultimately i once saw a documentary about japanese director akira kurasawa who had witnessed the carnage following the atom bombing of hiroshima never look away from the truth he advised good words for us all to remember,cruel
the director is trying to convey the message that the west unethically exploits primitive cultures and nature for the sake of sensationalism yet ironically the only one who unethically exploited living beings for the sake of sensationalism was the director himself when he ordered the slaughter of numerous exotic animals on camera in gruesome ways they stabbed a baby coati raccoon which was wrongly identified as a muskrat in the movie in the face dissected a large river turtle decapitated a boa constrictor chopped the face off a squirrel monkey squashed a tarantula to death and kicked and shot a pig in the face at point blank rangei give this movie a 510 whilst the realism is certainly astonishing especially for its time the message of this movie combined with the animal cruelty it displays are the work of a morally bankrupt mind and shouldnt be condoned ruggero deodato set out to prove something about western civilization but all he ended up proving is that he himself is an uncivilized barbarian,cruel
one must keep an open mind when viewing deodatos infamous cannibal film while the feature is shot beautifully and has a truly mesmerizing score by riz ortolani its hard to break past the aspects that made this film so controversial to begin withyes the film depicts the actual slaughter of jungledwelling creatures yes traumatic horrors such as rape seem glorified as just forms of punishment its not easy to handle and yet that was the goal of the filmdeodato did not set out to make a film for the masses he created an underground feature for a very select crowd but shot edited and scored it masterfully is more of an experience than an actual film  and thats just what the makers of this feature plannedif you can stomach it watch it in disgust shock and reverence it might be a monstrosity but its oneofakind,cruel
amazing and very depressing to see how many adult individuals will justify deem irrelevant or simply ignore the killing and torturing of animals in the name of human entertainment and shallow shockvalue a really awful film which relies heavily on the visual representation of violence and kills animals because humans cant be mindlessly killed on screen if you expect to earn some bucks is a cowardly hypocritical and clearly damaging work its degrading to watch to make to sell and to buy it tells a lot about people and their numb ways really hopelessi could of course just say that the story is stupid and clich that the characters and actors are extremely poor that the cinematography couldnt be worse that the music is frankly pathetic that the ironic ohbutwereviolenttoo twist is laughable and unbearably childish i could arguably point out that this work of art hah hah  would have been forgotten the very minute it was premiered had it not been followed by sheer controversy on the grounds not of some revolutionary philosophical standpoint but thanks to the most reactionary and ordinary tool available gratuitous easy lawabiding cruelty but quite honestly after having witnessed the deaths of several animals just for the sake of it and to make the fake and boringly told human deaths more shocking what a cheap trick gawd  i cant even said its a film what ive just watched its a piece of pathetic crap its so easy to shock people by torturing defenseless beings and it shows belowzero brain activity congratulationsits all so ironic and amusing yeah in the saddest most revealing and extratextual way,cruel
dont know where to start really  bad director awful acting bad cinematography crap music should i go on  anyway the sick and extreme proves that you really dont need ethics or talent to do a movie the worst thing about the whole thing being the socalled morality you get at the end of that truly incredibly bad film miss it,cruel
i really dont understand the need for killing real animals in long drawn out scenes just to film the animals frightened and tortured reactions first is a musk rat which is stabbed in the neck repeatedly with a knife then you see them drag a sea turtle up on shore and decapitate it not only do they cut off the head but the first whack doesnt kill it and you get to see its feet kicking in fury as its head hangs halfway off next is a monkey whos face is cut off with a machete then you have a piglet which is tied up kicked around shot but not killed yet and left twitching on the ground theres plenty of realistic looking gore in this movie done on people with use of special effects yet the animals do not get this luxury and are just slaughtered for a shock effect it eventually gets to the point that every time you see an animal you find yourself saying are they seriously going to kill a insert animal name here nowfor those saying animals are killed all the time you eat hamburgers yeah animals are killed for food purpose these animals were killed for reaction not a single animal in this movie was killed for foodoh and to those calling it a masterpiece really this is the most boring piece of garbage ive ever seen yeah i like the idea behind the story but they played it out horribly acting is bad and you eventually just stop watching it and it becomes background noise in fact its still playing on my tv right now ive just lost interest in it,cruel
to anyone who thinks that this film is a horror film  its not its not scary its not thrilling its not capturing and its not breathtaking the only thing that this film is is disgusting you see lots of animals screaming in pain while they get stabbed headed skinned etc that films for anyone who enjoys watching animals sufferbesides this the acting is poor you dont believe anything that the actors in the film say because it just seems that they memorised it and have to think of what they had to say nowanything but a masterpiece awful,cruel
okay so the lecture this movies teaching us that civilised people will under certain circumstances act no less savage than humans out in the jungleoh really now thats a truly groundbreaking discovery isnt it and thats already the first and major problem im having with this movie only to show off how thin or even nonexistent the layer of civilisation is the movie utilises some or actually a lot of the worst racist clichs ive ever seen its as if all the fantasies of the 18th and 19th centuries with its blackandwhite contrasts of the noble and the beastly savage have come to life fantasies we should already know were a product of the ideas of western of caucasian superiority granted the movie tries to show or at least claims to do so the minimal difference but nevertheless depicting natives like that is racist to the extreme as if cultures outside our civilisation had to be savage and cruel by default besides does the civilised man really need to be out in the jungle to behave like a beast the holocaust part of the title alone should make you doubt that as to the animals being killed no im not a vegetarian and yes i know that the burger on my plate was once a cow which had been slaughtered but i wouldnt get off killing them or watching them being tortured and id seriously consider changing the butcher if i found out that they were enjoying the act of killing hypocrisy burying my head in the sand maybe but i think theres a crucial difference between not having problems with a fact like animals being killed to be served on my plate and relishing watching and hearing them being tortured the coatimundis piercing screams of panic and agony the spilledout gutts of the turtle the smashed spider which turns the female scientist into a damselindistress etc are lets be honest only included to add some real kinky stuff they lack both dramaturgic if the movie has any at all and cultural relevance ritual slaughtering be it indian tradition or any other eg roman kosher halal to stay within the boundaries of civilisation does not include gratuious cruelty to the contrary an animal slaughtered that messily would be considered impure and i doubt a real indian hunter would be that clumsy this here is merely wanking material be the wanking physical or intellectual,cruel
this movie is crap there are few cruel very realistic scenes of killing and torturing and  that is all and there are also some scenes that are pretty weakly set it does not bring anything new all the actors are just pathetic screenplay sucks and  in my humble opinion  there is no excuse for killing animals i am talking about the scene showing the crew killing that turtle just to make some art if you want to watch some shocking pointless cruelty  go to ogrishcom if you would like to watch some brutal yet progressive and surprising film  go and get irreversible this one is really not worth your time i think that you would be really disappointed,cruel
my friends told me that beyond the violence this was actually a good movie wrong its godawful on every level it may have the fewest redeeming features of any movie ever the writing is ridiculous the acting is a joke and the dubbing sounds like iron chef when i saw this in the theater everyone was always laughing at the stupidity of this thing when they werent cringing and the violence serves no artistic purpose this is the lowest form of smut it has no artistic value and it is interested in things that are far more horrible than any sex act its just there because the filmmakers were madmen the only conceivable reason to see this movie is to test your ability to watch truly disgusting things,cruel
when i clicked on the button to grade this film i wasnt quite sure which number to pick  i mean i refuse to give any film a 10 because i would never be able to give anything a higher score and i want to wait for that one film to come along that will without a doubt demand the perfect 10 and one would assume that this would not be that film  i mean its disgusting boring reprehensible obvious and unoriginal  it actually shows animals being killed and ripped apart  so it deserves a 0 right well i think so but i am not surewhat is a movie supposed to do if not show us something we havent seen before  this plot is so stupid these characters so disgusting and flawed and this murder so indefensible that i am forced to wonder if this is the worst or greatest film of all time  in real life the plot isnt always interesting or brilliant the people arent always good or useful and animals die by our collective hands  and there are actually people in this world who eat people  this film is so stupid its actually realistic  it is bad but so are we and as the only film to be evil enough to actually show how bad we are it must be great right  it must be the greatest film of all time to show us something like thissomething with no story or conventional filmic technique that dares to be as horrible as we are there it gets a 10  or does itby the same logic all pornography is equally brilliant for being willing to show us how graphic and lusty we are  now i have nothing against pornography but there is quite a bit of it and by my own argument there can be only one 10  how do we pick which one  not only that but what if someone comes along and actually makes a sicker movie than this  does that then get the 10 or do we call it unoriginal for failing to be sick soon enough  that is the problem with film criticism  we never really know what we should look for  and i dont know the answer but i have figured out what to give this film0if we are to praise extreme cinema we have to do so with a different set of rules  when reality is all around you and there is no escapeeven though the limits of cinema are being stretchedthe value of cinema is being lost  because what is the magic of a movie  the ability to shock us by showing us what is all around and scary and shocking and sadly true  or is it that more refined and useful ability to play off that reality and give us something in which to escape and then something in which to find ourselves again  as soon as someone figures out how to make a movie that is completely realistic and completely cinematic then we must revise our views  but for now it is enough to give this film a 0 and condemn it for failing to redeem itself after it made its point,cruel
tortured to death in the same way these poor animals were lethal injection my rear end im 15 years old and only heard about the movie i havent actually viewed it myself but my 20 year old cosine and his girlfriend saw it and then tolled me about it they werent entertained or fascinated or even grossed out they were violently angry now im no member of peta and neither are they although i am against the killing of critters for fur i eat meat and having read the peta site for myself i know what cows go through to make that hamburger but meat is an essential part of the human diet without it wed probably suffer some bad side effects i do know a small child who is a vegetarian and she is a very unhealthy little girl however torture and violence is not an essential part of a human diet and thats exactly what this movie wasanybody who had a part in making this movie should have their face cut off by a machete and be cut apart limb from limb and then be eaten by anybody who enjoys this film before they are kicked and then shot in the head so they can talk about animal torture in the darkest circle of satans domain because thats where the turds who kill animals go,cruel
as far as grindhouse goes this is one considered the best of what exploitation has to offer i truly do love grindhouse cinema but the first time i watched this movie i was 16 and this film shocked the absolute crap out of me it was really one of those curiosity viewings and before you say why the hell were you watching it at that age this is kind of tame considering what the internet has to offer nowadays its also funny considering that when i was 21 i went to thailand for a month on holiday and ended up discussing the movie at length with a 26 year old scottish girlthe actual killing of animals in the way they did on this film just really bugs me to no end the endless raping and abuse to the natives ultimately leads to the group getting what they deserve for as much as the film makes social commentary of sorts throughout this movie personally it comes off tame and laughable like old schoolyard bullying and it never really left that much of an impression on mei can respect that ruggero deodato got to make the film he wanted to make and i can also respect the cult following it has gained over the years im glad it exists and is heralded as much as it is condemned but unfortunately it remains nothing more than a curiosity of the past and the morals if any of the story havent aged well its straight up shock value and the imagery is pushed way beyond the term reconstructed ive realised in writing all this ive probably also promoted this movie in some strange wayfinal verdict im glad i finally watched it and saw what the fuss was all about but i hope to never watch it again anytime soon just for the fact that it really isnt all that great 510,cruel
the most scandalous of the italian cannibal movies subgenre isnt the most disgusting that would probably be cannibal ferox aka make them die slowly but it has picked up the most press over the years following the tremendous controversy over its initial release one of the original video nasties the film features graphic depictions of staged snuff reallife executions courtesy of newsreel footage from wartorn africa and  most upsettingly  mondostyle images of reallife animal killing including the dismemberment of a live sea turtle by an amazonian tribehowever one of the biggest reasons why this one made such a stir is for a neat trick that the makers of the the blair witch project reemployed two decades later is a film within a film staged as a documentary with the original actors in prearranged hiding after release director ruggero deodato was even arrested and accused of having murdered his cast for real before convincing the authorities otherwisethis is one film thats had its longpig cake and eaten it being widely interpreted as a comment on developing world exploitation by the media bafflingly its theme tune also resembles a cross between queens too much love will kill you and something composed by the simon may orchestra for a 1980s uk soap,cruel
split in 2 is both accurate and ironic accurate in what cannibals do and ironic as i have 2 very different opinions on this film on the bad side this film does contain scenes of animal cruelty in italy film s made around this time which used animal cruelty resulted in prosecutions secondly this is a low budget film and the quality of production shows thisthis film however is fascinating you can see where blair witch and countless other movies got their ideas and influences from the director had the problem of working with a low budget and turned it to his advantage by making a documentary style now the imitators are using as a film method the film is nowhere near as horrible as its fame and banning suggests once the animal cruelty is omitted,cruel
make no mistake ruggero deodatos is one of those rare films that is exactly as remarkable and brutally effective as everyone says it is and as unbearable as many more say yes it made me feel sick but it was impossible to turn away at the same time this is not a film to be taken lightly is difficult to dismiss and should leave you a changed person after witnessing it for the first time if it doesnt then you need helpthe term witnessing is very fitting since the movie isnt watched in the same way youd watch an episode of star trek or whatever the film happens to you and you cant do anything to stop it sure you can switch it off but then you wont be able to remark upon the experience ill let others describe the plot or detail out events what impressed me the most about the film was the way it approached its subject matter which can only be phrased as national geographic on very bad but potent acid sometimes bad trips are important though you tend to learn more from them and they stick with you longer the film is like a train wreck choreographed for maximum shock value and none of it comes across as faked or phony even the very unconvincing parts of the documentary movie within a movie in spite of the lousy acting and atrocious overlapping sic misenscene approach to staging the documentary footage it still rings true no wonder people were stupid enough to think this might be a snuff movie  it hammers away at your brain senses taste and stomach until all you can do is reactthe violence against animals and women alike shown in the film will  should disgust some viewers its always strange to me that people make a clamor for uncensored versions with all of the rape and gore scenes but then blanch over at the sight of a giant turtle being split open like an egg i think deodato suckerpunched everyone with the animal scenes tantalizing vicarious sexual psychopaths with murmurings of savage carnal rape and then shoving their faces into a barf bucket filled with turtle guts that was his way of giving rape freaks the finger for getting off on his movie it should all be sickening get it the narrative is so powerful and compelling and believable to anyone who used to be an overachieving graduate student type willing to go the lengths to take a shot at the history books even if it costs you your life i really was impressed by how the film crew fell to pieces as their legacy of horror caught up with them i can remember hanging painting shows that led to just as much hysteria vomiting and scumbags feeding off the slow agonizing metaphoric deaths of others they should be working with then perishing themselves as the nature of the beast paid them back good riddance another one gone that no one much missesone area of credit that deodato deserves some actual genuine cinematic praise for is how he depicts the native tribes people that figure into the mle of the story not only do they appear to be accurately costumed but their behavior  not as noble savages but as people who just happen to have a totally different culture  is perhaps the most thoughtful out of all the italian cannibal thrillers he is never condescending to the natives even when the team of filmmakers is aping vietnam era soldiers burning down native huts for kicks part of me wonders if this isnt some ultimate example of an anticapitalist liberal fantasy run amok white people invade the sanctum of nature rape and murder their way across the jungle and are torn to pieces  eaten for their arrogance if deodato was responding to vietnam or cambodia in part it will be interesting to see how he responds to iraq afghanistan new york madrid washington london pennsylvania and bali with his cannibal metropolitan sequel in preproduction as of this date if he needs a story editor have someone message me there are some ideas here  only please no turtles910 im sorry its a masterpiece live with it,cruel
i bought this film over ebay after hearing and reading about it i got hold of an uncut version and had high expectations although i wasnt quite sure what to expecti have seen numerous infamous horrorfilms such as bunman the untold story men behind the sun etc but always seems to get most onlineattention and last night i watched it what an absolute mess this film is a joke the acting is dismal i cant believe some reviewers on here speak of realistic acting i have seen better in kindergarten christmas plays  the horrorscenes are unspectacular the axes with which most killing takes place look pathetic and the special effects are poor  the nakedness and rape scenes are simple crowdpleasers as this film as nothing special to offer deodato throws in as many nude scenes as possible which is typical for early 80s italian bmovies  the animal killings are sad in all senses of the word sad deodato realises that these are the only truly gruesome scenes and he milks it by spending too much time on it the turtleslaughter takes nearly 5 minutesthere is so much more to criticise about this film but i wont waste any more time on it dont be mislead by the mediaattention this film is truly terrifying terrifyingly bad,cruel
an elite us and columbian military team go into the jungles of south america to search for lost filmmakers who are making a documentary they battle cannibal tribes including making friends with one so they can get the filmmakers lost films but find the filmmakers dead in new york city television producers want to view the reels so they can see if its suitable enough for television as a documentary special as they view we also see the filmmakers adventure into the south american jungles as they find what horrors lie beyond the green infernosadistic extremely violent realistic immoral and disturbing as well italian made horror adventure classic from ruggero deoato that has became a landmark in foreign horror and one of the most infamous movies of all time the movie is 2 parts in one being the first half being a predatorstyle action adventure and the second half the viewer sees through the eyes of the filmmakers within the movie reels documentarystyle yes the acting is awkward but the movie is very original with a haunting music score and has been known as the source for the blair witch project with the same concept of moviemaking with a home camera to make it as a fake documentary and similar plot about people looking for something legendary then a year later their footage is foundthe movie is filled with realistic graphic violence unpleasant rape scenes  the one in the beginning makes the one in clockwork orange look tame cannibalism nudity gore smarmy sex scenes and the most talked about thing in this movie is the horrifying scenes of actual animals getting killed on screen such as a large turtle getting hacked and ripped apart even from its shell but the animals in the movie were killed for food supply when the movie originally came out in italy it caused quiet a controversy as people thought the filmmakers in the movie were actually murdered as they were arrested but ruggero deoato proved in court that no one was actually killed as it was all faked in the movie except for the animals since then the movie was banned for 4 years then in 1984 it was reissued again then became a hit worldwide including being one of japans highest grossing boxoffice hitsthis film is truly powerful stuff as its difficult to watch but a very unique movie that assaults the viewers senses if you thought a clockwork orange blue velvet and passion of the christ were pretty button pushing then you aint seen nothing yet as this movie ranks as a nasty treat besides caligula and men behind the sun its an important movie in the genre,cruel
what shall we say this were a movie ive heard a lot of different things about some has said that its one of the best horror films out there some has said the direct opposite i is with the second this movie has almost no story it just wants to show up as much cannibal and animal violence as possible sure there is a story which is that a group of documentary makers is set to make a movie about cannibals the film makers disappear so make their video cassettes and soon a group of people is set out to look after the films and the filmmakers they succeed and finds the films but the film makers is dead and after this a group of people looks trough the videotapes and its an oddesey of violence and sex the violence is just unnecessary and everything is just sick and disgusting and then its all the violence against animals ohh they kill a turtle a pig and much more it made me sad and grossed outbut if we shall lock at some good parts which are few the foto is sometimes real nice the acting is not half that bad most of the time but that doesnt help when the rest is so bad i couldnt honestly recommend this to anyone its not really a horror movie its just 90 minutes of the sickest stuff ive seen to date i could say buy this movie if you want to see something unusual but not for entertainment value which there is almost none of,cruel
this film is sick sick i tell you apart from the animal cruelty the worst being when they dissect a tortoise and pull out its intestines and crap bag and start to eat it and numerous other things too sick to mention it is work of art for the first half we follow a group of journalists who investigate and successfully blend in with the natives who treat them with respect do things very gross things to become part of there culture including eating raw meat covered in blood and eating a tribes womans white puke which looks like marshmallow fluff but im sure doesnt taste like itwhen he gets back we see the footage of the other journalists who got separated from him who are basically a bunch of pyschos and who actually got deeper into the tribes peoples culture the film then essentially becomes blair witch but with some truly horrible moments of gore all filmed with realism and we then become the voyeurs of violence the same way as the investigators do as they view the footage and try to make a sensational tabloid story out ofthis is a genius structure for a horror film of this sort works much better than blair witch comments on many themes such as violence voyeurism disrupting ones territory trying to resculpture those in society who have there own lifestyle the tribes the arrogance of white middle class societys desire to change those who are happy with their lifestyle and dont need it changing the journalistsvery gross and hard to stomach but if you can and can get hold of the uncut version do so the violence in this actually makes sense unlike mels passion of the christ,cruel
not withstanding the gratuitous animal cruelty this film is utterly insulting and i am amazed that people cant see through the masquerade as art this film is  shocking for the sake of being shocking and that is the laziest form of film making the film is utterly racist with every one of the natives portrayed as violent rapists it is also utterly misogynistic in fact has me worried about the film maker considering that every single woman in the film is viciously raped and that the rapes are seen as titillating utterly disgusting,cruel
i stopped long ago using scatological metaphors about movies but this one sorely tried meits simply the worst movie ive ever seen the first half alone is an overstretched patchwork of delaying dodges badly acted poorly directed and execrably edited cant imagine there was a script before this mess and lets forget the blatantly fartee soundtrackthe worse is yet to come in the rushes of the first expedition charitable spoilers ahead as theres very little plot to be shot some animals are slaughtered along the way the whole slaughter is morbidly shown in extenso its a documentary you know then you get to know the guys of the expedition really bad guys they rape they wreck havoc just for fun o in the end they get what they deserve they are slaughtered one after the other until theres no one left to shoot the marvelous show the old pretence for morbid voyeurism look what some weirdos are able to do incredible aint it positive side disclaimer let me tell you i am not proud of finding positive things in it the exploitative premise was good an anthropologist gets his hands on cans of reels shot by an illfated expedition as they did later with the blairwitch project largely cashed in on the marketing buzz there was snuff stuff in itanyone who admires or simply finds this interesting should go and see a psychologist moreover i hate to say so but anyone who wants to watch this another time should be filed for the sake of inland security,cruel
i watched this film for 2 reasons 1 i love gore 2like lots of other people i am tempted by the fact that it was bannedi have to say that as far as the basics of the film gothe rape and murderthe cannibalism and the tortureits all pretty much mundane and you can actually find far worse in a lot of filmsthe only thing that really got to me was what was done to the animalsthere are scenes of real brutality towards a lot of animals in this film and frankly it appalled mei love films with buckets of blood and gore and rape murder death etc etc etc but animals should never be killed for enjoymentif you like gory filmsit aint bad but if you have a sense of decency and like animals to be given a chance to live without being needlessly killed avoid like the plague,cruel
rarely have i seen such a tremendous amount of stupidity the cannibals are shown in a grotesque way that kills all the credibility of the project moreover the young documentary team is composed of characters that are totally unrealistic either they or the director had never seen a documentary in their life before the purpose of the film is to simulate in the mind of the audience the impact and the crudity of a snuff movie however the film is made in a way that annihilates this idea the situations are totally unreal  we are oftenly given to see sequences in which four points of view at the least are involved when the crew possess supposedly two cameras countains a number of clichs as rarely seen before and after including a touch of poor pornography the psychology of the characters is pathetically plain the pseudoehtnologists that are shown in the film behave like the young brainless postteenagers that they probably are in real life we are thus given to see a succession of rape scenes murder scenes animal slaughter each one more aberrant than the other in other words is an hallucinating piece of junk which i wouldnt advise my worst ennemy to watch,cruel
this movie could have easily been a 9 or a 10 because it is truly a disturbing masterpiece and really makes you think about what we consider civilized the reason im rating it so low is that it is ridiculous that the animal slaughters were done using live animals 7 animals were killed in the making of this video though only 6 are shown which was completely unnecessary as they clearly had the skills to depict realistic murderslaughterrapegore scenes as shown by all the gruesome events featuring humans the only good thing to come out of this is that very few movies afterwards ever used real animals becausr of all the backlash this one received,cruel
why has the modern society created a label horror as if to separate it when in truth any type of danger death or threat could be horror in any genre to our senses to me deodato has never made any horror he made films to awake you to life itself which includes both realms of light and dark equally feel the music in so heavenly exactly during times of great darkness at the same time that is deodatos theme constantly hiding underneath most of his films from waves of lust to ballad in blood the latter one even features the famous opening scene where a guy is vomitting onto his girlfriend right at the moment of making love to her speaks on a very intellectual level driven by visceral content not about some people but most of the society unaware of its hypocrisy it juxtaposes the nature and the falseness of man colliding with the nature always winning at the endamong other things i see the killing of animals killing is not animal cruelty as one of the most beautiful things about this film and truly genious in the way of testing audiences own triggers insecurity and disconnection from life life tests us all the time when our wife is raped or our child killed for instance how many men have enough emotional maturity not to feel the need for revenge or feel stable during times of emotional darkness this is what spiritual masters have always overcome not to get swallowed by darkness but embrace it by embodying enough light within ourselveshas been among the most relevant films for the mankind in these last few decades for its reactions from the public and until most of the society transcends the limitations that can get people even offended or insecure it will still have a lot to say subconsciously people are drawn to films like this without fully knowing whythis film shows a picture of what most of this world has yet to overcome,cruel
bloody disgusting but a remarkable achievement this movie had a lot of controversy surrounding the kills in it just remember its just a movie,cruel
cannibal holocost is a special film it pulls no punches and spares no feelings its positively disgusting but written well enough that it still has a cohesive compelling story between the grossout moments which is something far too many extreme films lack the characters are wellacted and compelling and though you know that the film crew will ultimately meet their demise you find yourself feeling a warped sense of justice seeing it unfold in all its grisly glorythis is the only movie that has managed to make my stomach churn i could talk about the animal cruelty as so many have but i feel that since the animals were all later eaten or so ive heard its just a fact of life that we firstworld moviegoers arent used to seeing portrayed in such graphic visceral fashion the soundtrack only helped it along heightening the anxiety that came along with these scenes and helping to truly cement the film into the back of your mind foreverin the end the message is very clear and one that i think most of us can stand by humans are buttholes especially firstworld humans,cruel
made in 1980 is considered to be the most controversial movie ever made one of the many italian cannibal films of the time the story is about a professor searching for a missing documentary crew when he finds the footage and brings it home he realizes how the film crew really acted after the film was released the director ruggero deodato was arrested on obscenity and murder charges but prooved he didnt kill his actors overall the film is entertaining and enjoyable but may be hard to watch it has many scenes that are very graphic including scenes of real animals being killed but one scene stands out from the rest and that would be the ritualistic punishment scene its so hard to watch and so graphic the score for the film is great from the main theme to savage rite its definitely one to save on spotify i do perfer man from deep river and cannibal ferox over this though,cruel
as is often the case with horror movies one of the weakest aspects of this film is the acting which is serviceable at best with the exception of robert kerman as the lead monroe it helps that the character he plays is a very likeable one who leads this expedition in search of the missing filmmakers with the best intentions  he immediately sympathises with his yacumo guide and respects the yanomam enough to strip naked and wash in front of them and even to share human meat with them when he returns home to view the footage he becomes both literally and symbolically the audience and the filmmaker at the same timeseeing the story from monroes perspective means we see the aftermath of the missing filmmakers expedition during the first half of the film and the footage of the expedition itself during the second it was a neat touch to show monroe in between his reviews of the footage  at first hes eagerly trying to interview the deceaseds families but by the end hes advocating the tapes destruction one thing that doesnt add up however is why the filmmakers would have recorded themselves committing these awful acts if they were trying to stage everything  why film themselves raping a womanin addition to some great gore and cadaver effects there are lots of haunting visuals including the shrine made from human bones wrapped in recording equipment the raped girl impaled on a wooden pole and the numerous animal killings which were genuine and are very hard to watch these contrast effectively with the more beautiful shots of nature and wildlife the sound design is gritty with the volcanic gunshots being most noteworthy and the score is just amazing  from the beautiful yet subtly eerie opening theme to the quiet foreboding ambience of tribal drums to the track adulteress punishment which is beyond wordstheres some great albeit onthenose dialogue throughout that puts the films lofty message across nicely  that perhaps were worse than the savages this is a film about children of the space age being consumed by a primitive world they thought they could conquer as well as about the ethics of journalists that exploit the less fortunate for entertainmenti wasnt disappointed when i first watched this film its as shocking graphic and hardtowatch as youd expect but its far more intelligent than people give it credit for910,cruel
its tough to really talk about not because its a high art cinema masterpiece more because its a gut wrenching crawl through the pits of depravity even today 30 years after its release its still a film that brings out intense disgust and revolt a film so controversial it still remains banned and heavily censored in numerous countries a film so gruesomely realistic the director was charged with obscenity and was accused of making a snuff film yet without the world wouldnt have found footage movies a low budget genre of horror which presents itself as a real event captured through a home camera which was popularised by films like the blair witch project and paranormal activity this film birthed a genre and for that its cemented itself into film historyis ripe with numerous cliches for the genre the typical group of film makers go missing and their footage is discovered later interestingly the film itself spends a large amount of time focusing on the discovery of the footage professor harold monroe portrayed by famous porn star robert kerman ventures into the depths of the amazon in search of a missing documentary team consisting of alan the director gabriel yates his girlfriend faye francesca ciardi and their two cameramen mark luca barbareschi and jack perry pirkanen who were shooting a film on the yanomam and shamatari tribes upon discovering their footage he takes it back to new york and clashes with tv executives who desire to use the footage in a guaranteed ratings success documentary upon viewing the footage the true nature of the crew shows itself in one of most testing stomaching churning films ever mademainly consists of two things one incredibly realistic and graphic violence and two surprisingly effective commentary on journalism ethics and western modernisation dont get me wrong is muddled in its message in its attempts to portray the ill effects of sensationalism the film itself devolves into it beneath the commentary on journalistic ethics and treatment of indigenous peoples is a horror film and a brutally violent one at that yet surprisingly it manages to get its warped message across beneath the buckets of gore and horror the crew making the documentary are cons staging murders and causing terror in the search for the perfect shot in a notable scene the group stumbles into a yacumo village where they hoard the villages up in a hut and set it a light filming the resulting panic and chaos another notorious scene involves the male members of the crew violently rape a native girl knowing full well she will be executed by the tribe they discover her impaled corpse on the shore later and gleefully film the sight the executives are aware of alans habit of committing murder with his crew yet they turn aw blind eye because as one of the executives puts it today people want sensationalism the more you rape there senses the happier they are in a way shes right paints a horrific picture that isnt afraid to use some of the darkest stuff ever set to tape to get its message across yet there are times where it gets a bit out of handtheres another thing about that tends to get people upset the animal violence uses genuine animal gore why it does this i have no idea but the nearly 5 minute scene of a turtle being bisected and disembowelled is where i started to get angry indeed six animals are slaughtered on camera the last five in a space of 30 minutes snakes and spiders are sliced in half a pig is beaten and shot and in probably the worst scene of the film a coatimundi is stabbed through the neck and dies a slow painful death while screeching in agony its rancid exploitive and most importantly cruel yet if you can look past such a thing the actual meat and bones pardon the pun of is surprisingly effective yes its overly gruesome yes its hypocritical but ill be damned if it didnt make me think the films harrowing conclusion is where things really descend into hell as the crew are all violently massacred and eaten by the tribe yet still even while their crew mate is gang raped and beheaded the remaining crew insist on filming even until theyre torn to shreds the footage stops and monroe ponders to himself i wonder who the real cannibals are is disgusting its a vile wretched piece of cinema that never ceases in offending and revelling in its own degeneracy but still its a surprisingly effective and well thought out critique on the western world seeking to reach out its grasp into what remains of ancient tribes and to crush them on the corrupted journalism scene which warps the truth and commits heinous acts to get the perfect story on the dangers of not respecting cultures alien to us its a long road to hell and paints it perfectly dripping with blood realism and most of all truth710,cruel
ive now shown this movie to people five times after id watched it it is one of the only movies that has ever made me sick and it really made me think about who we are as peopleis outrageous solely because of the fact that its supposed to question our morals as a society weve all taken world history and literature at some point atrocities are committed all the time in history but we dont think about it as much because we cant relate to history if we werent therewell this makes sure you knowhotel rwanda and the boy in the striped pajamas are the only movies ive seen that have a similar theme we think you are evil but in reality we are more savage than youyes the incessant animal cruelty was unnecessary but cruelty in general is unnecessary and this was based on a true storyif only deodato could have made more gems like this to make us fear and thinkgratzie for this wonderful opportunity to scare people into the light,cruel
this movie does what most horror films do featuring real life killings of animals and burning down a tribal village just for fun shows how this movie is extremely unapologetic,cruel

there i was eating a couple of bland rich tea biscuits when all of a sudden an innocent monkey is decapitated with a tribesman devouring its tiny skull safe to say i did not eat anymore rich tea biscuits often regarded as the most controversial film of alltime naturally i prepped my mind and body for the worst although i do not condone various practices during its filming surprised me there is textual substance to be found beneath the excessive gore and sexual violence a professor travels to the amazon to locate missing filmmakers who were creating a documentary on the green inferno when he finds their skeletal remains and the films he returns back to civilisation to watch the footage a fundamental question is raised as the documentary reveals its true nature are the civilised just as savage as the primitive are we the true cannibals of humanity by pioneering the found footage technique this film was widely regarded for its shocking realism so much so that the director was accused of murder and with this technique the exploration into societal savagery is a thorough bloody presentation the bloodsoaked actions of the tribal individuals are reactions from the filmmakers who cause destruction to their village sexually assaulting their women and unnecessarily murdering the inhabitants their monstrous actions are exaggerated to absurd levels that whilst frequently feels derivative does highlight the violence ensued by white colonials the acting was mediocre and the editing often haphazard but the amateur style offers a contagious charm that makes the whole scenario feel even more realhowever despite the bbfc cutting these scenes out i do take issue with the obscene amount of animal cruelty no creature should be slaughtered for the sake of art so slicing tarantulas and snakes with a machete is a no from me dragging a turtle onto shore and removing its insides is a no from me authenticity has its limits the first thirty minutes were particularly slow as you patiently wait for the controversy to ensue a disadvantage of acquiring such a title however the pace picks up as soon as the professor interacts with the tribe its also worth mentioning that the act of sexual violence was completely unnecessary and seems like its sole purpose is just to justify the damnation of these documentarians theyve already done enough to be viewed as the antagonists therefore proving this scene to be nothing more than obscenity so whilst i condemn certain excessive segments and filmmaking techniques there is a surprising amount of substance just make sure you dont eat anything as you watch it,cruel
i dont have a problem with the excessive violence if its acted but the cruelty to animals is entirely unnecessary and the filmmakers were clearly ignorant to the irony of their white people are bad arent we good to point that out message any value that was here perhaps in being one of the first films to use found footage is made null and void  though it must be said there was almost no value here to begin with its a dull film with stupid writing and bad acting dont bother,cruel
ill admit it i watched this movie because its notorious but was surprised to find the cannibalism was minor what it really is is a movie about exploitation that is a lot more than skin deep and mixes a fictional movie with reality in ways that are quite disorientating  i found that i couldnt easily compartmentalize the violence rape and gore into this is just a movie as easily as usual the reason is simple  the animal deaths are real the guts that are portrayed as human are probably real animal guts the director exploits the real natives they were real and none of them get credits the main characters exploit the natives the natives exploit each other the studio execs exploit everyone i as a watcher am exploiting the natives and the animalsvery interesting to ponder in the days after youve watched it dont get me wrong though the finale is pretty gruesome and looks very very real partly because it maintains the handicamlost film idea right to the endi guess i didnt give it a 10 because the it doesnt really age well  but most certainly this is a one of a kind movie that cant be easily repeated  certainly not by hollywood,cruel
is an obscenity but its an obscenity with purpose the film is heavily censored in many countries and banned in even more countries due to the excessive amounts of violence nudity and gore its hard to criticize this aspect of the movie though because its so relevant to the plot and very well madeshoti dont want to be that guy that likes to talk about messages in movies but does a fantastic job taking a look at western culture i dont want to spoil the unraveling of the message over the course of the film but by the end it may really make you think about some things in life a little differently including this moviethe biggest criticism i hear from people who resent this movie is that several animals were killed in the making of which i think is truly horrible but i think its more important to look at the film its self and not the production behind it i think some of the weaker aspects of the movie are some of the subpar acting shaky cam moments and use of music at certain momentsi really dont know if i can outright recommend just because of how extreme it is but it is still a very well made film that has a lot to offer in terms of horror and message as well as being the first found footage film,cruel
thats all i have to say just thought id share it is a good film obviously a classic i saw it at a midnight showing recently but once i watched the gore and the unsettling imagery in its entirety i decided i never wanted to eat meat again,cruel
watched this movie quite a few years back and at first i was a bit disturbed there are a lot of scenes in the movie which i thibk will disturb a lot of people however after thinking over it i found out that the director of the movie has actually shown the reality the group that went into the amazon to search for the missing three persons actually exploited the tribe and their traditions in various ways as a result the tribe revolted against them and then followed rape and murder of these people a good movie i would say,cruel
lets get the obvious out of the way this is a very disturbing movie and as someone who can watch abbatoir footage completely stonefaced this is somehow worse watching it at times i honestly felt sick and finishing it i vowed i would never watch it again this is a very uncomfortable film approach with cautionnow thats out of the way while i dont like this movie for a few reasons im not even going to attempt to say why i do have to admit it is pretty clever in spite of its hypocritical production again im not getting into it the basic idea is about sensationalism and how the media chooses to spin things so to be completely fair it is pretty cleverat first like i said this movie is very disturbing and veeeeery uncomfortable it is admittedly very well acted though inevitably some of the adr is kinda flaky the idea is quite clever and i hate to admit it but its directed and shot very well especially by 70s80s exploitation standards but none of this justifies anything that happens on screen my five out of ten grade was very begrudging make of that what you will but dont say i didnt warn you,cruel
this film only warrants to be used as toilet paper during the day after 1983 tv from the real killings of a turtle to that of a spider monkey this film is about an nyu professor who goes to south america to salvage the film recordings and find the crew who were sent to investigate a cannibalistic tribe soon he returns to new york to view the tapes with his peers they discover the crews heinous intent in south america  which seems to be bent on destruction and violence along with the poor portrayal of the native tribes filled with offensive and graphic scenes such as rape murder and the killing of numerous live animals the story speaks on a very shallow level about violence in the media the footage from the crew is filmed in a very gritty cinema verit documentary style somewhat convincing the viewer that what they are seeing is in fact real although this is somewhat intriguing the film fails to produce anything but a ultraviolent pseudosnuff film which makes you want to get into a delorean kick in up to 88 and drive into a brick wall this review is a warning do not watch this film not even for those with a strong stomach the crews footage will most likely shock and disgust you and not in a good way no wonder the director spent some time in jail due to this  above all else  loathesome piece of celluloid s,cruel
it works to an extent in showing who are the real savages but then it doesnt work when it becomes what exactly it is criticizing but then the director has contradicted himself at different occasions about meaning to include a message and not however the level of animal cruelty and racism is quite apparent the film is quite brilliant and shocking at times but in the end its disgusting not just because of what is shown but how they chose to show it,cruel
seducing the wild side of every humansthe only unwatchable thing is the killing of innocent animals they are real not graphics,cruel
has always been a movie that by reputation that ive avoided its been tagged as the one that goes all the way and has been banned in over fifty countries and it isnt every movie that gets confiscated ten days after its premiere with the director arrested and charged with obscenityhow much of this film was inspired by gualtiero jacopetti and his cycle of mondo films like mondo cane africa addio and goodbye uncle tom i think deodato tips his hand toward this influence by using the music of italian composer riz ortolani whose song more was featured in mondo cane it was nominated for an academy award for best original song in 1963 ortolanis soundtrack is well the best part of the film the opening song is gorgeous and lush with only a subtle hint that all will not be wellits hard to truly believe in the who are the real animals narrative when it seems like deodato learned none of those lessons for himself still i feel that films should challenge you and push you and make you think i wouldnt recommend this film im not upset that i watched it but i know how people are about having their sensibilities threatened and this is a film that will bleed puke and piss all over them before eating the remains,cruel
blair witch project came out in 1999 as paranormal activity did in 2007 originally 2005 was the beginning of found footagemore than just shaky cameras and a blessing of no digital effects is controversial practical and risqu as a found footage film should be the journey of who the real cannibals are makes you consider the definition of cannibal once more considering how cannibals can be hungry enough even for another human being to be degraded and belittled of a stoneage culture with those film cameras in grip like a pistol it adds more the journey of these lost americans and their intentions of recording footage as a trophy and eradication more than an observation of stoneage culturesclearly this was a big deal in 1980 for how realistic it looks and even makes cgi in todays technological standards look like a couple of steps behind but once youve seen it again it is obvious with the practical effects and if you research the controversy that surrounded this film they literally had to take this film to court blair witch project was good but jittery and shaky if the lack of dialogue makes you impatient paranormal activity set the digital standard of found footage however was shattered in my belief over the 2007 ending over the 2005 endingits pacy its edgy and it makes you cringe and clinch no other found footage films done especially when it comes to controversy a serbian film counterargued in 2011 and succeeded,cruel
at the time most hollywood movies allowed animals to die in a film from horses to dogs which were strays plus the few nocturnal bats was also the first movie to introduce found footage sequences to make it seem more real than it actually is a story about a group of anthropologist thrill seekers who wanted to make a documentary about a hidden tribe not seen by any white man in history tales of past cannibalistic people started to surface in the mid to late seventies as borders in the amazon forest became public after much heated debates in the unsoon countless documentaries were told about reclusive and often remote tribal people on camera some that became violent resulted in either internal executions or from an outside source such as the military regimes who thwarted the indigenous people as punishment yet to give this film a broader scope the realistic viewpoints of the troupe landed them in deep trouble as their idealistic way through uses of unneeded violence such as gang raping one of the women or killing animals as a means to eat the effects bordered both realism and daunting horror as each trekker became victim to their own debauchery and unconfined judgment to get that one perfect shot even in the face of deathafter this film was shown in theatres most went to the humane society and vetoed from the public eye because it was so honestly raw and horrific to stomach censors from all over the us banned it from being shown because of the extremities and wanton chaos that the story had displayed in fact it was vaulted until an appeal was issued some twenty years later via the freedom of speech act was brought up in the shortest court case in history since then this film had been the pinnacle of later films such as the blair witch project and countless other movies that uses found footage techniquesexcept with this film not all could still stomach some of the gratuitous gore or unneeded sequences of killing animals such as the turtle or boar and even the muskrat the cruelty displayed in still lingers to those viewers who saw it the first time and has never adapted well to other such films perhaps the desensitization dug deeper than it would allow but for newer audience members it has a cult following for me i do not like this film it uses too much grotesque misogynistic scenes that displays at how thoughtless and ridiculous a human can bealthough it was supposed to be an anthropology study it soon became a mindless crazed romp in the jungle with a group of students who only wanted to be famous no matter the cost yet in the end their only means of remembrance got burned in the cellar incinerator along with all of their notes and collected archived footage an ironic result that stated to the outside world that the amazon forest should remain a mystery and for those who trespass onto sacred ground knowing or not knowing the rules could get them killed either way the people have been ongoing since the stone age and does not need to be disturbed by any interferences not recommended to anyone under the age of eighteen this a very volatile film and must not be watched alone,cruel
is a very good movie but its also a gruesome movie i am a person who can handle blood guts and gore very good but this was totally insane i was so offended at some points in this movie that i almost threw up the other thing i didnt like about this movie is that the acts they did to the animals ive never liked to see animals die or being tortured in movies but i can handle it okay in this movie though i did not believe what i saw at times they cut off the legs of a turtle while it was alive and ripped of the shell of the turtle as well but other than this i would call this movie a fantastic movie the shots in this movie is fantastic and we get a look at what humanity can do to the jungle absolutely a must watch for a horror fan but not if youre easily offended i think it will be a long long time to the next time i will see this movie since even though it is a masterpiece i do not wish to be so offended as i was when i watched this movie again,cruel
tells the story of a film crew that was lost in the amazon while filming a documentary on life in the jungle their camera reveals the a horrifying truth about what really happens away from civilized society from start to finish the movie is filled with shocking and graphic moments so if you get squeamish at the thought of cannibalism i would recommend steering clear of this moviewhen people tell you not to watch this movie they mean it i saw this when i was 15 after i was told by several people it was too intense for anyone i thought i would be able to handle it since i watch a lot of scary intense and gory movies but too it to a whole new leveleven though this movie is extremely well made and delivers its message well the one major thing i dont like about this movie it its real animal cruelty scenes yes actual animals were killed while this movie was being filmed and it was all caught on camera i could have gone my whole life without seeing those scenes and i would have died a happy man but not anymore,cruel
prior to my viewing of ruggero deadatos i had of course the knowledge of the films controversy and notorious reputation as being one of the most disturbing movies ever made hence this was my reason for viewing it and boy was i underwhelmed first of all there is very little gore in this movie when compared against modern horror movies in addition to such the scenes of sexual violence and rape were also fairly lower in impact than what is around nowadays now for me to consider something to be disturbing requires it to be realistic and believable is often neither thus why it did not disturb me the acting is poor and often amateur at best but then again i dont go into viewing a film called with the expectation of topnotch acting and brilliant dialogue but this was worse than i expected summary little violence  poor acting  no reason to be disturbingthe film also features several scenes of genuine animal killings and as ive been thinking now i thought to myself why were they even in the film for example at one point the documentarians participate in the decapitation and mutilation of a turtle which they then eat how did this act further the plot themes or ideas of the film in any way what are we meant to interpret that documentarians have a taste for turtle meat this is just one of numerous pointless animal killings in the filmand im also not a fan of the found footage genre which seems to often be an excuse to put less effort and money into filming a movie in addition to poor acting handheld camera footage only further establishes a bgrade feel that no viewer likes not that there arent good found footage films but you get what i meanso at this point youre probably wondering to yourself about why ive rated this film a 7 considering that i have so many negative criticisms well i want it be noted that i do enjoy the ideas and themes of the film that are conveyed such as documentarians being more savage than the treedwelling jungle inhabitants which leaves the viewer wondering who the real cannibals are this comparison of different peoples attempts to redefine our definition of the word civilised it is the intelligence behind these ideas that i enjoy in conjunction with this the film has a good plotto summarise i would like to say that this film is not disturbing in its time of the early 80s it wouldve been the most repulsive film available yet graphic violence in film is much more common now the film also has a good plot and conveys good ideas yet these wouldve been more effective should the film have had better acting and been filmed differently overallhence my rating is 710 its good not great not something that im likely to watch again,cruel
if the dude who made this movie had never been born would that mean we would never have been exposed to these garbage found footage films ah if only wishes could come truesometimes movies are heralded as classics just because theyre old this is one of those films its not a classic horror like the shining a clockwork orange the amityville horror or even the entity its just an old overly hyped torture porn flick if youre into that watch it i watched it for free so im not fussed about the hour and thirty plus minutes i lost on it spoiler alert it only starts to get disturbing or even interesting after about an hour into the movie and frankly the most disturbing part of the film is the apparently needless slaughtering of the animals and the savage on a stick for a low budget film those special effects looked pretty dmn real far surpassing most present day films of the same caliber that hadheave a much bigger budget i hope they at least fed the dead animals to the villagers poor turtledidnt feel the least bit sorry for the environmentalists their deaths were well deserved dont fck around with the tree people live like a savage die like a savageoverall the movie was meh i give it a six because its fairly watchable the effects are excellent and it is thought provoking provided youve got more than two brain cells rubbing togetherwho are the real savagesim going to say the human race as a whole,cruel
dear ruggero deodato a day after 911 somebody should have sent a copy of your film to the bush administration they would never have invaded iraqlet me just say that is a tremendous achievement what can you say about a 35 year old horror film that puts most modern horror films to shame there is just so much to appreciate in your filmlet me start with the structure now i am no horror movie geek but i think yours must be one of the first found footage films only a third of the movie is found footage unlike recent found footage films your film involves characters reflecting on the found footage i think this was a great idea as it provides contextyour fearless daring also needs to be appreciated i heard you got arrested for some of the stuff you put on film but i read that sergio leone congratulated your personally so it did pay off in the end i admit that i had to take my eyes off the screen during some of the animal violence but i dont get all the outrage i am on the side of the people who argue that animals get murdered everyday to feed families anyway the scenes of violence between the tribal s and the civilized were also gruesome and disturbing i can only imagine what went on during the shoot i guess the crew must have had great fun the sex scene was almost pornographic i seriously doubt whether they were actingand that score by riz ortolani and the way you used it ortolanis score which conveys a sense of nostalgia and doom at the same time elevated this movie to another level i cannot imagine this movie without the background score or this background score being used for another movie the tune called adulteress punishment played during the scenes of primitive violence is just art the warm and summery main theme provides a great start to the film with the overhead shot of the forestlast but not the least the social commentary i couldnt help but feel that the whole film is a critique of western intervention in the affairs of third world nations the two fighting tribes and the civilized western man playing them against each other is almost certainly you having a go at american foreign policy the civilized western man and woman making love out in the open as the tribal s look on could be an allegory for the spread of debauched western culture across the world and the repeated shots of the tall skyscrapers in the western cities were you implying that in the face of mans primitive urges all the skyscrapers would amount to nothing  i wonder if the 911 terrorists watched once again your film is a tremendous achievement i am not rating it a 1010 due to the bad acting but that is a minor complaint in a film like thisi hope to watch this in blu ray and i will be watching more of your moviesbest regards pimpin910,cruel
have seen it this despite it combines two of my not so favorite elements being gore and found footage its pretty weird because found footage stands for me for what the x is going on or to quote one of those annoying blair witch characters what the x is that while no one could see anything and there might have been nothing and probably was nothing but its not about the blair witch project if did one thing right despite its disturbing content was not to shy away from what was happening and make it clear what actually was filmed not his overly shaky drunk camerawork which makes me dizzy but the found footage is only in the second half approximately 40 minutes and interrupted by reactions of shock from those who are in discussion whether to broadcast it or notnow about the gore well almost exclusively in the found footage stuff and no i didnt really come only from the cannibals actually the things the white documentary makers were doing were way more disturbing to me they actually were the ones acting like savages uncivilized beasts i think it answered the professors question at the end very well there who are actually the cannibals obviously not the nativesi liked the buildup the professor visiting the native tribes and he sees they are actually not those savages that outsiders believe them to be but it could have been shortened in my opinion maybe some more time could have been given to those nasty documentary shooters yeah its hard to get much character development if only excerpts from their documentary are shown and i doubt however i would have felt more sympathy for them in the end i knew the film would not want to make me feel sorry for them they deserved their fate as cruel as it was but what they did to the natives and the animals was much more cruel they obviously wanted to abuse their power to get sensational shots yes even if faye the only female among the 4 adventurers didnt really actively participate in harassing the natives she did nothing to prevent her colleagues committing these crimes she did approve of them the only time she intervenes is when the guys rape a native girl not because she feels pity for the girl but because she doesnt want them to waste film and she particularly doesnt like it when her sleazy boyfriend has a go at the girl too while it might sound clich yeah the guys are pigs in it the girl is again the decent one well that stood for me until faye allowed herself to be banged by her boyfriend for all the natives to see and went totally down the drain when she did nothing to save that poor native girl from the white rapistsnow i have been hesitating to talk about the animal killings and abuse again i think the white men where the ones who did it for their pleasure not the natives with the turtle scene the most obvious example but to say that the movie needs to rely on these scenes to shock the audience clearly didnt get the point the movie makers wanted to make again the cruelties are shown not always overly detailed which isnt necessary we know here exactly what cruelties are and who does them we dont need to guess not that feeling i have with other found footage what did happen did there happen actually anything now is this a good movie i think in its genre yes very much i really like how it panned out and i liked the point the makers tried to get across it has happened before so many times white men forcing their civilization onto tribes in africa america even wiping out whole tribes of them of course they would fight back to keep their land their culture thats what every race would do to protect their own kind im not saying i am a fan of found footage now but it actually redeemed my view on the genre at least if it would actually be filmed in the way it was done in i guess when they go supernatural as since blair witch and so on i would lose my interest again,cruel
how eduardo sanchez found this film inspiring whilst creating and producing the blair witch project i have no earthly idea after watching this film i have to comment that this film is the most disturbing horror film i have ever had the misfortune to watch  and this is coming from a person who personally loves horror films it was too disturbing that i cant even give this film a rating i was originally intrigued about this film after i glanced at the supposedly banned film i spit on your grave and assumed that the movie was banned during a time where gruesome horror was taboo in our once civilised society compared to the usual macabre we see in horror movies today however when i sat down to watch this movie i could not believe what i had seen on my laptop screen of course the word cannibal kind of gives the main plot of the movie away automatically because we relate the ideas of killings and eating flesh to this word but this movie takes the idea of cannibalism way too far we as an audience simply wished to see nothing but 1980s horror however deodato shocked us with at least six different examples of animal cruelty the scene where the squirrel monkey is decapitated and defaced will never leave my thoughts many scenes of rape honestly the gangrape scene makes us as civilised humans look like sexstarved degenerates and of course the infamous scenes of tortures and unnecessary killings the impalement scene being one of them i apologise deodato but we did not ask to see such horror and macabre and what inspired you to create such a film is beyond me completely what happened to the simple yet excellent horror we once saw in films such as the 1984 version of a nightmare on elm street or the shining whatever is wrong with sticking to this simple genre of horror im sure that way deodato you will gain a much eager audience than what you did with this monstrosity therefore is not for the faint of heart indeed you might be tempted to watch this film again and again but be warned you will never think about horror films the same way again after watching ,cruel
when i think of horror truly genuine horror not the cheap stuff that teenage girls screamgigglegiggle at its almost always something hyperrealistic do not misunderstand me im not contradicting hp lovecraft when he stated that horror and fantasy are only separated by a stream of black water but i am saying its a narrowminded view fantasy worlds that we do not understand will always scare some of us but there will also always be a group of people who find all unrealistic horror completely laughable in the exact opposite sense ive never once heard a person say that the premises behind truly realistic horror films were laughable ironically realistic horror is scarce perhaps its because we live in a time where modern directors saw the omen when they were 2yearsold their underdeveloped minds mistook cheese for terror and now they live and breathe to pump the horror genre full of crappy unoriginal movies like the unborn or a tale of two sisters thus whenever i see a truly realistic horror film regardless of its quality i cant help but take it at least twice as seriously as i would yet another oh theres a cheesy demon lets get naked then do some insanely stupid thing and get killed film in other words is far from a great film in terms of quality but the fact its actually realistic gives it weight and makes it worth watchingthe first time i attempted to watch ill admit i was bored to the point of tears it just seemed like a toneddown less entertaining version of the temple of doom i turned it off 15 minutes in the next day came and i reluctantly decided to force myself to sit through the other 70 minutes of the film this time it caught my attention immediately the boring fauxdocumentary setup blended into an infinitely more interesting study of human naturewhile most films that study human nature really just end up repeating elementary facts that we knew before we were old enough to get into pgrated movies there is quite a bit more intelligence here instead of typically displaying the entire modern society or just the american society as evil accurately depicts the mental breakdown of the young liveforthemoment mind in 2009 thats something ive rarely seen in 1980 im pretty sure it was an original concept to display on film also what makes infinitely more realistic to battle royale or lord of the flies is that it never uses extremes while the former two works that i listed lump the entire human race together into a single idealistic gobbledygook character type does the opposite and presents good bad and everything in between through diverse realistic character traits this is why is so intelligent in presenting the whole clich human nature is to kill conceptas for the quality    well people have accurately said that the acting from the older people isnt great the four young central characters all act realistically and are portrayed realistically however i didnt find the acting bad enough to be distracting at any point in the film some of the gore effects are outdated but again i didnt feel it took away from the story unless you allow it tothe gore is minimal at best some would go as far as to say it isnt there at all there are a few generic nongraphic hollywood rape scenes a few infamous animal killings and a few human lacerations but thats about it its nothing you havent seen hundreds of times before a lot like a clockwork orange and natural born killers i have absolutely no idea how this film was labeled as insanely violent much less violentgory at all the small amount of gore that was there was simply generic and done in a nongraphic way im someone who is very sensitive to graphic gore and i found everything in this movie below the level of violence in the average rrated movie compared to any given saw film just looks bloodless i am not complaining about this however just stating the fact the movie did not need more gore for any reason and i blame the lack of it only on the silly infamous hypeoverall i found a very entertaining and thoughtprovoking experience i watched it with low expectations and had an absolute blast one of the most fun movies ive ever watched alone regardless of my tastes however it is impossible to deny the territory and importance of this film on the horror genre it forces you out of your face fantasy world and rubs your face in the filth of the real world    even if that filth isnt really that disturbing610,cruel
i think you have to see this film very much a product of its time the 1970s as every one knows were a time of filmmaking excess or boundary pushing whatever you want to call it and is probably the most notorious horrorexploitation film from that period gritty unflinching looks at the cruelties men are capable of like the films of michael winner with somewhat confused moral messages often involving the intrusion of evil white men into the territory of natives who prove to be just as brutal in retaliating to the atrocities committed by said white men its often unclear just how we are meant to take all of this and while such uncertainty accounts for the films unprecedented power their deeply unpleasant impure feel it seems somehow reprehensible if no less reprehensible than hollywoods increasingly overt glorification of violence if its to save cute little kiddies and is done by your favourite action heroesso to even more than winners more mainstream work its a misanthropic film but like winners its targets appear a little confused as another review ive read has noted it sets up its crew of filmmakers pretty much as straw men while it may be true that newscrews exaggerate manipulate distort etc i find it unlikely that theyd go as far as to massacre pretty much a whole village and thus muddies the message furthermore while the anthropologist proff monroe becomes the jaded voice of reason later in the film earlier hes not exactly a pillar of virtue shooting several members of one tribe in cold blood so as to gain the trust of another tribe the idea that holocaust is attacking the mondo films some of which actually did stage shocking events is rendered unlikely by the fact that with its attempt at veriterealism it comes across as a mondo film itself at least in the final documentary sectionin making this film it seems deodato deliberately plays up and questions his own role as exploitation filmmaker though by doing so he unwittingly undermines himself as well when in the penultimate scene the tv executive orders the footage to be burned one wonders if this was not the very same attitude held by those who tried to censor deodatos work for a film that exists seemingly to confront and arguably to exploit the depths of human depravity cruelty and violence the professors stance wanting to suppress the footage seems protectionist censorial surely it would make more sense to expose the filmmakers for who they were as is deodato and the scripts intention after all their earlier documentary the road to hell has been shown to have been faked to some extent yet people will believe it be real  would it not make more sense to expose the filmmakers and by extension the culture of exploitative reporting that they embody furthermore deodatos attitude to the native tribes is confused were supposed to sympathise or at least to understand the actions they take towards the filmcrew to see them as justified while they react with initial suspicion towards monroe it never looks like theyre actually going to eat him but the massacre in a hut pushes them over the edge yet what to make of the native savagery in one infamous scene the crew come across a naked woman impaled on a pole alan smirks seems to be enjoying the spectacle but is then told youre on camera and immediately changes to a face of concern pronouncing that this is the result of some barbaric sexual ritual from a people who hold virginity as almost sacred earlier on in the films first truly shocking scene weve seen a native murder an adulterous woman by sexually mutilating her obviously this is supposed to be yet another example of the thrillseeking filmmakers callousness and exploitativeness but at the same time its unclear what moral attitude is being taken visavis the natives uncivilised practices true the girl may have been killed in this way because she has been raped by the filmmakers in the preceding scene although its unclear whether its the same girl and the tribes attitude to sexual impurity demands such a grisly response but that doesnt make the actual act of execution any easier to stomachand of course there are the scenes of animal cruelty we see a muskrat have its throat slit and hear its screams of agony is this supposed to be just a fact of life  look meateaters this is the suffering animals go through to get you your meat  or just another cheap trick monroe shows a little distaste but doesnt seem too concerned the disembowelling of the turtle is shocking you see its legs move even as its insides are being cut out an effect enhanced by the score but would it be appear any more palatable excuse the pun if it was done with care rather than lipsmacking relish at one point a tv executive tells monroe today people want sensationalism the more you rape their senses the happier they are of course she hasnt seen the actual footage yet i dont think anyone could come away from holocaust feeling happy although they might well feel that their sense have been raped by pushing things just that little bit further the film does succeed to some extent in exposing and challenging our attitudes towards extreme violence it is strange how we find something like holocaust shocking and deserving of censorship but have become immune to the horrors and deprivations we see daily on our news screens of course deodato is exploiting his violence just as his fictional filmmakers are and i suppose one could argue that the films value lies as much in the issues that he didnt intend to raise as the ones that he did,cruel
why was this film banned seen worse at the cinema most of these film with a bad reputations are rubbish just seen this film not as gory as cannibal ferox but a better film still not greatacting not up to much strange how people get upset by these films because thats all they are films with actors not many banned films are any goodmost of these films dont age well you see more gore at the cinema of today films like hostel and saw better acted and better films anything banned from the seventies or there abouts is usually rubbishthere are a few that that are still good today films like straw dogs the exorcist 2 films that caused problems both great films,cruel
contains lots of skin racks n racks of gore a group of missing filmmakers footage is discovered in the depths of a violent jungle and once its viewed reveals more about them than any of their colleagues would wish to know including their fate    this isnt so much a movie as its an ordeal theres nothing enjoyable about this movie and at times it flies right off the edge of moral repugnance the catalog of atrocities in this movie and the cold way theyre portrayed is more disturbing than any other before of since the movie is well made good direction writing photography and exceptional acting the atmosphere is gritty and imbues with a few moments of genuine terror where this movie slips up is that it never invests any emotion in the story even if its supposed to be a documentary the events should be arresting which is not the case here ultimately there isnt any reason to continue watching because there isnt a protagonist or a place for sympathy technically this may be the best movie ive ever seen but i confess that its hard to care about anything that actually happens in the movie 12 out of 4,cruel
okay i know there are already too many comments on this film but i havent read a review i fully agree with at least as far as ive readif youve heard anything about this film you should already know about how graphic and disturbing it can be it actually wasnt as bad as i expected but i think that depends on how much you let the film affect youas a film goes this is very impressive and should not be banned or cutmy problems with the film humans and animals are not the only ones who get bludgeoned you will be too by the message its trying to send there is no subtlety a factor that takes away from an otherwise highquality filmbesides that the actual message is taught by the director creating unlikely characters hes wanting to teach us that we are as barbaric as those savages we deride yet does so by creating farfetched scenarios sure its possible that these documentarians could have committed these heinous acts but its also a stretch in actual value this film falls short,cruel
this is one of the most intense movies i have ever seen right up there with tcm and definitely deserves its super sick reputation its graphic showing of well everything leads ch to be an extremely hard watchmost people will watch this for one reason the gore and sex well it definitely delivers in that department did you ever want to see a native abortion or cannibals raping and then eating a women then you are a sicko but its all in this movie one thing i must question is the real life animal deaths such as the three minute turtle slaughtering scene or the deaths of coatamundi snakes pigs or monkeys it was really unnecessary to do that but if you really dont like that type of thing there is an animal cruelty free dvd out there somewherethe plot is actually interesting for an exploitation movie and lends a great deal of added horror to the movie as it makes it seem for real also strange for an exploitation movie is just how well shot ch is the visuals are crisp and clear and the reels found in the amazon jungle are well shot to add every bit of realism that they can there isnt too much that can be said about the acting it wasnt over the top or fake lookingso why the reasonably low score considering how much i have been praising the movie mainly because i personally didnt enjoy the second half of the movie with the found footage but it is real easy to decide whether or not to see if you want to see all the gore and sex you can handle in what is probably one of the best exploitation films ever made watch it if you dont dont watch it simple as that,cruel
i just saw this flick and i still feel disgusted and uneasy as i write these lines one word gosh believe me im not one crying out often read never about scenes being frightening and disgusting nor do i rant at flicks exposing raw violence with a dose of blood and horror but friends this one really pulled me to the edge of things and then pushed me over the very cliff of realism i just wasnt prepared for this a classic horror flick was what i had pictured but this was just far beyond all thatsince its still disgusting me i have to admit that on the very point of realism this flick does the trick its a great shot for anyone who has an interest in classic horror movies but an advice is to view it on an empty stomach if you see where im getting at,cruel
having been aware that this was the most notorious of the video nasties i watched this with trepidation i was expected the usual low budget exploitation rubbish after the hoopla surrounding the release of last house on the left which i hated i was reluctant to be stung again i was wrong this is an intelligent film with a surprising plot twist yes it is gory and i realise that this is a heavily edited version but it was no worse than the hills have eyes sadly it has gained a bad reputation which is undeserved  man bites dog  is much much worse but is classed as art its filmed in black and white so it must be art if you have a chance to see it please do,cruel
a new york anthropologist travels to the jungles of south america with two local guides to find out what happened to a documentary film crew which disappeared nearly a year earlier after a long search and encountering a few primitive tribes they find the remains of the crew and several reels of their undeveloped film while in the us the anthropologist views the material on the filmsso this is the film that they did not want you to see after seeing it i can see why here is a film that has hundreds of people who love it and just as many who hate it mostly because of the violent content within the film its too raw and horrific for some but for others they love every minute of it myself im in that one percent whos indifferentthis is a grind house picture where its basically two stories into one movie the first half of the movie is the search party who goes into the jungle looking for the film crew the second half of the movie is the actual film footage from the documentary crew which portion of the film i liked more is hard to decide because what we see in the first half is shocking to us we have not seen this before its new and its brutal but happens in the second half of the movie is more brutal but not as shocking because you are expecting the uncomfortably of the film to grow and it doesthis movie influenced the likes of films like the blair witch project here is a movie that goes down in history as one of the most shocking movies of all time does it deserve that title well lets see during the 90 some odd minutes of the film be ready for 3 different rape scenes fullfrontal nudity both male and female decapitations reallife animal killings guts ripping people burning torture the most disturbing abortion scenes ever limbs being chopped off people getting impaled bodies being hacked to bits and guts being ripped out and what makes it worse is that its not that kind of deadalive tongue in cheek gore its so realistic and disturbingthe music is beautiful the theme song that plays throughout it amazing and a high point in this film dont pick it up for acting or dialougebut then again i wouldnt imagine someone doing that this is a horror movie for those disturbed horror fans those who want to see this movie to see what all the talk is about brace yourself youre in for some pretty horrific stuff im not going to go into the whole political aspect of animal killings but those were some of the hardest scenes to watch in this filmpeople are put off by the violence so they fail to see what its about how we today are more curious about whats bad in the world then what is good how the journalist focus more on violent issues was it overdone but then again maybe it was just the right amount it also shows how we as a culture are insensitive and ignorant to others even if it is a cannibal tribei did dig this film for its unique style that did come out before bwp faze i love all kinds of horror movies and this is one not to miss of course if you can handle this type of stuff the dvd is limited to about 10000 copies so if you want a copy pick it up fast oh and did i forget to mention that during its release it was banned in almost 60 countries,cruel
id heard a lot about this film and being a big horror fan i was itching to see it i rented it out settled back and let myself in for the most gruesome horror film i have ever witnessed to begin with i found it quite slow and within the first hour was beginning to feel myself getting bored whens the horror going to start i thought to myself i stayed with it though and was glad i did i think the film contains the most gruesome scenes i think ever featured in a horror film even though the main characters the film makers are portrayed in a very bad light and it is very hard to sympathise with them i think you would have to be a monster not to feel for them with the torture they face to watch a man having his testicles removed before being quite literally ripped apart is not a pretty sight at times i nearly had to look away from the screen as i just could not stand the relentless horror of the situation anymore i felt sick for ages afterwards and it really played on my mind because that sort of thing can and has happened beforethe film seemed to try and justify itself by having a moral thread running through it the film makers blatant disregard for the cannibals and the rape and torture they put them through is hard to stomach the film seems to be asking us to consider who the real monsters are the cannibals or the film makers and i would have to say its a bit of both im unsure however if the makers of the film simply put this in to cover up for the fact that they were making a horrible film which would sicken anyone who saw it they were trying to say hey this isnt just mindless violence you know we actually have something to say overall i wouldnt go so far as to say i actually liked the film but it did have its good points it has its audience and will always be renowned for its subject matter,cruel
first off i would have preferred that the actors in the movie actually have eaten the meat from the animals that they killed past that this movie was pretty shocking but not the worst i have seen i would reccomend that if you can find this movie for about 10 including shipping you should get it i have the unedited version and it is really messed up to say the least i think that the script for this movie had a point to it but lost that point in the interpretation to film if you are someone who likes to watch shocking movies then this one is for you let me say that even with the violence this movie was less shocking to me than requiem for a dream,cruel
another great inhuman cannibal film from the great ruggero deodato he was imprisoned after making this movie this film is ultraviolent and very realistic it also contains weird and eerie music after watching it the horrible content of this film can remain in your memories for a very long time for those who are distressed to see such inhumanity do not watch this film,cruel
i have to say first off that i am not particularly a horror fan however i also have to say that this is a much better film than i expected it to be  and in fact i would go so far as to say that this is a good film full stop it looks datedit was made in 1979 so it should do  but not in its use of special effects which remain good even by present day standards  see example later  the story was well told and kept the viewer with it all the way it kept a good pace and the acting all by unknown actors and actresses  atleast in the ukwas very good if this didnt influence blair witch  which is what the producers of blair witch claim  then this is without doubt a precursor to it i watched this twice the second time much more carefully  i have three main  comments  firstly francesca ciardi who plays the female lead was excellent  how on earth did she not become more well known  secondly how did they manage to produce such excellent performances from the tribe indians both individually and as a whole  there were times you forgot that this was a film and not a documentary the final point is regarding the spec effects  overall very very good considering both the budget and era  one particular effect has stuck with me over the last day or so and has witheld closer examination  how did they skewer the indian girl on the stake   that looks almost too realistic at both first glance and on a frame by frame basis if you are a film enthusiast and havent seen this film then you are missing out get it sorted,cruel
i cant say i disliked this movie however it lacked tempo and you didnt really got any scary stuff it was mostly gross and a lot of violence i enjoyed some parts of it especially when they are viewing the documentary filmings which was retrieved by the professor what really annoyed me though was that the blair witch project was considered to be sort of a genr chaning film when it was obvious that the directors had got their idea from this filmif you like blood and really mean humans watch this film,cruel
a movie which disturbs and sickens is thankfully rare but here is a film which does bothis the story of three documeantry film makers which get lost in the amazon jungle later there film footage is the only thing left and is found by a team in search for them sounds like blair witchthe film contains genuinne animal killings which are extremely graphic performed just for the camars this is what disturbs most about the film although without this unnesary killing would now be forgotten it is there simply for shock value and to give the movie a much more real tone this is the reason i believe people 20 years ago thought the actors were also killed of course untrue although there is a scene which a native girl is seen impaled on a pole which looks pretty real it was done with a bicycle seat  and a couple of poles very simple but the effect looks realspecial mention however goes to ritz ortolonis haunting score which belongs in a much better movie he also did the score for house at the edge of the park also for deodato so to sum up it is a movie which disturbs for all the wrong reasons not a bad flick just unnesary 510,cruel
i consider myself a true horror collector seeing as how i have of some 300 horror movies some rare others not i was looking around for something new something i had never seen and heard about well after doing some research on the web and of course checking out the reviews herei got my hopes up high thinking to myself cool a movie that was banned and is said to be this horrid violent movie i found it on ebay for a reasonable price and bought it welli have somethings to say about this film first i fail to really see why is was banned to begin withi mean compared to movies like cannibal ferox or bad taste this movie really wasnt as evil or for that matter as bad as most said it was you already know the story line as you may have red in others reviews so i wont waste your time with a storyline there were a few parts in the movie that were somewhat gpry but nothing i havent seen in others movies i give this movie 6 out 10 stars because in all fairness it wasnt a bad movie just overhyped i acuatally think cannibal ferox aka make them die slowly was more disturbing and violent then this,cruel
this movie grabbed my attention much the way it grabbed many others i was lured in with promises of extreme gore violence and other shocking images i read all the warnings and with careful consideration decided to be brave and veiw it ok this was some nasty stuff here definately one you need to work your way up to but the actual shock value was less than i expected thats not to say i didnt enjoy it because quite frankly i did i sat through the whole thing twice actually taking it all in sure there are some brutal scenes involving animals that of course were real i was not that repulsed though animals die everyday but people only seem to object to it when they actually have to see it i myself am a vegetarian so why am i not outraged for one the animals died quickly and second after that its only meat to me its dead what bothered me most about this film was the eerie melancholy music that accompanies these atrocious scenes the acting was superb and this is by no means a b movie this was well thought out executed and presented material i do not recommend this movie to most people though it simply is a little too much to watch but for those who think they can manage and stomach well have at it youll never forget it,cruel
this name alone strikes many disgusting thoughts into most peoples heads and it should the movie itself is repulsive vile and totally uncalled forthough there is a message within the movie a very important one too it is the message of media involvement in current events how much does the camera affect what we see it is only a lens that captures what it sees though it is the evil hand of humanity that controls the device,cruel
ok this is the 3rd cannibal flick ive seen i gave it a 6 mind you it would have received more except for the animal cruelty throughout  i found myself fast forwarding through each killing what is it with the italian directors eaten alive and slave of the cannibal god are just as bad ok so how was it as a movie great maybe i am too desensitised to be affected nowdays which is a little worrying by the gore one thing though  that woman impaled sure looks realistic if you are reading these comments you have probably already seen it or are curious to see it if you havent yet  just make sure you are in an ok state of mind keep your finger poised on the fast forward and settle back for a pretty strange ride,cruel
a small group of filmmakers vanish in the wilderness while in the midst of making a documentary and the only evidence of what happened to them is seen through their recovered film footage sound familiar the blair witch project may have been a welldeserving smash hit but what few people failed to realize was that its socalled revolutionary story device of terrorthroughrecoveredfilmfootage had been utilized twenty years before in a notorious italian cannibal film directed by ruggero deodato is arguably the king of its subgenre and may well be the most disturbing film ever made while blair witch left such an unsettling effect by showing nothing holocaust does so by showing everything there is no act of depravity that it is not displayed at some point in this film however direct comparison to the blair witch project is unfair as these are both drastically different films holocaust actually contains a sizable back story about the search for the film crew with the actual recovered footage taking up less than half the running time deodato uses this story as a catalyst for a commentary on the medias manipulation of the truth for the purposes of sensationalism and while some would argue that the final result is nothing but pure exploitation theres no denying the films powerformer porn star robert kerman plays the films protagonist professor monroe who leads the expedition to recover the missing footage and is actually quite good in the role his performance is vital to providing at least some comfort within the audience since the character provides the sole voice of reason in the film when ratingshungry tv producers try to use the footage as the basis for a prime time special he declares that it would be inhumane since the actions that the film crew have pulled to get that footage are nothing short of heinous indeed when all the footage is finally shown the foursome does nothing to inspire any sympathy for what has happened to them when the natives prove to be less interesting than they had hoped for their documentary the crew decides to destroy their village and burn some of them alive in hopes of inspiring a war with a rival tribe which in turn would provide them with some much better footage eventually they go too far and the natives end up resorting to cannibalism only as a response to the barbaric actions of the white man professor monroe sums it all up at the end when he states i wonder who the real cannibals are one of the main criticisms of the blair witch project was that it seemed very unlikely that the characters would still keep the camera rolling in the midst of their terrifying plight in holocaust the film crew is so obsessed with gaining fame and notoriety that we can believe it when they stand by in the background and film their friends being raped and butchered they may not make it out of the jungle alive but at least theyll leave some very memorable footage behindwith all this talk about the story i have yet to even get into what the film is long remembered for and thats the extreme violence and gore and they are indeed quite shocking and horrifying granted the recovered footage gimmick provides the filmmakers with the opportunity for some shaky camera work and an excuse to cover up the fact that many of their effects may not be technically proficient yet the viewer is still provided with plenty of moments that are sure to make one squirm such as rape with a sharp rock a foetus being prematurely ripped from a native womans womb and buried in mud amputation and dismemberment and the only direct oncamera castration that i can ever recall seeing the most controversial element of the movie however is undoubtedly its abundant amount of violence to animals  which is 100  unfaked while the early scenes of humans butchering live animals provide a very interesting parallel to the climactic footage of the cannibals butchering the humans the fact that deodato actually murdered some real wildlife in order to get this footage cannot be justified however despite holocausts rather exploitive elements one cannot overlook how truly effective the final result is the films direction and storytelling are simply topnotch and ive never seen a movie convey the tension and uneasy atmosphere of the jungle better than this one holocaust is also blessed with a truly haunting and memorable musical score which will stay with you long after the film is over while i wouldnt urge casual viewers to run out and find a copy of this nearmasterpiece id highly recommend it to all horror and exploitation fans to see it as this film will surely test their limits like never before if nothing else it makes me relieved that the camera got turned off before we could see what the blair witch did to those kids,cruel
the amazon to shoot a documentary they were never seen againa few months later their footage was foundsounds familiar you bet since i already made my point in the blair witch comment section and noticed in the meantime that someone else did too  salut pierrebenoit i will focus on why this is a much better effort to produce fakedocumentary material first of all the camerawork in the 2nd half is exceptionally well done it just really feels like a documentary in the late seventies when i was still living in paris france not texas i remember reading a huge article written by a female newspaper columnist who was trying to figure out if the socalled documentary footage was real or not  the distributor advertised the material as real and got away with it for quite a while  no www chat rooms back then to tell people about the movie beforehand  so this journalist went to see the movie over and over again in one day the cashier reportedly looked at her as if she was insane until she found proof it was fake tough girl but the point is she had to look really hard in ch the crew shoots a lot of themselves walking through the jungle  a fact that i criticized about blair witch  but this is the jungle not some boring maryland woods theres a terra incognita feel about it well for us industrialized people therefore it works why do you think josh heather and mike keep shooting all the time even if there is really nothing exciting to look at in burkittsville eh because they know they are gonna disappear and the directors toldem they need a certain amount of footage to get their movie done  thats whyoh while i mention directors  i always thought and i still do that ruggero deodato was really a boring untalented director  i just wonder how he managed to put such a convincing movie together well the 2nd half  the first is closer to his usual stuff but still not as badon a closing note i would like to mention how much i hate the animal snuff footage in ch i never understood why its in there  because the movie just doesnt need it  it would have worked just as well and better for me if deodato had not included it the fact that he did just confirms my original opinion and deodatos lack of self confidence  this guy is a moron who had an unexpected stroke of genius for a short period of timethats it arrividerci,cruel
i had heard so much about this film before seeing it  having read countless reviews and raves about ruggero deadatos film in fangoria and gorezone i was very anxious to see it for myself  i must admit that i was disappointed  while the film is shocking and sickening it does not use this as part of the storyline  it instead used its gore and sickness as mere tools for exploitation  the story itself is a great ideait really has promise for some great horror and shock value  but what happened was the director chose to disgust rather than terrify the audience  while there are some truly gruesome moments in the film nothing really shocked me upon seeeing it  had deadato chosen better actors and a better way to take the story then he would have made a great film  instead the fillmmakers in get no pity or remorse from the audiencethey deserve what they get from the cannibal tribeand then some not all is bad however  as i mentioned the story is basically goodjust not taken in the right direction  this film reveals the need of this culture for exploitation and sensationalism ie jerry springer and all those reallife video shows in the media  this fillmmaers in ch are merely giving the public what it wants  on a another level it also reveals the results of outside cilvilization and its disasterous effects on the uncivilized world of the cannibal tribe  like the anthropologist says at the end  i wonder who the real cannibals arenot for the squeamish  but if youre looking for good italian exploitation and gore with a bit of a story linethen watch personnaly id rather stay with dario argentos body of work,cruel
the premise simple the dialogue simple the music scores simple the aftermath wonderful  this is a movie that like it or not sticks with you this is why i love this film it is so rare that you actually watch a film and are actually inclined to talk about it  this is a movie that i had to share with friends just because i could not get it out of my head  albeit they look at me rather strangely now i love a movie that stays with you  i still can see vividly the scenes of the animal massacres rape lovemaking on the ashes of the newly cooked tribespeople etc  do yourself a great favor and buy this video,cruel
with all the hubbub surrounding the blair witchlast broadcast controversy was the former influenced by the latter i decided to track down the film that both were influenced byit was not what i was expecting the degree of cannibalism is not what the title would lead you to believe nor are the atrocities that have gotten the film banned in several countries even committed by the cannibals  but to say more than that would give away the main surprise of the film it starts out innocuous enough with a wellintentioned college professor trying to find out what happened to four ambitious documentary filmmakers in the depths of the amazon the film has a very national geographic look to it  to a point there is even a nice scene where the professor manages to reach the yamamama cannibals the tree people by recording the shamans voice  they felt that if he could capture their voices he could capture their spirits as wellif you have a strong stomach i recommend this film if only for the ingenuity behind the story not necessarily all the details in the film you can even get a laser disc copy that has an interview with the director ruggero deodato  he has some interesting comments as a footnote italian director producer writer and dop lamberto bava was an assistant director and the professor in a surprisingly good performance is former porn star r bolla billed as robert kerman,cruel
i read the reviews for this movie before watching it i kept saying to myself this movie is sick why are you watching it  those horrible disgusting scenes were making my stomach churn but i couldnt stop the movie i wanted to see how bad can it get after this  and the thing is it kept getting worse and worse heheheh brilliant work poor monkey poor tortoiseturtle  poor cannibals poor reporters but a mustsee movie for anyone who can stomach blood and gore,cruel
this sure is the sickest and most brutal movie ever made in the history of videos if you wanna see the most brutal movie made see this it shocked the he outta me violence5010 nudity510 profanity310,cruel
this film is really something else i would recommend only those with a strong stomach watch it though the acting is not up to much but it is still a must see for all horrorgore fans the animal mutilations are a little unnecessary and do not add much to the film overall but it is the rest of the special effects and some truly sickening scenes which make one of the most disturbing films ever made the fact that deodato was taken to court in his native italy to prove that he had not killed his actors is a testament to what you can do with a limited filming budget,cruel
i saw the sistermovie cannibal ferox about half a year ago and its brutal violence and almost nonexisting acting except for the indians in the jungle shocked me reflecting on it though when i had calmed down enough to be able to think about the film in any kind of objective perspective which took a while i became interested to see what one could get out of such a film when i heard from a friend of mine that was supposed to include better acting than ferox i decided it might be worth a look this time i was prepared for anything though and i must say i found it surprisingly goodthe first half of the film is in kind of slow pace we follow a search team in the jungle following the trace of a dissappeared film crew as they come deeper into the jungle they finally find the rotten corpses or whats left of them of the film crew they also find the films of they shot before ending up in the hands of the cannibals with this the rescue team heads home to new york and the second half of the movie is a tale told from those films as they are reviewedas i said up untill now we have yet to see any real disturbing scene at all but what the footage shows is a tale of violence on the films you see how brutal the film crew acted towards the inhabitans in the jungle before they were eatenthe movie ends with a thought on who the real cannibals are which brings me to an essential aspect of the movie this movie is despite all senseless violence not without a point i see it as a lame attempt to show in a strange way that those film people really didnt deserve anything better than what they got the real cannibals are the white man who have been acting cruel to the original inhabitants in all timesthere were a few scenes that i would rather not have seen however the killing of animals in a movie for example should not be allowed this film like many other like it uses real animals whos killed for the screen in a most brutal way another scene that touched me deeply was a rape scene when two white men raped a very young indian girlthough i have a lot against this film i do recommend anyone who have the stomach to stand this kind of violence to see it the acting is quite good though the acting in the new york city scenes are not as good the music fits in well with the plot and generally without the disturbing scenes this would have been a very good filmi rate it a 510,cruel
i saw this film as a midnight movie it was shown entirely uncut and all i can say is that the censored version must be about ten minutes longhowever it was an interesting film i did not expect a brain or a heart with a title like the plot is kind of a mix between the blair witch project and the emerald forest it works very well as an allegory on how civilized man rapes the land and destroys all of its resources the film also deals with the who is more civilized concept this is done a bit heavyhandedly but i think that the director was probably more comfortable dealing with socalled lowbrow audiences so this is forgettable he doesnt exactly have a flair for subtlety as it is anyway the performances were surprisingly good there are numerous scenes in which the actors are extremely natural when they dont have dialogue to deliver they actors can be quite extraordinary there are a quite a few real animal killings in this film that are quite disturbing granted this is how my food gets to my table but it can be a bit extreme if unnecessary the rest of the violence is actually quite impressive especially considering when it was made and the budget constraints im sure a film like this had the gore is still disturbing of course in the end the viewer is left to make their own judgement on what they have seen the filmmaker makes no attempt to soften the blow,cruel
watching this clumsy hamhanded attempt at moviemaking was a vile and regrettable experience anyone who claims a shred of cinematic merit for this bucket of swill needs his or her head quite thoroughly examined every reel every cell of this firm should be incinerated  an irony considering a comment made during one scene the making of this movie affirms every base and cruel value which the film attempts to portray watching it has made me complicit in something truly disgusting the only good thing about watching this abomination is that i downloaded it illegally paying for it would have been money better spent on a diuretic i feel like i need a shower to be cleansed of this film plus forgiveness for having ever let it touch my retinas wiring these comments may assuage the guilt,cruel
i remember watching when i was a kid 14 yrs old and being shocked by the violence when youre a teenager its easy to think something as bizarre and brutal as this has an underlying message to it 16 years later i find that it bears no message its just a bunch of poorly done shots complemented by the unnecessary killing of animals thats about it i am a big horror and gore lover braindead day of the dead reanimator the original texas chain saw massacre and i easily fall in love with depressing and disturbing flicks irreversible dancer in the dark funny games the score which is always applauded on reviews ive seen is lame and mediocre and the violent scenes are done so poorly you cant help but laugh at them animal deaths have no dramatic point whatsoever this is not apocalypse now and it is no oldboy when you see oldboys octopus sequence theres a true dramatic impact to the death of the octopus this one is totally stupid pointless and has no true impact on you other than feeling sorry for those creatures the acting is horrible and cartoonish how can you feel disturbed by something this amateurish thats beyond me the one that goes all the way hahaha guys if you can take r budd dwyers oncamera suicide then you can take any gory film regards,cruel
one other person on here thought the same as me small animal in agony makes you feel so cheap for looking at this awful filmbelieve it or not the death of the turtle that is seen in this is not worth the entertainment it has give others with at best the poor judgment to give it 2 hours of there valuable timedont look you will feel saddened by the end of it and feel ashamed you didthe death of those small lives will haunt youif you want to see horror watch real movies that are made to entertainr,cruel
i am a huge movie fan and i like to watch many different kinds of movieshowever when i got my hands on this movie i was dubious if i really wanted to see it hearing lots of nasty things about iti start it up and the first 5 minutes or so seems ok but then the movie starts getting so nasty that i cant almost watch it anymore i go on tho but after a scene where they kill a small monkey alive and believe me this is no fake i start to skip thru the movie when i have skipped thru the movie i dont regret i did not watch it completelythis movie is so horribly that the only good thing about it when you have watched it you never want to watch such movies again and in the next two weeks i simply had to watch comedies because the chock i got from watching it hurt me really bad and i needed a solid dose of humour to regain my composurewhat i sat left with after watching this movie is what kind of people can actually make such a movie and if you find any part of this movie entertaining i would strongly advice you to visit a shrink because no one in their right mind would find this movie amusing at allkeep distance from this one i am serious this movie might have stirred your curiosity and you might find it highly interesting from all the people who says to keep distance from it but i mean it i wanted to see it for the same reason but now i regret it,cruel
now considering myself a serious film buff i make it a point to not limit myself from any genre of filmmaking also being that im an aspiring film maker i tend to push the envelope as far as i can contentwise and im always fascinated to see how far other directors have gone in their films of course this cannibal film had me interested not only because of its notorious publicity as a serious gorehound movie and as the most violent movie ever made but also because it was supposed to have an engrossing morality story to it so i rented it and while i realized the influence it had on the overrated yet effective film the blair witch project that was the only noteworthy aspect of it the real animal killings as mentioned by many here were completely unnecessary and only served to disgust the viewer now i have an ultra strong stomach so i wasnt shocked by it just angry that a filmmaker would stoop so low as to purposely kill a form of life just to hammer home the point that advanced society can produce people who are no more moral and civilized than the cannibal tribe we are introduced to in the story  there are ways to do things  the animal scenes just brought about a doublestandard and a sign of hypocrisy from the filmmaker  of course i would have had no problems if those scenes were staged and if deodato actually delivered on other gore scenes concerning cannibalism and human killings obviously those would have to be fake as well  however the film wasnt nearly as gory as others made it out to be as a lot of violent acts occured offscreen  it was mostly sleazy especially with all the nudity the rape scene by the male reporters was realistically disturbing but not convincing in its motivation worst of all though its moral message was delivered unintelligently and i wasnt compelled by the story at all it didnt help matters that the acting was atrocious and that the dubbing was awful the cinematography was simplistic although that was the intention to capture the feeling of a documentary what i got was a trashy brutally awful film to sit through without any redeeming or thoughtprovoking story behind it sure ive seen plenty of graphic movies that actually entertained me but that wasnt the intention for this film  i wasnt expecting to be entertained by the movie but i was expecting its socalled important message to be convincingly portrayed still i recommend people to watchespecially film students  maybe theyll get something out of it definitely not enjoyment,cruel
i heard about this movie through a friend and a few of us rented it a couple of weeks ago  the only reason we got it was because of the excessive gore it supposedly contains and the fact that it was the film the blair witch project is based on  i hated it  not only was it not very graphic i think i saw an edited down version but it was really boring for the first 45 minutes or so and even when the gory footage was shown i was still bored it was obviously fake as the camera got really shaky every time something graphic occurred so you cant tell whats happening  the characters were completely dislikeable and deserved what they got  the only parts that were hard to watch were the scenes of real animal torture and killing  dont listen to what you hear about this movie  its not worth it  210,cruel
one of those bad video nasties appears its ugly head is a completely dated film  horror films can be cleverly made on a low budget just check out texas chainsaw but ch is a poor film in many ways the horror is placed rather sickly in front of you more disgusting rather than fright and the few scenes that use this are more like a comedy with bloodquite laughable the acting is not very good the main actor is from such films as debbie does dallas iii so theres your pedigree and the script could of worked if the actors didnt look so serious about it allthe editing although quite good in the footage viewing room sceneis half baked  the director at time looks like he wanted to make a wildlife film rather than a full on horror flick opening shots every time we see a cannibal then a monkeythen cannibalmonkeyohh a tiger must film thatoh pleasewhy is there a one theme uptempo soundtrack that pops up when a death scene is taking place why is there unjustified nude scenes that make the actors look so unconvincing and unerotic i laughed out loudin closing holocaust is a bad piece of filmakinga film that harks back to the early 80s horror genre but were they ever this bad,cruel
anybody who liked ch must be really sick when you enjoy looking at animals being tortured for realand women being raped without any motivation for the story its not horror movies that you want to seehorror movies should stimulate your imagination scare you or give you a chock with gore so that you admire the special fx ch only scares me because there are people in this world that like this movie  i bought the video when i didnt know what it was went back with it the next day and made a small riot at the store when i loudly told them what it was about for all the costumers to hear i got my money back and two costumers left the store with me,cruel
what in the hell was the writerdirector thinking how did filth like this ever get produced why do people watch sick garbage like this its nothing more than foul putrid filth i swear the guy who made this film should have been put away a long time ago im sorry i ever watched it i enjoy a violent horror movie as much as anyone else but this just goes too far by a long way if you want to watch it be my guest each to his own eh but there are some things that just take violence and gore way too far and this is one and to top it all off theres a right way to show some things and a wrong way and by this i refer to freaking rape scenes in my mind there is nothing sicker than rape if you include that sort of things in a movie take a page out of clockwork oranges book that is the right way to use such a theme dont glorify it dont try and pass it off as porn dont show it grapically what sane person wants to see that and dont try and make it funny somehow its just not and never will be this film should be destroyed like the filthy sickfest it is,cruel
this is one of the most vile and disgusting films ive ever seen geek show violence coupled with an infuriatingly half baked sense of self righteousness the film lingers on acts of violence and cruelty and then has the nerve to step back and try to tack on morals and social commentary so not only is the film reprehensible it is also extremely hypocritical a truly thought provoking film could have been made with similarly taboo subject matter apocalypse now and aguire the wrath of god spring to mind both of those films featured shocking acts of violence and real animal killings but they had a purpose other than simply shocking the viewer they had moments of true beauty and introspection great acting and cinematography and they didnt exploit their subject matter and then add some phony morals to make it all okay,cruel
this movie is awful the acting is awful the story line is awful it is not scary it just really gross i like a lot gross horror movie i like the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 and i think this is feat to gross do not see it i do not know why this got 6 i give it a 2 i like to be scared to do not like to be grossed out there most be people who like being grossed out the texas chain saw massacre was violent but it the original the texas chain saw massacre was scary this not scary if you want to see something scary see the green inferno,cruel
so i watched that title last night  my third viewing over 20odd years and the first i even half enjoyed the revelatory restoration currently available on region a bluray courtesy of grindhouse releasing has a lot to do with that especially when measured against the dubiously sourced pannscan vhs that introduced me to this infamous sleaze epic way back when where i once saw only a turgid and poorlyframed mass of washedout browns and yellows i now fully understand why so many praise for its visual qualities sergio doffizis lush yet gritty cinematography gives ruggero deodatos film a sweat soaked junglevibrant eye candy appeal that i was never before able to properly appreciateand the gore is spectacular lets get that out of the way right up front as its undoubtedly a huge part of this films lasting cult appeal even with thirtysome years of horror fandom beneath my belt the unforgettable and muchreproduced image of the impaled native woman remains one of the most astonishing practical effects shots ive ever seen its as brilliantly simple as it is brutally effective that said ill probably never become comfortable with the films ghoulish displays of reallife animal abuse while even its most upsetting moments do have thematic relevance in context id have been far happier to go through life without ever having seen a living monkeys tiny face chopped off in moments such as this grindhouses otherwise glorious highdefinition restoration is no blessing at allis often celebrated for its social criticism with all due respect to the films many erudite admirers i personally feel that its too obvious and hypocritical to make a truly meaningful statement while deodato clearly condemns the ignorance and exploitative cruelty of the civilized interlopers who view brazilian rainforest tribespeople and their customs as savage he milks a shockingly ignorant flatly racist cartoon of the latters culture for cheap shock value and though he seems to implicate his audiences bloodlust in the carnage we witness on screen he uses this potentially intriguing critical vantage primarily as an excuse to wallow in lurid atrocity much like paul verhoeven in robocop and starship trooppers despite all that im not inclined to condemn the film or its makers racism aside theres nothing so terribly wrong with the sort of cinematic hypocrisy on display and though s ethical incoherence sabotages its claim to moral authority it fuels the feral leering intensity of a true exploitation classicamid the carnage its interesting to note the seldommentioned inclusion of appparently real human execution footage in an early context  characterestablishing flashback sequence this documentarystyled section of the film seems to comment if indirectly on jacopetti and prosperis africa addio and the ensuing murder trial perhaps one could describe as a what if exercise imagining a documentary crew even more monstrously cynical than jacopetti  prosperi were alleged to have been by overzealous italian prosecutors with that in mind theres a certain bitter irony in the fact that deodato and his crew were themselves brought up on and ultimately cleared of murder charges following the release of their film plus ca changewhat else wonderful music i desperately want a copy of riz ortolanis perversely beguiling score on vinyl and im glad to have finally understood  and to some extent appreciated  a celebratedreviled horror masterpiece that long eluded me,cruel
is this film really shocking it shows a lot of stuff never before transplanted to screen but without analysis that can be more suitably categorised as groundbreaking for the most part my sensibilities remained unshaken is it shocking and am i just a sociopath my rejection of the films capacity to shock centers on a few psychological tenets not when the makers themselves seemed uncomfortable enough that they kept cutting away to bystanderviewer shots every time the squeamish factor was building no when pasolini showed audiences atrocity he trained the camera on it long enough for it to be really implanted in your mind so you eventually found yourself just hoping it would end from my perspective anyway  the gore scenes in this movie can rightfully be called gruesome but most of them were over in secondsbesides when i see a film with cannibal in its name i dont go in expecting superior standards of deportment the title kind of clues a prospective viewer in these people are uncivilised so of course theyre going to be barbaric  its a fundamental component of their nature it has nothing to do with power or the intentional degradation of their fellow speciesif some people turn savage after being exposed to savage conditions that can at least be rationalised by desensitisation mans inhumanity to man in order to consolidate a position of control is a concept that i find far more disturbing and disgusting but thats just me,cruel
when i heard that a movie made in 1980 called was one of the most controversial films ever made it peeked my interest and i decided to check it out after watching the movie i was disgusted and wondered how they were able to pull off such realistic violence for its time scenes like an impalement and animals getting tortured and murdered appeared very real and while i learned how the impalement was done by sitting on a bicycle seat i was disturbed to find out the animal slaughters were not fake they were indeed real why because the director could thats whywell just because you can doesnt mean you should were all capable of doing horrible things but should we no because we know its wrongit was just as easy to fake an animals death as it was to fake everything else in the film but it was shot deep in the amazon where there were no laws against animal torture and killings so director ruggero deodato had several animals murdered for his own sick pleasurethe sad thing is people try to defend this film and say its message is about the medias love of violence for ratings either the director is a huge hypocrite condemning violence in the media while killing animals for the purpose of a film or viewers are missing the real message in this movie deodato wanted to unleash his vile fantasies in a movie and try to pass it off as meaningfuldeodato was trying to make us all sick and in that way he has succeeded so instead of a 1 i vote it a 2 but anybody who claims this is a meaningful movie has been manipulated by a disturbed hypocrite,cruel
has to be one of the most overrated films i have ever seen in my lifetime not only is it not shockingits completely boringi was not offended what was happening on the screennor was i repulsed what so ever ruggero tries so hard to disturb usthat is starts to become obvious that hes trying to do it the so called graphic gore is completely overratednot only have i seen many more shocking horror films then thisi often busted out into laughter during many of the scenes i detest animal violencebut even that is overhyped with only the turtle death making any real impact the characters completely deserved their fatei was just begging for them to get there demiseand i got what i wantednot only that the acting is atrociouswith not one believable actor in the filmbeing the big horror fan i am all my life ive had people telling me to seek out this moviewell i finally did online in all its uncut glory and it gave me 96 minutes of my life i will never get back i am not trying to garner attention i am simply stating that this movie is nothing more then an excusean attempt to shock us i am sure plenty of people will be repulsed by this filmbut i wasntruggero deserves all of his criticism for this filmhis sick perverted mind has created a film that has been overhyped for way too many years nowto make a long story short boring animal killingsexcept for oneoverhyped goredegrading characters who deserved what happened to thema laughable mockumentary type styleand you have this boring suckerbottom line im not even gonna go over the performances there not worth my timenor is wasting all my energy in my hands while typing up a review for this film is a whale of a disappointmentmaybe i didnt get itmaybe others will find it fascinating like so many others claimbut you know whatgood for themcause that means they can go through the torture and not me310,cruel
1980  12 out of 4 ruggero deodatos notorious italian shocker about four filmmakers who go missing after going to do a documentary on cannibals months later their footage is found and we get to see what happened yep the blair witch project ripped this sucker off but i still think that film is better this film here is still banned all around the world and rightfully so probably peta members are still wanting to kill the director again rightfully so probably technically speaking i think this film is pretty damn good especially the terrific cinematography and the wonderful mixture of using 35mm for the city footage and 16mm for the jungle footage the music score is one of the greatest from any euro horror film and the director certainly gets across the feel that youre actually watching all of this stuff take place the problem is that the real animal violence takes away anything the film has going for it ive seen real animal deaths in countless other films but the way the director rubs the footage in your face is imo the reason this film is still so controversial while others like it dont draw too much heat i also dont buy the message the director tries to put across because its rather impossible to believe that the filmmakers would actually do what we see them doing in their footage again i think this is a very important film which is thankfully no longer being made and i can respect the technical side of this thing but in the end i still find the director to be a scumbag who deserves all the heat hes gotten over the past 25 years,cruel
the plot  supposed morality of this film are as schizophrenic obnoxious  unintelligent as its pitiful soundtrack which is in itself an atrocity beginning with some actually decent but rather dull guitar muzak it then randomly shifts from orchestra to various other instrumentations none of these permutations seem related to each other or whats going on on screen the exception being what i call the gore theme which chimes in to let everyone know when something is about to be disemboweledthe genius of this film is supposed to be its realism yet it is not realistic in any meaningful sense the only thing that seems realistic is the depiction of violence which with the animals is real if something is real how can if be credited with realism the violent scenes involving humans dont look real at all people get shot and just fall over there isnt even blood in one scene a woman is being cut from her throat to her pelvis  it looks like all they did was rub paint on her besides the animal killings the only aspect of the film that seriously establishes any realism is that it is actually filmed in the jungle which again begs my earlier question since when do directors get called clever because they shoot on location its as if the animal killings are thrown in to shock people into not questioning the laziness or absurdity of the films other elementsthe supposed message of the film makes even less sense if the director is so passionate about showing the viciousness of modern western society then why didnt he do any research the film makes no attempt at fact checking whatsoever and will immediately be seen as a complete distortion by anybody with even a sesame street understanding of anthropology again where is the realism when the film ended i watched the interview with the director hoping to hear some sort of elucidation of the films thin attempt at social commentary but all he talked about was minutia like how much money it made how much was spent on it  where the actors are now he seemed like a blockheadaltogether the film comes across as a shameless cynical  jaded play on peoples knee jerk reactions to reap the profits of controversy,cruel
contains some spoilersitalian exploitation king ruggero deodatos genre classic holds its own against defining horror pictures such as haloween last house on the left and night of the living dead while these three films conceptualised the slasher rape and revenge and zombie picture respectively did something different  it created a trend of horrific violence in order to terrify audiences and in this respect deodatos audacious picture succeeds wholeheartedly the films surprisingly intelligent plot is quite simple  an anthropology professor harold monroeplayed with conviction by porn star robert kerman goes on a trip to the green inferno  a jungle holocaust in the midst of the roughest amazonian terrain inhabited by warring tribes of cannibals with his guide monroe sets out to investigate the fate of a group of documentarians jack faye mark and their leader yates filming footage of such tribes in their questthey encounter a number of atrocities most of which are committed by the yamamomos rival tribe the yacumo one such set piece that remains one of the films most enduring images of extreme violence is a ritualistic punishment of an adultress this is one of s most violent and disturbing scenes when monroe and his team reach the yamomomos they are given yates teams footage monroe returns to the nyu with the footage and screens it the documentary is truly vile  yates team are shown killing animals real footage subject that laid the film in solid disrepute the most controversial being the turtle scene raping tribal women and committing a mass homicide of yamomomo tribespeople finally the yates team receive their just desserts from the natives they tormentedis an undeniably powerful film with some solid performances and great direction the score is also a highlight with riz ortolani utilising some of the skills that had nominated him for an oscar over a decade before is undeniably intense in its violence however none of it is gratuitous  it perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere of helplessness that deodato succeeds in conveying the fact that the film is titled arguably leads to its ultimate downfall gorehounds wanting deodatos classic slice of exploitation to live up to its title will be disappointed  cannibal action only really appears in the last fifteen minutes likewise those wanting an intelligent film will overlook because of its title overall is a solid film that has lost little of its power in some twentysix years,cruel
a masterpiece on its own probably the most infamous horror movie of the past 30 years every horror fan talks about it even if heshe has not watched it you may love or hate but you cant deny that it deserves some credit for many reasons first this one started the lost shocking footage idea it also created the myth that its events were real of course everything was a publicity trick that didnt have enough success back in the 80s but it has awaken the curiosity of many generations of horror fansis more than a famous exploitation movie the fact that it is banned in 250 countries is just a fact once you watch it you will understand the greatness of it its a powerful piece of cinema that displays the horrors of humanity in society and in the wilderness as many people have written on their reviews this movie makes you think who are the real savages you cant change natures way and when you irrumpt it with violence and no respect things can get really awful the first expedition group humiliated the savages most important traditions and their way of living just for fortune fame and for morbid purposes their ambition went too far and that is why they found cruel fates but they asked for it without knowing it that happens when you do not show respect for humanityabout the animal real killings i must admit that it can be justified as part of deodatos experiment the killings were not for a shocking purpose but for understand the nature of the message he is sending to the audience we learn more about how these animals are useful for humans who live in the wilderness there have been many heated debates towards this topic but there isnt an uniform opinion for it deodatos social message is very clear humans are savages by nature but the question is again who are the real savages after watching the lost footage of the first group we can feel repulsion for the so called civilized humans the savages didnt do harm to anyone before the civilized humiliated them after the tv executives watched the footage the movie ends in a silent way that will always leave you shocked that is a perfect ending there is nothing more to say after understanding why they found cruel fates to spoil how they were killed and what they saw which is the strong point of the movie would be unfair for those who havent seen the movie because the shock factor is very high and its very impressive to the point that a first time view is a great experience the truth is that is more than a cult horror movie its more of a myth this movie is among the best horror movies of all time and it deserves to be watched by any horror fan well maybe not for those who are easily grossed or for the fainted of the heartthis is truly a horror experience because it shocks disgusts and makes you think,cruel
ive recently heard that the average human life lasts about 650000 hours this breaks down to  74 years that being said when the moment of my death comes my last thought will be damn i wish i had back those 2 hours i wasted on grantedch was made with a modicum skill but this masterpiece talk is excessive the score sounds like elevator music every performance is onenote nevermind that the characters are unsympathetic  thats actually minutely cool  they are most of the time boring and stupid you have a sound girl who in the beginning is chiding her boyfrienddirector about not being ready to marry her days later she screams at him while he participates in a gangrape  but wait  shes not screaming cause he and their other 2 pals are raping a woman shes screaming cause the camera is still on good filmmaking and good art in general should be about some attempt at truth not fact but some revelation or expression of a point of view for all the credit ch is being given in these pages for the who are the real savages debate moments like the one i just described strip away any of those points  i do not believe these characters  i feel like i am being lied to when i am asked to believe that these people would act this way therefore the movie is a lie  and worse its a boring lie apart from some horrific treatment of animals which has already been given tons of lipservice here so let me only say that it is tragic that these poor animals died for such a weak movie the rest of ch is extremely tedious ya sit there waiting for the next shock  and then waiting and waiting smore and listening to that beautiful monotonous scorepoints have been given to ch for being gritty like this was some artistic choice this was not a choice this was a buncha hacks working so onthecheap that they couldnt pring for anything better than handheld the score sounds like elevator music  i know i awready said that but i need to reiterate it in response to how many people said it was beautiful  it sucked did it make for an unusual juxtaposition on a few occasions sure it still sounds like ross geller plunking away on his casio in central perk von trier ending dogville and manderlay with bowies young americans after 150 minutes of handel and vivaldi  now thats a friggin juxtapositionis not scary it is repulsive but not shocking shock would require some element of surprise ch ploddingly meanders way too often for any suspense to build to the point were a shock may happen the only thing surprising about this movie is how many people seem eager to play yesman and be next in line to kneel down pucker up and blow glorious praise over a towering mediocrity,cruel
is pretty much everything youve heard about gory disturbing disgusting etc ill keep this review short and sweet  cuz if you are reading this youve either already seen it or have read a lot about it even thought this film does have some seriously brutal moments  its still relatively lighter on poundforpound gore than more contemporary films i found that the most disturbing thing about this film was the socialcommentary angle that the film took towards the end at first the characters go into the jungle seeking to film the cannibals but end up terrorizing them to get better footage it really brings home the message of who is really the bigger savage is it the jungle dwellers and their seemingly savage practices  or the socalled civilized europeans who will terrorize and kill for their own gain strong movie not for everyone by any means  but is definitely a mustsee among hardcore horror fans even though i find this film to be more of a commentary on the depravity of humans as a whole than as a horror film 1010,cruel
amen brotheris hailed by gore fans and despised by the casual viewer and for good reasonthis is one of the most grueling relentless exercises in human savagery ever lensed  but is it any good  being a fan of italian horror i have to say yes but just barely  it delivers unflincing scenes of rape dismemberment real animal slaughter and other generally deviant behavior but the angle its presented in simply doesnt workrobert kerman the emerald jungle plays a college professor in search of a film crew in a south american jungle  he witnesses several atrocities committed by the natives mild compared to the rest of the film dines on human flesh and eventually is led to a macabre shrine where he finds the footage the crew shot  back in the states a bunch of stuffy tv executives want to broadcast the film for a slice of sensationalist reality but kerman refuses and we settle into the centerpiece of the movie  we watch with growing horror as the film crew indulges in rape torture and murder all for their art with the camera picking up every second the characters are hateful cretins who are obviously desensitized to human suffering butwhen all the ammo in their guns runs out the reality of the situation strikes them and their atrocities are avenged and then someis a repulsive nihilistic film with a silly angle that presents it as social commentary a bad idea this is pulpy dreck at best  it acutally reminded me of 15 minutes in that it goes about its business in a mindlessly savage manner  however i appreciated robert kermans character obviously designed to not just speak out for his personal disgust but for the disgust of the audience as wellhes the moral backbone of this film  also the violence is very effective and welldone and ruggero deodato directs the repulsive proceedings with style the use of handheld camera is effective  overall though i cant bring myself to rate this anywhere above average so 25 stars out of 5,cruel
lets face it those 19yearold eberts in the making who consider this an art film are without a clue the only reason people seek this movie out is because of the total depravity contained therein so for the total gore hounds looking for fun ill summarize this flick for youthe real stuff naturally all the animal torture in the film is sickeningly real1 muskrat getting stabbed in the neck blood pours out2 monkey getting its skull split open by a machete3 pig being kicked then shot in the head with a shotgun while the actor gleefully smiles4 giant and probably endangered sea turtle gets decapitated and then totally ripped apartthe fake stuff1 two separate scenes of gang rape2 a guy getting his weewee sliced off3 a bound woman gets raped with a stone phallus then she gets beaten to death4 a primitive abortion is performed on a very pregnant tribeswoman5 women and children are forced into a grass shack which is set on fire then they are shot while trying to escape 6 a tribeswoman is impaled through her vaginal opening all the way until it exits her mouth 7 and of course there are countless scenes of naked people getting mutilated left and right for any person to have the absolute gall to call this film social commentary should just take a look at any of deodatos other films the man is a mondo hack nothing more whatever sensationally offensive subject matter will offend most he will include probably the only deodato film readily available to the general public would be his the house on the edge of the park watch that little gem then tell me if you think hes a concerned humanist,cruel
as far as i can tell this movie has only one real point to see how much it can make the audience sick the gore is so overthetop that is ceases to be shocking and just starts looking ridiculous the graphic rape scenes were unpleasant and unnecessary as well but what really made me want to take a shower was finding out that the animals in this movie were actually killed im no animal rights activist but killing animals just because youre a dumb filmmaker without a decent makeup effects budget is just plain wrongthe acting in this movie was only slightly better than your average porn film the score only seemed to have two compositions which got played over and over again particularly that dumb synthesiser music the characters left a lot to be desired as well the four doomed student filmmakers were so obnoxious i found myself rooting for the cannibalsas far as the blair witch comparisons go i consider them pretty superficial at best the documentary footage is mostly reserved for the last half hour of the movie also blair witch relied on psychological terror and the power of suggestion seems to have only one goal to gross the audience out if the makers of blair witch actually did see this movie i would imaging that they used it as a blueprint of what not to do with their film,cruel
having finally managed to get hold of a copy of this movie i was thoroughly disappointed after viewing it the uk censors did it a big favour by banning it for so long because it isnt worth any of the hype surrounding it the animal killings in the movie are completely pointless and seriously detract from the overall quality of the film and the human death sequences are contrary to most opinions very unrealistic i mean how many corpses have cornyellow skin and organs the size of footballs maybe its because i saw it for the first time 20 years after it was made that i find it unrealistic and dull  or maybe its because it is  ,cruel
let me say from the beginning that i have absolutely no problem with scenes of brutality or extremity in films it might not be my personal taste usually but i think that every film should be watched for what it is without creating subjective expectationshaving made this clear let me take the next step into something even more controversial  the infamous scenes of real animal killings i will be honest i dont want to judge the film for its animal cruelty depiction  for many reasons most of all because it would be unfair why because then if we wanted to be fair we would have to take the same fact into account when speaking about tarkovsky  andrei rublyov  coppola  apocalypse now  jodorowsky  el topo  and the list goes on all of these are filmmakers that tortured or killed animals for the camera in the films i mentioned all of them genuine masterpieces in my opinion and after all can we really define with accuracy whats allowed in art and whats over the top of course the answer is nobut the problem is that the film doesnt stay there its supposed to be a social commentary and it is indeed a social commentary that only a lobotomized would appreciate and im not even talking about the message that the movie is supposed to have i could even say that the film was quite a strong experience for the first 40 minutes or so and when the real subject came up and the real face of the teenage documentarists starts becoming clear you simply cant resist thinking that if this was the ending of the film it could even be considered as a great film but no ruggero deodato apparently has very little respect for his audience thinking that the viewer is probably a retard unable to understand the deep meaning of the movie so he simply forces it with such naivety that after some point you really want to start banging your head against the wall and scream that even michael moore is an intellectual compared to this guy the ultimate peak of stupidity comes in the last sequence where one of the producers of the documentary  who by the way was a profithunting scum that didnt give a st about human pain so far  gets so shocked by the violence of the footage that he commands for all the reels of the film to be burned and in case any viewer with an iq of 5 didnt get it yet dont worry at all because then you have the last scene where the anthropologistmain character walks out of the building with a confused face and his consciousness wondering in voiceover who are the real cannibals simply outrageousi think the problem is that the director took himself too seriously and had an ambition that he wasnt able to execute without becoming ridiculous and he probably got a bit confused along the way because the real cannibals of the film are obviously the ones behind the cameras,cruel
ill stick my neck out and say it one of the best films ever madethis uncompromising horror film employs original bravado technique and aesthetic brilliance to corrupt our perceptionsthe second half a found film in which a party of doco makers suffers the consequences of their morally reprehensible actions in a cannibal inferno in brazil features mountains of raw horror imagery cut to a soundtrack that renders everything beyond surrealdeodatos strength is in his singular takenoprisoners vision the special effects are so good theyre invisible and the performances are so vivid we never doubt their authenticityto some the film is marred by several scenes in which real animals  are mistreated though im no fun of obnoxious cinematic tactics in the context of this extraordinary document these sequences simply add to both the accrued horror on screen abd the films hardearned notorietya masterpiece,cruel
this is i can safely say the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i am not stranger to gratuitous gore and violence i have an evil deadmeet the feeblesleprechan etc sense of humourand i have spent probably thousands of hours watching and loving spatteringly obscene and supposedly shocking asian and italian horror films but this was different this was every kind of inappropriately uncinematic disgustingness imaginable including what is likely the most disturbing rape scene ever filmed it was not so much gore because there really isnt all that much but the absolute ugliness of human behaviorand the anthropologists are the most uncivilized tribe of people in the whole film before i watched this movie i had never seen a film that made me feel physically dirty before do not watch this,cruel
i reluctantly decided to watch the infamous and i found it to be every bit as shocking as people make out it was by far the most uncomfortable experience ive ever had watching a film from the sickening violence and killings to the torturing of animals and graphic rape scenes this film is as morally low as they comeis not art  its not even entertainment how can anybody enjoy watching a coati being repeatedly stabbed as it screams in pain or a turtle being decapitated and then pulled to pieces it makes for an extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable viewing experience unfortunately its also an unforgettable one so watch at your peril,cruel
no i did not see this film nor will i spoiler nor do i watch old western movies or foreign films showing real animal cruelty suffering and death such as texas chain saw massacre actors paid to simulate being tortured injured killed are one thing animals actually harmed because they are weaker than their killers and because someone wants to make money off their pain are quite another inhumanity is fostered with the acceptance of this kind of cruelty and it is the true horror of films like ,cruel
for his work on the film the director was arrested by italian authorities on suspicion of murder charges and faced life in prison following its 1980 milan premiere he endured a trial when italian authorities were unconvinced that the footage was indeed staged deodato lost the original trial and all prints were to be destroyed but he managed to have the ruling overturned in the early 80s when the actors finally appeared on tv to prove otherwisesome five years passed before the film saw release in deodatos home country this movie was banned for twenty years in many countriesonly for fans of disgusting footage,cruel
i cant understand why this movie has just the six average maybe people just seen the violence and not the social criticism that this movie want pass down the movie use the violence itself for criticize the violence suffered by the indigenous people due to consumerism that along the years destroy their lifestyle in order to replace it with ours its a sad story that began with the colonialism and carry on today at the end of the movie the audience should sympathize with the cannibal that are more honest and less savage than the white people nevertheless people ignore this message and just focus on the violence over the animals,cruel
i think people who make films like are real visionaries how did ruggero deodato know in the 1970s itself that the scenario he created then would come true 23 decades after that scenario was released this film is a prescient exploration done in the 1970s of the age of exploitation and voyeurism that we are living in now yes has its shortcomings at times the film seems amateurish but that is maybe because the film required that raw look as for the violence shown in the film yes its graphic but that perhaps compares nothing to the age we are living in now i wonder if would create any ripple now when videos of public beheadings are easily available on the internet and circulated via whatsapp for being such a prescient and gutsy work i rate 1010 i think am lucky i got to see this film,cruel
having avoided this title for much of my horror viewing life i decided to give it a try being one of the better reviewed cannibal films all in all i found it to be a pretty decent movie yes it has some graphic images but sadly this is tame compared to some of todays slasher movies it also has a pretty engaging story which kept me interested all the way to the end i really enjoyed how our victims demeanors transform throughout the movie we go from our initial impression of the film makers as being victim too learning that it was they who were the violent sadists and that the cannibals were in fact punishing and executing them for their atrocities a neat note clearly eli roth took note of this movie in making the green inferno which i am now very eager to see makes numerous mention of the green inferno region of the amazon and the cannibal tribes there,cruel
can sick movies be good movies yes as in quality and merit this one came off better off then i thought it would be is it exploitation for the sake of exploitation maybe but what comes with it is a story ch is quite intriguing as from the tribe peoples point of view it kind of asks that question where does tribal rituals stop and murder begin third time unlucky i guess sees another young crew of filmmakers out to make a documentary about these cannibalistic tribes people some scenes i warn you are sickly graphic where even some of the characters retch on a few occasions such graphic images challenge the viewer one involving the disemboweling of a turtle which in my opinion went a little bit too far the latest crew before ending up all victims encounter their share of bites etc a big shot new york journalist his guide and assistant head to the amazon to recover the young film crew who of course now have become skeletons and bone retrieving a camera with tonnes of footage of their exploits from a shrine of death you could say what unfolds are some shocking and evidential truths at the selfish and indecent hands of the film crew where except for the young girl me myself are glad her friends got what they deserved i have heard this title mentioned a few times where such a itching curiosity got the better of me the voice of the journalist i have heard in many other luici fucci flicks most ostensibly night of the zombies if youre into sick films and want to test your senses again go for this one a beautiful and memorable music score accompanied that will stay with you for a while,cruel
what to say about this terrifying ordeal its too horrifying for words and yet imdb has a minimum of 1000 words so here goesstep by step you are brought to a place where you hate the film crew more than usual i think that the nigerian executions are disturbing and upsetting and it plants this terrible seed in your mind is this real footage going in to this movie you know that its staged and that the cannibals do not actually kill the actors even if deodato was prosecuted for murder on the basis of the film  but you still have a little voice in your head asking how did they do that this looks like stock footage of nigerian shooting squads then the atrocious film crew they are smokers and in 2014 smokers are always evil the 2014 audience would probably want to see people torn to shreds simply for smoking but no they are murderers and rapists too and they make you want to kill them yourselfall things said there is something wrong with the whole project something morally objectionable this is totally inappropriate said my roommate as we watched it and i laughed a little at the prim and proper analysis  while we watched cannibals slaughtering people with rocks and eating their viscera yes totally inappropriate and disturbing and sick truly sicki highly recommend,cruel
ruggero deodato masterpiece have been name the most controversial film ever made and many people dont see beneath that i have been a fan of this movies for a long time and this is the way that i see this movie is one of the best horror movie of all time robert kerman delivers an amazing performance making a sympathetic and down to earth character the rest of the cast are all secondary characters all important to the movie story linethe camera shoot are absolutely brilliant from the beginning of the movie with those great wide shoots of the amazon to the shaky camera shots of the cannibals killing the makeup is absolutely breathtaking after more than 20 years the movies make up is still one of the most memorable of all films historybut is something deeper in this movie that many people may not have seen if you see the cruelty and of the film in some way didnt you find the same premise of avatar you can see this movie as a safe the earth kind of movie this people do harm to this tribe and they got what the deserve the got kill because they didnt respect the way of the people that live there that are one with the nature that surround themmy last words one this movie is that is a masterpiece and i think it dont have the respect deserved,cruel
is a film approached by viewers with a variety of attitudes ranging from reverence to utter disgust i will attempt to add my two cents to the pile without retreading too much or delving into cinematic history too far is a 1980 film directed by ruggero deodato chronicling the journey of an nyu professor into the south american jungle to recover the films of his four associates who have mysteriously disappeared whilst on assignment with help from some equally experienced and jaded guides he navigates through the lands of the yacumo tribe to the yanomamo tribe who with some coaxing and a peace offering relinquish the films of the crew with some other associates in the television business he reviews the films and learns the horrible truth behind the film crew and their expedition which ultimately forces the viewer to question who is the civilized and who is the savagethe professors journey serves as a lesson wherein we learn about the intricacies of the two tribes and how despite the typically western view of such cultures and their inherent brutality there is indeed a sense of justice and a harmony among these people but make no mistake the jungle is still a dangerous place and the justice itself is both harsh and swiftwhat we learn from the footage of the crew is that while the outside world views the tribes as a primitive and backward people it is ultimately the conduct of the outsiders in the film crew that disrupt the balance of life in the tribes and the result is captured in all its gory glory on the filmthis film contains not only gore in the conventional horror sense but a certain amount of real life animal killing i will not run down the list of animals but the most famousinfamous scene which features a large turtle is one of the most sobering things i have seen in any movie ever even as a jaded horror fan this scene still induces a chilling silence in the room in both mixed company and my own solo viewings from a historical perspective this movie is extremely important as the culmination of the entire mondo genre and a prediction of things to come in human experience and entertainment the film mondo cane represented a bleeding edge of film where human experience sometimes sublime sometimes frightening was captured in real time on film only after some time and investigation did we learn that some of jacopetti and prosperis classic footage was embellished or in some cases outright fabricated flash forward a few years to and we are forced to ask ourselves the question that arises from this phenomenon if we can take cinema verite and make it realer than real then what limits are there to impose we can not only capture the truthful horrors of the world but make an even more repugnant reality by manipulating the brush with our own hands and to what end before it was to outline a certain line against which reality and human morality bristled now we use the line for our own ends to create outrage and the resulting titillation is entertainment so by nature this film is the climax of a wave of italian cinema that predicted our current forms of entertainment like reality tv and other selfreferential products by a good amount of timebut the judgment is yours is it right wrong were these the only films or even artistic movement to predict this concept maybe it was the inevitable result as bloodsport is not unique to humanity but comes and goes in waves so art trash you be the judge but i implore you to definitely watch itan interesting note some people have seen this and thought it was a snuff film which gives me a laugh but one thing does sit oddly with me if this was an italian crew in the middle of colombia how did they get all that meat and blood to shoot those gore scenes maybe reality is a little more blurred than i once thought,cruel
ill never forget the first time i watched this film at the alarmingly young age of just 13 years old i was exploring the more lurid areas of cinema i had seen the hysteria and infamy surrounding this film the list of countries that had banned it the various warnings such as if in doubt do not watch this film which of course was an invitation rather than a deterrence due to my age i would have been hard pressed to walk in to a shop and buy a film titled and i didnt want to waste my time watching a version that had been slaughtered by the bbfc so i broke the law and found it on the now extinct limewire id never downloaded anything before i was sure it wouldnt work somehow however when the download finished i opened the file and was presented with the opening scene a shot of the vast perpetual amazon rain forest accompanied by riz ortolanis beautiful score the realisation that i was now able to watch this film of unprecedented horror was so terrifying that i instantly closed windows media player in a wave of fright eventually i mustered up the courage to watch it it was a joyfully intense experience i never knew what ghastliness was around the corner only sheer masochistic curiosity kept me watching it this curious thrill being the essence of exploitation cinema in order to clear my name i must add that i have since bought a fully uncut version on the internet is the father of the found footage genre the film follows harold monroe a professor of anthropology at a new york university who endeavours to discover what has happened to a young group of documentary makers who ventured into an area known as the green inferno in south america eventually he finds their reels and takes them back to new york witnessing their fate in a projection room according to director ruggero deodato the film serves as a diatribe against the sensational violent nature of the media which is quite obviously dubious and hypocritical considering the exploitative nature of the film it is a very powerful piece of filmmaking it leaves a lasting impression on you the film batters you with its biting visceral force which is both visual and aural in many respects this film has high production values for an exploitation film for example riz ortolanis score features both beautiful acoustic tracks and relentless aural assaults it works with the strong visuals to wear you down until youre imploring for it to stop its violence is jarringly realistic and notoriously on several occasions completely real im somewhat torn on the issue of animal slaughter all animals killed in the film were reportedly eaten afterwards and the animals were killed humanely apart from the coatimundi whose fate is the hardest to watch i feel is unfairly maligned look atapocalypse now the brutal slaying of the water buffalo is ignored because of the massively high esteem its held in if it was a lowbudget exploitation film it would have probably been steeped in criticism the acting is tolerable if slightly toecurling in places however generally its good enough for it not to detract from how horribly effective the film iswwwhawkensiancom,cruel
considered to be one of the most controversial films in recent years holocaust repulsed audiences with its ultra realistic violence and its real animal cruelty on screen the footage was so realistic that the director was charged with murder until he proved the cast were alive and wellbeneath this gruesome facade lays the narrow divide between what is considered to be civilised and what is deemed barbaric the first half of the film picks up the pieces of the final and most hard hitting half which is the lost doco footage is it here where holocaust really shines in its desired context by the end of the film we are cheering for the amazonian tribespeople lost in a forgotten time and leering at the sensationalist western filmmakers who substitute their moral conscience for the most depraved acts of murder and pillage possible towards these villagers if you watch this do not view it through a shallow lens of depravity and abhorrent cruelty rather view it as a social commentary on the savagery that still exists in this so called civilised society of ours,cruel
this film while somewhat over the top and overly gritty and violent does make you think at the end of the day who are the real savages a question posed by the main character towards the end of this film now i did have a few problems with this filmproblems okay so the movie was great but way too nasty and violent and i saw the us edit here are some examples the rape scene which leads to the raped girl being murdered by her people and hung from a stick from her anus to her mouth the birth scene baby is born then buried alive in thick sludge and left to suffocate then the mother is killed the castration scene self explanatory but while all these scenes were hard to watch just a little hard to watch not as graphic as you would think or maybe thats because i saw the us edit while these scenes are graphic they are amazingly well shot and in a morbid and odd way beautiful im not crazy and i hate violence i simply am saying for a film done in 1980 the effects are beyond the effects of many of todays films hands downas far as the animal killing scenes  done with real animals i do not approve   but as far as they go they are cut from the us edit so watch that version to be safe although in the us version it is not shown like the sea turtle is not shown being killed but is shown being eaten and the pig is not shown being killed or eaten so yeahif you watch this movie please remember it is just a film just a movie this is the first movie ever where i can accept and appreciate the directors vision and see the art side of it so remember its just a movie and try to appreciate it not for violence killings castration mutilations or anything of that sort but try to appreciate the moral question and artdrenched shots in this film thank you for reading my review,cruel
wow i literally just finished watching this bloodsplattered masterpiece and i dont know who to acclaim the director ruggero deodato or the writer gianfranco clerici the things that stand out most are for sure the special effects and plot but mostly the morality of the tale in whole at first it seems like your average tale of woe as you wait for the build up and once it gets going you find yourself relating to the film crew as normal folk seeking answers to the primitive unknown you feel sorrow for there plight once professor harold monroe robert kerman finds theyve been dismembered and possibly eaten although at the same time you begin to think of them as child like almost in the way that they play fear and communicate in a way that makes you forget about the doc crew and then we see the found footage personally i found myself more disgusted by the behavior of alan mark jack and faye the way that they raped and pillaged even shooting that poor piglet made me quite frankly hate them in the end the footage was burned and we all got a nice life lesson here we are at the edge of the world of human history things like this happen all the time in the jungle its survival of the fittest in the jungle the world in general its the daily violence of the strong overcoming the weak,cruel
arguably the most infamous controversial and shocking of the video nasties ruggero deodato managed to infuse a horror subgenre flagging from over exposure into a powerful piece of pseudodocumentary cinema that still horrifies traumatises and disgusts modern audiences italian genre cinema has always had a tendency towards imitation and the cannibal subgenre was one that was specific to the country and by the mid 1970s was already dying a death deodato had made one previously last cannibal world 1977 and he was pushed into making a sequel which he was reticent to do however after some time he agreed and seems to have taken the opportunity to actually comment on some very interesting observations on popular culture at the timeanother subgenre exploded and created a huge batch of imitators the mondo cycle started in the 1960s with paulo cavara and gualtiero jacopettis mondo cane 1962 with its use of documentary techniques they delighted audiences with graphic depictions of exotic bizarre and archaic practises and incidents however as the market became flooded with imitation the practices used to get the increasingly shocking images became questionable  these aggressive techniques even infiltrated newsmedia in the decade what this means is that the creation of sensationalist stories within the media and this cycle of pseudodocumentaryethnographic expose were often manipulated by the filmmakers who would exploit the situation to make the story more interesting  exploitation which culminated in often horrific violence towards other humans it is this element of pugnacious and hostile form of reportage that inspired deodatos new cannibal moviethe film could be said to be a two part structure in the first we follow harold monroe robert kerman a new york professor is lead into the amazon jungles in search of a group of filmmakers who had disappeared some time previously here the group encounter a primitive cannibal tribe and discover film cans left behind the second half of the film focuses mainly upon the screenings of the shocking footage captured by the illfated documentary makers from this found footage the professor television producers and us film spectators are shown the increasingly hostile tactics used to get shocking and scandalous images of an apparent primordial tribe of viscous people but what it fundamentally highlights is the possibly more horrific nature of modernity as it uses violence for the purpose of entertainment and procurement of profit and it is this barbarism that becomes the four person teams demise and catastrophic deathsa contentious issue with the film is the very real killings of animals on the screen and this coupled with the special effects of human death creates a disjointing juxtaposition making it appear entirely realistic the woman who has been placed onto a stake which protrudes through her mouth appears very real these juxtapositions also created much of the controversy surrounding the project and even lead to the director being accused of killing the cast even in its native italy the film was accused of being a genuine snuff film it is no mistake that deodato was able to use realist film vocabulary techniques to offer a complete experience  he had worked as assistant director on several of roberto rossellinis films the master of italian neorealism the film was inevitably banned in almost every country and vilified as grotesque exploitation but this claim is to completely miss the point of the filmthe impact of this film still can be seen today whilst it is now belatedly getting the kind of critical acclaim that it deserves it still has the power to agitate and appal anyone who watches it  it even manages to horrify some more fanatical gorehounds besides this the influence of the film can still be seen to this day in 1999 the blair witch project arguably lifted s main premise and the found footage concept is being exhaustively used to this day cloverfield 2008 trollhunter 2010 and chronicle 2012 to name just three at last in the uk we are able to view the film in its entirety and whilst the film is genuinely horrific the importance of the uncut version will suggest that the meaning can be fully explored it is an incredible achievement of horror cinema and should be seen by everyone well i wouldnt show it to a child  even though i saw a version at a young age powerful important cinema with an incredible amount to say about the savagery of our modern timeswwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,cruel
notorious hardcore horror film hits you right in the gut for over an hour and a half to say that its not for everybody is an understatement its impossible to walk away from it and not be affected in fact to say that this viewer enjoyed it may not be entirely accurate but everything that it does it does extremely well its that kind of a movie ultimately its not exactly subtle about the messages it espouses and its exceedingly grim for much of its running time it works as a prototype for the modern popular found footage genre almost two decades before the blair witch project had its great successthe story chronicles the journey of an nyc university professor harold monroe robert kerman to discover the fate of a documentary film crew who had disappeared after venturing into the amazon at first when we find out that they indeed met a horrible fate thats not the real twist the real twist is what motivated the local tribe to treat them this way these filmmakers were no saints  in fact they were just the oppositedirector ruggero deodato here creates a movie that you dont just watch but experience its all too believable throughout with its many scenes of violence against animals understandably too much for some viewers to take gorgeous cinematography and convincing performances are heavy assets when one sees just how depraved the supposed civilized individuals were they may feel sick to their stomachs contrasting all of this is a main musical theme by riz ortolani so utterly lovely it doesnt seem to belong in a horror film at all but thats why it works as well as it doesthe film spends a fair amount of time in the jungle until at a climactic point back in nyc monroe and dubious tv executives view the footage that the documentarians shot for a while these executives are eager to exploit the sensational content until they realize just how ugly things gotthe overall effect of is very sobering but unless some of the elements of its presentation are a turn off for the individual viewer it does rank as something well worth a look as was already said its nothing if not memorableeight out of 10,cruel
oh where do i begin okay if youve ever seen yu yu hakusho theres this video tape called the chapter black tape the villain shinobu uses to brainwashing people into thinking all humans are evil and deserve to be massacred by demons this movie would be on that tape in fact the music from the chapter black tape during the show is a mimic of the melody in this movie almost like a porno a times this movie is extremely graphic that doesnt even do it justice if you ever wanted to see a turtle and some rodent dissected and eaten this movie has it yeah the gore in this movie is more disturbing than any modern day horror movie id ever seen alsotheres been some debate about whether some the sex scenes in this movie were real honestly i think some of them might have been real after watching them dissect a turtle which was still partially alive with its head cut off i didnt think they were acting any more they couldnt get away with nearly as much stuff in a modern day horror movie which is why i like 80s horror movies so much no computer generated crap there were times even i cringed but to be honest i enjoyed it and if you think you can stomach a movie with ridiculously amounts of gore go ahead and watch it too,cruel
ahhh the infamous first off its pertinent not to mention obvious to note that this film is not for everyone those friends you have who cite halloween or texas chainsaw massacre as the goriest most effed up films theyve ever seen do not expose them to this movie they will likely never speak to you again that being said i loved this movie but have some glaring problems with it i felt that the animal slaughter scenes were perfectly fine and can respect the realism of them given that these animals were supposedly fed to the actual natives as happens everyday in the rain forest so the acts themselves i do not consider gratuitous however i do feel that the way in which these killings were filmed and focused on bordered a bit on the verge of disaster porn the muskrat killing though somewhat benign compared to the others seemed particularly egregious closeup of squirming animal with a knife through its throat squealing and convulsing wait for it to die scene over it was just unnecessary in my opinion and couldve been portrayed with a bit more tact however this is modern man trekking into the wilds to essentially reconnect us all with what we come from and this is beyond commonplace in nature the acting was not as bad as i expected though some scenes truly were awkwardly performed the viewer i assume is to believe that these film makers after being exposed to harshness of the jungle descended into barbarism which was magnified by their programing from growing up in the calloused society of western civilization unfortunately the acting just was not there i found myself scratching my head as the atrocities became greater and greater while the actors conversed as if they were walking in the park on a rather mundane day and not in an eerie sociopathic sort of way more of a we dont have much of a range as actors sort of way that being said this is a brilliant film if taking into account what they had to work with the juxtapositions of commentary about the green inferno paired with shots of nyc the by and large convincing gore the iconic impalement scene the very convincing look of the found footage and the overall message of civilized man being just as barbaric but in less overt ways were nothing short of very impressive in my opinion i finished this movie much more impressed than i expected thinking it would be nothing more than a fake snuff film that relied on animal cruelty for shock value i will certainly share this film but only with my very most open minded and lets face it at least somewhat screwed up friends,cruel
i first saw nearly three years ago i borrowed it from a friend of mine who was borrowing it from his friend he kept asking me if i was sure i wanted to borrow it to the point where he was just getting on my nerves and he told me how disturbing it was i finally said just lend me the film already later that night i went home watched the movie and i was like oh my god he was right this probably the most disturbing film i have ever scene i also found out the guy who directed this movie was arrested after it was released he was accused of making a snuff film for anybody not familiar with what a snuff is it is a film showing the actual murder of a person but he was cleared of the charges truth be told the killings of the characters do look real however 7 animals were actually killed when this movie was being made six of them onscreena rat being stabbed in the neck and then gutteda turtle drowned and decapitated and limbs shell and entrails removeda spider killed with a machetea snake decapitated with a machetea spider monkey with the top of its head cut off with a macheteand a pig kicked twice and shot in the head with a shotgun at close rangethis is a very disturbing movie warning this movie should not be viewed by anybody younger than 19,cruel
when i ordered this movie on dvd i thought to myself can i handle this surprisingly i did the stone in vagina scene i could have done without as well as the turtle disembowelment but overall this movie didnt bother me in the same way that tinto brasss caligula did robert kerman an actor once known for porn movies does a good job as professor monroe and so does the rest of the cast including the actor who plays jack anders although he bears a striking resemblance to chuck norris theres also a louis gossett jr lookalike playing one of the colombian soldiers i wonder if chuck and louis ever get asked what was it like filming even though they werent in itworth watching but only if you have a strong stomachits not rated but is worthy of an nc17,cruel
this film is not easy to watch but the statement made and the way it was done make this a big moment in film the various scenes of animals that get shot chopped up stabbed ripped apart and eaten will upset most if not all viewers to some extent but it is these scenes of real violence that make the violence involving humans so believable apart from the animals scenes there are still plenty of other horrific moments the rape scene or rather death by brick scene one of thembut the statement of who is civilised and who isnt is well made and evolves throughout the film and as far as i know this is where the handheld camera viewpoint started the craze blair witch would later ignite hard to watch but a big talking point in film,cruel
id a liking for brutal movies at one point of time at that point in time i heard about this movie from one of my friends hed downloaded an uncut version of i got to know the movie was not an ordinary one right from the credits there needs to be definitely a special mention about the music a wonderful music is rendered by riz ortolani which in an excellent way complements the plot theres an extreme violence right from the beginning many of my friends could not watch the complete movie such gore it hasas the movie progresses it becomes increasingly disturbing there are claims and allegations that the people are really killed in the movie while it was shot it might be false but such a doubt to arise in the peoples mind the maker of the movie should have done a wonderful jobthere are many gory movies but none can come near this one this is a cultclassic it feels so real a masterpiece indeed see it if you are ok with extreme violence and like realistic presentationi give full marks for the excellent work,cruel
lets get this bit out of the way firstas im sure you are already aware this is possibly the most notoriously banned movie ever made it features animal killings in extremely graphic detail and rightly so was banned as a reviewer i do not condone the use of such acts in film making but whats this brings to the film is quite astonishing in effect on with the reviewthe violent nature of this film is well documented and its my belief that overshadows the incredible direction of the film it is a film of 2 halves the first is the story of a professors search for a group of film makers who were documenting cannibalistic tribes the search leads the professor to the jungle where he meets with a team of trackers who agree to take him to the tribal village where the documentarians were last seenthis journey sets the tone beautifully its a well executed insight to the tribes way of life a brutal savage and alien world the direction is wonderful deodato as brutal as his methods were captures the essence superbly as beautiful as it is horrificupon reaching the tribal village the professor discovers the remains of the young film makers and manages to acquire the film canisters containing the footage that the documentarians had shotthe 2nd half of the film is the reviewing of the footage found by the professor what ensues is a truly horrific masterpiece of cinemathe footage shows the story of alan yates and his team as they trek their way unmercilessly through the jungle to capture the footage they want at whatever costas they quite unsympathetically brutalise the tribes people to film their reactions they become almost drunk with power as they rape pillage and destroy their way through the tribes village deodato builds these characters so well that you develop a hatred for them which in turn makes you cheer on the cannibal tribes to dispose of them despite its grotesque nature the climax is incredibly satisfyingcredit to the director like i said at the start of this review i do not condone the killing of animals for the sake of entertainment but this is an incredibly well directed picture the pace of the film keeps you watching till the end the music is astonishing in the scene where the film makers are burning the village the main theme plays which is a soothing piece of music quite an irony to nature of the film it adds so much to the main characters it makes them seem innocent yet they are the ones who are savageoverall this movie excels all expectations and deodato made sure of that its a gripping story that is well executed inspite of its obvious disrepute this is a fantastic horror flick it shocks scares and disgusts to an extreme level if you are a lover of horror then this is a must watch,cruel
never have i seen a film that was truly disturbing until now never have i seen a film that i agree is not fit for public consumption until now i have seen just about every so called video nasty all the old horrors that were banned and simply couldnt understand why this one its clear to see why whilst this film makes for compelling viewing not in the sickest mind could it be considered entertainmenti think the film is very well made and constructed the style works very well in creating tension and realityi was expecting the typical run of the mill low budget gore fest this is not that at all but i stand by my first paragraphyou have been warned,cruel
would have to be one of the most sickest film ive ever looked ata couple of days ago my friend and i were really pumped up to see this film and it turned out that he hated it but i had a different feeling for the way this film turned out the rape the torture the blood everything was done so well except for one thing that was not needed animal cruelty i will get to that in a moment but ill talk about the things that made this film excellent i also want to put out that at times it didnt feel like a horror filmacting 7510 the acting i could say was up to scratch its not the best but what they hey they did okscenes 910 most of the scenes as we all know are very rough and at times too hard to handle i found this film most of the time very hard to handle especially the rape scenes most of the scenes felt very powerful and at times it felt emotional there were also many different elements to these scenes so we always had something different to look atcinemtograhy 1010 now this was excellent if we didnt have the normal shots we had shots that were shot in documentary style whether it was shot in those two it was disturbing i think deodato did a nice job on making it believable that actors were really getting killed cause when i saw the trailer at first it looked that wayplot 810 a pretty good plot thought carefully i like how they show the beginning then they go to professor monroe and a bounty hunter searching for the camera crew and then after seeing the shocking documentary that the crew have filmed too be honest i found the scenes with the crew the most disturbingnow the animal cruelty what was the point in the animal killings the turtle was disgusting i just dont get the point in them killing the animals because that ruined the film for me every time i saw an animals getting shot or cut or whateveroverall this is a good film and a good one to add to your collection its disturbing and full of terror and the beautiful tropical music makes this film 10 times sick as it is already 8510,cruel
this is not a movie that bears repeat viewings well not unless you have something really wrong with you i would watch the human centipede twice before i watch again this is handsdown one of the most gutwrenching movies ive ever seen i took an antacid halfway through just in case my stomach got the better of me the strongest feelings of true disgust are elicited from the six  genuine animal killings in the film a native boy amateurishly slits the throat of a screaming coatimundi grinning americans decapitate and disembowel a giant turtle a squirrel monkey has its face cut off and brains eaten by natives etc this did not need to happen although it does fill the viewer with a lot of animosity towards the americans not that the subsequent rapes dont do this equally as well without anyone actually getting hurt in the process making their deaths less of a tragedy and more of a karmic public serviceand then there are the rapes there were at least 3 by my count that is waaaay more than my yearly recommended intake of rape scenes needless to say the fact that these were fake didnt make them any easier to stomach i rarely have to look away from a movie but i broke that rule tonight ugh despite the good special effects please god tell me that guy didnt really get castrated with a rock the rest of the production was borderline awful the sound was off a lot of the time and the acting was shoddy at best this could easily be attributed to the found film aspect but the segments that werent found were just as bad then again what do you expect from a lowbudget italian exploitation movie from the 80s bad production is just par for the courseas posited by many critics i can see the film as heavyhanded social commentary about civilized society the most vile acts perpetrated in the film were at the hands of the american film crew who went into the jungle to document the savage ways of the cannibalistic tribes the cannibals in the film are portrayed as simplistic jungle people so their actions while horrifying the adulteryshaming scene comes to mind plus the whole cannibalism thing are excusable the actions of the americans however are in spite of everything they have been taught by society thus we see how uncivilized the civilized truly are the aforementioned heavyhandedness comes primarily from the last line of the film i wonder who the real cannibals are in case you know all the rape and murder in the last 90 minutes didnt spell it out clearly enough for you while the social commentary somewhat redeems this nasty short brutish thing of a film the generally low production quality bad acting and copious unstaged animal killings are sure to turn off all but the morbidly curious dont watch this movie unless you really feel like you need to see it it shouldnt interest all but the most hardcore of horror fans who have probably already seen it but if you are just getting into extreme horror movies go for it nothing i can say will deter you anyway,cruel
when i was in my early teens the first time i watched it uncut in the early 80s i actually thought it was a so called snuff film a film that actually show real killings of human beings this was of course not correct but since the movie was banned in norway and rumors went out of control i didnt know better not good for a kidbut you should know that this is an exploitation movie this includes animal cruelty killings and sexual violence if you cant live with that many cant dont watch this movie the movie is made to look like a documentary and therefore everything looks more genuine the story is very short what happened to some explorers who went into the jungle and second analyzing the film footage they made its following this horrible footage we will see what happened to them not very good things i can tell youas an adult i have to admit that i actually like this even though i could have lived without the obvious exploitation part but i guess that is also what makes it so bonechilling that something has actually been done inhumane in this movie and not only film tricks makes me think that am i really so immune to violence and gore to actually accepting to watch this sorry to say yesif you do accept watching this type of movies i think you will like this oneit looks genuine the directing is quite good considering what the movies goal is the acting is good to mediocre and the film quality is quite good later releasesagain if you have any problems with animal cruelty dont watch this if the movie is uncut and of course do not show this to young people even though when i was a kid i thought it was a snuff movie with the following nightmares i think it still would have made some scares to my atheist soul not knowing it to be sothis is not the worst exploitation movie made not even close but it is something in between i wont name the movies that are worse but i can say in my opinion that if you go further down this route exploitation movies the more hurt you can get like watching the poor actors who stars in them then its no longer acting at all in my opinionfor more info about the story of this movie read many of the other reviews here at imdb or search the internet i mainly want to first warn exploitationfilm virgins if i can call it that and secondly just say that i personally think its very good in that order8 out of 10 stars,cruel
first lets sum up the beginning of the film  4 american reporters accompanied by a local guide decide to go risk themselves into the tropical forest somewhere in south america obsessed with the idea of bringing a scoop back2 months later those 4 big mouthed hotshots are missing so the government decides to send there an american ethnology specialist with to help him a sort of badass rambo afraid of nothing and an indigenous who knows the tribes and the forest by heartthe films focuses on the professors travel and in parallel the footage shot by the american reporters this is the shocking part of the film  where you find out their methods to approach the local tribes this film is known as many people as a horror or gore film which is wrong of course there are some unbelievably violent scenes of animal killings or rapes but the real aim of this film is to denounce the modern methods of the reporters who are ready to do anything to amaze there is also a brilliant critic of the relation between occidental people and indigenous people to finish a word about riz ortolanis music  hes a genius  the superposition of violent scenes and a heavenly beautiful music just make this movie horrifying and unbelievable that youll have to watch one day,cruel
as ready as i thought i was to deal with the most controversial movie ever made after viewing this masterpiece it was quite apparent that i was not whatsoever prepared before even trying to collect my thoughts on what i had just seen i consulted the mirror to see what my eyes said about the experience i looked about as enthused as that muskrat must have felti have known about and wanted to see this movie for the longest time so when i saw that amazonca had it in stock i felt a purchase necessary thankfully i decided to view it online beforehand to see if it was really worth my money thank jesus i didnt waste my hardearned cash on this vile piece of garbagenow before i get into why i hate this movie i must point out that it does have a few things going for it for one the cinematography especially in the second half does a marvelous job of making the viewer feel uneasy secondly the musical score is quite remarkable and the manner in which it is juxtaposed with scenes of extreme cruelty is genius and makes the film that much more unsettling and i guess the story is interestingly told for the most part but thats where the good ends and the nausea beginshonestly except for the fact that almost every woman shown on screen is inevitably raped the human violence did not bother me that much in fact it seemed to be of the level of most gore oriented horror films of the time  nothing to write home about however the animal violence is so immensely vile that i think it sabotages the entire film and does not make the human violence any more realistic as for the crew members and natives supposedly eating the animals they killed  that is a lame excuse for what went down as its not so much the fact that seven animals were killed 30 years ago for a film that bothers me  its the loving detail in which this cruelty is captured on screen the voyeuristic camera lingers on the deaths of the animals yet most of the other significant violence is committed off screen this might have fooled people back in the day but it does nothing more than prove that deodato was a lazy bastard who had no regard for life todayi suppose in lieu of my response i cannot recommend this film to any one with a clear conscience even if you are a horror fan i dont think this is a must see i certainly wish id never seen it but if curiosity gets the best of you like it did me make sure for the love of god not to spend any money on it i am confident that you would regret such a decision,cruel
im assuming is most peoples first and last exposure to the infamous cannibal exploitation subgenre of italian horror films but there are many films like this and to be sure this is not the only one with scenes of animal torturewith that said i found this movie to be enjoyable but then according to a certain imdb commentator that makes me some sort of subhuman or cretin whatevercannibal films are not for the typical film watcher theyre for people into nasty and violent exploitation films and yes these films are often crudely made the acting isnt incredible etc but thats not why i watch drivel like thisits a good movie if you arent put off by the extreme torture sequences and in all honesty does make some pretty strong statements about the media as a whole in its portrayal of violence for fans of this also check out eaten alive not the wes craven film man from deep river jungle holocaust and of course the companion film cannibal ferox aka make them die slowly,cruel
the italian cannibal subgenre is obviously an acquired taste founded by umberto lenzi and eventually resurrected by bruno mattei but only a man named ruggero deodato would have the nerve to create a cannibal epic that would not only overshadow the ones before it but blow every single one after it out of the water is not only king of its respective bmovie subgenre but also the ultimate in disturbing exploitation if there is such a thing as a cannibal masterpiece here it is about a professor whos investigating the disappearance of an american film team who had wondered off into the depths of the amazon jungle hoping to film a documentary based on the rumors of a primitive tribe who may or may not have practiced cannibalism a sadistic bunch none of whom seem to have much respect for life only money and success and a passionate desire to keep on shooting no matter what once these morally corrupt sadists reach their desired destination they decide to have a little fun with the locals and madness ensues rapings burnings castrations and impailings will set the tone for the rest of this movie that most refer to as a shotgun blast to the senses as a horror movie is about as terrifying as it gets plunged into such a massive wilderness that you know very little about filled with tons of living things that want to kill you the ones most capable now have a very good reason and happen to know this place very very well kinda scary as shock cinema goes its quite simply the ultimate not even beyond the darkness can stand toetotoe with this beast some compare it to the blair witch project which always makes me chuckle even as a fan of this stuff i find it peculiar beyond words that there has ever been a fan base for something so blindingly vile as rough as things always end up in these atrocities they always turn out to be damn good movies plenty of adventure and suspense never really a dull moment to speak of more than plenty beautiful exotic scenery at all times not a lot to dislike other than the gruesome mutilations and if youre already amused by such a thing then i guess youve found yourself one hell of an entertaining movie anyone out there who might dig stuff shot on video dont miss bruno matteis 2003 sequelprequelremakeripoff the beginning for something worthwhile on the other hand check out deodatos jungle holocaust as for this one there could have always been more actual gore so perhaps only deserves 9 stars although those authentic animal killings tell me otherwise 810,cruel
i really enjoyed watching this movie i felt inclined to take a peek because i have heard around the web that some believed it was in fact a snuff film it was pleasing to the eyes how realistic the filming of this movie was although i do not condone animal abuse i thought it was a really fascinating event to watch people still hunt and kill animals for food to survive and although the director didnt mind the real animal slaughtering it was a good view on how savage people are i didnt really find the original film crew who we watched most of the time too great of people the men were too money hungry but again isnt it just human nature alan had a disgusting personality and it added to the extremity to the film was intensely disturbing and wrong and it made me love it even more i hold this movie one of the best ever made every scene that showed the suffering of humans you really felt it i cant believe how well it came out even knowing that the movie wasnt real i had that question in my head how can those actors make everything so real they cant be actors after watching this movie i was became apprehensive that i would not be able to enjoy any other horror film because nothing can top this masterpiece,cruel
well what do i say i have seen some horrible sick movies in my time and this has to be right up there with the most disturbing so you have seen some bad films eh cabin fever the hills have eyes wrong turn well forget them compared to those movies are the equivalent of highschool musical without giving too much away a group of amateur film documentry makers head out to the amazon jungle not the website to make a film on the local residentsbut on their journeys decide to treat the locals like crap and end up being dinner all i will say is that i have no idea if the animal mutilation scenes were real or not but if not they were the best effects i have ever seen 910 only dropped a point because i cant decide if the animal stuff is real or not,cruel
i dont know about you but i heard this film was out of control i heard it was the most disturbing movie you will ever see while i am sure this was true for when it was released its semistandard now this doesnt mean that its a good family flick it just means there is worse out there with that said there are still some bad things about this movie like rape that isnt particularly easy on the eyes the storyline took a surprising shock that is one thing i did not expect from the other reviews which surprises me i also really liked the setting of this film they did a good job of making you feel as if you were thereif you want to feel shocked go watch my all time favorite horror film inside,cruel
i first witnessed ruggero deodatos about 5 years ago so i was probably about 14 or 15 at that age i was just getting into mondoexploitationsexploitationsleazegoregiallo the list goes on 70s and 80s gore films this was among the first few along with nekromantik and suchthe film is almost 30 years old and if youre a youngin i doubt youll appreciate it much although im 19 at the moment of this review and ive loved it since the macabre day i laid eyes on itthe film has a unique and very eerie premise a group of young folk who are well known for their controversial documentaries the very disturbing clip from the last road to hellset out on a journey to whats referred to as the green inferno to study cannibal tribes in the wild the group dont return months later and soon a rescue team is sent out to find themamong the team is professor harold monroe mr chaco losojos and a guide to help them through the green inferno what they come to realize is that the cannibals are at first very hostile but are soon friendly in a way and only to discover during their journey a horrific and disturbing display of human and animal crueltymost of the movie after their discovery is lost footage of alan yates his girlfriend faye cameraman jack anders and their guide felipe in a world of mayhem and horrorthe film is extremely real most of the time and pretty disgusting and graphic rape scenes are not of the norm the violence is gory and horrific and there are several animals real animals that are butchered through the course of the filmwhats haunting to me at least is the end of the film the last ten minutes of footage seen through the lens from alan and the crew its horribly real and lingers in the back of your mind and it took me a while to shake it offthe message is quite simple who are the real savages the cannibals trying to live peacefully among other tribes in the wilderness minding their own or the civilized smart city folk of today who are scared of change and the different you make that judgment yourselfthis grueling horrifying and gruesome masterpiece gets a 910 watch at your own risk,cruel
wow what an amazing and original filmi had heard about this film once when looking up snuff films on the internet to see if any actually existed the director of ruggero deodato was arrested upon making it and charged with the murder of the main characters he had to actually bring the actors to court to prove to everyone that it was not a snuff film though it was for two squirrel monkeys a turtle a coatimundi a snake a spider and a pigi was very scared to watch this film but once it began and the gruesomness started it was like being on a ride i could not get off i had to see what happened nextit is a simple enough storyline a group of young documentary filmmakers go on an expedition to the heart of the amazon in search of primitive cannibal tribes in which to make a documentary they never return but their footage is found the film actually has quite a strong message for most of the film we wonder what must have happened in the jungle for the group to be murdered so savagely by the natives by the end of the film we realize that their gruesome and violent demise at the hands of the natives is just revenge for what they inflicted upon the natives alan yates and his crew had been savaging the savages murdering and even raping for the sake of sensationalism in their documentary the found footage ends up not being a documentary on the savagery of the natives but an exploration of the cruelty of the civilized world and how far they will go to get a good story they had gone to the jungle in search of a story and failing to find one interesting enough had created terrible situations in order to film them afterwards i actually had to look up how the special effects were achieved so that i could believe that the human deaths were not real it is quite a short film just over an hour and actually has a pretty damn good story line and a good message too it is a graphic commentary on sensationalism in documentaries and i am glad that i saw it though it is not for the faint hearted and is quite disturbing the only thing that really upsets me in the film is that there was actual animal cruelty it felt perverse to put that in a film as part of entertainment the last line of the film is sad and thoughtful harold monroe who found the groups footage having just watched the footage again walks out of a building and says with defeat in his voice i wonder who the real cannibals are the music for this film is also amazing it doesnt have the clich tribal drumming that a cannibal film easily could have gotten away with the music is beautiful and ironic and compliments the films dark themes and gory images in an almost sardonic way more horror films should have music like this i give this film nine stars out of ten because it got its point across i am still thinking about it and despite some minor qualms about animal cruelty it is really a fantastic film and i will watch it again some day but perhaps not for a while i would recommend this film to those who have not recently eaten lunch,cruel
as a die hard horror and exploitation fan i couldnt help but add to my list of viewing experiences what was delivered was certainly not what was promised by the many reviews i had read i am partly to blame for this since i made the rookie mistake of relying too heavily on marketing hype before viewing the film as a result my expectations were set too high after it was over i was literally asking myself that was it honestly i felt cheated in a wayhowever in all fairness is a good film with beautiful scenery a unique plot for its time period and one of the most electrifying musical scores in horror film history looking beneath the surface the subtle social commentary is what should have been used to push this film rather than the  allout inyourface exploitation flick as it is currently labeled even the animal torture scenes werent as shocking as i was led to believe although bad i have seen worse in slaughter house footage the message i took away from this movie is that despite how sophisticated our society has become there still remains a primitive side to mankind that has yet to evolve it forces you to rethink many of your political and social points of viewif you have yet to view i would suggest you do not read the internet hype and view the film objectively if you are looking for the hardcore gore fest this film is not for you for these fans i would suggest the traces of death series not to be confused with the inferior faces of death series after you view these films you will be jaded to anything you see from that point forward as this series holds nothing back i purchased the traces of death box set a few years ago and anytime i need my reality gore fix i pop one of these into the dvd player when it comes to exploitation nothing beats the real thing with that said was seemingly ahead of its time on many aspects but for most it is nothing you havent already experienced,cruel
this is a great movie the plot was great and reveling though to some it make no sense why those people were so cruel with those savages but i think it could be explained that they were afraid of them and felt being a potential diner for those savages also they probably went a little insane because of some events and some other things the only thing which i didnt like was a cruelty to animals isnt this ironic the makers of this film arent better than the characters of this film who were presented as evil people but still i can appreciate the rest of the film which was great they really shouldnt use animals if i knew that there will be shown some cruelty to animals filmed specially for this film i wouldnt watch it,cruel
was not something i exactly wanted to see and i didnt rush out out to buy it the day grindhouse releasing put out the uncut version on dvd but i kept hearing that it was a movie that if someone very interested in films or just in the most shocking in the realm of cult and exploitation this was something to see at least once its called the most notorious of its kind and after watching it tonight i can report that its not far from the truth it is shocking and horrifying and makes you feel about the human race that everything at base level is so barbaric that it might not be worth a damn but what could be just another schlockfest from a director who just wants to chuck crap up on the screen in the form of bad acting and blood and poor craftsmanship actually isnt whats served up on this level it way exceeded any expectations i had and is in fact one of the more satisfying exploitation pictures of the periodthis is mostly due in part to the dedication on part of ruggero deodato to actually tell a story reasonably well and to even throw in some biting however shallow commentary on the state of sensationalism on the news and how colonialism seems to repeat itself when the opportunity knocks with the wrong bunch of westerners the first half of the movie is told in a straightforward style shot without any amateurish meddling however in lowbudget form as a professor at nyu goes on a search with a couple of guides to locate a documentary film crew that went missing in the south american jungles from the outset were led to believe the worst has occurred that the film crew got slaughtered and eaten by a tribe of cannibal natives some pieces end up standing out as shocking already like a moment where we see how a man deals with an unfaithful woman but for the most part its relatively with only bits of action and terrorthe second half however is when things get ugly as the professor back in new york looks over the footage shot on 16mm by the crew and sees how things really went down is it perhaps a little much on the part of deodato to show how cruel and vicious and to a point fake the documentary filmmakers are in treating their subjects yes and no yes because of course it is exploiting the expectations of the audience and making it easy for us to not feel any sympathy for when the bloody realistic climax rolls around but not so much because he and his cast do it so convincingly this is unlike the more recent cloverfield where were made to feel sympathy for the characters but are not given much of a reason to do so on the outset of this docureal scenario and theres also a stark message underlying this which is cyclical in nature and without stating the very obvious last line that the professor makes at the end of the picture it is in fact a question of barbarismi should point out that even when is at its most effective its not any kind of great movie it left me shaken and stirred and a little repulsed sometimes a lot the turtle scene somehow really got to me more than anything if only for the time and detail spent in wallowing in it which was the correct decision based on the atmosphere but it is only as good or bad depending on view as it can be based on the action and lowbudget direction and makeup effects sometimes it is somewhat shoddy in production value or in talent but most of its flaws are supplemented by deodattos rigorous attempt at for one never making it boring which is crucial for an exploitation picture in retrospect and for also keeping the story focused and the continuing situation tense and bleak amid the shock value theres some things committed here that i dare not reveal but only so you can experience them yourself in all their fauxrealism that at the end of it all has a slight nasty satirical kick theres guts here no pun intended and its everything youve heard and then some  oddly enough also a welldirected picture despite the directors own ashamed though understandable feelings about the making of it today dont watch this alone,cruel
banned and heavily censored throughout the world here is a film that surpasses its reputation as a shotgun blast to the senses presents the found footage of four documentary filmmakers who experience brutal death at the hands of a savage south american tribe of flesheaters the footage is so intense so graphic and so unflinching in its realism that the director and producer of were arrested on its original release and the film was seized widely acknowledged as the uncredited inspiration for the blair witch project is essential to every video stores retail and rental selection this definitive version of deodatos masterwork ranks with the most highly anticipated and sought after dvd releases in the history of the medium not for the weak of stomach the films horrifying power cannot be denied be forewarned this is the one that goes all the way,cruel
i first heard about this film only a couple of weeks ago as a horror fan and a believer that there is not much left in the world that will shock me i wanted to see it to find out what all the controversy was about i went in knowing the basic plot and what i was going to see i thought either this movie is going to scar me for life or its going to be stupid as hell well im going with the latteri realize this is an exploitation film and perhaps the whole purpose of it is to shockdisturb so maybe you could say i should have known but after viewing it i felt like i should be ashamed for watching such garbage not because of any moral code an extreme sensitivity to bad subject matter or anything comparable to that i just feel like it was disgusting simply for the sake of being disgusting and not even in a good way  as i can think of plenty of films that have grossed me out  but i still enjoyed them and felt they had some intrinsic value in the end the film clearly had a point to make  having the viewer question who the real savages are this could have been a powerful message but it was lost due to the never ending onslaught of horrific scenes i suppose that discussing world issues was not the main reason this film was made but nonetheless i feel it comes across as contradictory to have a serious issue presented alongside such disgusting scenes and it leaves you feeling as mixed up as you are sicki am not an animal rights activist but i feel that the animal scenes were a bit much i also thought the repeated rape theme was overdone as an animal lover and a woman you might think these scenes bothered me simply because of those facts but as mentioned i think i am pretty open minded and not overly bothered by these subjects but now and again a line gets crossed and even the most liberal person questions the taste of thingsif theres one thing ive learned from this film its that this sort of cinema is probably not for me i was going to give it one star but figure maybe two is more realistic not that it matters much between the two deep down i feel i hated it but i could see that it might have some enjoyment value for other people i mean there were times during the film when i just had to laugh at the pure insanity of what was going on i guess that counts for something,cruel
wow what can i say about this outstanding film well to start it is definitely not meant for kids for there is many sex and nude scenes throughout the film and no its no just the cannibals there are also rape scenes which is definitely something a kid should not watch this is the most violent and disturbing movie i have viewed but it is not something to vomit over of course i never thought anything was disgusting from faces and traces of death to faces of gore ive seen them all still if you are new to extremely violent films i suggest you start out a little less then this one the deaths are so realistic i couldnt tell the difference if you told me it was real death scenes the gore is way surpass its time of 1980 the director must of worked night shifts to make that gore look so realistic the movie also has a nice and easy to follow plot you can never get bored with this movie you will find yourself watching the whole film even if you cant take the gore so to sum it all up i recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18 maybe even 16 younger then that i really dont think this film is something for you to watch,cruel
extreme violence rape gore blood voyeurism made it unbelievable but truth this film will stay in the history of cinema because of its violence i saw an awful lots of horror movies but this one is not like the other ones actually i dont think i would be able to take it in a movie theater but in the comfort of the home this is a guilty pleasure deodato managed so well with his camera camera is actually the hero here the camera films everything including death of poor animals will stay in memory because it got it all as grindhouse dvd says well i was lucky enough to get the ec dvd uncut brilliant printing and above all the sound is nearly perfect wont be the same without such a brilliant score  riz ortolani did for ch as john williams did for star wars ch is bad but so great ,cruel
is quite possibly the most hated and controversial films ever made banned in over 50 countries and accused of being a snuff film was in hot water with governments and censors for awhile many hate it and some love it but there is no one in between i happen to fall into the love it category for many reasonsthe movie begins with a tv program about four documentary makers who go missing  alan yates director faye daniels script girl and alans fianc and mark tomasso and jack anders both cameramen nyu anthropology professor harold monroe heads to the amazon to lead the search team they witness disturbing and shocking rituals by all three local tribes after gaining some trust with the yanomanos monroe discovers that the documentary makers had been killed frustrated with the yanomanos hostility and brutality monroe trades the groups footage possessed by the yanomanos for a tape recorder back in new york he views the material and discovers who the real savages are as the film starts out we feel sorry for these four who for the sake of information go into the jungle for research only to be savagely mutilated by brutal primitives however we come to realize that the natives were the victims of civilized society by being tortured and exploited in incredibly disgusting and inhumane ways by the group mainly the three males which ultimately lead to their demises in the most brutal climax ever filmedpulls no punches there is no escape from the atrocities that occur this movie holds to date some of the sickest acts of sexual violence violence and animal deaths six in total all on screen and all very graphic this being the main reason for its controversy and hateaside from all the violence and gore there is some great acting an amazing score beautiful cinematography and a story with a powerful albeit not subtle messageunlike most italian cannibal movies the acting in this isnt corny or clichd its quite good the intelligent script really helps the actors as well riz ortolanis serene yet disturbing score is played throughout the movie and it really increases the impact of some scenes the shots of the jungle are beautiful the perfect mask for the horrors that occur inside the second half of the movie has some amazing scenes in fact some of the best cinematography the story plays out rather simply but packs a very powerful and meaningful message the last line who were the real cannibals summaries it nicelykudos should go to ruggero deodato for his daring direction he is brave enough to keep the camera rolling on some of the most horrific acts of murder and rape something which todays directors seem to lack bravery to be daringas i said before this is one of my favourite horror movies it is disturbing and immensely powerful and it pulls no punches it shall be interesting to see the remake in 2009 as i personally dont see how this can be remade45,cruel
i will not assign a rating because i simply cant i dont think anyone can really i can rate most if not all other films because there is a basis upon which i can rate them and i fear that i may be rating this too high or too low if i was to rate it this comment is not a review but rather a record of my thoughts on the filmi think is a mess of a film i didnt find the gore scenes particularly convincing as a matter of fact they all looked pretty fake with a couple of exceptions i didnt like the much heralded score and frankly found it illchosen and misplaced to the point of being humorous in most scenes though eerily effective in a few others the acting was very fake and silly and frankly more than a little annoying with the exception of ciardi as faye daniels and yet i cant deny that achieves exactly what it set out to do it is a harrowing experience thats the word experience it never really set out to do what films do tell a story make a point or simply entertain so i personally cannot consider a film this is the definitive controversial film and i doubt any other film can bring about such strong and heavy emotions in everyone in a sense this is commendable what films can claim to even get a reaction out of every last person who watches them i cant imagine and seriously doubt there was anyone anywhere at any time who saw this and said meh its impossible really you will have a reaction to i dont think that the screenplay direction cinematography acting or score are enough for me to call this a good film heres why i cant give this a rating people seem to rate this film two waysa if i was to rate this film based on how i personally felt about it as many have done i would give it a 110 b if i was to rate this film based on how well it accomplished its goal as many have done i would give it a 1010the issue is it deserves neither of those ratings it is powerful and disturbing and if thats all it intended to do then it is a massive success its harrowing and sickening in a way that no other films are however its narrative is a mess and the subplot with the people watching the fauxdocumentary footage is both unnecessary and amazingly hypocritical theres nothing wrong with the films music but the way it is used is questionable the acting is not particularly good heres what i dislike about it most it is simply unnecessary there was no reason for this to exist and there never will be and there was most certainly no reason for me to watch it and frankly im a little sorry i did i hated this film but wasnt that the point after all,cruel
so many people have written about that it seemed futile to write another review when there were already so many of them but the film impressed me so much that i want to give my personal view of itis said to be a very violent film and in fact it is but there are many violent films especially the american ones featuring lots of blood explosions streets paved with corpses and so on but the violence in american films is stylised it almost resembles a video game play  the films are predictable and follow fixed rules and in the end the good guys always win this kind of violence doesnt shock it entertainson the other hand shows directly whats going on  violence is a part of life the film is raw  there are no good and bad characters  and the handheld cameras enhance the feeling of reality i was so engrossed that i forgot that i was seeing actors in a film and this is no easy feat when i saw for instance the man who would be king by john huston the story of two english adventurers that become kings of a savage african tribe it never left my mind that i was seeing a film but in you feel things happening  a constant tension a feeling of urgency fills the filmthe soundtrack of riz ortolani is magnificent and helps to enrich the strength of the images sound and visuals work hand in glove in sometimes extremely violent images are underlined by a soft and melancholic musical score producing a feeling of estrangement and perplexity it it the brechtian distancing technique or is it the lyrical glorification of violence i think that it is none of them all i can say that its disturbing and beautifulthe exteriors were shot in leticia a small colombian village deep in the amazonian jungle deodato and his team lived in small huts connection with the nearest city could be made only by airplane  they were on their own surrounded by the green jungle heat snakes mosquitoes rain they were shooting a film about cannibalism and the friendly indians in the neighborhood were used to play the role of the cannibals far from home inside the heart of darkness to tell a tale of horror and darkness tensions mounting one day some people in deodatos team went to a canoe trip through the river they landed on a shore they left a skull half buried in the mud and one of the members of the team casually discovered it and said aloud look what i have found francesca ciardi the filmmaker faye daniels in the film had a nervous breakdown and remained in a state of shock for some days no wonder deodato was in command but even if he was forceful according to robert kerman he knew how to work with other people weather conditions lack of equipment or money made it necessary to change or cut scenes every new day could bring new changes they were in an unknown land working in precarious conditions with many inexperienced actors i mean the indians only passion for their job could hold them together interviews in the dvd released by grindhouse that is why the film has such a spontaneous feel to itone can say that mondo cane was the father that inspired deodato but the grandfathers name is rossellini rossellini filmed roma citta aperta with few resources and had to improvise in order to finish the film a small story the priest pietro pellegrini and his work for the resistance was enlarged  other characters were added and in the end there was a long feature film roma citta aperta a film that amazed the world because it felt true  it gives a living picture of the last days of the german occupation of rome the same cant be said for is of course a sploitation film and its aim was to make cash the film is not a documentary and is not concerned about the truth indians and jungle are portrayed in a somewhat stereotyped way but was really filmed in the jungle and the indians were in a way just playing their own roles one can see that they are at ease  at home so they act convincingly very convincingly i should say deodatos passionate vision filters through the film  in the middle of the jungle they were much on their own they had to improvise and they were able to give us this powerful and beautiful film  very cruel very desperate very human,cruel
spoiler nearly twenty years before the blair witch project was found we were assaulted by another kind of discovered footage im finally sitting down to write my review for ruggero deodatos much talked about mockumentary and i have mixed feelings the premise is that four documentary filmmakers went into the jungle to study cannibals and never returned a college professor is hired to track them down and find out what happened he finds their corpses and the footage they shot before their deaths we are led to believe that the poor youngsters were murdered by the savages but all is not what it seems the footage reveals the mystery layer by layer and we see who the real savages are thats the movie in a nutshell minus the outrageous violence and animal torture of course i know deodato had something to say here he makes this crystal clear by the films closing lines i wonder who the real cannibals are i just feel he could have got his point across without the slaughtering of innocent animals i found this part of the film to be indeed tasteless as good as the effects in this film are they could have faked it deodato himself supposedly regrets it and i hope that is true i hate to say this but i feel umberto lenzi accomplished the social commentary much better in cannibal ferox even if he was ripping deodato off at least lenzi threw in some sympathetic characters its hard for me to watch a movie with no identifiable characters as far as the gore is concerned it wasnt as graphic as i had expected after hearing about a movie for almost 10 years your imagination runs wild there are a couple of scenes that are indeed disturbing but i feel like he was trying to push the limits for the sake of pushing the limits there comes a point where it becomes too much i found it to be almost boring it became how many minutes can they drag this rapetorture out instead of wow this is shocking im a fan of gore but by the end of the film i was completely desensitized to it and thats probably a testament to our civilized society being ever bit as primitive and cruel as the cannibals i feel is not to be completely dismissed as simply barbaric and nasty because wed be missing the point however that point could have been made and been just as powerful in a different manner,cruel
horror exploitation bgrade can bgrade actually be truly horrific especially when dubbed i dont think so especially when bhorror plays like a bporno check your genre definitions at the door this was an 80s romp that probably had no small part in spawning blair witch crew go into the woods film gore die tape is retrieved horror here the slick towers and achievement of new york are deliberately cast against the supposed savagery of the jungle cannibals a crew of right idiots make an amateur docoslashfest in the amazon they get nekkid they torch villages and rape n kill they film their antics they ball theyre surrounded slashed and eaten and a nearly legitimate professor of anthropology goes back to the scene salvages the film which the exploitation hacks in ny wanna beam to the jaded masses 80s cynicism with deplorably brate gags and a lilting dissonantly pretty soundtrack theme its amazing how they got the tribes to agree to filming this little jaunt in the jungle they look like they dont mind getting into the pigs livers or whatever they are the guileless savagery of the doco team was probably the scariest of all like you think youre so civilised with your technology and gi brainsmarts and depraved recklessness as though deodato was going for the heaviest metaphor he could think of to contrast the relative calm of the tribe with the idiocy of the west every second observation was about strange sexual customs ultimately the title is misleading i mean in terms of sheer numbers 5 or 6 people for lunch and dinner is hardly a human holocaust its more of a cannibal incident really and despite the great transfer and usually good image quality this romp mightve benefited more from a vietnam or goingupriver angle obvious metaphoric contrasts work better against a climate of human despair or inner corruption that is psychology  bgrade and psychological depth obviously dont mix stick to aguirre der zorn gottes rino breebaart,cruel
this movie has gained a heck of a reputation worldwide and not without reason its extremely violent but in comparison to other italian horror movies this one has many aspects that make it very interesting im not a fan of italian horror i find mostly of these movies boring cheap and almost every one has the same atypical style repeated over and over but there are exceptions and is one of them this move has everything it takes to make a good horror movie an interesting story atmosphere a great soundtrack and great goreeffects like you never seen before this one has some scenes that will stay with your mind for a long time watch it and whatever youre gonna think of it you will have one hell of a movie experience,cruel
this is another in the long line of films that you hear so much about that if you are at all curious you have to seei bought a copy off of ebay after having downloaded a version a year agoi only skipped through the downloaded copy to see if what all of the reviews were saying was truefor the most part the reviews were right this is a pretty disturbing film the thought of cannibalistic tribes existing is not a pleasant thought some of the images are a bit shocking there is no question there are scenes of animals being killed while this is a common occurrence and is something that can be seen on the discovery channel it seems a little too much as it is presented here yes the tribes had to live off of food they caught and killed its just a bit too much to include for the sake of a filmthere is also a lot of rape and brutalization of women in one gruesome scene an adulterous woman gets raped with a stone has mud stuffed into her and is bludgeoned to death with the same stone in another scene a pregnant tribe member literally has a fetus pulled from her and then the fetus is buried in the mud the woman is then stoned by other female villagersthe cannibal scenes themselves are not the most gory part of the film yes the tribes do eat human meat but they are not ripping and gnawing at anyone as you might expect the fate of the original camera crew is indeed brutal and in fact was partly brought on by the way they treated the natives the four americans did savage and provoke the tribes into further violent behavior not to excuse cannibalism by any means but as professor monroe says i wonder who are the savages i found it hard to feel any sympathy for the documentary film crew they were a pretty idiotic bunch and as stated previously they treated the tribes terribly prof monroe was easy to side with as he clearly saw that the concern over the film crew was overshadowing their nasty behavior and lust for making a groundbreaking film it was only towards the end of the film that i could sympathize with faye as she was the only one with any conscienceone thing i found so odd about this film was the soundtrack the theme playing during the opening and closing credits seemed a little too happy for such a serious movie as for the rest of the music it was great and fit very well with the feel and look of the filmall in all not a bad film deodato did a great job with the jungle locations though the editing was a bit choppy pretty much what i expected after reading the hyperating 6 out of 10,cruel
i feel that this film may not be the best one ever made in fact its flawed at times howeverin its complete uncut form it remains to be one of the most disturbing and shocking horrors i have ever seen although the depictions of animal cruelty are disturbing and sadly genuine it still remains as a horrific element of a horrific film although i think that cruelty to animals is wrong i put this aside while watching the film and concentrated on the affect that the director had in mindbefore seeing the film i had been warned by numerous people that no matter how much i was sure i knew what i was in for i still was going to be horrified the opposite was the case when the opening credits rolled the different strokes style opening music dont ask its just what it reminded me of got me in a good mood and i found the opening to be rather slow things naturally changed this film isnt notorious for nothing i dont wish to harp on about the different scenes of depravity and animal slaughter but its necessary if one needs to see why director ruggero deodato decided to make his slaughterfest in such a way why would a movie be made with such emphasis on the close up on the genuine dissection of an animal in my mind it is the point of view that we are being shown that is relevant to the statement of the film there is the obvious idea that the real monsters in the film are not the cannibals but the filmmakers who rape and murder their way through the jungle but one needs to look at what we are actually watching it is the footage found of the filmmakers therefore it is what they themselves thought would be the most interesting footage i dont feel that the film is as horrific as the levels to which a human being can stoop for their own personal gain this is the core of the film shock factor in my mind the music although very dated strikes a chord no pun intended the eerie eighties screeching synthesiser makes the images seem more horrifying as it is an inescapable atmosphere that the music wraps you in the music during the most graphic scenes is a repeat from earlier in the film it is the overture so to speak and the repetition reminded me of a time less than a few short minutes ago where i was safely watching a normal gorefest and had since then been thrown into this mad world of hedonism and evilwhat was most unusual about my experience with deodatos holocaust as it may be with yours is that it took me some time to realize what i had just watched normally a film stays with you for some time and this is no exception but i walked out of the theatre knowing that i had just finished watching one of the sickest things ever but it took time for the images to sink in a few hours later i felt exhausted as if i had been on some odyssey of exploitation even for those of you who think your hardcore just remember you have been warned,cruel
 may contain some spoilers  i am a huge fan of the italian horror subgenre of the 70s and 80s and is one of the best films to come from that it is known as the most controversial film of all time and is highly dissed by many for its disturbing gore real animal violence and graphic sexual violence but this film is one of my favorite horror films ever not only because of its unflinching realism but also its stunning direction good story and one of the best scores ive ever heard the film starts of pretty good with robert kerman traveling to the jungle in search of a missing documentary team there he discovers a tribe of cannibals who have the documentary teams missing footage which is right with the teams remains he manages to leave with the footage which he brings back to new york and that is when the real show starts we get to watch the teams footage and see how they met their deaths at the hands of the cannibals definitely a shocking film not for the squeamish or any animal activists great movie i give it a 910 the only reason i dont give it a 1010 is because you cant recommend it to peopleat least not normal people but if your looking for a good cannibal movie this is the best,cruel
having watched films like cannibal ferox 1 and 2 and other mediocre cannibal movies i finally got to watch this one too came across an uncut dvd version from nepal i just had to get it must say i was surprised and impressed the cannibal scenes are truly authentic considering the film is 25 years old and the story never lets goacting so so but never mind but im completely against the violence against those poor animals there was no need for that especially the turtle scene which is said to be a real one hopefully its not true however a good 8 for the film and a 10 for the scoreprobably the most realistic film of its kind,cruel
i first heard about when i was a young girl my mother was obsessed with horror movies and thought that this particular one was brilliant well after 12 years of wanting to see it i finally did last night my initial reaction while watching it was that it was boring it took a long time to become interesting it also jumped from one scene to another without any kind of link the acting was not the best ive seen and i became so disinterested in it that i was contemplating turning it off thank god i did not because the last half an hour was so good that i almost forgot about the dreary first half the pace quickened and the scenes which i had heard about when i was young appeared before me in fact it was so good that if the whole movie had been filmed in a documentary style it could have been believable that those atrocities had actually happened so although it had a slow start the movie lived up to its bad reputation and was well worth the wait 710,cruel
there are 3 kinds of people the first kind wants to see because they want to see gore full frontal nudity and violence the second type wants to see this flick because its a cult classic with a social message the third kind doesnt want to see this movie because they think theyll be disgusted but they watch it nevertheless and end up vomiting and fainting ok theres also the fourth kind people who just dont give a damn and will never see this movie i thought i belonged to the first type but during watching this movie it became clear to me that this movie is much more than a horrifying movie yes it has a message yes it makes you think there are a lot of sick movies who just please the filthy minds of psycho perverts movies like guinea pig etc but please dont compare ch with that kind of crap my comments are kind of vague i know but i dont want to spoil the fun watch it think about it  ps although this movies intentions were against american exploitation i think its far more then just american television i think we all can learn a lesson from this flick ,cruel
wellive finally seen one of the most controversial movies ever made and so what do i thinklets see is one of those movies where you actually dont want to watch it but at the same time you do i guess curiosity leads to this sort of thing in particular my first impression of the film from reading all these posts and comments on imdb was that this movie would scar me mentally and socially when in fact this did not happen as i am an avid movie watcher and can generally keep an open mind when it comes to seeing these type of moviesfirst off the concept of this movie is great it is quite intriguing to see how the people in the movie deal with the intensity and sadisitic nature of cannibalistic tribes but yet the movie falls flat on its face with the brutal torture and rape scenes especially the scene with the turtle i would not recommend the movie to all of you softhearted people as watching it will ultimately contradict your beliefs and morals in a very aggressive nature however if youre in to the bgrade italian cannibal movies of the 70s and 80s then i guess this is what youve been waiting forim not really as picky as roger ebert and usually try and emphazise more on the positives of a movie rather than the negatives so realistically i will give a 5 i would also not recommend buying it on ebay like some crazy people do but if you do end up watching it make sure you have a barf bag with you just in case510,cruel
just to let you know unlike typical italian fashion italy finally edited a new clean dvd version with original english dialogues and original italian dubbing directors comment and interviews with director set designer dir of photography music composer and one of the actors it also features a little joke at the start of the film but wont spoil the surprise what many noticed over and over is true the film is still actual far ahead modern and now that it has been cleaned up it really looks like done right now not 20 years ago now you realize how innovative its filming and editing techniques were the steady cam has yet to be invented it is true from apocalipse now to blair witch project all learned from itand no it is not a horror film as everybody is classifying it it is a sort of dramatized documentary deodato is just showing real existing environment real existing lifestyle real killing of animals not humans as it happens every day in those places he is not simply exploiting he is demonstrating once and never again hopefully what happens every day in other countries on the earth where do you think your grilled chicken or roasted lamb comes from our lobsters rabbits pigs served on a dish are treated in the same way as the monkeys or the turtles so what is shocking a single killing scene in this film or the thousand eternal killings going on forever behind the clean walls of industrial butchers and romantic farms in the beauty of your country one plus point to dedramatize these poor animals have been definitively used as food after the scenes joyfully eaten by natives and crew also to mention even if everything looks so real who says the acting is bad is bwproject better both cast and crew filmed in a very familiar relaxed situation they had fun doing the film which doesnt mean they entertained themselves with torture or nudity and they believed seriously in this project with their heart they took advantage of the set the people their traditions the weather conditions its real handcraft made movie with some naiveties and little mistakes but powerful like it doesnt exist anymorebut why do not see it from another positive point of view these animals i tell you i wouldnt even kill a flyhave died for a moral ethical cause to underline together with the realistically recreated human tortures as counterpart and justice the cruelty of the civilized world to emphasize the message that the victimizers we all will suffer one day by the hand of our victims and die in the same way till justice and balance will be restoredi must recognize our deodato is foreshadowing the tragic evolution of our civilization all the killings we see in the news today the war ww2 is far away but vietnam is still hanging around and other have yet to come the cruelty hate exploitation and cheap entertainment in our modern world is present in this film accompanied by a bitter sad mourning musical comment you will never forget againa bitter genuine masterpiece,cruel
of all films ever made this is the lowest most depraved attemptnay act of lunacy ever mistaken for distributable motion picture it is offensive to all people on all levels and in all possible manners purely wrong whoever would consider that it would be entertaining to see a native woman skewered through on a wooden stake or see a foetus torn from a womans stomache or the numerous animals that were actually killed for the movie should be committed for life or executed why they would think somebody might enjoy seeing a closeup of a castration or a hut full of people burned alive or numerous people blugeoned throughout the movie is beyond me the lowlifes that made this film are without any moral fiber whatsoever so dont miss this one its a classic 5 out of 5 stars,cruel
first off i was rather shocked with this film and it wasnt because of the violence  its because it was so well made  this is honestly a great movie with a very meaningful story if you can take the chance to see through all of its genuinely disturbing factors  there are no less than five scenes of rape all of them utterly convincing and quite impactful  the scenes of human dismemberment are simply the best that i have ever seen in any film there is also considerable animal cruelty with the death of a muskrat turtle and pig to name a few  and now on to the reviewstarts out with a professor going in search of a crew of four documentary filmmakers who were documenting cannibals in the amazonia after getting together with two guides professor monroe locates the remains of the film crew and their film canisters  he is successful in convincing the tree people to give him the canisters and returns to new yorkonce in new york he and a group of producers watch the crews footage and realize all to well why the cannibals killed them  there are scenes of the crew huddling a group of natives into a hut and burning it raping an innocent native girl as well as shooting the natives just for the sake of media recognition  but they soon turn from the hunters to the prey as the cannibals capture each of them and kill them  it is then decided that the film should be destroyedthis is a powerful film  the mockdocumentary footage is suitably realistic and the actors never fail to portray their characters just as they should as i said earlier the special effects crew new what they were doing and have created the most convincing gore effects that i have ever seen  and unlike most films of the same genre holocaust holds its own in skilled acting as well as direction  make no assumptions this is indeed a disturbing film  but it is also a great film and i recommend it to anyone who thinks they can handle seeing it,cruel
this film is definately overrated the film itself is excellent but due to all the hype i was expecting an all out bloodbath and wall to wall gore but it only had a few violent scenes anyone looking for gore would be better off watching braindead or terror firmerall in all its a great film the acting is very well done it is kind of like the blair witch project1999 as it is shot from a documentry point of view but i felt they could have left out the scenes in new york where he people are watching the documentry footage as this took us out of the realism of the documentry and reminded us it was just a film which leaves the viewer feeling reassured but then again it is not an all out horror flick and more of a view on the filmmakers themselves and how they change whilst out with the cannibalsi give it 810 for a good quality film top special effects brilliant acting an original idea a kick ass song a totally unnecassary scene of a naked man swimming with native women and a scene of a man getting his penis cut off,cruel
watching ch was all but fun i by now still do not understand how a movie team could cope with taking those real shots they are for real of mutilation and killing of animals i am no vegetarian though and judged myself as a horrorsplatter fan ever since the point i like in horror movies is the amount of phantasy involved  stuff that is taken out of bad dreams that visualizes and makes use of our deep fears  by story or gore effects anyway it has to be creative and inspired to please me ch is quite far from this the massive decrease of distance to the shown scenes that is achieved by the movies documentary style makes it hard getting through  but does not touch the problem i got with this movie  since other films like blair witch project just live by this effect its more the simple plot the thoughtless primitive message which is presented as mass media critics hough  it are mainly the other elements of the movie next to the gore that make me sick there was obviously no work involved in setting these up  it is just showing pure shocking scenes to the viewer  and thats it this way ic could probably agree in judging it as a piece of art a bordercrossing opportunistic piece of st that exactly gives the audience what it demands  which i would like but to do this there should consequently be be no plot borderstory or other surrounding these just give a cheap reason an excuse for the shocking material and it seems like many people simply catch this message up without spending a thought this movie is not entertainment its a viewing experience i guess a snuff film has to offer in fact it is snuff concerning the animal scenes so if you are into horror movies  do not think ch is just another one theres no monster no dramaturgy nor story or fantasy elements the gore scenes do not show creativity but just look real  and you probably know that the entertaining quality of reality is not that big  but disgusting judge it a pleasure to take out your cat ripping every single part out of her while she is still alive  then this is your movie an extreme piece of st so do not watch this for entertainment reasons  if you are not into snuff this one is no pleasure but disgusting if you agree that real gore is sick skip this one excuse my broken english  had to say this though,cruel
incredibly frustrating to watch  i mean the actors are carved out of balsa wood as big a fan as i am of gratuitous nudity do we need everybody to shuck out of their shorts including the professor  and big chunks of dialogue were apparently written by somebody with a length of rebar lodged in their skull  who are the real cannibals indeedbut lordie when deodato hits his groove this thing rocks  several viewers have mentioned blair witch  how about blair witch crossed with begotten  the jungle sequences in the first sixty minutes in particular are gorgeously shot the premise beautifully established and this sillyass splatter film you rented suddenly starts looking like a major work of artistic creationpossible spoiler for the artistically sensitivewell deodato loses control for about ten minutes  hes not skilled enough to convince us that the first film crew is actually capable of coldbloodedly going to the lengths they do to phony up a documentary  it would have worked a lot better if theyd at least started out fudging a few shots rather than making the whole documentary up from scratch but amazingly he finds it again and in the final sequences in the jungle he gives a clinic on cathartic violence that only straw dogs approaches so if coppola can rerelease a recut apocalypse now why cant deodato have another shot at including shucking the driveinfriendly title  hes ten minutes away from a masterpiece instead of an exceptionally welldone splatter film  incidentally i trust that all those who find the turtlekilling and similar scenes to be shocking are vegetarians,cruel
if you decided to read my review you are probably already interested enough to know what this film is aboutthe plot is truly original  actually everything about this movie is great but one thing completely stands out in the moviethe score  the score was composed by riz ortolani  everything about the soundtrack is beautiful  it goes from being very haunting to emotional and sad or simply just beautiful  fits in with the movie all the way  the main theme is one of the best songs ever probably wouldve been a hit if wasnt so fearedi saw this movie about two months ago and decided to write a review about it now because i was speechless back when i just viewed it and i still dont have much to say  simply its a great movie  if you have the chance to get your paws on this movie grab it  watch with caution this film is very violent but is something anybody will be able to sit throughone question i have is what happened to all the actors  they only played in a couple of films besides this  they were terrific  also does anybody have guitar tabs the main theme  once again i love that song  if you can answer one of my two questions please email me thank you1010,cruel
is one of the most hated but unfortunately misunderstood movies in the world the rape  revengethriller i spit on your grave is another example for such an erroneous belief were people only judged the things they saw but missed the point in any way in comparison to other cannibal movies which deliver only sadistic showmanship ruggero deodatos film has a real message it shows how far people would go for money and a piece of fame television reporter alan yates is willing to rape to torture and to kill innocent natives even to sacrifice his friends his girlfriend and his own life for a sensational story in this way is a cynical statement on every kind of yellow press but its also a film about the conflict between nature and civilization about the arrogance of urban people towards those primitive natural tribes the combination of an adventure movie in the first half and a blair witch projectlike shocker that was shot with a handheld camera in the second half make being one of the most unique films ever made people with weak nerves weak stomachs and a conservative imagination of moral  however should avoid it because this flick contains a galore of brutality that gets out of hand blood guts rape castrationabout harming and killing real animals animals that had to die for this movie were an anteater a pig a monkey a snake and a black widow especially the beheading of a living giant turtle and the following dissection are extremely shocking disgusting and disturbing i heard various rumors about the animal scenes the one says that an animal welfarist has always been around the set others say that director deodato had to take responsibility in court finally its exactly this snuff fake or not that gives this movie his bad reputation and an unpleasant taste to this otherwise great film 910,cruel
truly a work of arthow often can it truly be said that a movie is totally unique and innovative  i realize that its not the first of its kind but it is clearly the best of its kind  i have seen many mondo shockumentary movies and nothing else even comes close  i still dont know how some scenes were accomplished  it is no wonder that so many people thought the film to be a real documentary  its reality is unsurpassed  five stars ten out of ten  two thumbs up,cruel
this was real hard core horror  blair witch looks like disney movie beside this some of the scenes were so real that i thought that they were realthe animal action was definitively real this movie is not for the weak hearted  1010,cruel
19979 and the last house on the left1972 are two films that the marquis de sade would have done had he lived today as a filmmaker one group of people look at this a boring pointless and a piece of trash another group sees it as a compelling piece of cinema  i believe that its uncompromising in its display of violence by the civilized person is one of the gutist films to ever be made in the history of moving picturesit was inspired by violent events that plagued the italian scene during the 1970s  creates a powerful look in the negative aspects of sensationalistic journalism  there are elements of de sade that are present in here  one element is the presence of sexual perversity another element is the idea that the strong is always victorious over the helpless and weakit was ruggero deodatos followup to an earlier cannibal effort called jungle holocaust1978  this was banned in italy during the early 80s and is still banned to this day  is one of the most censored and cut films in the history of world cinema  the only thing negative about this movie was the killing of actual animals  the film was confiscated by the police because of thisdirecting the infamous classic proved such an emotional draining experience for the the director that he has stated that he would never do a 2  it would prove to be ruggero deodatos crowning achivement was to the cannibal sub genre as zombie was to the living dead subgenre in italy  1979 deserves to be compared with werner herzogs aguirrethe wrath of god1974 and francis ford coppolas apocalypse now1979  in many ways its a cannibal version of the last house on the left1972the first half begins with the announcement of four missing documentary filmmakers  a rescue and retrieve team led by professor monroe is sent to find the missing people  he hooks up with an expert guide who leads him through the jungle and swamps  the remains are discovered by the team as monroe is chasing a bunch of naked women  finally after gaining the natives trust professor monroe is given the documentary footage to return home withthe second half focuses on the footagethis is where the controversy begins  the documentary team are seen going through the jungle before and after their guide dies of poison  they go on to burn and kill a village full of women and children  after commiting a few more horrific acts the filmmakers are given their just deserts by one of the cannibal tribes the film climaxes with the material being ordered to be destroyed by the producersthis is a feature film that will not be something that hollywood is anxious to remake  it is one of the top grossing films japan  allegedly this was one of sergio leones favorite films  for a horror flick it is well made and professionaly filmed  the death scenes of many of the characters were done with tons of realism that the director had to go to court to prove that the actors werent really deadthe whole scenes of filming are just as disturbing as the camera scenes in peeping tom1960 and the murder of an entire family on video in henryportrait of a serial killer1986  there is an anarchistic tone that dominates the entire screen  the ritual scenes involving adultery and abortion gives hints of the tribual laws of the cannibals  the scene of the mai li type massacre is very indictive of the brutality by the western culture towards other cultures  the death of faye daniels is the most painful thing to watch as she was the only one to sympathize withher fate is the cruelest one of all the filmmakersthe directors of the blair witch project have denied seeing this is something that i find hard to believe  deodatos followup would the the equally despised la casa sperduta nel parcothe house on the edge of the park1980  has yet to be released on home video in the united states  the most available print is 95min although i have a feeling that the original cut was probably about 140 to 180 minutes long  the cinetopgraphy is excellent and the film score is memorablethere was a well known scene that supposedly does not exist called the pirhana scene  i believe that the message the filmmakers tried to make was delivered through its visual disturbences  1979 was written by granfranco clerici who was also known for his contribution to other controvosial works such as lucio fulcis dont torture a duckling1972 the new york ripper1982 plus other ruggero deodato efforts like jungle holocaust1978 and the house on the edge of the park1980 it would be a perfect movie to be shown on a double feature with pier paolo pasolinis salo120 days of sodom1975  is a disturbing gut wretching and sick motion picture that should be viewed by mature and open minded viewers,cruel
is in my opinion a great movie this one will have you at the edge of your seat compared to other goremovies the story is ok and the message is brought over in an extreme but clear wayand for all the guys who complain about the animalkilling take a look at your highway where every day thousands of cows and pigs are being transported under miserable conditions thats torture i give this one 1010,cruel
this movie made me an instant fan this is probably the sickest movie you will ever see unlike a lot of horror movies with reputations of being sick this one actually deserves it with animals actually mutilated at least three rapes scenes cannibals ripping out guts one castration scene gratuitous full frontal nudity drug use and more the director was in either court or jail on obscenity charges for the next few years after this movie came out,cruel
what would you like me to say about this film its not the goriest film ever made but the very ideas and in its schlocky detail it has to be said that it is quite sick having said this it did make for an interesting if not disturbing viewing  you learn why films like this are banned the documentary style was innovative and worked wonders in giving the film a more realistic edge credit has to be given for the fact that the film was well made,cruel
after the viewing of i must say that i probably have seen the most unsettling movie ever made ive seen two cannibal movies before eaten alive and cannibal ferox but they didnt have the same effect on me those movies were at some moments very laughable but this time the actors and the dialogue are better and more believablethis isnt such a bad movie sometimes i find it very intense and frightening deodato is a good director and some scenes are very professional  but there is one thing that shouldnt have been there and that is of course the real authentic animal killings some scenes were just too much why why was it needful to kill those animals i mean how could one do that and be sick enough to record it on tape those scenes were too strong even for methe absolutely best thing in this movie is the music by riz ortolani i was quite surprised when i heard the intro music a couple of tunes played throughout the whole movie giving it a special atmosphere which was lacking in the other cannibal filmsi cant recommend a movie like this and i cant say i like it a lot but its much better than id expected you must have seen much if you decide to see this remember that a movie like seven is kiddie stuff in comparison if you have seen another cannibalfilm or i spit on your grave maybe youre prepared to watch holocaustwarning if youre a true animal friend you must stay away at any cost,cruel
i was going to write a comment about this movie last year but put it off now with this movie in the spotlight i decided to finally give my thoughts on it  this movie is great and is one of my favorite films  for 1979 it was ahead of its time and very original  as many have heard the makers of the blair witch project showed no shame in ripping off the plot which focuses on a missing documentary team and their lost footage  although i gave this movie a 10 i can understand some of the negative comments about it  it is disturbing beyond anything ive ever seen  the animal killings are repulsive and disgusting  they serve no purpose and i personally kept my head turned during those scenes  looking apart from these scenes the movie is perhaps the finest film to come out of the italian horror genre i cant agree with some of the negative critiques on the acting because many of the actors are dubbed so aside from the realistic animal killings is a masterpiece  its a classic worth being watched and judged fairly for the great movie i found it to be,cruel
i have seen many movies about cannibalism but no one as by deodatothis movie is the best one of the genre the images the effects and the music yes the music that have nothing to do with the kinf of images that you see while is playing instrumental musicthe movie goes about a documentary team that travel to  the jungle to make a film a bout a tribe the team is lost in the way and years after another team goes looking for them and you have to see it,cruel
anyone that can sit through this intense movie should lay down afterwards for some serious introspection into their own minds  the entire movie revolves around the obsession with sensationalism the plot is only loosely based on 4 disappearing teens  instead the movie is about the quest for fame the commodification of the human and the desensitization of the mind to death and violence  and it is beautifully well done however what may be the most disturbing of all is that although the messages could not hit you harder in the face people want their senses raped most watch it because they hear its a really gory movie banned in a bunch of countries and then laugh when an entire village is burned downi highly highly recommend seeing this if you have a good stomach,cruel
my opening comment is true for 95 of this film  you will need a strong stomach to sit through this filmmade in 79 this film has been banned until now  apparently a friend of mine saw it and she commented on the fact that its most likely the original inspiration for the blair witch project and a damn good film to boot i sought out a copy and was not prepared for what i was subjected toa group of four filmmakers go into the green inferno to make a documentary about cannabalismthey are never heard of again but before they go we are given some info on other groups who have tried the samethey too never came back gulpso its up to prof harold monroe kerman to find them he goes in search of the infamous tribe and does indeed find remains of the group the tension building up to the actual discovery of the tribe itself and the remains of the four group members is good and there are some great visualsthe tribe are and later understandably scared of the new group they dont trust them at all but after a lot of tense moments and some brave decisions the group is accepted and are invited to dinner human flesh nice eh anyway this is just a way of getting to the core of the film and its many messages after establishing trust with the tribe the group discover the film reels that the other group had used and eventually the action moves back to new york where the footage that was retrieved begins to be editedand this is when things get horrible viewing the documentary footage is very hard as some things happen which will probably offend gee i wonder why it was banned the four members of the group are clearly not documenting their discoveries in a traditional way instead they provoke reactions from the tribe  burn their huts rape their women etc this in itself is shocking how could civilised people like these americans do such thingsthis is the ultimate question that the film poses  who are the cannibalssure the tribe eat human flesh and other meat but through the footage retrieved from the tribe which the group had filmed the group are the real cannibals worse than that they are the uncivilised onesthere is one scene where 3 male memebers of the group rape a young girl from the tribe the poor girl now has to face death due to her rape most likely as a sign of cleansing and freedom from the harshness of her ordeal but its the way that she dies that is at first shocking then hard to take in we do not see her death but we see the outcome of it she is situated on a pole the pole goes through her vaginabottom and up through her mouth believe me its harder to look at it  youll need that strong stomachto make us as an audience more aware of the groups slow deterioration we see alan yates yorke smile at first when he sees this awful and tragic sight then as he is told the camera is rolling he changes his tone and expression into mock disbelief now that really disturbed me and made me soooooooo angrythere is a sequence in this film which also made me slightly on edge  there is a horrific scene of decapitation castration and further mutilation to be had and accompanying these visuals is the haunting score which sets a carefree light hearted floating kind of feel the visuals and the music both clash and create a very uneasy feeling for the viewer  the trailer sold this film as a document of real events blair witch and for the whole film i didnt know if the people in the real footage were real or not  it was that authentic at the beginning of the film a caption reads that most of the material was not edited for the sole reason that the director wished to capture the authenticity of the footage shown i will not reveal whether the people in the group are actors or real people  its up to you to discover determine decide etcthis film is clever horrific and beautiful at the same time the locations that the film is shot in are both treacherous and beautifulsome great performances or are they inspired directing and a beautiful and evoking soundtrack make this a must see for anyone mind you after saying that you should have a strong liking for the horror genre must be able to think for yourself and try to question your own reaction to the films content and as i have said have a strong stomachthis film is not for the faint hearted and it is not just another video nasty this one has a meaning see it910enjoy,cruel
its not even ten minutes ago that the film ends but ive to go here to write a comment holy shxt absolutely disgusting it must be the most realistic horrormovie ever first there are the cannibals they are not zombiethey are alive in our world too also the roleplay of that actors and the screenplay is fantastic you could easily sell parts of the movie as mondofilms there cant be any difference to realism ive seen many shockumentaries but this movie topped them all,cruel
after reading and hearing about this movie id tried to locate a copy of it for years ofcourse my the regular videostores didnt have it and even through the internet it was impossible to get a copy of iti finally found a copy though through an onlineauction for a pretty low price so i immediately bought it and prepared myself for the ultimate horror movieafter seeing it i was dissapointed this movie is not a horror movieits a very realistic documentaryi liked the movie although i absolutely am disgusted about the animal killings in the movie okay i know it happens everyday in slaughterhouses all over the world and i love to eat a burger from time to time but for this movie its not necessary its just plain crueli loved the scenes at the end though in which you see the cannibals devouring the filmcrewi can recommend this movie for everyone who likes graphic violencei wont see this movie a second time in the near future though,cruel
one of the better cannibal flicks by rival director ruggero deodato a documentary film crew go into the amazon jungle and are never seen again a search and rescue team are sent but find only their remains and their stock of film that they had shot about the last remaining cannibal tribes upon viewing the found footage they find that the film crew had brought about their own demise by pissing off the local tribes who subsequently ganged up on them and murdered the crew in the most brutal of fashions this film has suffered several outrageous claims about being a real snuff movie but that is the case with most cannibal capers as they feature genuine animal butchery and extreme violence the original go video release was cut by 6 min 24 secs,cruel
there are lots of cannibal movies over the years and they are all equally gory and provocative but yet also ridicules because of their overwritten silly stories with silly plotlines and characters this really is not the case since it chooses an effective and realistic approach by partly telling the entire movie in documentary style it was also one of the reasons why many people at the time and still believe that this is a snuff movie with real people getting killed in it it still makes this one of the most controversial films ever made even to this date in its genre this was a quite modern movie at its time the approach was new to people and it surprised them director ruggero deodato got almost prosecuted in italy for slaying real people in front of the camera and the movie was also banned in several countries for graphic gore sexual violence and for the genuine slaying of six animals featured in the film i believe its even banned in some countries till this date at least i really wouldnt be surprised if it wasits quite hard now to believe that people at time thought that the events in this movie were all real i mean the acting is so bad and the blood is typically early 80s fake reddish looking and all sequences are all too obviously staged filmed and cut but then again there will be always people who keep believing these sort of things remember at the time of the blair witch project in 1999 many people thought that one was real as well the whole controversy that is even now still surrounding this movie makes it part of its charisma and cult status this alone is for many people reason to watch itbut really this movie is so much more than intentionally or not opinios differ on it the movie also works great as a social commentary on various aspects of modern civilization and sensationalism themes in this movie still apply today which makes this movie just as powerful effective and relevant as almost 30 years ago especially the plot line with the producers wanting to release the shot documentary to meet the publics demands and needs still applies and would be relevant today people always have had an hunger for real violence war and other things like that on tv tv stations try to exploit this as best as possible with shows such as cops and the jerry springer show but also on the regular every day news with more images of war areas and natural disasters and such coming on day in day out even though you really dont want to see these things you subconsciously still think and say why doesnt the camera move in any closer why dont they show more of what happened etcetera the human curiosity and fascination for the unknown is simply too big to feed for instance nobody wanted to see nick berg being decapitated an islamic terror group in iraq but still thousands if not millions of people watched the video online which proofs my pointyes this movie is an extremely graphic and gory one not only because of the human slaying and cannibalism in the movie but also if not more because of the real animal killings in it the turtle sequences is already legendary for those whove always been interested in how the insides of an turtle look like watch this movie also shocking are the many sexual abuse and killing rituals in this movie even though im no woman i can still imaging the pain but also the male crowed will have something shocking thrown at them involving the oneeyed trouser snakethe movie looks mostly realistic due to its limited resources and restrained budget basically halve of the movie is done in documentary style which only adds to this the camerawork is extremely effective suggestive camerawork often works more effective than cutting back and forth between different cameraangles also of course the jungle and natives portrayed in this movie adds to the claustrophobic and more horror kind of atmospherethe movie has such a great symphonic theme something you really wouldnt expect from a movie like this and it seems out of place but yet perfectly suits the images on screen italian horror scores and scores in general are often underappreciated simply because of the fact that they arent really widely known and releasedworks great as a fascinating and extremely gory cannibalism movie but perhaps works ever more striking as a social commentary which still applies today1010httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,cruel

where to begin the plot holes the size of iowa or perhaps the music which was reminiscent of a 11 year old playing with a synthesizer  this movie sucked  it had no plot and the acting was about as good as a fifth grade school play  i constantly found myself laughing out loud at the ridiculous script ill give you a little background so i can point out my favoritely awful part  the whole movie is premised on a group of students or some such thing that travel to the green inferno where two tribes of cannibals live these students have gone other places doing documentaries and are supposedly world renowned  one of the members of the team is a girl named faye  the team heads into the jungle and has a few runins with the wildlife mostly them killing it with hatchets  then faye screams and the camera turns to show a spider on her shoulder  she seems as if shes about to defecate in her pants and needs to have it brushed off by another of her team  whats wrong with this scene you ask  why the hell would an explorer whos been all over and seen all kinds of grotesque things get freaked out by a spider  if youve seen even one national geographictm on the jungles  youd know there are tons of things to get more upset over than a spider but anyways to finish my review  the movie sucked  i would recommend the faculty over this movie no wait i would recommend you rent kangaroo jack the week after its in the theatres over this movie wait stop instead i recommend you buy a dozen copies of this movie and then chop them apart piece by piece by piece,cruel
it is the most disgusting film that i ever watched in fact i left the theatre before the end animal cruelty and unhuman violence it pretends to be a found documentary in the jungle but it is only an excuse to display all kind of revolting scenes with no rational aim dont waste your time or money,cruel
i watch a lot of movies each week and i find this movie to be the most disturbing of the hundreds i have watched this year alone there are several scenes that very unnecessary and very brutal this movie should be banned because of the actual killing of six animals they are not glancing shots either closeups of animals being killed just to make a movie its a disgusting filmthe plot to the movie has been used several times before lost in the amazon and someone comes to the rescue what they find is a little different i imagine it has its cult following of whackos doesnt most of the controversial movies,cruel
ahhhh treasured memories of times gone by the mother of all true cannibal films the mother of all fffilms and first and foremost the mother of politically incorrect cinema if youre an 80s kid youre mos def plagued by sentimentality right now and for those of you who arent old enough you have no idea how sexy deodatos relict was back in the days it was inescapable no bingeparty without a wornout vhs bootleg its menacing reputation not only outstripped the movie itself but pushed the obscure cannibal subgenre to new heights most notable green inferno the notorious filmwithinthefilm gave birth to ff the rest is historyholocaust isnt shocking by todays standards of course and yet as vintagehorror playing by its own rules its still raw still nasty still thoughtprovoking  morally politically and technically its media criticism may have been ahead of its times in 1980 but its coming back with a vengeance nowmajestic indie art from 1980 until today and beyond all hail gory glory,cruel
well here it is everybody the movie that was banned in the most countries is it really one of the most notorious films of all time yeah pretty much having recently seen caligula i will at least give this movie credit for not being as bad as that movie the violence and nudity here does seem to serve more of a purpose it is more interesting and seems to send more of a message of course its still just nothing but destruction over and over little in the movie makes sense at all its weird as how you appreciate how good the effects are as people who saw the movie sincerely thought it was a snuff filmwell it wasnt but they really did kill animals in this okay they did eat them so i guess that means its fine the part where the turtle is killed is one of the most disturbing things i have ever seen in a film probably because well its real this was one of the first found footage movies ever made and while i do enjoy certain ones like cloverfield this obviously didnt do much for me i had no clue i could even find this movie at all because youd think it would be rare the characters in this film truly are evil and might deserve their deaths theyre still pretty stupid with their actions look i could never recommend a movie that literally killed animals whatever your argument might be if youre really morbid then you should see this i guess this could qualify as a porn movie so i was tricked into seeing another one after caligula dang it ,cruel
selfproclaimed as the most controversial film ever made and often credited to creating the found footage genre has a huge reputation to uphold but brutal sometimes unnecessary violence mixed with a relevant social commentary leave mixed results follows an anthropologist traveling to the amazon to find a missing documentary crew that were sent to film the cannibalistic tribes who lived in the jungles after finding the lost footage a news channel intends to broadcast the footage and we are shown the grisly demise of the team its often referred to as one of the most disturbing movies of all time and it certainly makes you feel a little dirty watching it the torture and rape displayed by the indigenous tribe is just as shocking as the behavior the documentary team shows towards the tribe so theres really nothing pleasant to watch in this film one of the more famous lines in the movie asks who the savages really are the cannibalistic tribe or the documentary crew it presents some thoughtprovoking stuff but its so hard to ponder those themes when your senses are being assaulted by the graphic nature of this film the social commentary in and the reputation itself makes this a mustwatch for fans of extreme cinema just dont try to watch this for entertainment,cruel
i love horror flicks gore exploitation flicks getting gangster flicks true crime shows on id or trutv slayers musici thought id seen it all but i hadnt apparently ran across this awful movie by accident on the internet and decided to buy it watched it last night and it went straight in the trashmind you i rewatch zombie movies i love rob zombies movies ive seen the texas chainsaw massacre about a dozen times and it never gets old but this flick i saw just went too far for my tastei read the reviews knew going in it was going to be hard to take but bought it and watched it anywayif youre ever tempted to watch dont its not bad as in cheesy or bad as in no plot or bad as in bad acting its bad because even if youre anticensorship like me it left me wondering why they did what they did in this movieits from the late 70s and was one of the first found footage movies like blair witch project a novel concept at the time the plot is as follows four documentary film makers three of which have a mean streak and their girl friday have disappeared in the amazon and an anthropologist goes to see if he can find out what happened to them the first half of the movie covers his travels and the film he finds and his journey can best be described as interesting semihumorous and nonoffensive generally speaking its how you would treat natives if you wanted to engender good will and get out alivewhen he brings back the found footage to new york and the network begins preparing it for broadcast you get an idea of what you should not do to natives if you want to get out alivefilmed with real natives upon release the film was banned in many countries and the director was arrested he had to prove it was not a snuff filmthe film is advertised as a shotgun blast to your senses the makers of hostel said it was the most disturbing film hed ever seen those are spot on assessmentsand just when i thought i was desensitized to portrayals of cruelty,cruel
this review may contain spoilers im not paying attention to see if i am i give it 9 stars not because i enjoyed what he did in it but because it is a very disturbing film i have to give him credit for that if you want to see this film make sure to get the unrated grind house release version its the only one that is completely 100 uncut it is so disturbing because deodato i think his name is didnt have a big budget so to replace all of the gore he couldnt put in the movie he murdered at least 7 animals 6 on screen for the movie the one you dont see on screen is in one scene the cannibals kill a monkey by cutting his head in half and eating its brains he killed two for that scene because the first one they killed he said they didnt do it right so they killed another one there is also a lot of rape in the movie which is some of the most disturbing and gruesome scenes in the movie most of it is gang rape and they normally kill the victim in a painful way in the middle of it if you watch this film be warned it is a very sickening film do not watch if you dont have the stomach for itmadballs4,cruel
this movie if you have heard is insanely gory expect limbs ripped people dead all that good stuff peta stop reading here and leave you wont like what i have to say next 6 animals are killed in the making of this film watching this movie and having that in mind it made me feel bad that i liked it as much as i did it has some great acting and the recovered footage part of the film made it feel almost real that being said i have some criticisms first off nudity nudity nudity nudity its everywhere and everyone if you have a weak stomach this film is not for you thats my other criticism it is unnecessarily gory but trust me if you can forgive the nudity animal cruelty and endless gore you will love but and believe me you will probably want clean your eyes after watching it gets crazy welcome to the jungle,cruel
i had this film in my queue for almost a year before it finally found its way to meand only after i switched from blockbuster to netflix after having exhausted pretty much every 80s american horror film 2 years ago i switched my attention to the italians who seem to have more imagination if not less money or acting talent yet they seem to do a whole hell of a lot more with it nudity is very plentiful all the same more so actuallymy criteria in renting these sorts of movies is pretty simplenothing after 89 and must include words like banned gratuitous or cencored this movie enveloped all rules i had sotruthfully and with no joking this is probably the most disturbing film ive had the pleasure of seeing seriouslyi remember when i spent a week working myself up to watch salo after reading 120 days of sodom i was ready for the worstthings i would rather not describe but for an easy example would you get off sticking a red hot poker into some whores eye socket and then defecating into it then eating it pretty gnarley stuff for a 100 year old bookbut in the end the movie was relatively tame to my disappointment have to say  this movie however felt all too real and jeezum crow would peta have a field day with this ive never seen an animal killed for real in a movie aside from documentaries and this is not a documentary they chopped shot and slaughtered live animals just for this movie and that is ballsy to say the least which may be the reason it was banned in so many countries though it couldve been the violent rape scenes or that really real looking girl skewed on the pikethe story is actually really ingeniousdocumentary filmmakers who take great advantage in every way to make their film dramatic and meaningful even while they are the ones raping the natives and burning the village just to make the godalmighty dollar its all in the editing is it not still the effects were amazing for the time and im still not sure they were all effects some of it seemed so real it makes me wonderif they were willing to slaughter monkeys and turtles and piggies maybe they were willing to take it a step furtherand if they didnt well damn that dickcuttingoff scene almost made me wretch good on ya guys,cruel
this is a much better film about immigrants than borat is as a foreigner from india in the us for some years i found borat offensive and disgusting and yet had to hear from all sorts of idiots as to how that was a good film borat was the film that made me puke really i sincerely desire that all who watch borat should compulsorily be made to watch this film as wellof course this film has west vs nonwest but in fact it is true about any inequality in power relations anywherei saw this as a film with a universal message not simply indicting the west its another matter that in the last 200 years or so the west has played the role of the grand aggressor much better than othersand yes you might not be able to sit through itfinally those who are talking about useless animal cruelty must be idiots why so thats a completely different issue but i think that 98 environmentalists are elitists how come that all environmentalists are either from the west or from welltodo third world families that is kinda strange,cruel
is a really hard to get through film but still manages to be a classicspoilersfollowing a high profile news group disappearance anthropologist prof harold monroe robert kerman is sent to the amazon to find them and along with trackers chaco losojos salvatore basile and felipe ocanya ricardo fuentes go into the jungle while searching they find a small tribe of warriors in the jungle known as the yanomamo and are accepted into the tribe he finds that the yanomamo have canisters that the film group consisting of director alan yates carl gabriel yates his girlfriend faye daniels francesca ciardi and cameramen mark tomaso luca barbareschi and jack anders perry pirkanen had left behind taking the footage back to new york he screens the footage and becomes appalled at seeing the cruelty and torture the group inflicts in the film as they get more and more violent towards the tribesmen in the jungle he senses that they will turn and seek revenge all culminating in the foreboding last reel of footage to be screenedthe news this is one of the best horror films around and the cream of the crop of the cannibal subgenre simply what gives the film its power and enjoyment is the fact that this is one of the strongest stories ever told the first half of the film is a normal jungle adventure replete with the viewing of the native rites acceptance into the tribe and other assorted jungle adventures it isnt groundbreaking but it gets the job done keeping the viewer focused on whats happening and setting up the trump card that is the final half this is the main footage of the lost crew and is a whole different story consisting of raw handheld images shot from two cameras by a quartet of filmmakers as they callously tromp through the jungle committing sexual and violent acts against the mud people and even offing an animal or two in the process this is also where the films heart comes into play where it makes the valiant charge that civilized man is no more savage than the people out in the jungle the great trick that this pulls off is that the film is essentially a nonviolent protest that attacks the civilized man and the media for their ability to spin any story to a sensationalized account this can only be possible with a peaceful tribe being assaulted by a rowdy and extreme outsider force the cameracrew coming in and destroying their way of life purely for ratings conducting extreme amounts of carnage including setting fire to a series of huts and forcing the occupants to stay inside raping villagers in full view of others and then reminding themselves to become serious and poignant because theyre being filmed this even occurs during the abortion sequence where they visibly force the natives around so that the camera filming can get a better shot they also are the main ones who dish out the animal violence as they slaughter several creatures and the natives merely do one in a really quick shot aside from the ending retribution all of the violence in the film is caused by the crew towards nature or the tribe and as they are nearly all done in the last segment this really helps to sell the message of the savage man and the media away from the message it makes this is one of the greatest horror films around it assembles a series of images that are both violent and disturbing but in the end they are no more graphic nor more violent than any other gorefest instead it is the tone and nature of the violence some of it is rawly primitive and all of it is unflinching in detail even more this approach makes the viewer a participant in the carnage as much as the lost film crew it is the audiences demand for more blood darker thrills that drives the acts on screen the gore gets extreme as legs get severed multiple rapes a castration a chestcracking scene eyegouging a woman impaled to the point of the stick coming out of her mouth organ eating and so much more in here that are simply brutal this brings up the biggest and most controversial segment of the film which is the actual animal slaughter present the on screen killing of animals is completely indefensible of course and are nothing more than a nauseating nature snuff film the verisimilitude of these sequences causes the viewer to then question the reality of everything else on screen indeed many of the more memorable moments come with the unnecessary torment and torture of innocent creatures but such blatant abuse is a necessity it sets up the whole potential premise of the film when we see a pig being shot or a seaturtle gutted and chopped up the reaction is instant they have instant impact before being identified for their fakeness since they allow the viewer to put up barriers and prepare ourselves for the next instance the result is that it really happened however the cruelty obliterates any chance of becoming a credible social commentary in no way shape or form is murdering helpless creatures suitable for entertainment whats most sickening about these scenes is the way the actors behave appearing to enjoy these barbaric acts it makes the whole affair much more unsettling even still this is one of the best films in the genrethe final verdict this is one of the hardest films to get into but its wellworth it not just for the extreme gore and story but for being a smart film as well while the animal carnage is hard to get through those who can will find a film with a lot to love but that is one big obstacle in itselfrated unnc17 extreme graphic violence continuous animal violence full male and female nudity several sex scenes and several rapes,cruel
this film was far from what i expected having held out for many years against watching it mainly on account of the terrible animal killing that goes on in it i finally plucked up the courage to watch the uncut version of how surprising to find not a cheap and nasty exploitation film which sometimes is no bad thing but a genuinely moving urgent and powerful piece of film making which reflects on the nature of western attitudes to naturethe camera never shys away from showing you the mutual brutality of primitive and civilised man asking the question have we in the west really evolved as much as we think yes the imagery is shocking brutal and extreme containing scenes of an enforced primitive abortions male castration the terrible fate of a tribal girl accused of adultery the cruelty and brutality of the tribes graphic as it is never seems as shocking as the violence carried out by the team of journalists who go into the green inferno as they burn rape and mutliate their way through the bush the camera never once urges you to enjoy the events but it is a powerful way of gauging your own reatcions to what is happening on screen as first we follow a university professor into the jungle as he attempts to discover the fate of the four young journalists he himself is forced to take part in a cannibalistic act the second half we see events through the cameras of the journalists filtered through the reaction of the tv execs in a screening room watching the amateur footagei felt the film was a graphic but sober meditation on the nature of civilised man a film whose power comes in part through its haunting and powerful score which should be available on cv lush soulful strings accompany the images of a young girl previously raped by the journalists impaled on a stake prove quite jarring yet impact the image powerfully in the mind of the viewerfinally some mention has to go to the famous animal killings these over the years have provided with its reputation as the most horrific film of the genre these scenes are barbaric and ultimately pull the film down however i believe a cut is available without these scenes inthis aside i was hugely surprised by this movie and would recommoned it to the strong of stomach it is a horror film like no other of its type genuinely moving tragic sad yet extreme brutal and violent,cruel
ok look i absolutely love horror films  the more gore the better i was told that this movie was exceptionally gorefilled and was given no warnings so i rented it expecting something along the lines of dead alive or a romero film instead i traumatized myself with this horrifying beast of a filmthe rape scenes are numerous and extraordinarily graphic but much much more disturbing to me were the animal killing scenes i cannot understand how any reasonable human being would be able to watch those scenes i had to turn away or just skip to the next dvd chapter each time the turtle and coatamundi scenes have plagued me since i watched themi use imdb daily and have never before felt compelled to write up a review here but i felt like it was necessary to get this out there to warn people like myself who might otherwise unwittingly watch this film and be deeply bothered by it as i said i am a fan of gore and an extremely liberal person  but this film impacted me like no other ive ever seen it was the first time in my life ive felt like i wish i could unwatch something that i just saw totally erase it from my memory  because it can only cause me damage,cruel
i was really expecting a lot from this movie so maybe this has something to do with my low rating of itas far as it being shockingwell yeah sort of its certainly disturbing to see animals killed in horrible ways for no other reason than to convince the director that he is furthering his art killing the cow in apocalypse now probably qualifies as essential to the movie the killing of animals in this movie just looks like a perverted mind getting off on how edgy hes beingother than that i didnt find this movie to be shocking as much as boring its really hard to be shocked by the violence as you have zero emotions invested in the characters mostly because they are so wooden its saying something that the most convincing actor in the cast was mainly known as a porn starthe plot is almost nonexistent it feels like the things that happened did so only because there was no other way to get to the end of the moviealso i have no idea why anyone thinks the cannibals are scary basically the scenes with the cannibals looks like somebody went to the local home depot lot found some undocumented workers threw a bit of paint on them then told them to run around in a field and scream a loti can think of so many better movies for people who might be interested in this garbage due to stuff youve heard on the net if youre looking for something that is just flat out disturbing watch salo or irreversible if you want gore get a good copy of day of the dead if you want to see natives acting like natives see aguirrethe only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is that i only give a 1 to movies i know i will forget youre not going to forget seeing these animals violated although youll probably want to,cruel
i came across this some years ago it carried a tagline reading the most controversial movie ever or the most violent movie ever which i have to admit hooked me i saw it only recently though when my brother brought me the 25th anniversary dvd edition i call it cinematic form of expression because to me it doesnt deserve the movie denomination actually i cant find any qualification that suits fine this is the telling of a journey through the jungle by two crews of occidental people a second crew looks after a first crew of reporters which aim was to shoot a sensational documentary on cannibal tribes living in the amazonian forest the second crew led by a so called professor discovers the reporters rests their film which is taken and showed to the civilized world us the viewer the footages consists of several actually real animal killings and several fake human murders committed by 4 morons laughing their pleasure of doing it out loud and who end up dismembered and eaten by the people they were viciously taking the ps out of the professors quest also consists of killing animals and slaughtering people notably with the help of machinegunned soldiers finally consists of muddy rapes and dancing naked in a river while being sextoyed by a bunch of nymphomaniacs all this is meant to be real and tackled the way documentaries report real facts but its a failed attempt due to the following aspects intention denouncing our modern world bestiality and mass media as manipulated tools through the objective eye of the camera cool but why such a subtle showing of everything story see above screenplay meant so serious and dramatic that you cant stop laughing several lines are cult classic acting was there any actor they were so good it seems these guys had been doing it eg tearing turtles apart since they were born very deep aholes art direction they had to kill real animals to make you doubt and be ok with the blood and dismembered bodies design coarseness no need to mention the use of custard to fake vomit photography 16mm camera for the real footages 35mm for the professor sequences but why both were used the same way the picture is grainy shaky well documentarylike editing where did these ed wood style shots came from snakes crocodiles monkeys otherwise thats overall scene shotclose up shotaction shot sequences one after another simple and effective or should i say boring as death sound unsynchronized several times coarsely dubbed lousy effects gunshots screams music too prominent as irritating as the sound and made to cover the latter direction obliging admiring and thus praising what it is supposed to denounce its hypocritical and insulting the viewers intelligence the filthiest and most unbelievable lie ever filmed,cruel
ruggero deodato strikes once again with some more gruesome cannibalism this highly controversial and extremely gory film reigns as the almighty king of cannibal films banned in almost sixty countries for its unapologetic scenes of violence torture and real animal slaughter the film follows a documentary team going deep into the jungles of south america looking for reallife cannibals after discovering a tribe they decide to mess around with them for the hell of it and the consequences are more than severe when the footage is found we get to see the carnage firsthand and it is some vile stuff highlights include bodies cut to pieces a fetus torn out of a woman castrations and of course cannibalism,cruel
back in 2005 when i first read about right here on imdb after starting my extreme movie quest i decided to track down an uncensored copy of the movie at the time it was one of those very rare movies that you only heard about  never actually got to seeat the time i had heard australian customs will confiscate any copy of that finds its way to the boarder so what did i do i had a look on ebay to see if i could find a lucky chap which had successfully imported an uncut copy of ch into the country to my surprise i found a copy straight away there was an uncut legit copy of the ec entertainment deluxe collectors edition for just 15aud i quickly chose the buy now option  wallah i now owned one of the most violent morally repulsive  downright sick movies every createdthis year an uncut version was released here in australia after a 25 year long ban as an extra on the disc it even included the infamous intact version of the last road to hell sequence naturally i picked it upnow to the good stuff ive been now been collecting extremehardcore movies for over a year  i can tell youis still in my top 5 most disturbingly violent movies of all time why as youve already heard the movie contains real animal killings purposely done just for the movie endless rapes brutal violence  all that stuff right you may think that a movie with such content would have no hope of actually being a decent movie right wrong the movie follows the atrocities committed by a group of young doco makers in the amazon jungle most of the movie is footage in which they recorded whilst tormenting the jungles natives in an attempt to manipulate them so that they could get exactly the footage they wanted for the docobe prepared it may sound simple butnothing like this has ever been done before  nothing will ever come close in the future the sheer brutality of the violence rape animal cruelty  forced abortion promises to turn stomaches most people probably wouldnt even be able to finish the movie so unless youre an extreme horrorgore fan such as myself then stay far far awaybut dont get me wrong theres more to ch then meets the eye its also an incredible movie with an important message but at heart its still a hardcore underground exploitation flick with bulls see it  judge for yourself if its not still banned in your countrythis is truly a masterpiece  has gone down in history as one of the most disturbing movies of all time,cruel
after hearing so much about this film i was so happy to finally get my hands of a copy of the dvd when i got home i immediately put it in my dvd player and sat down anticipating one hell of a ride considering everything id heard about itthe movie itself is a beautifully shot piece of cinema never before have i seen something filmeddirected like this before the film ran so smoothly there was never a dull moment and the locations were perfect the acting was average but still not bad enough for me to loose interest i have to admit the scene where faye had the spider on her shoulder seemed a bit overacted but otherwise as i mentioned earlier average all aroundnow onto the gore mainly when i watch a gory movie i just take it as it comes knowing that the filmmakers have tossed in a gallon or two of blood for good old fashioned gory fun with ch the gore was more realistic because it wasnt overdone you really believed that thats what it would look like if someone did have their leg cut off or did have their wang cut off or have their guts pulled out and thrown about by savages there was no over the top bucket of blood effects just believable amounts of blood after all i think deodato wanted more to get his message across than the gore  the animal killings were quite easy to sit through because as i mentioned in another thread you see that kind of thing all the time in documentaries on the discovery channel granted that its lions or tigers doing the killing but i took it in the sense that the deodato was trying to show that people in normal society can be as brutal as the cannibals meat is meat and you kill what you need to survive the cannibals kill humans for food just as we kill cows chickens or even turtles for food natural selection the food chain only for cannibals humans are on the food chaini quite enjoyed the way that the film took a stab at the media exploiting people to give them a bad name or to look worse than they were as shown in the last road to hell sequencewhen compared to cannibal ferox is definitely the more intelligent of the two ferox was made in the hype of holocausts release just as nowadays you have movies coming out in a genrehype although ferox had no real grounds to be so in your face about it as holocaust as there was no real underlying message other than heres a gory cannibal movie to say it any simpler ferox was to holocaust as deep impact was to armageddon in a word inferior a directorstudio trying to make money by copying someone elses successi conclusion was a highly interesting and enjoyable movie to watch and i shall be watching it again and again because it has a great underlying message which is also the final line in the filmwho are the real cannibals,cruel
ruggero deodatos is probably one of the most talked about films of history sadly most of the controversy is not about the film itself but about deaodatos decision of having real animals killed in some scenes while obviously what he did was wrong the fact that this small detail overshadows the message of the film is a small proof of how underrated this legendary film isis without a doubt among the most beautiful and thoughtprovoking horror films ever done while it displays horrific scenes of extreme violence it carries a powerful and very human message with a class that very few films have in the middle of the countless exploitation films deodatos gem shines as a rough diamond with characteristics way different to the rest of the movies of its particular subgenreat the beginning professor harold monroe robert kerman goes to south america in an expedition to discover the fate of a group of young filmmakers who went to the amazonian jungle in order to film a mysterious cannibal tribe after monroe befriends the cannibals he is able to recover the lost films that depict what happened to the filmmakers back in the us monroe is shocked because the footage contains horrors worse than what he thoughtthe film is cleverly divided in two at first we follow monroes expedition and his attempts to find the cannibal tribe his humanistic philosophy is on display as he tries to understand this ancient culture which has kept its traditions intact over the centuries despite the light nature of the first part it still contain shocking scenes but deodato makes sure to point out that this is the way the cannibals live and that it is natural for them to be that waythe second part is the lost footage as monroe prepares it to be studied the tragedy of the filmmakers is depicted as we observe the surviving parts of what would be their documentary as the professor discovers the shocking truth an important question is raised who was really the evil one deodatos minimalistic approach gives the film a realistic look as at times the film looks like a real documentary the subtle use of music enhances the atmosphere and perfectly sets the mood for the visuals the acting is very good for the budget as well as the makeup sfx while is not as gory as the legend goes it certainly is not a splatterfest it is a very disturbing film not only because the violence is very harsh but because the reasons behind it are quite shockingis a film that many people talks about but very few have actually seen this movie is a very demanding experience not only for what is presented but for what is implied nevertheless this film is a mustsee for any film fan not only fans of exploitation films as deodatos masterpiece is one of the films with more heart ever done 910,cruel
it is hard to think of what to say about this movie i have been a fan of italian horror for years and was and still a fan of the cannibal films that were made in the late 70s to early 80s and i must say this movie takes the cake this is truly one of the most disturbing vile films ever made and yet i keep coming back to it i saw this movie for the first time about 6 or 8 months ago for me this movie was the forbidden fruit and a friend of mine found a copy of this flick totally uncut of course he warned me about some of the things that happen in the movie and straight up gave me his copy because he wanted nothing to do with it so i sat down to check this film out knowing half of what i was getting into because once when you see one of these films youve basically seen them all not true with this movie thsi film truly infests your brain with some of the sickist stuff i have ever seen i am not going to say what happens in the movie for i feel this would truly take away from the first viewing so prepare yourself for a vicious film 9 stars,cruel
well after watching tcm texas chainsaw massacre i wanted to see how far blood and gore can go i asked some people and was told that ch and mbts men behind the sun where the movies for me after seeing ch i couldnt believe how much it got to me how many strings it pulled in my mind in my heart but most of all in my stomach its a beautifully done film with a capturing storyline vivid characters beautiful landscape and above all a divine soundtrack that if you hear without seeing the film you could never believe that its tied to such a morbid expression of art whit all the contrast between beauty in carnage present in this movie its one of the most vivid portrayals of how modernday mentality destroys natural beauty and of how savage the  so called  civilized world is this may be a widespread idea and therefore nothing special but its not only what the movie wants to say but also how it says it and that is nothing short of ingenious i did watch this movie for gore and guts but in the end i came to realize that its not the violence that makes it special but the beauty that shines through from behind the carnage as for those who say its a cheep flick well they either have a too sensitive stomach or a feeble heart or maybe a too stubborn head an excess of violence is not necessarily a flaw it can also be like everything else in the world an expression of art,cruel
i saw this movie almost 20 years ago and until now i think this is one of the most horrible movie ive ever seen the screenplay is very simple the performance are bad too bad an the appearance of salvo basile one of the most horrible actors on movie and tv history makes this film very unreal if you can to avoid this movie do it if you want to torture you if you are masochist for example or if you enjoy the free blood and the simple unreal and stereotyper point of view of the director about the american natives who lives in the amazonas watch it i only say to you beware this is one of the most coarse and rough film ever made but if you have a fascination for this kind of movies i only can say watch it and good look ps this is not a precedent of the blair witch do not fall in this error,cruel
welli have to say the ending ruined the entire feel of the film for meyes i was shocked when the animals were killedbut i was actually more relieved that it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be anyone who has seen slaughter house footage knows that it is much worse than anything in this filmalthough i in no way am justifying the sick and sadistic murder of these animals im also relieved that the footage showed the film crew actually eating the animals well only muskrat turtle and monkey so at least they didnt go to waste spider snake and pig did thoughi watch horror films to watch special effectsch is a cheap cop out that uses real animal snuff instead of seso theres no craft to itjust sadistic measures because makeup is too lazy to create effective se i enjoyed the fake human gore see fake note craft and special effects at the beginning of the film and felt i was watching something special that i could look beyond the animal snuff and watch something entertaining nope ruggerro really makes us hate the crew through very effective measures they kill without remorse and sacrifice even their own crew for the shoot however when the time comes for them to get theirwtf first off jack is too far away for us to really see anything worthwhilewe get guts flying in the air and a quick penis shotlame he should have been more in pain we should have seen his penis slowly cut off and him slowly gutted it seemed as if he were dead already whats the point then fay gets hers well we see her get raped enough very fake looking the natives are humping alongside her obviously getting nowhere near penetration and when she gets bludgeoned camera shakes from afar no deep cuts and then they hold up a very fake looking head the head looked so fake that a tree was obviously used to cover the flakiness of the shot i did not watch any of the scenes frame by frame eitheri watched it in one sitting and let it play through as it was meant to be seenvery fake ater this the two remaining crew members are taken care of by having the natives rush the camera the camera spins around and a head covered in caro syrup lays before the fallen camera while the natives do a little dance behind himpuhlease the gore at the begging was so effective when the cannibals were eating that arm and then when the dr had to feast with the cannibals and also the remains of the crew or any remains for that matter looked so great that i was really excited for the rest of the film looking forward to the climaxnopethere is no justice to be had and we dont get the pleasure of seeing these bastards torn limb from limb as the film promises the whole film was a giant tease paying off in the beginning and promising more that would never comeinstead were treated to snuff crap and a cop out ending and some of the dumbest revelations ever we are savages in our own right naw you think yeah civilized wars are so much better than uncivilized wars  sarcasm if you cant tell stillit was a nice attempt although when the executives become disgusted with the footage and the one of the phone says he wants it all burnt it feels like the cheesy moral learned by all endingthe crew had done immoral things for their past documentaries last road to hell  which was real footage  yup they killed that little kid and now you know what it looks like to see a child die arent you a better person was supposedly set up by the crew as well the woman states that allen payed the soldiers to do a bit of acting and allen says while burning the villagers alive yeah a set up like in forgot name of place but referred to last road to hell im not gonna look it up or watch the movie againin the past andwhat is this suppose to be the last straw bullcrap so its ok for them to pay soldiers to kill people but not ok for them to kill people themselves yeah right if the execs supposedly ate up last road they would love green hell and edit it to their liking and release it anything for a crowd pleaser thats how media really are in many instancesthus the film really started out with something special but then gave us a really stupid resolve we dont witness the punishment of the true bad guys and the point of it all is thrown out the window supposedly this is a commentary on how media is obsessed with violence and suddenly violence disturbs the execs to the point of destroying what they were seekingnot the smart movie it promised to bejust a dumb exploitation filmand not even a good one at that watch the first third and the mondo scenes if you must but if youre the kind of person to seek this film out then you have seen worsetrust me,cruel
this movie wasnt scary but what scared me was that it seemed realistic it scared me because some of the scenes looked so real the most amazing shot in the movie was the tribeswoman put on a stake how was that done that looked amazing and i kept saying no way that looks too real the makeup is too good i kept thinking what is one dead tribes person nobody would notice in the jungle just maybe they really put an adulteress tribeswoman on a stake and the director lied and said it was not real that was in the back of my mind i know it was not real but i kept thinking who really knows the special effect makeup person deserves a lot of credit another amazingly realistic scene was the castration scene ouch the ending of the movie was the definite climax the slaughter of the end was amazingly realistic this movie did the trick it made me say wow how did they do that any movie that makes you question what is real and what is not deserves some crediti understand they used real footage of animal food preparation that did not scare me or bother me because what do primitive tribes in the amazon do that is right they hunt to survive this movie contained exploited tribes people if you want to call filming tribesmen preparing food exploitation who cares except veggans and peta i dont mind seeing tribesmen demonstrate how to gut animals to prepare food 78100 high score for realistic makeup and special effects,cruel
i first heard of this film on a message board where it was described as too brutal for anyone normal to watch this and numerous other sources accolading its grisliness got me interested and i decided to take this test of character and see what category i fell into i dont consider myself a person whos easy to make squeal but if the action gets spooky enough i can be seen peeking at it amidst my fingers that said i really looked forward to seeing thiswhen i finally got through watching the 86minute version after just gawking at the dvdcase for a few days building up the expectations i have to say that i was utterly disappointed i wanted to be shocked out of my worn out socks but this just didnt happen it completely failed to live up to its controversial hype it didnt even come across as a horror movie but as a halfassed sociological statement made into a too long filmthe much ballyhooed gore did nothing for me people got ritualistically raped bludgeoned to death staked eaten and whatnot but i just noticed myself thinking that all of it was just part to that primitive society those were customs of that people as gruesome and cruel the acts might seem it was like in nature documentaries where you see lions rip a zebras guts out i dont lose my stomach in the sight of nature running its course nor did i do so while watching this film the scenes that id heard to be the most horrifying like the slaughtering of the pig and the turtle were cut out from my version but i dont think those would have made much of a difference in this respect though i do think it was absolutely unnecessary and sensationalist to kill live animals this was probably the most daunting aspect of the movie a questionable merit to say the least excluding these the most disturbing parts were the atrocities conducted by the portrayed film crew itself as these people had no real motive behind their actions besides making money and becoming famous unfortunately these scenes were taken too much over the top to be credible and thus effectivethere is a message in this film it is not gore just for the sake of it i kind of wish it were but its not the message isnt really concealed in any way but repeated very explicitly several times during the the film so that even the most dense viewers get the picture its basically criticism towards the way anthropologists and documentary filmmakers manipulate their study subjects to make them behave in a certain way this is demonstrated for example by having the film crew consisting of four 4 young people round up an entire cannibal tribe into a shack and setting it on fire in order to stage some war footage unbelievable believe it such overstating just took the edge off for me although i was quite pleased to see all four of them getting torn to pieces in the end because of it a more subtle and discrete approach would probably have worked better the other major theme  using the term major loosely here  is the question of who the savages really are the allexploiting urbanites or the people living in trees in the jungles the contrast between these two worlds is brought forth by showing footage of the jungle and camera pans of skyscrapers subsequently with eerie music playing in the background this is done several times inefficiently the movie goes for these issues in a very simplistic and monotonous way which gets very tiringthis thematic straightforwardness combined with nonexistent acting and somehow subpar voice overs leaves very little to be enjoyed also the fact that this trash is considered horror is deceiving at best real horror doesnt come from blood and guts alone even if you add some eerie samples to the mix mr ruggero deodato should have known that this piece of trash is best described as mondo three stars just for the cut off penis at the end  that made me chuckle,cruel
this film has some reputation i had real fears of watching this movie and had quite a few doubtsit could be great but it can seriously suck as exploitation movies dobut then it was in theaters so i thought what could be that badits great movie its inovative film within the film was used for first time i think so  all comparsions with blair project are ok holocaust was the first in aiming more on gore that the plot  yes but this time you have it well conjoined it has some over the top gore and violence i couldnt stand watching it sometimes but it was all in the right place it had its reasons there were snakebites there were traditional rituals its not gore for the sake of gorei recommend it because is has great influence in modern horror it separates horror fans from others it has cult following it has legends around him so better watch it yourself than listening stories that are frequently  false not for people with weak heart and stomach,cruel
the message of is while human society has advanced tremendously in their technology over the past 500010000 years modern man has become alienated from life itself behind the veil of modern technology and political philosophy lies a pervert not a savage the killings and atrocities of the westerners are erratic and sadistic while the punishments of the natives follow ritualistic patterns related to their lives as a group and the groups struggle for survival in other words the murders committed by the westerners are unnecessary while the ones committed by the natives are not the native brutality and cannibalism are part of ritual ie they serve a distinct function the brutality of the westerners imitates those of the natives without understanding the ritualistic function the savage breaks loose but it is a perverted savage who does not understand what he is doingin terms of this message does a better job than apocalypse now or other movies that deal with related topics i wonder however how ruggero deodato shot this film the natives dont look like they are actors at all but like real natives who really dont know what a camera is that makes the movie very realistic and shockingly disturbinghighly recommended viewing810,cruel
ruggero made a great film here  he had us believing back then that this movie was for real what bwp wanted to do as well  the first half of the movie is very mild and a little uninteresting but the action picks up when the second crew finds the footage that was shot by the lost crew  from here on anything goes  this movie makes you think quite a bit some people might just watch it and be repulsed by the gore and realness of it all even the actual animal killings portrayed but if you just dig a little deeper you might see that what this movie is really about when civilized people think that the rules of society are out the window would they stick by them  would you  a great film that even though some people have criticized through the years still has a lot to offer to the open minded viewer  910,cruel
spoilers ahead no other cannibal film or horror film for that matter has as much originality as sure the name of the film could have been better but the movie itself is in its own league this film paved the way for a lot of cannibal films and euro exploitation films in the late 70s and early 80s if you look closely at the plot of the movie you can tell that it also paved the way for the blair witch project in 1999 the gruesome story of 4 film makers disappearing into the hell of the jungle never to return is something as real as the disturbing images in this movie real animal deaths tons of blood and gore castration a fetus ripped from its mothers womb rape torture pretty much all the ingredients necessary for a disturbing and very controversial movielegend has it that even director ruggero deodato had to prove to the courts that the human deaths were fake even bringing the actors and actresses before the courts to show them they were alive what a powerful film this is and the reality of it all makes the film believable for we know cannibalism is real and there are tribes in the darkest of jungles that feast on human flesh this unnerving thought is portrayed brilliantly in this film riz ortolanis stunning score has yet to be matched in any horror film the beautiful serenading orchestra music as villagers are burnt to a crisp in a hut the sad dark violins and stringed instruments churn in almost a sorrowful manner as a woman is tortured to death for committing adultryall together deodato knows his craft well in it is something you must see once in your life to experience it for weak stomached easily disturbed or faint of heart do not even attempt to see this film i would like to see hollywood put out something as realistic and powerful and potent as good luck9 out of 10,cruel
with ruggero deodato managed to completely smash the barrier that umberto lenzi had been pushing at before himthe movie is perhaps the most brutal entry into exploitation cinema ever more savage than lenzis man from deep riveror cannibal ferrox much more intelligent and selfaware than the likes of slave of the cannibal god or the damn awful cannibal apocalypse or eaten alive oh dear what happened lenzi stands alone in its subgenredeodato has a colorful record for raw exploitation cinema with credits such as last cannibal world jungle holocaust and the downright cruel house on the edge of the park to his name nut with he transcended the genre as a wholepossible spoilersnot too in depththe story is fairly linear  a crew of journalist go into the amazon to film the lives of the dwelling tribes and never return a search team is sent out for them only to find that they have been eaten by the tribes and that the only evidence of what happened lays within the films taken by the deceased crew arriving back in new york well as near as you are going to get the feel of new york from italian directors such as deodato and lenzi robert kermans lead man begins to watch the footage he has procured from the cannibal tribes this is when the real horror beginsi found myself watching this move with a real sense of dread as each scene ended frightened of what might follow in the next scene deodato has got the balance perfect enough onscreen violence and savagery to disgust the viewer but more than enough socialawareness and cleverly crafted irony to keep the viewer entranced with its downright beautyone scene that nicely summed up the intelligence of deodato in his parody of journalistic media is when one of the crew is commenting on the sickening death of a tribe elder and the fact that she will soon be eaten by crocodiles as the girl in shot with him waves cheerily to camera like a small child completely self concerned unaffected and unmoved by her selfish egofor any true fan of exploitation cinema particularly italian this movie will be your bible for anyone who is unsure about strong violence i would seriously recommend that you give this movie a missthe recent grindhouse release is certainly the definitive dvd edition of this movie in my opinion however to see the infamous road to hell scene in its entirety the ec ultrabit edition is the best version to get hold of10  10,cruel
despite the animal killings this movie had a smooth overall flow  while a little hard for the more mundane to accept it had at least continuityi was super glad the americans got killed and killed violently  good serves them right they rape burn down the village and kill the tribes food  what goes around comes aroundwhen you think about it its really hypocritical for people to be offended by the animal scenes  how many cows are killed each day for meat  exactly by the way i eat meat so actually the scenes looked tasty  i would give turtle a try710 as far as im concerned,cruel
i have never considered myself extremely jaded but i must rethink that idea after watching i had read all the reviews and knew what to expect but i was not a bit disgusted by anything i saw at least not on a physical level of course the horrible things shown in ch are disgusting on an emotional level when you consider what the filmmakers do to the natives and how they meet their grisly end however i was not scarred after watching it like i thought i might be perhaps all the research i did ahead of time helped i dont know but as far as disturbing movies go i have seen much worsethats not to say ch is a bad movie it is not the scenes are beautiful and the process in which the story is told is revolutionary i suppose my only complaint with the film other than the fact that real animals were actually killed in the makingbut thats another subject for another time is that i see no motivation for what the filmmakers did what reasons did they have to round up an entire village into one hut and set it on fire i can sort of understand the rape though i dont in any way condone it but genocide i do notall that aside ch does what it aims to do brilliantly i dont think the gore is as bad as some make it out to be but i certainly wouldnt recommend it to someone who has to close their eyes during scream if you can stand violence rape and animals being killed this is a masterpiece of a film,cruel
i never thought i would watch a movie that actually would make my stomach quezzy to the point i couldnt eat anything for a while after watching it but this film did it is so horrific with the killing of animalsesp the turtle because the poor thing looks like it is still squirming around after its head is cut off the violence toward women and overall brutality that is inflicted on people  i wanted to see this because i had heard about the gore but i had no idea it was filled with such awful rape and disememberment scenes  this type of movie just didnt need to be madefinal verdict  the idea for this movie must have come from a sick mind yeah it has a lot of gore for all you gore fans out there but the realistic violence is just too much  i like gory movies but this offended me i recommend this movie only if you have a really strong stomach and if realistic violence wont bother you too much,cruel
after two years of hunting down this film on import dvd i finally watched this masterpiece in the early hours of the day of the general election i consider myself desensitised to violence so was not too shocked by the violent content however this is the most powerful and though provoking film that i have ever seen for the first time in my life i was actully left feeling numb after viewing a movie everything about this movie is perfect the acting is immense considering that the majority of the cast were gained from acting schools the cinematography is unbelievable for such a small budget 100000 in my opinion the best piece of this brilliant cinematography is the scene when professor monroe decides to play a recording of the tree people chanting as a last ditch attempt to gain their trust the way that the tree people immerge from the thier giant tree house and the way they react is brilliantly shot and captured however the most special aspect of is the score the main theme that riz ortalani created is a classic i do not understand why some people lambast this film because of the animal killings i have seen many upon many documentries on the discovery channel and so on that show amazon tribes freely killing rare birds monkeys and so on this was done for entertainment purposes so there is no difference between the animal killings in ch and those shown in nature documentries what are people trying to say that its ok to show animal killings for educational programmes but not for which i learned more about humanity from than five hundred documentries put together,cruel
when i saw this movie i wondered about how sick people can get i voted a 2 instead of 1 because the film is an excellent psycological test for us who watch to many horrormovies and laugh about it nice thing with the camera found in the forrest the moviesound is awful and reminds me of computersounds from the middle of the 70s,cruel
this is a mustsee for everyone over 16 to debate ones morals it is a pornographic film which means it may excite you and its very thoughtprovoking at the same time very dark in style also dark view of mankind very sexy performances many ingredients which make up a cult classicmy personal analysishumor      310 drama      810 offbeat    1010 music      1010 violence   1010 sex        810the music is overwhelming it sounds pornographic most of the time in a seventies style the apocalyptic chord arrangements are cruelly existentialist i  must admit the music has a very disturbing effect on meof course it is a very cheap and repetitive score but the effect is great it strengthens the scenesthe film is very extreme more shocking than scary its got a strong drama component as well regarding nature in general mankind  that wont be appreciated if you cannot bear watching the bloody scenes most people can as i mention below though most of us deny itit makes you feel pity of mankind but at the same time i found it absolutely sex related it even excited me some of the characters are depicted as civilised people putting out their most primitive instincts while being inside the savages environment and it must be noted that it is not as a defence at all from the cannibals the reporters film a fire they cause on purpose as if it was a real fight among the cannibals just for the sake of filming something of interest for american viewers when they return homethey rape a young girl from the jungle they f in an exhibionist way with all the cannibals watching them just for fun  they are obviously getting mad because of being in the jungle for so long and because they begin to understand theyre going to die in a short while they are ultra competitive they are anxious about filming every monstrousity real or not to be more prestigious as reportersi really did not find the scenes so disgusting but curious in style very obscure twisted and maddening i liked most of the film camerawork its very impressive in spain some medical tv shows are aired in which doctors perform live operations to patients i hate this kind of show it is even more raw than two s together i really find some of those scenes disgusting everybody watches the show and people dont get so angry about it since it is about medical practises people who dont consider themselves as twisted or perverted find it interesting and entertaining  theres too much hypocrisy the same people would not bear watching it on films as it seems a perverted portrayal of human nature or whatever to themmany of the bloody scenes are both entertaining and not really exaggerated they are not just pretentious but gives hints to the plot the scene in which a huge turtle is disenbowelled will provide a good example the white reporters are starving and theres nothing to it around having spent a few days in the jungle these people are in a very unusual situation and thats what i like the most from their reactions you know more about them the girl pukes she is the most sensible of them one of them giggles and plays with the turtles head in front of the camera just for fun as showing off a trophy which means they are competitive unsensible people it is not a coincidence that later on the cannibal women play with this mans head as a trophy celebrating his death its a great paralelismfurthermore whatever may shock you might be a typical practise elsewhere in spain cows are still disenbowelled in small towns because the tripe is sold afterwards as an edible product just imagine the scene a cows intestine might be twenty times the turtles bowels my parents dont find that disgusting at all as theyve seen that through their lives many timesi enjoyed the rape scenes which took me by surprise since i never watch porno or enjoy such scenes in other movies the actors are all very sexy i would pay for a porno movie featuring these men for the first time in my lifeif you feel sick after watching it i would recommend the double life of veronica just to get the impress that the world is more a magical place to be in a more spiritual feeling of things and people this is one of my cult favourites too but its just the opposite view of the world my election of a kiewsloski film proves im not just a horror film buff when analyzing i love fassbinder bergman derek jarman and many art house filmswhich of the two views do you like the most the horrifying agressive in or the religious spiritual magical lyrical in the double life of veronica  your personal view is up to you but which one is a closer portrayal of mankind  who knows,cruel
i saw this today at college film studies class i thought id seen alot of scary and disturbing horror films but this one really got to me i recommend talking to someone after it i watched it with a group all disturbed or quiet maybe had to laugh just as a shield to the horror thats how this film is rated by the reaction  its the disturbing horror you think about during and definately after the movie to me it was and i rate this the finest horror film ever made people who thought blair witch project was clever  what started the whole documentry lost in the woods type movie then is first and only to do it so well and remains the best strange some horror films i proudly talk about and say its the best but is so shocking and disturbing its painful to actually rate something that is shocking but as the film had a morality about who really are the cannibals its us for wanting to see such gory stories and images that morality to the story alone makes the film so much better and the best credit to the film makers for making everything so real i would actually want to know that it was not real thats how real it was to me i doubt though well ever know the history of making of this film the best horror remains in the 20th century thanks to ,cruel
spoilers id been wanting to watch this film for years because of its cult status but i turned it off about 18 minutes into the film i dont mind watching bad special effects in a film i know that no one was actually injured or killed in making this film but animals are actually tortured mutilated and killed in this film for this reason i dont recommend this film nor will i watch anymore of it animal torture is never entertainment theres a huge difference between fake death for films and the real mutilation and death of animals this film crosses the line and should be banned its pure garbage screw the film makers they should have gone to prison for what they allowed to be done to those animals this is not entertainment its more like a snuff film or a crush video i hate it websites should at least tell people there are actual animal mutilations and death in it so people can make an informed choice on whether or not to watch and support this film,cruel
film making is supposed to be a form of art any deranged individual can stick a knife through a rodents throat chop the head off a turtle hack at a snake with a machete chop a spider in two and shoot a pig  and film the event its not art its perverted and had nothing to do with the story anyone giving this piece of crap positive reviews ought to have their head examined total garbage take away all the actual animal killing and what you have left is a piece of crap the acting was awful the only performer that seemed to have some type of acting skills was a porn actor so in a nutshell what you have is a porn actor as your star actual killing of animals rape scenes and killing really stupid story real bad probably the worst film i have ever seen 010,cruel
is a movie that somehow gets people to recommend it with 1010 points a lot one asks why because the movie neither has good actors good cinematography good music or anything else then the usual cheesy bull that comes with horror flicks of this caliber as it seems some people are wetting themselves because some animals get killed along the way  and slap around other people for not being amused by this as it is the human way and controversal and stuff surely the natives like a good snack of monkeybrain but ill bet they dont usually slaughter turtles and then mash around their bowels like they were playdoh as natives go i think they just eat them without much interplay  but hey that would not be as shocking as it is noanyways as the director had only so much money and thus the special effects look like stolen from any rundown ghost train killing some animals were apparently the only gore effects he would get also with all the social criticism going on one begins to wonder when not beginning to nap what a false picture most people have from war correspondents and the like dang so you have to rape pillage slaughter and overall behave like a complete bastard to get your pictures sold and maybe a pulitzer prize from time to time no wonder the white men from the west have such a bad reputation amongst all these stupid indigenous peopleand what did the yanomam think about these white guys who were doing a movie and wanted them to act this way and that good we stayed in the jungle what the dang are all white men totally insane and perverted but back to the one thing that makes a movie to remember the message paradox as many stated on this site the movie has a message about how evil corrupted and perverted humans are and how all the worst human characteristics come out just to get a higher audience rate now this struck me as something strange a movie who criticises the outrageous depravation of humanity  and only ever got heaved beyond the cesspit of abysmal horror flicks because it does the very same without all the senseless slaughtering of animals this socalled movie would rot away in the deepest corners of moviemaking and rightly sothe question is had ruggero deodato this in mind when making this crapfest is it a clever conundrum of criticism or did the director just fall for the same perverted lure of fame he so believably depicted in his movie,cruel
starts in new york city where anthropologist professor harold monroe robert kerman works together with new york university  a tv station monroe sets up an expedition to the amazon jungle in colombia where four documentary filmmakers vanished without trace in an attempt to find out what happened to them director alan yates carl gabriel york his girlfriend  writer faye daniels francesca ciardi along with two cameramen jack anders perry pirkanen  mark tomaso luca barbareschi plus their guide felipe ricardo fuentes were last seen heading into the jungle in search of cannibalistic tribes together with his guide monroe retraces the four filmmakers steps  discovers the cans of film that they shot back in new york monroe develops the film which shows shocking footage of all sorts of atrocities  reveals what happened to the filmmakersthis italian production directed by ruggero deodato  one could make the argument that is thematically the most interesting  thought provoking of all the italian cannibal flicks although i also could see why someone might label it as cheap gross exploitation just like any other italian cannibal flick personally i think its a really great film its certainly more intelligent  challenging than just about any other italian cannibal flick but that on its own may not be enough for most people to enjoy it the mainstream film that most resembles is the blair witch project 1999 which have very similar story lines the script by gianfranco clerici asks questions  uses its premise  gut munching gore  exploitation to try  get its point across the basic aim of is to make us the audience question who the real savages primitives  cannibals are since the four documentary filmmakers are portrayed as the villains rather than the cannibals this is fine but one has to say that in that case comes across as rather hypocritical the film seemingly condemns the documentary makers for killing animals  exploiting the natives for their own ends but in reality that is exactly what as a film  its makers do there are scenes of various animals being graphically mutilated  killed there are voyeuristic scenes showing cannibals at work eating flesh  sequences showing inhuman  ancient tribal rites just to add to the violence  gore levels its just odd that as a film  its makers condemn the very acts that make the film what it is  seem to take great pleasure in showing the audience having said that it does have a very strong well thought out story its very watchable  it one of those films which you cant help but look at whether your enjoying it or not the characters are good  the dialogue is surprisingly good for a dubbed italian cannibal flick as well not for everyone but for those with the stomach then is a mustdirector deodato does a nice job shot on location in new york  the amazon this looks authentic although once you see one bit of amazonian jungle youve seen them all at the time of s release in italy the film was banned  director deodato was charged with obscenity  unbelievably murder facing life in prison deodato simply contacted the actors involved  presented them in court case dismissed  i bet the police felt like idiots apparently at the time was made director deodato didnt care about the animal killings or cannibal scenes but has since gone on record as saying he now wishes he never made the film there are real animal killings in they are explicit  i would expect many to find them upsetting on a personal level i couldnt give a toss that real animals were killed in that will probably outrage some but thats the way i feel millions of animals are killed in slaughter houses everyday whats the different ironically the killings  executions seen in the the last road to hell segment are supposed to be fake but are real while the killings in the film proper which are meant to be real are fake the gore levels are high but fairly well spread out theres cannibal intestine eating scenes decapitated heads people impaled on sticks a leg is chopped off with a machete  characters are sliced upwith a supposed budget of about 100000 is very well made with an often gritty documentary film look about it which suits the film perfectly the acting is strong from most of the cast although dubbed its better dubbed than most italian exploitation flicksis a notorious film its an acquired taste for sure but for those who crave extreme cinema exploitation  gore then you are almost certain to enjoy it if not then your not like many classic horror films hollywood has decided to remake it as 2009 but i cant see it being anywhere near as effective as this,cruel
 may contain possible spoilers at the beginning of the movie i was treated to a very long disclaimer from the distributor that they do not want to be blamed for the content provided by the filmmakers they do however want to make loads of money off of it they even went so far as to quote thomas jefferson  play the opening credits then provide another disclaimerthis film has the most interesting history behind it is famous for the real animal slayings and for being accused of killing real humans deodato went to court to prove the film was not snuff and appeared on tv with his actors to prove they were still alive the film grossed 19 million 5 million today in the first 10 days of its opening before the film was banned in its native country of italy besides for the sheer cruelty and realness of the film they put fake documentary information on their dvd extras and website wwwcannibalholocaustnet to pretend this was real i am not surprised the filmmaker was accused of making snuffthe basic plot is this a professor and explorers discover the fate of a missing documentary crew that disappeared in the jungle they locate the missing footage and learn what really happened with the savages the professor finds that after the crew finds the tribe to be docile they push them to the brink of madness for the sake of good filmmaking with disastrous consequencesit is hard to side with anyone other than the professor in this the young crew members are shown at first as just young filmmakers looking for the truth they have fun together fall in love and want to expose the truth the real truth comes when the professor discovers their footage and watches their slow decent into chaos they become savage themselves by first killing animals then the people they suffer a horrible fate by the enddeodato should be proud for blurring the lines the direction here is excellent there is a social commentary at the nasty little heart of this film it speaks volumes of civilization the effect of media on society ethics morals etc this is not a sleazefest as you would think by its outward appearance there are nuances added to every scene that adds something new to the story for instance in one scene the couple in the crew is having sex in the jungle what adds to the creepiness is when you realize that their friend is filming it the camera slowly turns and you can see that they forced about 50 villagers to watch this happen to teach them how americans have sex the sex was not put in this film to draw attention but to draw attention to the complete disregard of humanityportion of review removed to stay within word limit view full review at horroryearbookcomthis is an incredibly effective and powerful film it is too realistic to be considered entertaining but it is the first film in a long time that made me feel something real horror films disappoint many adult lovers of horror today they can no longer make you squirm or give you nightmares well this one hit home for me it might be todays events war on iraq genocide in africa bordertown in mexico etc that make this all too real i felt shellshocked when it was over i felt like a victim watching this as though i was assaulted too as these are crimes against all of humanity at the same time i felt guilty for watching as though i was committing the crimes myself by not intervening there is a huge blame placed on the rest of society because these crimes do occur everyday and we sit and watch the news and believe everything that is told to us without question this film will make you either hate mankind or want to hug your neighbori should mention the animal slayings these are all real the camera looms over the animals with the gore shown in detail the worst part is hearing the animals screaming the muskrat killing was the worst and almost brought me to tears it took multiple stabbings before it was killedthe sound quality was decent considering it was shot in a jungle but there was weird transitioning between dialogue and background noise causing a bit of popping in a couple scenes the film quality of course was fantastic the look and feel of the film was real giving the viewer the sensation that they were watching actual footagefavorite quote one of the main characters says its survival of the fittest the strong overcoming the weak as a little piglet is tied to a stake in the ground kicked repeatedly falls down squealing then is shot for no reason at all this scene is real it is said that the actor practiced his lines repeatedly then flubbed them due to the nastiness of this scene they could not reshoot it as they could not find any more pigs to killdvd extras audio options commentary and trailers inside the green inferno gives detailed fake bios for each character tribes new findings and the original script bottom line do i think it should be banned no for the disillusioned horror fan of today i highly recommend this it will blow your mind the 25th year anniversary collectors edition is being released now but for the weak of heart with weak stomachs most definitely pass on this animal lovers bewarerating 010 for the atrocities and a perfect 1010

to make a crappy movie like this is a waste of everything but to torture a little animal to death like they do in the movie should be unlegally to try to make a movie sell by torturing animal is the lowest form the people that stand behind this movie should experience to be killed the same way at least they should be ashamed of them self hope the all suffer for a long time,cruel
i dont even know where to begin with this one almost everything about it was awful right from the start  this movie was banned in 50 countries for a reason  a very good reason and its sane mind no one in their right mind would enjoy watching animals get killed  and i mean full length killing video of a defenseless animal  its like the director himself knew that hew wouldnt get any horror film out of his horrible actors  and although the idea of the story was pretty descent they took it and killed it  in conclusion i wouldnt recommend this movie even to my worst enemy  dont fall to the trailer telling its some kind of a good controversy because its not  its a total garbage that no one should watch ever again,cruel

some movies just stay with you days after watching them is one of them admittedly not the easiest film to watch the graphic nature of the film will turn off all except those with the strongest of stomachs even the most seasoned horror fan may have a hard time with this one but those who are not easily disturbed and can appreciate powerful filmmaking will no doubt take a liking to ,cruel
now from the title of my review you may go ahead and assume that i am in fact clinically insane however i assure you that im not and never have been i enjoyed this film immensely some parts were quite difficult to watch but i thought that the cinematography was beautiful and the score was magnificent yes it is a very rough movie to watch and i suggest no children under the age of 13 or so should see it but of course this is truly up to the adult who decides whether the child is mature enough to watch it and not do anything stupid i myself saw this film when i was 14 years of age and i did not go and do anything stupid but some children are more easily influenced my point is that its not a disney family film its art take it for what it is and what it is is great,cruel
i hate i hate i hate evil moviei hate snuff film,cruel
gratuitous long winded repetitive and sometimes even dull i vibe with the message but the execution becomes redundant and painful the found footage concept is well done in parts and the gore is extremely well done but much like the soundtrack this movie is just too obnoxious to be impacting in a truly meaningful way,cruel
i enjoy disturbing art well i of course have limits if you are going to be graphic great but at least lets just pretend you have a point so this movie doesnt offend me at all yes animals were really killed and thats insane but this movie is old enough so i get why they thought it wasnt a big deal so not offended by thatbut this is just awful its like the opposite of the blair witch project while i read about how this movie just shows you how brutal civilized humans really are at least as violent as the cannibals the thing is what we have to endure to get that point across is too boring too gratiously graphic and not engagingand im not really that sure that was the point from the filmmakers other than to shock people with its graphic violence and realistic snufflike release the actors killed in the movie went hiding and it was believed that all the things that happened in the movie really happened again something similar was tried by the blair witch project if the point was a metaphor on civilized humans then there is no way you would kill real animals to do so,cruel
so here we are making a movie about how the white devil impacted this tribe,cruel
this movie make you ask yourself if all documentaries and nature programs are made it without interference and the people who make the docs are really there with good intentionsthis movie is not for everyone you have to be very prepared to see one of the worst side of humanityi gave a 10 because i want to equilibrate the big amounts of 1 from people who couldnt see the movie just for the hard content i rate this with a 8,cruel
there isnt much that can be said that hasnt been said before but i will reiterate on why is one of the greatest pieces of cinema of all time not only in terms of exploitation or horror but generally one of the greatest movies ever to be made before we get started for those who do not know this movie is extreme brutally violent depraved and vicious it is not for the faint of heart but for those who do stomach it they are in for one hell of a ridethe plot seems so similar to other cannibal movies which in 1980 was still a young subgenre and had yet to be given any praise outside of extreme cinema fans or thrill seekers but this film holds much more in its heart than to purely shock crowds it has deeper commentary than can meet the eye tells the story of a professor and his rescue team whom travel to the heart of the green inferno in hopes of finding a film crew who has been missing for several months they had been shooting a documentary on the monstrosity of the cannibalistic tribes that reside there but soon we will see who the monsters really arei want to keep this a spoiler free review so i wont go into great detail on many of the scenes just the ones that everyone already knows we will start with the gore i am a gore hound and i love gory movies the effects in this movie are done mostly in a found footage type of way the first of its kind and it really adds a charm to the scenes it makes you feel like you are watching a real snuff film which was obviously the point seeing that people thought the director ruggero deodato really had his actors murdered he had them sign contracts to not make any appearances at any of the screenings deodato really went the extra mile on making us feel like we just watched a brutal massacre there are of course the typical cannibal movie tropes that seems to happen in almost all them a beheading penis sliced off etc but in this film it feels different other movies like cannibal ferox which i also enjoy would go on to copy almost all of these scenes repeatedly with that there are some effects that are much different one for instance the impaling sequence it is so realistic that deodato had to prove how he performed the scene in court though in todays world some very desensitized minds wouldnt bat an eye to the atrocities that take place throughout the course of the movie but in 1980 it was unparalleled in its brutality most people still feel that this movie is reprehensible and disgusting due to the gore but thats the fun of watching a movie like this just to see if you can make it throughall the gore effects werent faked in this movie though and some on screen lives did meet their demise if you dont know what im talking about and you are an animal activist than this next paragraph and this movie as a whole isnt for you shows some very intense on screen animal executions from quick killings of monkeys and pigs to one extremely hard to watch scene where a turtle is killed cracked open and decapitated for me personally these are the most hard to watch scenes in the movie even though i will say i am not offended by them like many people are i think they are necessary actually to truly put you in the mood the deodato was going for it just makes your heart hurt and thats what this movie should do the killings are there to make you feel bad and thats exactly what they do theyre present to show us how civilized and sheltered we are from our true animal nature and our place in the food chain to us these animal scenes are evil and terrible but to the tribes its a part of everyday life and not a big deal at all if your average person today went to a farm they would be just as upset over what they see there if not more so than whats shown in the movie and thats why im not offended by whats portrayed other cannibal films would follow directly in the footsteps of and kill plenty of animals along the way the problem with those is the killings seem to be there purely for shock factor where as in i find them to be essential for portraying the theme on todays societysome of the hardest scenes to watch for a lot of people are the ones filled with sexual violence long shots of people being raped and large objects being forcefully shoved inside of women it is pretty intense and i think much more exposing than that of other films with similar content like last house on the left or i spit on your grave the big difference between those 2 movies and is that the female getting raped gets avenged or gets her revenge in holocaust though we see none of that you are assaulted and essentially left for dead i dont feel i need to explain the social commentary thats being portrayed here and how unfortunately relevant it still is today as i said earlier mankind has become sheltered and even still sexual violence seems unavoidable and this movie shows how quick someone will take advantage of others less fortunate its safe to say things havent changed muchi think when compared to other movies of its kind that came out of italy has some of the best writing and editing ever there are times when the acting suffers but in most of those moments its because the actors in the movie are acting as bad actors i understand that sentence may not make any sense what so ever i will explain after we see some characters in the film do terrible things for no reason we then see them act on camera that they did nothing wrong you will just have to watch it to really understand also the score of this movie its downright amazing i have an issue with italian horror movie scores i usually find them to be oddly placed compared to the theme and pace of the movie but in it is spot on and helps build off of what we are seeing on the screen tremendously is one of the most powerful films i have ever watched and in a painful way i enjoyed every second of it it definitely ranks as one of the most influential horror films of all time it inspired the likes of eli roth and many others and changed the face of what we looked at as exploitative and violent this movie should make you look at yourself and question humanity and morality has stirred more controversy than arguably any other movie ever has and that is an achievement in its own right considering we are still trying to top it today i recommend to anyone who wants a powerful watch and isnt squeamish anyone who considers themselves a film buff and most of all any and all extreme horror fans ranks in my top 10 films of all time without a doubt,cruel
i was pretty disturbed in a very good way and im still coming down from the shock a bit even a day later as i am writing this maybe some of the animal abuse was sad but animals eat each other so who cares the gore in this movie is really good for the time and was enough to trip me out and cringed with sympathy pain when that tribe woman was raped with a rock,cruel
this film is another sick cinematic experience of italian provenance considered by many the goriest film already made to date its a bad example for international cinema in that it shows virtually everything that a quality film should never showthe plot is simple after the disappearance of a film crew from a documentary in the middle of a remote area of the amazon rainforest an expert is sent to find out what happened however the region is inhabited by ferocious cannibal tribes therefore the film mixes a bit the found footage style with a mockumentary the director ruggero deodato focused on realism to the point that he was arrested on charges ranging from depravity to qualified murder he was only saved from life imprisonment when the actors killed in the film appeared before the judge alive and in very good health so the movie is not for anyone and its not that movie that you show to your girlfriend or mother in fact the human deaths were staged with extreme graphic realism but there are actually scenes of executions that were included in the film in addition to having been killed several animals during the filming where were the greenpeace guys then this is equally horrendoussincerely there is some talent here especially in makeup in the decoration and idealization of the sets and in other technical questions but youre going to be so sick and revolted against the movie that you will not be able to absorb it,cruel
i know that i will probably repeat what other users have already said but this movie is for me the true ancestor of the likes of blair witch project rec paranormal activity the bay cloverfieldand i am not speaking of the stories of course but the footage principle way of filming if you prefer and i will continue by saying that this movie is maybe the most unbearable horror movie of all time not for the sissies and a film which shows the most gratuitous blood bath ever but if you watch this feature till the end you can also conclude that this is a film that makes you think about the true human nature so this seemingly gratuitous side of the gore shown here is perhaps not so gratuitous after all thats what i wanted to say sorry if i have repeated some other comments i have not read them unfortunately the audiences able to use their brain the most intelligent audiences will probably not make it till the end of it on the other hand the less intellectual audiences bloodthirsty audiences will probably not understand what the ending exactly means a sort of hybrid movie made half for intellectuals and half for empty brains,cruel
this movie was in no way aided by the amount of gore and animal torture included in it and for anyone using the excuse that it happens and what about factory farming need to stop rape murder and cannibalism all happen as well but they were able to depict those actions realistically without harming any humans factory farming is wrong that is correct not sure why that makes hacking the head off a screaming in fear defenseless monkey okay oh right because some sicko will pay to watch it id call this snuff for snobs 15 hours of aninal torture and rape with a plot and script to make it digestible,cruel
this movie is just downright appalling not for its content but just the fact i cant believe a movie like this even exists and here i am trying to review it like what am i supopsed to say first things first i fail to believe there are tribes out there that are actually like this because this movie fails to provide any solid proof of real life existence now lets talk about the content this film containsmultiple animals being killed on screen purposely for this film rape scenes and torture scenes for no real reason whatsoever nudity and sex just for audience appeal naked children yes and lots of them too actors who you would swear the director just dragged out of 10th grade i found out the director actually used a heap of prostitutes from a local brothel in one scene so there you go i guess combine all this with the worst concepts in the history of film from one of the worst directors in the history of film and there you go in a nutshelli dont care if this review gets nothing but negative points it only makes sense due to this being such a negative and abysmal film if youre a sick minded bloodthirsty moron who likes dehumanization this is the film for you if youre a normal person like me you will probably feel the same wayi just cannot fathom what the director was thinking wanting to make this film what a sick pathetic joke of a film maker he is,cruel
 may contain strong spoilers this is a review made by stonedraim and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review keep readingthis is my personal experience my personal point of viewperspective and my personal opinion and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this worldwarning if you are about to see this movie you should be aware of that there are real killing of innocent animals real scenes shot when killing animals the director of this film ruggero deodato were in fact arrested after the film were finished as the police thought that the killing of human beings were real later on ruggero deodato had to show the cast in court still he got charged of the animal killings please take consideration before turning this motion picture on make sure that you or the ones seeing this movie is 18 or olderas one of the most controversial movie ever made starts off with a beautiful orchestral tune along with nice scenery over swamp and tropical environments as the movie sal this movie is also made a lot by an italian production team are italians more in a chase of the controversial topicsthe obscene and perverse contrast between the beautiful soundtrack in audio and the total horror visually makes some scenes in this one i am trying to find a word disgusting this is wrongjust wrongover to the movie as a product  the production  well to be honest about this type of film and a globally phenomenon as this is very bad the story in the beginning to the actions starts to take place just hangs together on a thin thread so to speak bad film editing bad camera work one thing that is very goodnomore than goodexcellent the soundtrack from riz ortolani one of the best tunes made to a movie  the actors  both the director and the actors is so lousy that it almost feels that they sometimes read directly out of the script for their lines this is so low budget that if it was an ordinary movie i would have shut down a long time ago and i was thinking that about 10 minutes into the movie  entertainment  how a movie with real animal killing can be entertaining no no no i was just curious and watched this  age  18 due to extreme cruelty real killing of animals and nudity42 out of 10 the final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie short elucidation of the rating 5 approved 4 failed lacking in character,cruel
this is the best horror movie ever made i rate 1010 but i already see annalist rs rating 110 because a turtle and a monkey being killed and eaten pst i love animals too but come on stop being so fs and shut the fk up when i saw this movie for the first time i was surprised seeing how realistic was at first looks like a snuff movie but clearly it isnt however is one hundreds times more realistic that nowadays movies that are more computer made garbagei i recommend this film if you want something uniquei do not recommend this movie if you are an annalist fg and you cry after seeing an animal being killedstop reading cause i dont know anymore what to say cause i already said everything i wanted to say but this sd website doesnt allow you to comment if you dont write 10 fg lines,cruel
i wont write a 200 words review of this film but will simply define it in few linesthis movie surely is blunt in respect to its visual but i give it 1010 just because its unaltered  it present the modern society and primitive tribe the way they arei do find this movie quite relevant for today  the way media manipulate things  we are so materialized that we modern society literally has no limit for our goal neither for the path we chose to achieve that particular goal and urge us to ask ourselves who is the real cannibal ,cruel
gorehorror movie from the 80s the quid of the plot is that despite the progress of our modern society mankind still behaves in inhuman and primitive ways at first you feel despise for the cannibals but then you end up hating the white guysits real intention wasnt to be scary but to be shocking and while watching it i felt like its gotten old and as if its lost that effect this is why it doesnt get a higher score but still it might be worth watching it if you enjoy strange movies from the 80s its interesting to see that the bleir witch project was not original at all,cruel
4 people go into the jungle and just do brutal acts to the tribal people with the motive they think they will become millionaires because people want to see them bully the tribes take their food burn down their houses burn natives alive kill natives rape natives etc i dont think so some of the acts of violence just drag on it reminds me of movies like last house on the left and i spit on your grave like those 2 movies this movie is not scary at all and lacks any suspense its just repulsive and thats not horrorthis movie drags big time editing stinks as they show everything not sure why so many people like this slow moving movie in the jungle is not my thingthe things i did like the musical score you hear at the beginning and end and at times thru out the movie is a great tune also the last 510 minutes when the people start getting their just desserts by the natives looks pretty realistic those moronic characters got what was coming to them,cruel
i rated this a 7 out of 10 however i didnt like this movie the only reason was because i found out the animals were actually killed and it wasnt fake  there was absolutely no need for thati put that aside and rated it a 7 because it was well made and was pretty interesting and it was shocking there wasnt much of a story line but it didnt really need muchanyone who can stand animal cruelty will be fine but i just cant see any animals being hurt and those parts really upset me  and im a huge horror fan and can watch anything but i definitely cant watch animals being hurtvery well made for the year and budget and there is nothing else out there like this movie which makes it even more interesting its pretty shocking but there is worse out there nowadaysif there wasnt real animals being killed on this movie i would have loved it and i would have rated it a little higher too,cruel
ruggero deodatos is one of those movies that is truly going to split people oops should i have said it like that people who like exploitation cinema are going to rank it alongside citizen kane and dr strangelove while just about anyone else is going to want every copy of it incinerated one of the original found footage movies it contains every type of gory scene imaginable along with graphic rapes it could just be a typical excuse to assault peoples senses something that one of the characters notes that people want although it comes across more as a look at the question of what constitutes civilization the tribes actions are no more brutal than what the journalists do to the animals as gandhi said when asked his opinion of western civilization i think that it would be a good idea it should be noted that this is not a movie for the fainthearted it contains some of the ugliest scenes ever put on the screen i feel like i have to appreciate the fact that someone was willing to put this on the screen its the perfect example of exploitation cinema just make sure that you understand what kind of a movie it is before watching it,cruel
1980 the good the bad and the necessarysynopsis a team of documentary filmmakers go missing deep in the amazonian jungle in the search for legendary cannibal tribes never before captured on film a rescue team is sent to try and ascertain their fate only to find a gruesome discovery and the film left behind to tell the talethe good the idea is a brilliant one and it gives us one of if not the earliest found footage films but lets skip to the chase here the question is whether or not the idea works and i would say the answer is mostly yes whenever cannibalism is the concept the idea is to shock because thats why the idea of cannibalism is so appalling the idea that someone could eat human flesh is a primitive and rather nasty proposition if you see a movie titled and you think you are not going to see gore that is meant to shock the senses i am not sure what you are expecting so if its shock value they went for then yes they definitely did what they set out to do while the film tiptoes the line of believability i think the graphic scenes mostly do what they set out to do which is shock the senses i do have to admit though i am a hunter so some of the animal kills which i believe to be 100 real werent nearly as effective to me as i am sure they were to others there were certainly times where you could tell things were fake but when they threw in real animal deaths it made you wonder about the validity of the found footage that is an effective film because it did what it set out to dothe bad this is certainly a tale of two films the first 40 minutes is about the attempt to find the missing filmmakers it is not shot as found footage so it is just meant to be a movie then the last 50 minutes is some council of sorts watching the footage and trying to determine whether or not to publish it so some of it works and some of it doesnt the films opening leads you to believe that its all a documentary so thats what i was expecting so 15 minutes into the film i was scratching my head a little that it didnt seem to be filmed documentary style the beginning is a little slow moving and like i said it takes a full 40 minutes to figure out what happened to the crew and find the lost footage while there is some initial shock tribal rape the first part of the film is relatively tame and almost a bit boring the nontribal actors are not very good either both in the film part or the found footage which certain detracts from the authenticity aspect of the film the crew just doesnt act natural enough speaking of the crew they are my biggest beef with the film so a noteworthy documentary crew goes to great lengths to film ancient tribes and their rituals and really they are just hacks that stage everything to make a buck i dont buy it usually documentary film makers have a passion and love for what they do which is why they usually dont make much money or become famous they tell stories that mean something to them and that most of us would otherwise not see so instead of filming with those values in mind they torment rape and burn the villages of the locals simply to get good footage bah like i said i dont buy itthe necessary the question i asked myself as i sat through this film was is this a necessary thing to have to show i mean certainly cannibalism has a past and possibly even a present in this world it is fact that certain cultures have practiced cannibalism as a way of life or part of religious beliefs so certainly there is a tale to tell however is it needing to be told under the guise of horror or shock value its a tough question because most horror films are meant to shock your senses i guess maybe the component that is different is that rape torture mutilation and cannibalism exists and the story is shown in a way where you are meant to believe it as real footage this is why it is shocking to the viewers even if they know the found footage isnt real its done well enough to be disturbing especially given that there is enough real animal death footage to add to the real footage claim it was certainly done to add authenticity and it works right or wrong most will argue that real animals shouldnt have to die just so some sickos can enjoy being shocked watching a movie and i heartily agree still there is a raw disturbing feel to watching this because it affects you and thats what films are made to do especially the rape scenes which were hard for me to stomach because there is no joy or entertainment value in it theres no doubt you end the movie feeling like you saw something different regardless of whether you feel repulsed angry sad cheap or even guilty after watching this movie the fact that you felt strong emotion means the film worked and did what it set out to do for that alone the film is a success me personally i didnt think it was overly disturbing aside from the rape scenes and the animal deaths were nothing i havent seen in real life although the monkey killing is quite disturbing its worth a watch if you can handle the content just know what you are watching before you hit play,cruel
is a necessary cinematic example of the deterioration of morality when released from a cultivated civilized society a documentary film crew sets out into the amazon to study the lifestyle and sacrificial justifications between the conflicted tribes of yacumo and the yanomamo exposed to the undeveloped lands of the amazon it is soon realized that the behavior of the student posse undergoes a drastic and disturbing direction their acts of rape murder and destruction illustrate the distinction between human nature and human brutality their subjects as they see them indeed practice cannibalistic rituals and live primitively within the nature that surrounds them ironically this becomes reason enough to elect a congratulatory dismissal for any crueltyhumiliation and destruction the film crew inflicts because they are fundamentally above these uncivilized peoples as to be expected their victims lash back and resort to their animalistic resolution to threat  murderso tell me who are the real savages this film is very graphic and had raised a lot of speculation and controversy the only thing that i would like to mention is the mutilation of animals it is possible that the director may have approached these animal killings by asking these native people to demonstrate how they kill and prepare their foods the remains may have been used personal theorybeneath the bloodshed there is something to it,cruel
is a horrormovie directed by the italian director ruggero deodato year 1980 this film caused well a history when it was first made and released in the us united kingdom and italythe basic plot of this film revolves a team going trough the jungle of amazon basin searching for a lost documentaryteam professor harold monroe played by robert kerman is among the searchers after witnessing a gruesome rape done with a spiked ball they arrives at a village where they find skeletons from the documentaryteam together with some filmreels back in new york harold monroe decides to watch the filmreels in order to find out what really happened to the movie teamas i mentioned before this film caused a history when it was new ruggero deodato said his film was inspired by a reallife documentary which was much worse than this he was even supposed to be in prison for the rest of his life due to the belief that the movie itself was an actual snuff after getting released from jail he wanted to show some proof to the italian court that the human killings were fully staged the special effects in this movie must have been so realistic hence this actual snuff beliefonly the infamous animal killings were real something which made this film to be banned in several countries like italy singapore and the united kingdomthis film is also listed as one of the 72 movies banned in the uk as a video nasty 1983norway is one of the countries where the film has been banned but released completely uncut in the mid2000s rated 18 other notable horror movies released by the scandinavian company another world entertainment include stuff like zombie flesh eaters cannibal ferox and eaten alivemy overall rating 810,cruel
if ever there was a case for banning a film this is it utterly offensive nihilistic and cruel sadistic and torturous to sit through this is a mean spirited exercise in exploitation that comes very highly recommended but with serious reservations you need a cast iron constitution to sit through itits set up like a documentary and plays out as such and remember people this is 1979 20 years before the blair witch phenomenon so this film was revolutionary in every sense of the wordit also makes some very powerful statements about civility and that the perceptions of civility are thinly veiled by a deep seated animalistic urge of survival in all of usi personally challenge any viewer to not be moved by the climax of this film and walk away unaffected it has a grimy gritty grindhouse look to it and all this adds to the layers of cruelty on screen i have some serious moral objections with the film the animal cruelty is truly reprehensible and unnecessary and its the reason the film loses a star but this is still a grindhouse classic that will probably never be matched in the annals of horrora classic,cruel
well i finally got around to watching i had been aware of this film for the past thirty years but had never made any attempt to actually watch it it just sounded too repulsive well as i say that is until now the reputation of this movie goes before it and its plot line is so well known that i just dont feel the need to go over it again what i will do is simply give my emotional reaction to it i think this is justifiable simply because this is a movie that assaults you i cant honestly say i enjoyed it i would say more accurately i endured it as many probably know many of the films from the video nasty list are amazingly lightweight and inoffensive well this one isnt in that category this is a very nasty and meanspirited affair indeed interestingly its director ruggero deodato was responsible for the other film on the video nasty list that is closest to s level of repulsiveness and that was the house on the edge of the park that one has a drawdroppingly excessive amount of sexual violence and its overall extremely disturbing both films make you feel somewhat dirty for having watched them i suppose you have to say that deodato is a very uncompromising director indeed these are films not for the notsoeasily offended many horror fans will find them too exploitatively nastyshares the very repulsive sexual violence of park but it brings in two other key ingredients namely an underlying social commentary and the infamous animal slaughter the latter is a feature of the italian cannibal films in general and it really makes for diabolically horrible viewing its a pretty low way to shock audiences by shooting a pig  okay youve got our attention but where is the skill in that in fairness even worse things happen in slaughterhouses every day but there is just something particularly nauseating about the gloating nature of the turtle scene with the characters goofing around with the poor beasts severed head for the camera all of the excesses of the movie mean that the social commentary is somewhat lost in the mix the idea that the media exploit events for their own gain is most certainly one that carries some weight particularly in the case of the italian 60s mondo movies of which i am sure were a big influence on this film but its so very very hard to get past the extreme violencehow to rate its one of the most difficult films for me to score because this is a wellmade film and it has definitely sickened me and that was the intention but much of the experience for me was a negative one where i felt somewhat debased actually watching it so i have settled for a middling score that reflects the skill and originality of this genuinely troubling movie but which also acknowledges that in many other ways i was appalled,cruel
tells the story of a documentary crew who go into the amazon jungle to film indigenous cannibal tribes and some time later their footage is found and we see the gruesome deaths of the film crew by the hands of cannibals this is a horror classic the film was heavily banned due to the graphic violence and gore but mostly due to the on screen killings of animals despite the horrific imagery being shown on film the music makes the movie feel like its not a horror movie because the music score seems to be happy and later turns crazy towards the end of the movie overall its a great horror classica classic found footage horror movie a must have on any true horror fans dvd shelf,cruel
the depiction of such savagery and im not talking about the actual cannibals here is so disturbing it hurts my soul and body looking past the cannibalism the graphic sexual violence mutilation brutal animal killings which was real adding to this films notoriety this is actually a wellmade film sure some may say its not gory enough that coming from a generation where the basis of how good a horror fim is by how much blood and goo was shed or how many extremities were amputatedthis was made in the 80s and you gotta give ruggero deodato props here hes a genius from the camera movements the internal organs which looks so real that makes u rethink twice whether this is truly a snuff film and those were really from dead actors and his ability to repulse his viewers and hate his film so much they feel so exploited after watching it and vowing never to endure such a painful viewing experience again then yeah genius as ive saidit is a film about medias exploitative nature for the sake of sensationalism its not about cannibalism its about human beings innate savagery hiding beneath the guise of civilization i mean lets face it despite our pretentious superiority among all other gods creatures we are still animals with animalistic instincts locked up by the weak cages of social norms and civilized manners begging to break out we see it on the news everyday in history classes that makes this film so scary because deep inside us as we watch every brutal scene unfold eyes wide with horror we know that men are capable of what we were seeing its easier to watch ghost films or psychokillers bashing their hapless victims heads because we think its just plain crazy and unrealistic but to see civilized people killing other people killing animals raping lying just because they can its beyond scary and its realawful repulsive horrifying insulting  degrading esp if you are a woman and u see the rape scene impalement and forced abortion this is one film you will never want to see again but its also one of those that you have to see before you die so therei give it 45 because its so damn effective,cruel
much like faces of death created a controversy as to whether it was a real snuff film or a series of staged events a group of three men and one woman travel to the amazon to catch some native jungle people for a documentary they dont return and so a professor from new york takes the same route in order to solve the mystery of course he smokes a pipe and figures out a way to make the natives who all seem to have hair that looks like moe from the three stooges help him out he brings back the lost footage and we get to see the four from the original journey behaving badly by burning their huts and gang raping one of the young women the acting is bad and the script even worse a turtle is disemboweled and a monkeys head cut off in addition to other acts of animal cruelty the bad soundtrack only adds to the amateur look of the whole thing i was not offended as i am sure that all those tortured and killed on screen are quite alive in the mood for a degrading check out the original version of i spit on your grave instead,cruel
finally watched whats all the fuss sure there are some disturbing scenes the animal ones being the most yeah i get the point of the film as it is directly stated in the last line which was rather poor and we didnt need it or were people back then that stupid but besides a few effective scenes there was really noting else here sure it was brutal in its plot and what the crew did but frankly i ended up not caring all that much the film takes turns very randomly which never really allowed me to be invested in it too much overall sure it was disturbing but so are a lot of films nowadays i can see why it was maybe in 1980 but now it just remains an average film many people will claim people didnt like it because it was too sickon the contrary it was only really sick in the animal scenes for good reason which by the way i find no excuse in what they did to the animals but whatever by tomorrow i will have forgotten about this film and its nowhere near the level of a serbian film in both story execution and graphic content but of course i didnt get this film so my opinion on this infamous horror film is meaningless,cruel
having just watched the uncut version clearly a low budget poorly acted film that somehow  and i guess i shouldnt be surprised  utterly mesmerizes and disgusts as the violence and barbarity increase from beginning to end good grief i had to turn away on at least one occasion the first being the real life gutting of a small ferret like creature the real time real life animal killings are disgusting and hard to watch but having said that shoulder a lot of the emotion generated after watching the film yup i thought about it for days and occasionally still think about a month or so later i havent looked at my dogs in the same way since not for the feint of heart for sure but for open minded film viewers who still enjoy more than the special effects storyless garbage hollywood puts out a must see,cruel
pretty straightforward yet effective storyline has a group of intrepid documentary filmmakers immersed in the jungles of the amazon running afoul the otherwise placid locals after they exploit them for the sake of their documentary recovery team led by porn actor kerman aka rbolla no less discovers evidence of the expedition that reveals a harrowing tale of exploitation and subsequent gruesome retributions gruesome being the operative worddespised for its blatant animal cruelty fortunately theres a dvd release of this previously banned video nasty that omits the ghastly scenes in which defenceless animals are brutally killed for the sake of celluloid the dvd i purchased also featured a revealing documentary in which director deodato explained the market forces that briefly made this sub genre a craze in italy and a marketable commodity to the western worldmemorable scenes abound some perhaps too graphic for the average punter and yet despite the often sadistic confrontations theres still evidence that this is just a film  eg the mudcaked victim of the infidelity ritual is clearly a caucasian woman in disguise in fact it was the wardrobe manager who agreed to participate when no other willing candidate could be persuaded not exactly a work of art but an important film nonetheless,cruel
so cmon this movie is banned in 33 countries banned in what sense like porn movies are banned or how i mean quentin tarantino kills more men in his films than this one does and so does rambo and the rest of the gang this movie does indeed show a lot of skin and a lot of violence but does not deserve the honor of being banned or at least it does deserve to be banned as a bad movie and as a waste of 15 hours of your life but hello then 99 of the movies should be banned the entire movie is a joke the act is played badly there is no conflict the characters are poor so 3 reasons not to see this movie 1 unnecessary human violence 2 unnecessary animal violence 3 a lot of picture of the two above3 reasons why to see this movie 1 it is considered a landmark of the genre  so see it for yourself and never again be biased by people suggesting to see a movie 2 none 3 none,cruel
perhaps im the wrong person to review a horror movie as i dont really care for them anymore i loved them as a kid and the more extreme the better i liked them this is why i was intrigued to see i had read so much about it and the trouble it caused that i had to see what the big deal was im still waiting to find out this movie is a joke the directing and acting are terrible go figurebad acting in a horror flick the characters unlikable since i knew ahead of time that there are real animal killings i was able to stay on the lookout and i forwarded past them call me a wimp but i see no reason to watch animal slaughter for cinematic purposes so excepting the animal cruelty i have no freakin idea why this movie was barred in what 5 countries i fail to see the controversy the gore is absolutely laughable and is no worse than any of the faces of death movies the cannibal people apparently had no language of their own because all they did was grunt and scream to communicate this gives these scenes the air of being conceived and acted by teenagers with clubs governments arrested the director for indecency people actually thought this was snuff ridiculous maybe for 1980 this was a little tough to take but audiences today should know better it really aint that bad so dont believe the hype the movie on the other hand is that bad,cruel
although i am a strange guy some will say i have basically a stomach of steel i did not find the murder of animals onscreen revolting or offending but rather quite a willtaking thing to do yes i have been to world of deathcom before but even though i liked this movie very much there were things i hated about it1 the sounds and effects of the shootouts at the beginning were awful there wasnt even blood 2 even though i can stomach most stuff i did not like the fact that a woman vomiting for real onscreen because of the turtle dismemberment scene i dont know why but vomit anywhere just disturbs me far more than animal abuse 3 not as horrible as they say it is the violence isnt as bad as lets say a silent hill or saw movie most of it is onscreen yeah but when its offscreen lets say the raping scenes its not that bad dont believe everyone who says it is unless you too have a stomach of steeltheres my closing comments um yeah would be 10 out of 10 without those flaws though,cruel
when i first heard about when i was about 11 curiosity gripped me like a python the reviews on the film and the controversy only made the grip tighter so i had to track it down for myself when i first saw it i was taken back i couldnt believe what i was seeing about thirty minutes in i turned it off now what feels like five years later i watched it again and im ashamed that i stopped watching midway because i didnt get to finish what was one of the greatest films ive ever seenthe film follows professor monroe an anthropologist who goes into the amazon jungle with a search party chico and miguel to look for a missing group of filmmakers who had been missing for several months the film crew had trekked into the jungles to do a documentary on a cannibal tribe through out the movie we see monroemiguel and chicos growing relationship and alliance with one of the tribes their relationship is sometimes overwhelming heart felt and beautiful in on scene monroe strips naked and swims in the river to show hes one of them several tribe women join him and they have a splash fight and lots of fun chico and miguel are smiling from the shore and the mood is palpable you cant help but to smile despite the tribes sometimes distrust theyre relationship stays true into the half way marker of the film where monroe returns to new yorkthe film knows how to set you upin the scene previously mentioned with monroe and the river the mood changes from very heart warming to revolt and terror when the following scene cuts to the remains of the film crew in field as well as an earlier scene where chico trips on a turtle shell and discovers the remains of another person from the crew felipeas well as other scenes such as the murder of a womanwho was punished for committing adultery and the killing of someone from a rival tribe the second half of the film is monroe in new york watching other projects by alan yates the head of the film crew and the salvaged footage from the cannibal tribe documentarythe footage shows alans different intentions for being there as well as much more there are several scenes involving alanfayemark and jack disrupting the peace within the tribe the burning of huts the shooting of a pig and later the rape of a tribal woman two of the more disturbing things caught on the footage consists of the killing of a turtle and surgery of a woman the tribe ends up having enough of their actions and seeks revenge in the only way possible the last twenty or so minutes consists of the murders of jackfaye and the off screen deaths of alan and markthe film ends with an executive telling the man running the film projector to burn the film monroe leaves the building smoking a cigarette and the film pans out a view of nyc while the theme music plays  after the release of the film it has gained notoriety for being one of the most if not the most controversial film ever made it resulted in the arrest of deodato for the animal killings and almost for the rumored murders of the actors the contract signed by the actors in which they had to disappear for a year for the sake of realism was broken for the sake of the court case read the trivia for more about this this isin my opinion one of the best films ive ever seenyou can sometimes forget youre not watching a documentarybut a hollywood filmand the music adds to another level of suspense and terror with this as well im giving a 9410 go watch it sometime,cruel
there are a lot of horror sub genres out there slashers psychological horrors monster flicks supernaturals i could go on but i am telling you is in a class all its own well it probably fits in with the other extremes like this but i digress nothing you have seen will prepare you for this if your looking at my review chances are your probably debating whether to watch this movie or not the only people i would recommend this movie to is horror fans who want to test what their able to handle im a huge horror fan who wanted to quench his sick thirst with some of the most gruesome and freaky movies over the halloween weekend admittedly ill just say i was not ready for thisits actually funny how i came across ch i was in the hostel 2 forum reading about what people had to say about it ive already seen that then i came across a poster who said he was glad that he had seen the scariest movie ever finallylol then someone posted back to him are you serious he then replied you know something worse little did i know his recommendation would scar me for the rest of my lifethe story is about a anthropologist who foolishly sends 3 reporters to a jungle to find the other reporters who didnt come back needless to say i forgot the rest of the story because for the last 3 14 of the movie i was fighting back vomitdont get me wrong it is a good movie for what it is the director did a great job at making the story something that you could actually understand the actors while i must say do a alright job in this movie they have to be downright fing crazy to even be in such a human disgrace like this i do applaud them however cause i swear you will never in your life see alistor b for that matter actors and actresses in a movie like this everim not one to spoil a movie especially in a review i write so ill just say this there are extreme torture scenes that regardless of your gender will leave you with your mouth hanging open hands clutching your chest and your mouth repeatedly saying oh my god if you are having doubts about watching it dont watch it if any of the hostels made you sick dont watch it if you plan on watching with a girlfriend or boyfriend dont watch it if you just watched one of the scariest movies you ever seen in your life dont watch itbut if your a horror fan and want to see how immensely your thoughts of mankind can be pushed to the limit i dare you watch with caution,cruel
i heard about this film because of the programme the perfect scary movie when it was discussing found footage films like the blair witch project also many have heard about this for being apparently the most controversial film ever made especially in the video nasty market so i had to see what all the fuss was about basically new york anthropologist professor harold monroe robert kerman with experienced guide chaco losojos salvatore basile and his assistant are heading for the jungles of south america to find a missing film crew director alan yates carl gabriel yorke his girlfriend and script girl faye daniels francesca ciardi and cameramen jack anders perry pirkanen and mark tomaso luca giorgio barbareschi were there filming a documentary and have been missing for two months they arrive and during their time they meet both tribes living in this environment the yanomamo living by the riverside and the the shamatariyacumo or tree people both at war with each other after spending some time with the seemingly friendly but torturous to their enemies tribes people the team do eventually find the remains of the documentary crew and the undeveloped film cannister after returning to new york professor monroe plans to show the film to the public on a tv station but not before fully reviewing the whole reel and what he discovers is much more sinister than he thought the film reveals that the tribes didnt just torture and kill each other but the film crew were killed by the people and their flesh was eaten in hideous cannibalistic fashion all the action of flesh eating pulling a pregnant womans foetus out of her body a woman with a pole going through her bottom and coming out her mouth animal cruelty and much more besides has all been caught on film and the tv people agree in the end it should be destroyed i was certainly shocked by the foetus moment and the flesh eating scenes are nasty enough but all the stuff in between was a little annoying it is a little laughable now that this film was taken to court to determine that it was all fake but certainly the animal cruelty is realistic but as a film just like the human centipede ive seen stuff i consider worse but not a bad horror worth watching,cruel
this film was recommended to me for being brutal and really shocking i dont know how much experience with horror movies you have to lack for thinking that but believe me if you do you better check some other movies like saw and final destination of course in therms of plot depth this movie is far better than them but i wasnt expecting a warning sign for the cruelty of the civilized men i just wanted some gore and this movie was a joke i nearly fell asleep but what can you expect its a film made in 1980ththere was something about how cruel and reckless the white man can get in this situation but i really wasnt paying attention so i wont argue about the plotim just warning you  its not a shocking movie happy three friends is more shocking tokio hotel is more shocking its the freaking 2010 and we have a lot more brutal footage in video games than this movie has to offer,cruel
a documentary crew ends up lost in the very depths of the amazon rather than let the mystery linger a search party is sent after them apart from two locals trackers the best available the only other participant is professor harold monroe robert kerman a world renowned anthropologist the fearless threesome equipped only with weapons and a firstaid kit delve into the unknown  their main weapon is wisdom and common sensea breakthrough movie which is not by no means for everyone most people may not be able to throat this extreme exploitation movie which looks as impressive from filmmakers point of view as it did 30 years ago it remains no surprise that the italian jury actually believed this movie was no movie some of the scenes are absolutely mindboggling even if the provoke the occasional hurl and i have no idea how they filmed the impalement scene with such realism it is a cinematographic masterpiece that i believe will never get old and as a horror movie packs just as strong a wallop as back in the days it neednt be said that that in itself is an immense accomplishment very rough bleak downtoearth with a documentary feel to it remains breakthrough and a movie to which all similar pseudodocumentaries strive to achieve and never manage to with district 9 being the closestmuch smarter and better made that the similar cannibal ferox it is best not to exaggerate its message the director himself stated that he had no underlying deep thoughts whilst making his ultimate cannibal flick all in all the message is quite obvious and put straight in your face making the modern civilisation not any better and probably worse than the maneating primitives the title fits perfectly as it basically brings to the forefront the cruelty and immorality of the modern world with the cannibals at least having a clear if somewhat gross set of social rules not sure how selfaware the director was but it was very tongue in cheek to make a genuine social commentary about exploitation and snuff movies by making a nasty exploitation flickafter so much praise why dont i give it a higher rank basically because this isnt my piece of horror cake i didnt enjoy watching the movie or will not want to rewatch it i also found the meaningfulness of the social commentary gravely exaggerated although i must admit it sells the message well and it is very cleverly done also i was very much offended by all the animal cruelty and found most of it very unnecessary apparently ruggero deodata agrees and would probably never go down that route nowadays all in all if youre in to this kind off exploitation cinema  a must see if not  enter at your own risk,cruel
id heard of this film through various sources some being from reviews from friends and from books eg cult movies etc and with every source came a warning when i see a warning it just makes me want to watch it more id read nearly everything about the film so i knew what to expectbut it still disturbed me this was my first vipcos vault of horror film and i watched it with my friend who id told as much as i knew it was only a film and the acting was fairly laughable the special effects had the film looking like a snuff flick i understood why it was under investigation from police there are various scenes in the film which get carved into your mind and you cant forget i liked how it was filmed the style really added to its effect its filmed as a documentary off explorers cameras similar to the style of cloverfield but without all that shaky camera business the main theme love it really made me feel so uncomfortable for an old early 80s film this film delivered a shock that made hollywood films like saw and texas chainsaw massacre look like the teletubbies this film is a definite win if your up to been shocked and very disturbed not for the squeamish and definitely not for childrenthis is just my opinion but for just an average horror fan this really was a superb horror flick just remember this was only a film,cruel
i promise you that you will never find a more unsettling and graphic movie than its that kind of movie that viewers including myself must send a warning to any other person before they view that filmall of the rumors about this film that you may have heard are all truei cant recommend it as a film for someone looking for it to be a campy gorefestits a gorefest but it definitely isnt campythe director is very serious with the material that he put in the moviehe actually went to the amazon where nobody could stop him so he could film actual animals being killed in grotesque and grizzly fashionsa muskrat is gutted alive and is seen squealing and kickinga turtle is decapitated and has its breastplate cut open where you can see the guts even the heart is still seen beatinga monkey has its face cut off with a machete and has its head bashed and brains eatena piglet is shot in the headlets not forget the rape scenesthis film has the kinda rape scenes that even the last house on the left couldnt have made more graphic and disturbingif theres anything anything at all in this ugly movie thats beautiful its the soundtrackthe song at the beginning and end of the movie is just fascinating in a haunting and creepy kinda waydespite the grisly nature of the movie is a very wellmade and entertaining movieits shock value should definitely be taken in for credit of the movie because the director did not believe in censorship when it comes to filming the disgusting things that happen in this filmlet this be a warning this is a very good movie and should be seen but view it at your own risk,cruel
i loved the first time that i saw it about five years ago the film is about the mysterious disappearance of a documentary film crew who has gone missing in the jungles of south america for two months in new york city a tv news reporter tells the details surrounding their disappearance they are alan yates gabriel yorke the director faye daniels francesca ciardi his girlfriend and script girl and friends jack anders perry pirkanen and mark tomaso luca giorgio barbareschi who work as cameramen they were last seen near the remote columbian town of leticia which is deep in the jungle on the border between brazil and peru trying to film a documentary about cannibal tribes in the rain forest the film is very disturbing and very gory at time for some people to watch as this was one of the video nasties that was banned in britain for many years and was not available for a long time i think that was one of the best video nasties there was,cruel
ruggero deodatos masterpiece of mayhem and torture still holds up as one of the more disturbing films ever made and indeed it does have some interesting things to say about modern culture and more specifically the mass medias need to glamorize all and throw integrity and conviction to the wind for the sake of ratings and money but oftentimes this message which was revealed to be unintentional by director deodato gets lost in one simple fact this is a bloody messy cannibal filmexploitation to the max the film is about a professor harold monroe who has discovered the lost footage of four documentary filmmakers while investigating their disappearance in the amazon he takes it back to new york and develops the footage screening it for an audiencethe footage follows the filmmakers alan yates faye daniels and jack anders  mark tomaso they were shooting a new film about the cannibal tribes of the area and something went wrongthe films imagery is quite stirring granted i went into seeing this already having seen other films that used this movies iconic documentary style footage notably including the blair witch project and cloverfield but this films carnivorous and overthetop contents really elevated it in terms of just how disturbing it was to watchit is no secret that the film is controversial for its violent and sexual content and even i who is almost never bothered by violence in films was struck by just how devious the footage was from the infamous animals killings we see six real animals being slaughtered on screen which hurt to watch to horrific portrayals of murders and worse this movie really hits you in the guti will say however that this film also falls into a clich that has emerged in the years since which is that it is just too uneven at times i feel that the movies style almost dictated and necessitated a quicker pace and it is a bit of a chore to watch but allinall it worksalso i have to complain that for a horror film it just isnt scary its borderline but again unintentional satire works quite well and the film will generally make you feel awful but it wasnt particularly scary then again most horror films arent truly scary so this can be forgiveni suppose the big problem i had with this film was the hype i was lead to believe it was one of the best the horror genre has to offer and while admirable it just wasnt quite as good as i was lead to believe but it still was very goodim gonna give this between and 8 and a 85 out of 10 its very good interesting and for a film lover almost necessary to see and own because of its status but its also slightly uneven i would recommend this film to the strong of stomach,cruel
there are gory movies there are exploitation movies there are violent movies and there is this movie may be the goriest exploitation movie of its kind till date banned in many countries this movie is surely not for the weak of heart the plot revolves around 4 documentary film makers who travel to south america to study about the local cannibal tribes there after much time passes by they are not to be found anywhere and a rescue operation is undertaken to find out what happened to those 4 after a search operation by the rescue team and staying with the local tribes there they find out the video tapes shot by these 4 filmmakers and they get the whole scenario what actually may have happenedplot is good engaging and even thrilling the actors chosen play their part perfectly the locations local people surroundings everything looks authentic and perfectbut there is a huge problem with the movie filmmakers often use the word cinematic liberty to explain their sometimes weird experiments undertaken but my question is shouldnt there be a particular boundary which should not be crossed for defining cinematic liberties i mean if cutting the head limbs and shell of a live turtle on screen shooting a live pig with a gun cutting the head of an alive monkey personifies cinematic liberty then hell with such cinema cruelty towards animals on screen is disgusting and should be a punishable offense as a veggie and an animal lover i hated this movie inspite of the plot being great and thrilling rating  510 for the cruelty on animals,cruel
this is your typical 70s80scusp independent low budget movie actors youve never heard of questionable acting poor dubbing in parts bbudget effects and camera work the only difference is this film is an exploitation film which is a genre of film that promotes exploiting shocking or lurid subject matter such films always end up with a notoriety to their name and often way overrated as a resultthe first and foremost thing about exploitation films is they are usually grossly stereotypical in cannibalism is exploited by means of setting up the stereotypical idea of what a cannibal is  an uncivilised and undiscovered tribe hidden in the depth of a jungle each member with bones through their noses and always portrayed as complete savages the cannibalism genre of exploitation films pretty much always follows the same formula in the first half of this movie were aware that the tribes did something to the missing film crew but the audience given little clue as to what or why we just assume they got eaten because the cannibal tribes are savages the end the first half follows professor monroes expedition into the south american jungle to uncover the truth cautiously befriending the tribe by means of assimilating himself into their culture this leads him to the discovery of the strange totemlike shrine the yanomamo tribe had erected with the missing film crews body remains and filming equipment he makes a bribery exchange with the tribe for the film and takes them back to americacue the second half of this film this is where things get troublesome the female executive of a news coverage empire wants to sensationalise the disappearances of the film crew by using the footage on the film to create a documentary uncovering the mystery of this undiscovered tribe professor monroe begins viewing the material and slowly starts to piece together exactly what happened to the film crew this is the interesting facet of the film  the social commentary on who the savages of society really are the film highlights this quite well however it also goes to unnecessary extremes to highlight this too this movie includes actual animal torture and slaughter a turtle is beheaded dismembered and graphically disembowelled a coatimundi is skinned alive a spider and a snake are killed with a machete a pig is executed with a rifle a monkey is mutilated and beheaded i have no issues with the concept of animal death in movies if its not actually real but this was real yes it added to the realism yes it highlighted the point that civilised men are actually the savages as opposed to the uncivilised tribes but it was unnecessary and very upsettingas professor monroe views more and more of this footage we are shown that the film crew destroyed the yanomamo villages raped their women killed members of their tribe basically executed an ambush that left this tribe who were supposedly completely unfamiliar with white man terrified for their lives thus the yanomamo tribe eventually fought back out of survival and the film crew became their lunch the cannibalism scenes were hardly graphic  well not to me i was expecting blood gore guts the whole shebang but all there was to be seen was innards being pulled out of obvious dummydoll cadavers i suppose the likes of more grisly gore houndhorror movies as well as the many mind boggling things on the internet have desensitised me plus its hard to be grossed out by the fake cannibalism after watching six animals being mutilated and slaughteredin the end after monroe has finished watching the footage with the executives they decide and agree that the footage be destroyed as opposed to using it to sensationalise journalism and fabricate a story for the purpose of well sensationalism monroes last words uttered before the credits roll i wonder who the real cannibals are you could say this film is a social commentary on western civilised society being the cannibals or the rape of the natural world by the unnatural the exploitation of others for western entertainment i would say thats not an unfair commentary to make because its true what does it mean to be civilised its an interesting question to askhowever i dislike the fact that animals were slaughtered in the name of sensationalising this film that in and of itself is hypocritical  the film slams sensationalism of the media and of the western world raping the natural world yet involved animal killings in the name of that exact same sensationalism apparently director ruggero deodato regrets ever making this film nowadays or at least regrets including the murder of actual animals and so he should i couldnt watch those scenes they upset me immensely the sexual violence was upsetting too though i understood its purpose to the plotthis film is not art it is not deserving of five stars or of critical acclaim it is in my opinion an overrated movie but with interesting concepts it is not the gore fest many would have you believe  animal cruelty aside its actually a pretty tame movie then again back in the day when this was released it wouldve been considered extremely graphic times have changed a lot in the horror genre of film though i hesitate to call this a horror movie  more of an exploitive cult movie i guess dont believe the hype about this movie this is a film for the morbidly curious rather than because its actually worth watching,cruel
a group of documentarians go into the amazon to film warring cannibal tribes unfortunately for them they dont make it back an anthropologist is sent in to find them and is horrified when he sees the grisly images they captured on filmlet me make a confession despite being a serious horror fan and having met ruggero deodato twice engaging in some interesting conversation with him i had never seen before i had a fairly good idea of what to expect from it as i was familiar with umberto lenzis cannibal ferox which i suspected was quite similar something i suspected correctly but i think its safe to say deodato went further than lenzis imitation didstarring robert kerman perhaps better known for his many pornographic films its not surprising that this film pushes the boundaries on nudity and cruelty men and women naked some of them sexually brutalized animals killed including a monkey who gets his face cut off and the infamous turtle scene i was actually somewhat disturbed by this film  at the very least rather uncomfortable one scene where an adulteress is punished was particularly disturbing for mei dont think those of you who are squeamish will want to see this one or those who dont like seeing animals killed yes virginia the animals killed on screen but if you want to see a horror film with some sense of reality in it this is it theres also a strong social commentary in it about what makes man civilized or not but i wont get into that youll see it,cruel
when i first heard of the movie i though it was just another stupid disaster movie later on i suddenly heard good stuff about it friends imdbcom etca guy told me that he cried of this movie because of its grotesque violence and animal cruelty and another guy told me this movie stank and he said it was horrible and rash and he wish that he never saw it it thought wow this movie is worth risking your life for i though of this as the real version of la fin absolude du monde from cigarette burnsin the beginning of the movie i got this good mood and the thoughts of this movie turning out to be a masterpiece of the 70s later on when i had spent time watching raping of women molesting of people animals getting molested and not to forget the poor little pig getting kicked at and shot made me cry it was just a total failure the movie just wanted me too feel bad and sick i guessim giving it 4 out of 10 because it only made me realize that i should treasure the good things in this world,cruel
first and foremost because its going to be talked about whether i want it to or not the animal killings its not that i have a problem with this but i feel too big of a deal were made about them id have to say the animal killings seemed to take up about three minutes in all most of which goes to the turtle scene im not complaining but people should just shut up about them especially when the likes of cannibal ferox and mountian of the cannibal god have worse anywayafter three years of waiting with great anticipation to see what i believed to be the potential holy grail of horror films i finally got around to watching this and i must say im somewhat disappointed which pains me to say in ways you couldnt imaginefirst off while i knew beforehand that this wouldnt be incredibly gory i most certainly expected much more gore and cannibalism that is my favorite aspect of cannibal films the gore now while many say this is made up by how disturbing it is i feel it fell just short of the mark here too partly due to the aforementioned aspect which subject matter like this its necessary in my eyes to go a little further furthermore if the film crew wanted to be gruesome and sensational then they shouldnt gotten a cameraman who likes to furiously masturbate while filming stuffits the only explanation i can come up with regarding the poor camera work of earlier bits of footage i also feel like the film wallowed in its message a little too much and lastly the film put a bit too much emphasis on those rape scenesas for good things the score riz ortolani is my favorite film composer and i make a point to see the films he worked onbig mondo fan here by the way ive loved it ever since i first heard it and its even better when watching the filmthe acting the people who play alan monroe faye and jack are all quite excellenteveryone else has too small of a part to mention alan yates is perhaps the best movie villain ever put on screen and it shows faye comes off as rather natural toospecial effects though as i stated before there isnt that much gore here what gore there is is incredibly realistic these make the final momentsmy favorite part of the film so great the use of real pig organs was ingenious and the leg amputation was one of the best partial dismemberment scenes ive ever seen while on the subject of harrowing parts of the film i also really dug the hut burning sequence now that was disturbing if there was more of that sort of thing this film wouldve been greatall in all it gets a 610,cruel
those who have seen either love it or hate it if you read reviews on this site or anywhere else ratings tend to land at the extremes rather than anywhere in between some give it 1010 others 110 as in all matters of taste it is absolutely pointless to attack the other side for being wrong about the movie the movie is what it is either you love it or you dontwith that said i obviously belong in the category of people who love so much so that i make no reservations about calling this one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the 20th centuryi cannot abide animal abuse i am to this day haunted by pictures of dead pets that i glimpsed for a second years ago i find the inclusion of real violence toward animals to be reprehensible and yet i realize its purpose and know that part of the overall effect of the movie is to be credited to this animal snuff by switching between real animal killing and fake human killing the line between fact and fiction is ever so subtly blurred and the effect is powerful i am very hesitant to defend cruelty to animals but it is undeniable that it is part of what makes so stunninganother key element in the movie is the breathtaking score by riz ortolani the movie opens with beautiful shots of the jungle filmed from a helicopter and accompanied by the most beautiful music ive ever heard in a movie then the music fades out the plot moves along and it isnt until much later during the most terrifying and meaningless act of cruelty in the movie that the theme song returns the effect is simply amazing i for one got goose bumps all over my bodythe acting is not oscarworthy but neither is it horrible i found most of the actors to be quite convincing and some of their reactions are certainly so since the actors reportedly often reacted with revulsion to the scenes in which they actedthe plot is wellstructured and flows with masterful steadiness toward the climax of the final scenes apart from a few weak parts the story and dialog are not at all bad the way in which the feelings of the viewer toward the four filmmakers are manipulated is sublime and ensures that the ending leaves one with a feeling of revulsion and satisfaction all at oncei cannot recommend this movie enough if you reader have not yet seen this movie i strongly urge you to seek it out it is of course possible that youll end up hating it for whatever reason and that is a perfectly valid response to such powerful material but it just might be that you react as i did with awe and reverence,cruel
i have seen somewhere i guess in a tshirt a phrase like who is the beast with an image of bullfighting in part has something related with that question practically we have two different views on the same subject one of them by balanced persons who are there for a reason that we can understand but the other by persons whos reasons are simply their own curiosity or better their own way to make money with something shocking i will be honest i bought this dvd exactly in january the very first days of 2008 by then i had heard the enough things about to make me had the enough desires to check it out and by then it was a complete surprise to find the dvd at my local store even my cousin made fun about that when i wanted to buy the dentist brian yuzna 1996 saying something like sure just to put it away like later i borrowed this film to a friend and from him i heard again all the situations with the animals especially the turtle sequence of course those situations made that this film wasnt the great one that it could have been and thats because those were contradictions for the film itself forget for an instant those horrible scenes we have a normal first part but of course we are tense but at the same time we learn here how possible is to make contact with the natives they have their own world there a world that was completely disturb by some civilized persons that were there to show the horrors of the green inferno without watching the reels of those civilized persons we realize the type of persons that they were and we know the thoughts of their own familiars about them on that way the film is great and the alreadytalked message is a very important part on that way harold monroe robert kerman has many great lines not only the last ones of the film would you like people to make money off your misery is one of them of course not even the fact that monroe saw the natives could stop those executives in their way to show the footage of the civilized team but ironically the footage itself was enough my point when i write about the animal footage was that the film has a strong point with the fact that people are interested in violence obviously the crew conformed by alan yates gabriel yorke faye daniels francesca ciardi jack anders perry pirkanen and mark tomaso luca giorgio barbareschi the civilized team knew that and they were on that business im totally agreed with director sergio leone who in a letter to ruggero deodato wrote the second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism i think it could have been as powerful as it is without the animal footage footage that obviously place deodato as one of the civilized team for a way to say it really disturbing stuff but at the same time this footage is part of in that way i found the introduction by the distributors of the film from the dvd quite accurate so in other words if you are going to watch this film you must watch the uncut version of it as if you can you must check the interview with robert kerman then really was what i expected and thanks to that probably i will not watch it again or at least not very soon even that i found in this a really worth watching film i really cant recommend it and it is simply as if you have heard stuff about it and you have that curiosity to know by yourself if everything is truth well i guess sooner or later you will watch it and as happened with a friend of mine if somebody comes to me talking about believing that is a cult masterpiece i will borrow it since is a film to see once you know where you are youre in the jungle baby youre gonna die but not the jungle the concrete junglegrindhouse releasing deluxe edition for sure this is a great presentation first of all it has a great package and the look of the discs is unique it has a booklet with words by legendary horror journalist chas balun and a great little poster of the film as for the extra material we have commentary by deodato and kerman the making of interviews and other stuff,cruel
i have heard rumors about this movie for 20 years i have seen the headlines and know that the crew members were arrested and later released i knew that that there were rumors that this is a snuffmovie which it is noti knew all that and yet i was very disturbed i wish i could unsee this movie i have watched horror movies since i was 7 ive seen everything there is to see but nothing could prepare me for thisthis is a masterpiece ten out of ten doesnt do justice for this film 15 out of ten might be closer i am completely sure that this in not only the most disturbing film i have ever seen but also possibly the best movie i have ever seen this is the way to do it bravo,cruel
i cant rate this movie on one hand its a poor nobudget gorefest with unnecessary animal cruelty and exploitation on the other hand its haunting atmospheric and thought trough one thing is sure there will never be a movie like this againstarting out as a campfest promise four youngsters travel into the jungle to shoot a documentary on cannibal tribes just when you expect to see the first decapitations we cut to a middle aged professor who is dispatched to find out what happened to said four youngsters the movie stays very serious from now on and has some very powerful scenes the sense that its just a silly movie passes and you become engorged in the insanity of the green hellthere are scenes in here i actually skipped bits of which ive never done in a movie before its not the fact that theyre inspired in their sadism because ive seen worse its that theyre real shot in the same shaky blurred style as news of that age our brain conditioned as it is to accept footage like this as the truth sees through the sometimes lacking effects and the hammy acting and becomes terrifiedin the end the movie does give you a little moral tidbit which doesnt surprise or irritate the moviemakers doesnt need to tell their point weve been shown well enough not even chuck pahlaniuk can conjure up such distrust and disgust in mankind for this will always be remembered,cruel
plot synopsis new york anthropologist harold monroe heads an expedition into the amazonian jungle known as the green inferno to locate a group of documentary filmmakers who went missing while making a film about the cannibal tribes who live there he finds the crews skeletons encountering the cannibals he recovers the rolls of film that the crew shot back in new york monroe is shocked to see the footage consists of the filmmakers killing  raping the natives but as the footage shows the cannibals get their revenge is the most notorious of the italian cannibal films of the late 70s  early 80s banned in just about every country in the world including italy the film was seized  the director had to go to court to prove that what happens on screen was faked which brings me to the films most disturbing aspect the gore may be extreme with legs amputated by machete a rape where the victim is bashed to death with a stone dildo a pregnant native woman being tied up  her unborn child aborted  so on but what is truly terrible about the film are the scenes of animal mutilation a muskrat gets sliced up a monkey has its head chopped off a pig shot in the head  a giant turtle is torn to pieces as an animal lover i find these scenes to be reckless  distasteful not to mention offensive sure the human gore is not bad but the animals gruesome deaths is too much to bear at the end of the day the film shocks  disturbs just what a good horror flick should do but goes too far with the animal cruelty,cruel
has a low rating on here for one reason and one reason only people cant take it it is the one film that ive seen in my life that crosses so many lines you get nervous about fifteen minutes into it you start to think what am i getting myself into here its exploitation at its most brutal and realistic anything further would be snuff its certainly the worst movie i ever want to seeif you are on that collision course with italian horror you are bound to come across this flick sooner or later if youre like me youll question yourself before watching it it contains some animal cruelty which while being horrific and hard to watch leaves a lasting impression on you that is one of love for animals and not hatred you end up hating the people who are doing it not enjoying the scenes id like to remind everyone that apocalypse now also contains a bit of this but people herald that film as a masterpiece see afis top 100 films along with the notorious animal stuff this film contains very realistic gore and special effects especially given the age and budget of it also contains scenes of such graphic cruelty that you will no doubt be shocked by what you are seeing regardless of movies youve seen beforemost importantly this film delivers a twist that while not totally surprising remains very effective it does have a message and its a pretty strong one at that what makes someone a savage watch this film and find out if you dareeffective bold imaginative and 100 nihilistic is a movie you will never forget9 out of 10 kids,cruel
while a lot of people would be offended by the subject matter i find it fascinating as part of a genre that wasnt like this at all part of the italian cannibal genre beginning with umberto lenzis man from deep river in 72 the main draw was as morbid as you could imagine since the only thing going for these movies was to see a bunch of people being eaten by cannibals ruggero deodato and franco clerici had the idea to be equal to the movies that were in vogue in those days part of the ongoing mondo movies like mondo cane and africa addio made by two italian mavericks called jiacopetti and prosperi who were also made famous by the same accusations of staging scenes for shock value on their documentary films of course deodato being a filmmaker decided to base his movie with this in mind as a tale of black ethics and demoralizing antiheroes that no way you would root for thats the power of this movie while i definitely do not agree with some of his decisions they are part of what makes this movie look so real theres no way a movie like this would get made today since this type of guerrilla filmaking doesnt exist anymore its obvious that deodato was filming without any regret or remorse and he wanted to make a film that would stick to you no matter what and he succeeded the tale is bare bones but its social commentary is what puts it above anything else in the cannibal genre and horror movies for that matter the camera work cheap sets and passable acting add just what the movie demands which is to say that it looks like it was made by amateurs not professional actors or filmmakers lets not forget that indeed the cannibals look bad because they have to be like that to survive in the jungle but the filmmakers in the story are far more depraved and horror filled that their means do not justify the end in the case of deodato i have only but praise for such a maverick director to tackle such a difficult project that will be vilified and praised as nothing short of a masterpiece remember that this movie was made in the 70s and just to be still talking about it proves its power to titillate and disgust for me its a milestone that will never be equaled,cruel
ooooooh yes this is a movie i will not soon forget i was at suncoast looking to buy some good horror movies as i do every other friday i stumbled upon a brand new copy of i had heard the stories and read the review on the flesh farm so i knew what to expect so i bought it brought it home put it on the shelf and waited for 3 weeks it sat there intriguing me and making me want to watch it but i wanted to wait until the perfect time so one night i had some friends over and us and my brother popped it in to watch didnt take too long to realize what we had gotten ourselves into this truly was the most gory disturbing and gross movie ever made and i never exaggerate i am being 110 serious when i say it is the most gruesome movie ever it will most likely make you sick it made my brother and his friend leave the room and me and my one friend stayed and watched until the end good lord however despite the gore the gutwrenching slaughter the lowgrade acting and the lowbudgetthis truly was a great movie robert kerman porn star was very well cast as professor harold monroe alan yates is truly the most evil realistic movie character ive seen the story was terrific the tribe people were very good as well all of them the deaths looked real according to reviews ruggero deodato was arrested after this was released and had to have all the actors show up in court to prove it wasnt a snuff film carl gabriel yorke alan yates says he was scared he was going to be killed on screen he also is haunted by the movie and regrets being in it a movie with these kind of aftereffects must be disturbingand it is i give this unforgettable movie an 810 warning watch when you dont have a full stomach not a movie for the weak,cruel
truth is i dont know how to review this film is competently directed and the acting is certainly up to par for what you would expect but to the average person there is very little entertainment value the film consists of a series of brutal animal killings and simulated human atrocities so realistic they landed deodato in jail for a while and still inspire argument to this day there is even a plot a fairly adequate if not inspiring plot that works well to serve up situations of extreme violence italian authorities seized the movie a few days after its first showing and tossed deodato in jail deodato managed to demonstrate the special effects to the courts satisfaction and he was released the special effects in some cases are so spectacular that against reason people are left wondering if maybe deodato didnt use humans or corpses rather than special effects im not familiar with deodatos other works but in he certainly shows his genius with gore i do plan on tracking down his other movies and giving them a look,cruel
viewing even the first part of its easy to wonder what all the fuss is about the film is fascinating in the sense that the locations werent really scouted and the process required amazing pains by the cast and crew kerman particularly does an outstanding job but the film itself isnt truly special at least not to the extent where it should still remembered twentyfive years later even the scenes with kerman and the tribe seem staged when there is no conceivable reason for them to it plays like national geographic without the cinema veritewhen they go into the jungle things change dramatically at first it is the extremely disturbing slaughtering of a tortoise who probably lived well over a hundred years before alans crew and deodatos if were being entirely fair came along even faye is unable to take this as she vomits at the sight of the mutilated animal betraying her tough exterior ciardi truly was disgusted by this and her revulsion is not faked the rest of the group gleefully tears into the creature yet we are taught to simply place this in the context of documentary objectivity just the other day i saw a random image on one of the nature channels an elk slips through the ice kicking and screaming and according to the narrator taking a long time to finally drown what is left unsaid is that in all that time the crew never attempted to intervene in the animals painful death after all they had to retain their objectivity and let nature take its course i cant help but think that the elk may have disagreed i would never approve of cruelty to animals but i merely point out that deodato practiced the same horrible things documentary filmmakers do to this daythe crew continues to stumble upon or instigate several grisly happenings as they record every moment they remind themselves to feign shock and disgust so the audience will not see them as monsters looking at the raw footage we know they are more interested in filming violence and tragedy than preventing it to be fair deodatos motives also remain unclearwhen the crew is left without their guide in the jungle things look ominous but they play up their quandary focusing on the work they do meet up with the tribe and find that while the images are interesting they just arent very good television under the guise of a nonexistent war between tribes the crew themselves comes in with their modern technology and brutalizes the tribe the tribe which has its own barbaric customs including a disgusting reprimand against adulterous wives are actually not as savage as the advanced interlopers eventually they even massacre them in a scene that recalls the american devastation of vietnamese villages like mei laithings dont continue to go as well for the crew as they try to make their way out of the jungle the cannibals hunt them down and their footage details their shocking demise its brutal and heartbreaking yet none of us could honestly say the filmmakers didnt get what was coming for them,cruel
my sister introduced me to this movie and i really though that its just an ordinary movie by the end of the film i found myself avoiding meat for a week and running away from people selling barbecue the movie wasnt meant to be a graphic thriller it was already a horror movie even in its titles sense perhaps the most memorable scene for me was the turtle scene it kind of made my stomach churn watching the turtles leg move after it was decapitated the rape scenes and reallife animal murders were too close for comfort and the thing that this movie could boast is a progressive ending if the first parts werent enough wait for the ending the scene where jack anders was dismembered and barbecued had me going vegetarian and faye daniels being decapitated was kinda cool the women of the tribe joined the action im really never gonna forget this movie as a result i lost around 3 pounds because i skipped meat for a week a new slimming idea if your stomach can handle it,cruel
i will tell you exactly what you get from this film to those that are familiar with the movie faces of death  thats basically what you get here why is the word cannibal even in the title i ask sure its suppose to be about cannibals but their portrayed soo idiotic  and the fact that its low budget it brings out the meaning you get what you pay for this movie sucks killings animals oki dont have a weak stomach so i dont mind but thats not what i wanted to see i was looking for a scary movie this has nothing scary about it i really dint know if the animal killings were real because the movie is soo low budget it all just seemed like a big joke the tribes acted so retarded that i was waiting for them to just look at the camera and say got cha  then i might of laughed and said ok so thats why ur so retarded you meant to do that  horrible film i dont even know what to say about it,cruel
this is truly a movie of contrasts beautiful and undisturbed nature and manmade fire consuming primitive houses pleasant and serene music and bloody scenes that are bordering on the edge of human comprehensionin this movie a group of well educated well meaning and certainly adventurous western adults visit a country of primitive simple tribal people the technologies and the clothing or lack thereof of the two groups are further compounding the contrasts between our societies the culinary and social habits of the primitive cannibalistic society are supposed to disturb and anger a civilized individual but what follows shows that were not all that different from the amazonian tribal societies we have anger perversion hate that are only enhanced by out technological capabilities who are the cannibals here another contrast could be noticed in the attitudes of the documentalists and the anthropologist who came in search of them the anthropologist managed to win back the primitives trust and good graces because he was ready to lower himself to their simplistic level at which they could understand and accept each other he came not to judge but to learn from these tribesmen ultimately he showed how the contrasting societies of our planet should deal with each other  not judge but accept not hate but connect not preach but bridge,cruel
riz ortolanis pacific melody opens up the credits which are printed against a sweeping shot above the amazonian jungle and the only hint we have of the horror to come is the title itself then the story starts in which we learn the infamous documentarist alan yates and his film crew has disappeared while shooting a documentary piece in the green inferno an area in the amazonian jungle the homeland of savages from which no white man has returned alivewith the help of two guides professor harold munroe ventures into that green inferno in hopes of finding the bodies of the filmmakers when he reaches the natives at last in an uneasy truce what he finds instead is significantly more chilling alans unedited film reels mostly undamaged and fit for viewingbut are they really fit for viewing the second half of the movie consists mainly of the professor and his colleagues in new york watching the documentary before they air it on television i do not want to spoil what comes next but suffice it to say that it is both shocking and soberingthe first thing you probably heard about this film was that is was violent exceedingly violent such a rumor is correct ruggero deodato achieves with 100000 what our modern torture flick couldnt achieve with 10000000 graphic violence that looks and feels real sure there are a few moments where the effects are obviously fake but most of the time the violence and sexual assaults are hideously powerfulprimitive to the core fitting that such acts should be associated with the indigenous tribes of the south american jungle tribes that are reported cannibalsbut then the movie raises this question who are really the savages is it the uneducated uncivilized culture groups of the jungle or is it the civilized people who invade their lives and take advantage of their naivety who are we to consider ourselves superior merely because we have an easier more fortunate lifestyle many people who sit down to watch this film do so in hopes of getting all the gore theyve been promised but what they also get is a great adventure yarn and on top of that is timeless social commentary that will make this film outlive more than 99 of the horror movies that have ever churned themselves into the theaters i am not exaggerating here this film is a timeless classicadmittedly this film will never make its way into a mainstream audience it is off the deep end of extreme cinema and very few moviegoers will have the stomachs to stand this film i recommend that you keep this in mind before you decide to watch this masterpiece and make sure the little kiddies are tucked into bed or if youre like me wait until your parents and siblings are tucked safely away in midnight slumberother aspects of this film satisfying actors a mockumentary style that isnt at all distracting or annoying if you didnt mind the shaky cam in the bourne series you wont mind it here a musical score that is unforgettable the main theme counterpoints the extreme violence and makes for a memorable viewing experiencecinephiles watch this now gore hounds prepare to be satisfied but also be prepared to think everyone else who can possibly stomach this movie start stomaching to those who dont fit in this category im very very sorry youre really missing out,cruel
who can stomach it that is not only does this film deliver what is promised it raises many morality issues that so many films attempt to acknowledge but fail horriblythe basic plot is good as it is a professor is hired and funded by a college to rescue a team of documentary makers who went missing in a jungle in south america however it is made all the more intriguing by his find of their films  and his ultimate screening of the films to tv executives upon his returnthe gore is all there but in such an instance i would say the term gore is unnecessary as the violence within is wholly necessary literally each wound is there to provide some support to the story or actions of the characters  after all this is about how these people lived so none of it was out of order for themthe film brings up the idea that attempting to westernise or alternatively attempting to demoralise foreign or what some may call primitive peoples is a foolish idea and that the very idea is primitive in itself whereas the use of the word primitive to describe the peoples is infact misused as their way of life is simply different to our own a fact which most of us westerners find difficult to comprehendim gonna round off now cos as you can see i could go on for years about thisbasically what im saying is that the film isnt about the violence its about the people and how they deal with the situations and how they treat each other and peoples with whom they are not familiarif you choose to take my advice and view this motion picture then hopefully by the end if it effected you as it did me you will find yourself  like the films dr monroe  thinking who are the real cannibals a metaphorical question not literal its obvious who the real cannibals are this is undoubtedly one of the most impacting and best films i have ever seen  view away,cruel
i came across this movie on the internet and being the diehard gorehound that i am it sounded good i was surprised id never heard of it before i ordered it for myself with high hopes and even though i read about the senseless killing of animals for nothing but pure shock value i sat through most of it i came out a little disappointed when it was over i expected more i guess the effects were very good and some of the film was difficult to watch especially the scene with the forced abortion far as the animals go the turtle was 100 not necessary and barbaric i read about this scene and when i saw it coming i left the room so my husband filled me in to my dismay the camera work is good and the score is haunting and beautiful when you watch this you realize who the real barbarians are and it aint the cannibals i pondered the idea of getting rid of my copy but i may hold on to it as part of my collection i do know its been collecting dust on my shelf and it wont see the inside of my dvd player anytime soon,cruel
1980 d ruggero deodato s robert kerman francesca ciardi luca barbareschi m riz ortolanistraight laced university lecturer kerman is presented with the case of four documentary filmmakers who disappeared in the amazonian jungle leading an expedition to find them he discovers a tribe of natives who feast on the flesh of humans the most memorable part of the film consists of the recovered footage of the illfated documentary crews exploration of the tribeas repulsive as it is important is a genuinely unsettling film experience deodatos relentless portrayal of cruelty and violence is by no means reserved for the cannibal tribesmen  the documentary filmmakers are presented as voyeuristic and violent peoplea comment on italian mondo documentaries of the 1960s and 1970s deodato makes a clear point about the invalidity of reporting on primitive civilizations when the filmmakers themselves revel in the sadism and cruelty however deodatos social commentary falls short due to his own actions during the films production  the genuine slaughter of animals and the reuse of violent footage from a mondo documentary are precisely the actions that the director is condemningperformances from robert kerman and francesca ciardi are the highlights here with fine supporting roles from barbareschi and salvatore basile the acting is generally of a higher standard than other italian exploitation fare as is the production music from riz ortolani is chillingly misplaced in parts the score is one of the films most notable achievementsthe strength of the imagery in is the factor which to some renders it unwatchable to others however it is the films most shockingly effective feature whether you love or hate deodatos exploitation film you will certainly not forget itone might argue that is the most effective horror film ever produced for me this is a perfectly valid argument never before had a film taken the unique stance of actually attacking the audience with such brutal scenes never before had a director blurred the line between fictional killing and actual slaughter to such an extent that some genuinely believed to be a snuff film important and brutal deserves none of its reputation as a schlock horror film  it is far more valid than that,cruel
this movie was by far the most graphic and intense movie ive ever seen when i finished watching it i thought that maybe the footage in it was a real documentary and that the actors had been slain imdbs trivia revealed that the director had to go to court because it was believed that he killed all the actors in the moviethis movie made me look away more than once due to the gore and blood content im very squeamish if only gory movies by hollywoods standards could hold a candle to thisif you want a movie with tons of rape genital mutilation real animal deathtorture and realistic cannibalism this is the movie for you,cruel
anyone hungry this film will test the most hard stomach person with its intense gore and grotesque scenes which will change your cinematic experience forever if you think this is the type of movie to watch while with your girlfriend than your sadly mistaken this isnt your normal horror movie its not even horror at all its a total new genre in itself some scenes in this film really make you think what was the filmmaker thinking from a slicing open of a little rodent animal to a innocent tourtoise being sliced and diced the film really crosses the line and makes you appreciate you dont live in the amazon as a filmmaker ive come across many films that cross the line but this film is possibly the most insane and grotesque film i have ever scene the film score is quite spooky but at the same time relaxing and kinda puts you into a trance,cruel
yes to answer a lot of questions this movie is disturbing serious and at times extremely gory there are animals killed and plenty of gore aside many people die painful brutal horrible deaths that make the viewer want to turn his or her television off do not dont look away the purpose of this film is to teach a lesson the average city man is not as civilized as he thinks he is even compared to a tribe of ruthless cannibals we still reign the most ignorant and careless deodatos shows real animal killings to show that we just dont give a care about who or what dies we destroy the rain forest we deplete the ozone and we cause global warming there could possibly be a day where we who trash our precious and dear mother earth could see ourselves as savages then how would we act,cruel
first off this film is not for the faint of heart it is absolutely brutal its not violent throughout though its definitely a horrordrama the director ruggero deodato really makes you get to know each character none of that bullsht where you cant remember a characters name and couldnt care less about what happened to them this film really pushes it to the limit and does a good job of itthe downside to this film is that the animal killings are 100 real and graphic a coatimundi sort of like a muskrat is killed and eaten a turtle is pulled from the water dismembered disemboweled and eaten a pig is shot in the head and eaten a monkey has the top of its head cut off and a native eats the brain rugger deodato wanted to use a fake monkey but the native insisted it be real because monkey brains are a delicacy to them also a tarantula is cut in half and a snake has its head cut off but nobody cares about them because theyre dumb the animal killings however brutal they are to watch arent that bad considering that the cast cooked and ate them afterward its merely food preparation in graphic detailoverall if youre looking for a pointless film with tons of gore and depravity this is not for you youll be bored out of your skull go with something like murdersetpieces or august undergroundmordum if you want a great drama that isnt too graphic go with something like green mile or the godfather or city of god because this will shock the sht out of you but if you want an amazing drama that makes you feel for the characters but also has mind blowing gore and depravity then look no further because this is the film for you 8 on my top 10 of all time 3 best horror of all time incredible movie,cruel
i just saw this movie for the first time but after first seeing the blair witch project this movie was better only because it actually had some horror in it   major spoiler alert    dont read any further if you havent see the movie the main criticism i have other than the dated score was how the atrocities were depicted on the one hand the film crew drew first blood against the natives while no horrific music played in the background these acts were no worst than what an enemy tribe would have committed yet when it came time that the natives retaliated then the horrific music played i kept thinking if you go into the jungle to commit a massacre on film of course youre going to get what you deserve in the end the natives were better off left alone   end of spoiler    i read that the music was particularly beautiful after seeing the movie i disagree i thought it must have been ok back in 1980 but i believe some people would find it annoying by todays standardsa lot of what happens that drives the characters forward is from their own observations of the natives unfortunately their misguided motivations are what get them in real trouble much of the reasoning behind the actions of the natives other than the retaliation is unknown or pointless and its the assumptions of the film crew that attempt to explain whats going onthe methods vary but the animalkillingeating was the most violent part of the movie if you look at if from the standpoint that everything else is acted out but these actions are no worse in the end than what any seasonal fisherman or hunter would do seen or unseenas far as the authentic moviewithinamovie footage of the road to hell is concerned its far too brief even in the 96 min deluxe edition version and only depicted what sort of history the film crew had and could have easily been omitted without being missed,cruel
i think this film is really pointless its about an hour and a half of insane violence and its too graphic there you go thats it i really dont get it besides the audio isnt the best overall good scenarios poor acting and not much of an argument its just in the end when you can resume something about the film when the professor says i dont know who are the cannibals we or them you can dig really deep on this thought and make a conclusion because of the actions of the foreign group into the tribe but i really dont know whats the point in such violent film such disgusting film in a way there are some scenes that are out of line totally unnecessary scenes the killing of a rat the killing and dismembering of a turtle the really really graphic and intense and gore rape of a young woman i mean its really not necessary to show this kind of scenes but anyway what do i know youll have to waist your money on a rental to see what im talking about,cruel
perhaps this is the most disturbing film i have ever seen in my life this movie contains some gruesome killings of innocent animals and the rape scenes of a native girl as well as the rape of the film maker after seeing this movie my mind has gone insane and not been able to concentrate well eat well or even sleep welli wont recommend anyone to watch this film as watching this movie will drive you crazy last week when i saw the movie i was not able to sleep all night the film is shot as though you are seeing the actual footage the the young american film makers make during their visit to green inferno a deadly area in amazon forest for most of the time during the film i really thought that the footage shown in the film was realthe rape scenes in the movie are also disturbing also the punishment to the adultery is also very gruesome and gore overall the killings the punishmentthe rapethe blood and the revenge makes this film the most mentally disturbing movie ever made,cruel
this is truly an original piece of cinematic art in an era of multimillion dollar hollywood special effects gets its point across in a direct unflinching manner unfortunately this film has suffered from the hype that the film is hyperviolent but then again isnt nature and the wild itself my generation has seen iraq 911 and colombine so in actuality a fake docudrama doesnt get me all the worked uphalf way through the film one realizes the power of the film when it is revealed that the journalists themselves cause the cannibals to war and commit violent acts among each other in an era where marines are being tried for murder in iraq it does make you think i wonder who the cannibals really are,cruel
at the beginning sorry for bad english i liked this movie a lot and since his rating here is 6 i needed to find out why it is so low so i read many users comments non of them didnt mentioned that this movie is about capitalistic society when professor talks to the lady from tv network he says something like would you like people to make money of your misery that reminded me of a quote from carl marks capital in which he says capital is a vampire that sucks out the life from the worker and that is exactly how capitalist society works workers are forced to work much for small wage cause they have family to feed they get only the small piece of what they earn and the rest goes to capitalist who gets richer and richer every day the other thing that made me to think this way is that at the end when professor say the last line i wonder who the real cannibals are camera focuses on the skyscrapers that somehow reminded me of the pyramids that were build on the suffering of the slaves the 3rd thing is that alan and his documentary crew is literally eaten by their desire for money success and famecause modern society force you to wish for these thing and dont leave alternative for happiness and selfsatisfactionso we must ask ourselves who are the real savages are they the jungle people who will kill a man for food or the ones who byes 50 million  yacht while millions of people starve to deathwhen this movie was made this wasnt such a big problem but today we must think how to force the big companies to cut their profits in order to save environment or we all might soon be eaten by desire for progress and profit to do that we must change the foundation of society as we know it now,cruel
first i dont know how to effectively rate this so i choose the middle ground but thats irrelevant im not sure its a movie thats made to be rated in any normal wayno use rehashing what the plot is once more suffice to say its very efficient and was at the time pretty innovative but the plot device would have been moot were it not for the stunning craftsmanship of ruggero deodato and co its an extremely well done production and i have never seen anything like it before or since one of the main protagonist of the movie is often overlooked the amazon jungle its probably one of the most terrifying place ever rendered in any movie wouldnt be half the movie it is were it not for the permanent sense of foreboding one feels amidst the oppressive scenery its easy to have empathy at least on that level with the film crew deodato makes the viewer feel like hes lost in the middle of nowhere in an incredibly dangerous environment where everything can happen at any time by ricochet this sense of terrible isolation takes its toll on alan yates and friends and is also part of why they snap and produce mayhem on the tribes they later encounter the last reel of the crews footage is probably the most intense thing ive seen on a screen it is apocalyptic disorienting sordid and heartbreaking in more than one way indeed is a sad despairing movie and even though by that time the viewer is supposed to despise the film crew it is quite disturbing to see anyone end up that way the pirkanen scene is a moment of such savagery of such disregard for a human being that it stays with you for a long long time from his castration to his complete dismembering its a vision that will make anyone suffer one of the most haunting scenes in any filmi have to add that these scenes and most of the rest of the movie wouldnt pack such a punch if it were not for the incredible score by riz ortolani which is the soul of the movie and the reason why some parts are so hard to watchon the touchy subject of the abominable animal killings perhaps everything and its contrary have already been said about those but there are some precisions to addthe they were killed for food line of defense doesnt hold close scrutiny im afraid the shot baby pig wasnt eaten afterward but left for dead as is for one secondly the infamous monkey scene had to be shot twice so they in effect killed two animals i highly doubt the friendly tribesmen stuffed their face twice with monkey meat because of the movies needs their love of monkey brains notwithstanding same as im not quite convinced that tribes people do have goofy fun with turtle guts prior to eating it when they hunt one when i saw pirkanen enjoying his fun and playing with the turtles severed head still gasping for air in front of the camera i somehow doubt it made his food betterfor those who have the grindhouse dvd edition its said in a crawling text introducing the feature that this matter has been a subject of regret for everyone involved ruggero deodato included allow me to highly doubt that to say the least as recently as 2003 when the onehour documentary on the feature was shot none of the crew involved seemed to regret anything in that area to put it mildly barbareschi who is the one who shoots the pig among others goes even so far as saying he simply didnt give a s at the time and still thinks today that the scenes and the movie called for it ie the animal butchering so please enough hypocrisy already it seems to me that the crawl text regarding the socalled regret of the makers was put there by grindhouse only to justify what is otherwise a good idea ie offering an animalcruelty free version of the film on the dvd i dont believe for one second that it is a sincere comment though the only ones apparently genuinely disturbed by this aspect of the movie are carl yorke and robert kerman it was like they had pierced heaven as he put it in reference to the muskrats cries of pain and anguish as it is being slowly and painfully sliced open not deodato not barbareschi despite everything they might tentatively say to the contrary as it stands i think the film suffers much from this its the movies major drawback as has been said repeatedly beforeno matter what the message is annihilating lives for entertainments sake is vulgar cowardly and inelegant case closedall that being said i think the point is not to like or hate this movie its qualities are obvious as are its few but very nasty drawbacks the point being its an experience unlike anything else in cinema whether one wants to have that experience or not should really be an informed decision the first time i saw it 25 years ago i wasnt in the least aware of what was ahead and at the time i deeply regretted having seen this watching it again recently has put of course a perspective on the way i see the film if only because ive read so many things about it since i first saw it but even so many of the old sensations came back as the film unfolded when i watched it againthis is a very very potent piece of filmmaking this is something you cant ever unsee and its very unlikely youll be able to forget some of the imagery once youve seen it so proceed with caution and dont presume of your resistance to awfulness this one has shocked many a gore hound,cruel
many people claim that this film shows how the socalled civilized world is actually brutal and violent that may be true up to a point but the overall tone of the film still portrayed the indigenous people as inferior stupid and worthless this film was incredibly racist in its portrayal of the indigenous people of the amazon the animal torture and murder was completely unacceptable and unnecessary however the point could be made that the same type of thing happens on an enormous scale every day in factory farms the acting was utterly terrible as was the dubbing the cinematography was strangely captivating at times and many of the visual effects were quite believable the film tried to be philosophical but it was really an excuse to make a brutally graphic exploitation film that would shock viewers and cause controversy  which it has now been doing for decades people do not watch this movie to understand how indigenous people are affected by the invasion of documentarians settlers imperialists or any other outsiders people do not watch this movie to understand the medias obsession with violence and sexand people dont watch this film to better understand human nature people basically watch this film to see how graphic and disturbing it really is some even watch it because they enjoy the content the former is understandable the latter is upsetting to say the least this movie is gore for gores sake with a pathetic attempt at creating some semblance of a moral that is not to say however that the film is completely without merit the realistic style was interesting the constant nudity male and female definitely goes against the grain and lastly the effects were very innovative for their time with that said the overall movie was racist misogynistic cruel and in extremely poor taste supposedly deodato regrets having made the film it probably would have been better if he hadnt 2 out of 10,cruel
this is itthe definitive film in the cannibal subgenre of italian horror films billed as the most controversial film ever made perhaps no film is more deserving of that title than according to reports the film maker actually spent time behind bars for animal cruelty due to the scenes of actual animal killings and torture in this film but this was only after he had to produce documentation that proved the actors in this film were still alive and that he did not make a snuff film this is the original pseudodocumentary film designed to make the viewer believe that what they are seeing is real films like faces of death and the blair witch project would later attempt to duplicate this style of film making but this is the first film of its type and for this reason it deserves its place in cinema history despite of or perhaps maybe because of all of the controversy that still surrounds the film today often imitated but never duplicated this film with its scenes of cannibalism rape murder torture bizarre native rituals and animal slayings is a film that truly needs to be seen to be believed,cruel
a great deals been said about ruggero deodatos grindhouse masterpiece that its been banned in numerous countries real animals are slaughtered on camera or many believed it was an actual snuff filmdigression aside should a person watch yes and no the sensational title leaves no doubt that it is not proper viewing for everyone even many disreputable 42nd street moviegoers thought the movie too intense with that said film buffs looking for a little more extreme cinema may as well start here is considered the epitome of this particular genre the jerky handheld camera movements and plot can be widely recognized in future films such as the last broadcast and blair witch project examination of media violence was covered here long before natural born killers deodato has gone on record as saying that oliver stone is a fan of his pseudodocumentaryin the final analysis should be commended to a degree for its out and out ballsiness just dont expect to finish a sit down with this mother unscathed,cruel
hell when i was younger this film sounded like a dream for me younger i mean 14 only but a year ago i heard of this movie and i took a shine to it ive always been fan of gore movies and things that generally screws with the mind for about a year i thought of the movie and wondered where to get it and so on then i was watching cannibal the musical and it came to me i remembered ch so i pondered over the internet looking at reviews and clips and so on i thought hey ill watch it so last night i decided to download it i know its illegal but it was just to see if it was worth getting the special editioni got it i was a happy boy i started watching and i was bored at first then it all started to happen the vicious savage beatings the slaughter of animals the rape of that women which was seriously fed up considering the dude who did it shoved a load of mud in her yeah i kept on watching and then it came to the first real gory scene the muskrat scene i saw the man pick up the muskrat and just put a knife through its throat it screamed and the man kept doing it i was delighted i knew i was in for a treat the film is well made in my opinion i just loved how it was all filmed so carelessly like it was a bunch of people going through a rain forest well made yeah especially the brutal scenes of death it looked so real it makes you wonder if it is real at times the turtle scene where its horrible ripped apart was amusing its head kept moving xd a lot of scenes were generally pointless like when the goofy army dude walked around naked with one of the cannibals on a leash what the hella lot of scenes satisfied me but a lot were a bore theres not much to the movie except shock value i thought the women impaled on the stakepole was hilarious and yet looked so real with the animal killing scenes i was comforted by the notion they were eaten by cast and crew after filming its not a film you want to watch with your girlfriend or wife or someone like that unless they have a screwed up mind like you do the part that was rewarding to watch was that asshole of a rapist get his penis cut off yes justice is servedthe film is great fun to watch unless your an animal rights activist i gave it a 910 because it was enjoyable but its very boring at times,cruel
just that wowthis is a powerful film and to say the least wowdont get me wrong peta would and probably does hate it i understand them killing animals for fun is wrong killing for food is understandable but what about cannibals then i wont touch that subject with a ten foot stickbut this film does i was expecting a flimsy splatter movie and what i got was a film that actually had something profound to say you think this is funny then youre sick and depraved the film makes it totally clear that what it is showing is utterly wrongbut to make a film like this in that way is dangerous people are going to get the wrong idea ruggero was driven to court and had to publicly show that the actors werent killed for entertainmentbut i feel like im just blabbering on it becomes nastily realistic and wile you get the feeling that some of the shots dont hold up it feels realistic and you are torn between your feelings in the end when they are ripped and raped to peaces by the natives that where openly offended by their acts of depraved misconductas he said it makes you wonder who are the real cannibals experience this movie dont look for pleasure just experience it,cruel
well what can i say i heard about this film back in 1991  i have just watched it this year grindhouse released it uncut with a director  actor commentary  i just had to buy it i knew it was going to be nasty stuff with all the rape violence animal cruelty nudity misogyny so why watch this in the first place well the same reason why you are reading this out of curiosity this film is a cult classic of an extreme hardcore savage nature its not for everyone but if you dont mind exploitation  if your not easily offended then check it out everything you may have heard about this film is true they sure dont make em like this anymore,cruel
is a film that goes beyond the lengths of accepted cinema banned and heavily censored the world over here is a film that surpasses is reputation as a shotgun blast to the senses what you will see will definitely shock and offend you nonetheless it should be viewed as a disturbing historical document of a bygone era of extreme irresponsibility which no longer exists and hopefully will never exist againis the apex of italian horror cinema if you can find this hidden cinematic treasure purchase it and be prepared for a journey unlike anything that exists within the cinema of today it is a film that stands alone with a message that still grasps as tightly as it did almost thirty years ago,cruel
i had been waiting to see this film for some time and finally broke down and bought the rereleased 2 disc version all the stuff i had read about this being the mother of all sicko films had me expecting a completely over the top film experience maybe i watch too many sick and depraved horror and exploitation flicks but i must say that did not deliver the knockout punch i was hoping forthe plot needs no major highlighting here lets just say that the story follows a college professor and his guides and they attempt to find a lost group of young filmmakers who had set out to document elusive amazon tribes the professor manages to make it through several encounters with various tribes and finds film canisters revealing the fate of the first party it is the viewing of these canisters where the tension is supposed to come from in this movie i will say that the idea is unique for the time and was obviously ripped off for blair witch projectthe first party of young filmmakers end up being total assholes who ravish and manipulate their footage trying to show the savagery of the primitives but only end up revealing their own violent nature you guessed it the primitives turn on them and horrible things ensueto its credit takes itself more seriously than other cannibal movies therefore it has higher production values and a decent story line the scenes of savagery are nasty in some cases with the adultery punishment ritual being particularly disturbing my gripe is with the way the younger filmmakers were disposed of the film goes out of its way to shock only to have what should have been a long gruesome death turning into a quick slash em up they really missed an opportunity to let the cannibals show the full extent of their brutality on the film crew who obviously deserved it a real let down after some decent buildupis more vile and disturbing than 99 of most movies out there but for me it just missed being a classic of forbidden cinema,cruel
in 1999 a film called the blair witch project was released there was plenty of talk surrounding the horror megahit mostly because of its jerky handheld unsettling camera work but no one knows the technique was pioneered in the notorious controversial 1980 film director ruggero deodato was arrested shortly after its release and the film was confiscated deodato was charged with the murders of his actors in the film the charges were later dropped when the actors turned out to be alive and well only serving a short sentence twentysix years later its still as controversial and sickening as it was back in 1980sal or the 120 days of sodom will always be the most disturbing film to me but in terms of violence wins and ive seen my share of shock cinemahas been known as one of the most notorious movies ever to grace our screens and deservedly so mostly for its attitude realistic human murder scenes and of course the real onscreen animal slaughterings especially the infamous turtle killing where a large turtle is beheaded deshelled gutted and eatenmostly shot with a handheld camera the film is given a more grainy quality and realistic feel to itanother quality to the film is that you end up supporting the cannibals for the white filmmakers are more savage than the savages themselves ex animal killing burning a village and the rape of a nativeoverall the film is good but its not for everyone its not a life changing experience like 2001 a space odyssey or sal but itll stick with you for awhile and youll definitely feel the need for a shower after you watch it,cruel
this movie is overhyped and there was no explicit sex in the movie at allso if you rent or buy this movie looking for explicit sex youre wasting your time and money the people responsible for adding to the list of movies with explicit sex missed this one by a mile over all the movie is poorly actedand just another low budget b movie i found nothing shocking at all about this movie maybe when it was made it would have been considered shocking but by todays standards this movie lacks in shock value and may draw an r rating but certainly not an x rating nor have been banned from movie theaters around the us simply put it was almost laughable at times,cruel
this movie blew my mind the first time i ever saw it i just kept thinking to my selfturn it off turn it off but the truth was i was captivated this movie make and other horrorthriller look like peewees play house scared the crap out of me i just couldnt believe that this was acting the director even got thrown in jail for 6 months because it was so realistic and the police thought the actors had really been eating by canniblesoverall a brilliant movie not for the weak stomached but brillian nonethelesscomment by stickboybobhttpnalocomicsinfo,cruel
the movie starts pretty slow and totally without gore  people are shot but doesnt get a single wound or anything like that many will probably find it hard to make it through the first half of an hour without asking themselves when are someone going to get gutted the theme melody in this movie are fantastic pretty cheerful if you ask me it constantly starts playing the most illtimed moments in the film but i guess its to add some more effectsi was also a little disappointed with the amount of gore i saw the uncut version dont get me wrong there is a lot of gore in it but i just hoped it was a little more gory when this film has the record for having been banned in over sixty countries and some of them still forbiddens the uncut version but still there is a hardtowatch scene in which a reallife turtle gets cut open is it just me or does its guts look like eggslike i said good but not that disturbing as everyone says,cruel
when you see this film you cannot decide who is the real beast white man or wild man or who is the wild great film i recommend this film to anybody who likes a bare film that strips all clothes of fiction and reveals the true nature of mankind alltrough the film is from 1980 it creates a choking image of the brutality of the jungle or maybe the concrete jungle the title is perfect because it creates an image of what happened under ww2 but watch the film and see for your self personally i miss more films from director ruggero deodato because modern film miss the rough reality and all trough you can see the missing effects of modern virtual effects the barbarian message comes out i wonder who the rest cannibals are,cruel
this is the sort of movie that people might hear about but few actually see therefore people who are familiar with one of its versions start to feel proprietary about its reputation after all whats the point of digging it up and sitting through this poorly edited ridiculously acted grindhouse shock film disguised as selfreflexive subversive social commentary if you cant wax critical about its wonders its worth seeing for the spectacle if you have the stomach but dont fall for the hype about its importance if youve never entertained the notion that civilized people can also behave barbarically perhaps it will seem profoundas a mockumentary it has little value and some discussion about its breaking ground in this department is clearly overlooking louis bunuels much better land without breadinstead of comparing it to a truly disturbing work like wild at heart it is actually better compared to a movie like saving private ryanmuch like saving private ryan one leaves the film with little doubt that an unscrupulous film maker has used the least pleasant regions of human experience in the service of his own career dressed it up as art or culture and let other people do the work of figuring out what it was really worthprecisely like saving private ryan it is ultimately disappointing people are made of meat bone and various sacks of juice it is not all that hard to take apart a body and the world can end for any of us in the least pleasant of ways without remedy at any time it doesnt take a genius to figure that out and it certainly doesnt take a genius to film it it is something to see youve never seen anything quite like it if you want to get a fairly good idea of what happens when a human being gets taken apart either movie will be quite helpful if you need help visualizing a gang rape will be quite helpful,cruel
possible mild spoiler nothing bigfirst of all i feel a bit dirty still that being said what a truly outstanding piece of cinematography is this film truly took my breath away although gutwrenching at times not for the faint of heat i like many of you have seen many many movies in my lifetime no movie that i have ever seen has touched me the way that this movie has nor offended me in the way that this movie has this movie had to be made and should not be censored of banned history should be remembered by all in every gory detail furthermore what kind of halfwit would honestly think this was a snuff film even after investigating it not to say that it wasnt some of the most convincing effects that i have seen kudos to the effects crew to do what they did on a 100000 budget but in no way was i ever convinced that any human actually died in the making of this film,cruel
a lot of people hyped this movies as being graphic in violence etc in spite of animal killings rape torture mutilation and full frontal nudity i wasnt shocked at all this may have shocked people before mtv and the internet but im guessing know one really have nightmares about this nowadaysit has its moments though the jungle imagery combined with the fantastic score by riz ortolani is marvelousbut the reality  including the last road to hell sequence and anything else that might impress people is made out of pure luck or coincidence i dont believe deodato to be that talented just check his cvrhorrormovies can not shock people anymore we have the internet for that a 5 out 10 movie,cruel
i got curious about this movie a while back after reading about it on imdb downloaded the uncut version and began watching in anticipation of something truly shocking disappointment would be an euphemism for this crap of a movie bad acting  in fact there are no actors in this moviethere are performers  pathetic direction  director too along with rest of the crew seemed to have lost the direction in jungle make up  name one amazon tribe who look filthy and prefer to have sex like deviants editing  cinematography and every other movie department may be i am too jaded but this movie as well as a movies like caligula left me bored i mean if u want gore and sex then a visit to the slaughterhouse and a german scat flick would suffice ohyesi almost forgotthe background score is kind of good,cruel
this is it people the holy grail of extreme cinema the apex of exploitation all avid film buffs particularly those with an interest in horror hear of this notorious exercise in cinematic depravity sooner or later what makes it so infamous where to beginthe plot is simple a group of american filmmakers seeking to study primitive peoples have vanished into an area of the amazon basin inhabited by two warring cannibal tribes nyu anthropologist harold monroe is sent to investigate and this is where our film beginsprofessor monroe played by porn star robert kerman is justifiably shocked by the cruel rituals of the natives but earns the cautious friendship of the secretive tree people when his band drives away their enemies he shortly discovers the missing film crew whats left of them at any rate along with their footagefrom here on out holocaust becomes a grueling endurance test as the viewer is assailed by gruesome imagery and scenes of unimaginable violence the adventurers are shown to be sociopaths who crudely hack off their guides leg when he gets bitten by a snake eagerly filming his death burn down a village roasting many of the inhabitants alive gangrape a young girl and smirk at her terrible fate the film does a marvelous job of turning the viewer against themthe cannibals wreak terrible vengeance in the climax and deodato pulls no punches castration decapitation and rape are among the acts committed against the vile crew and all are graphically depicted are we supposed to cheer their arguably justified revenge or condemn it as the monstrous act it is or are we simply meant to cringe at the grotesquerie of it the film closes with a troubling if not exactly subtle thought voiced by monroe i wonder who the real cannibals are this is the films raison detre the message it is trying to purvey the uplifting forces of civilization havent eradicated our darker impulses which can emerge under the right circumstances there are those who say the deeper meaning was simply tacked on to justify a morally reprehensible exploitation film undoubtedly there is at least some truth in this criticism regardless it remains unsettlingly relevant today over a quarter of a century after its release moving on to the technical aspects the cinematography is nicely done the fauxdocumentary footage is appropriately shaky and scratched immersing the viewer into the world of the green inferno riz ortolanis score is simply magnificent ranging from soothing to harsh as needed one of the best effects in the film is the juxtaposition of the placid theme with images of extreme violence disorienting the viewer the acting is generally solid particularly when compared to the other italian cannibal films with kerman giving an especially strong performanceit would be amiss for the films most controversial aspect the authentic animal killings to go unmentioned in particular the butchering of the turtle is one of the most stomachchurning scenes in cinematic history the suffering of the animals is terrible to see although they werent dispatched in cruel ways these scenes have the impact of a sledgehammer blow and ramp up the intensity to almost unbearable levels needless to say this is not for everyone the violence is far too extreme for a mainstream audience and the animal deaths turn a great many off but for those who can stomach it holocaust is a disturbing look at the violence inherent in human beings it isnt simply one of the best exploitation films ever made its a great horror film period,cruel
a documentary film maker from new york city sets out to the jungles of south america to find a missing documentary film crew amidst the heat jungle perils and violent conflict there he eventually manages to find the crews bodies and their film canisters he brings the footage back to new york along with its disturbing revelationsheavily censored widely banned and extensively bootlegged this is probably one of the contenders for the single most notorious film watching it is no easy task and even more so when you read up on some of the things that went on during production  real animals were killed for example however blood guts and gore set aside this is a surreal and nightmarish journey into bowels of human treacherycomplemented by a soft and touching score the film is packed with the very contrasts and absurdities that it tries to point out also the film while well before the reality tv craze is a shocking commentary on just that how real can you get how much more are you going to have to add to please your increasingly callous audience as the film points out  too much one of the many disturbing and poignant sequences is the slaughter of a turtle for dinner  the soft touching score plays as the characters happily butcher a hapless animalthe films main absurdity is that the film makers themselves are in a sense guilty of the crimes that they so harshly criticize  violence as real as possible to get an audience now the film is not fully exploitative in that it uses the violence both real and fake to make its point but the idea of real hits very close to home here you are in fact watching what you are not supposed to in a couple scenes however you know what they say fight fire with fire the same can go for criticism but the line between it and pure treachery can become controversially thin so controversial in fact that the director and producer of this film were arrested during its first release which resulted in the banning of the film in over 60 countriesdue to the films constraints and production difficulties there are a few scenes that seem to be missing something most notably a monologue after the killing of a pig but if you have the stomach for it this is one of the most brutally compelling films youll ever see also to keep in mind this is not a film to be enjoyed but taken in 810the grindhouse dvd released in 2005 is unrated also uncensored and has disturbing violence graphic gore and rape proceed with caution,cruel
ive been hearing about this movie for a long time so i decided to check it out its the disturbing tale of 4 new york film makers who are trying to make a movie by exploiting the natives in a jungle where 2 cannibalistic tribes live a scientist guy who found it is trying to discover what happened to them and stop a company from airing it on tv thats the basis for this hard core gore film apparently all the scenes in which animals are killed were real and the human murders were pretty damn realistic too however after viewing a turtle getting beheaded and gutted a young pregnant native getting the fetus ripped out then bashed on the head with a rock a women being raped with a rock a young female native being raped by americans and then seeing what they did to her afterward impaling her on a spike through the back of her head coming out of her mouth im extremely glad for what happened to those arrogant americans but i have come to a conclusion this is just an excuse for extreme gorethe story is irrelevantone more thing i have been thinking is who is this film marketed to not a lot of people,cruel
i dont know what score to give this filmit has a few good questions about the nature of humankind but it is packed up in some twisted scenes i felt sick about 90 of the film so if you want a movie that can give you that this is a good choicethere are scenes of murder rape slaughter animal cruelty cannibalism  many details that make it look horribly real the thing i liked best was when the questions about who the real savages was came up who are the beast in reality the best reason to watch this is because of the fuzz around it and to get an opinion about this movie now that ive finally seen it i wont see it again,cruel
i decided i had to see this film after reading all the reviews hereand to be honest i didnt have high hopes for anything more than some hardcore gore boy was i wrongthe whole story was great and i loved the way it is done in a documentary kind of wayit really helps you get into the filmi can easily see why he was called into court to prove that the actors were in fact not killed during the making other than the stock footage and animal killingsi dont think i have seen more realistic fake deaths in any movie even in todays wonder age of cgi the acting wasnt brilliant but the characters came across very wellthe cinematography and editing were both top notch much better than expected for such a gory moviei found the music a little annoyingim sure it would go down better in the 80s but does seem dated nowi did find i had to look away at times during the animal killingsi didnt find the turtle scene as shocking as i found the cries of the little rat thing they kill very early in the filmi didnt watch any of that scene the sounds of the poor little critter was more than enough to send a shiver up my spine so if you are a animal lover like me just get the version sans the animal killings i knew i wasnt going to like them but like them or not they are part of the power of this filmi dont think i have seen anything that really freaked me as much as this movie yes i frequent such wholesome places as rottenogrish etc and have also seen the faces of death series paramedics etc and yet none of the real imagesmovies i have seen have the power of this filmthis really is one shocking powerful filmnot for the faint hearted but if you think you can handle it grab the dvd now,cruel
this is by far the most extreme film i have ever seen well actually i think there were only really ten minutes of extreme footage in it but these were enough to send me into a catatonic state i have seen so many violent and horrific films in my life i remember seeing the exorcist at age 6 and not being as disturbed as i was by this film now all the stuff actually looks pretty goofy in a lot of ways but the animal scenes particularly the turtle scene are just obscene they went to such extremes in its mutilation that they were only trying to accomplish one thing and that is to make people very very uncomfortable and they really succeed in doing so when we see the genital removal scene also it is very well made and looks like it is really being done i am of the belief that they used cadavers to make this scene as i just cannot understand how they could make it look so real anyway i would rate this movie higher than a 7 but at times felt it to be just a little off taste which is the aim but i just didnt approve in some regards anyway check it out if you have not seen it already and if you have a liking for this sort of film you will not be disappointed of that you can rest assured,cruel
it is not surprising that this film stars a former porn star the plot plays out pretty much the same way much like a porno where the plot serves only to get you from one sex scene to the next the plot of ch serves only to get you from once scene of intense gore to the next here is the general idea a group of documentary film makers goes to the amazon to film cannibals they disappear and so some big wigs in ny hire a guy to find out what happened to them he finds the film and takes it back to new york with him where they watch it in a attempt to have the footage shown on tv the plot of this film is really of very little consequence if you are interested in this film it is surely not for the story line anyway it is for the gore the idea here is fit as much over the top gore into one movie as possible want to see a turtle dismembered you got it want to see a guy get his cash and prizes cut off no problem how about a woman getting a forced abortion and then having her newly aborted fetus buried in the mud sure it goes on and on the acting is subpar at best the tribal rituals are laughable excuses for violence and the only really disturbing scenes in this movie are the when violence is done to living animals i am not a charter member of peta or anything but i dont really need to see someone greedily digging through a turtles innards thats just me though,cruel
i have just finished watching this filmand i have to say that its really not as bad as i was expecting i am not trying to display swagger and bravado and huh ive got an iron stomach and nothing fazes me attitude but i felt that all of the violence was completely in context with the storyline i didnt think any of it was gratuitous all of the nudity and violent acts had a place in the story it was relevant to the subject matter even the animals which were killed i didnt think it was done in a macho wayonce again i felt that those scenes belonged there i hope i dont appear insensitive because i am not i will shed real tears over rspca stories of animal abuse as well as being a contributor to animaland peoplecharities i think thats the difference here the animals were used as food it would seem and not abused which is where the difference lies overall the film is quite good no way deserves all the sensationalism it got gets there are far more gory and gratuitous things on ogrishcom and i definitely think the crewin the film deserved everything they gotwhat a reprehensible bunch they were i admit unashamedly that i cheered for the tribespeople when they exacted their revenge on allan and co for the barbaric acts the allegedly civilised peoplecommitted against the yacumo and yanomano peoples,cruel
this movie is so gory and disturbing it overshadows whatever merits it may or may not have in its acting cinematography directing etc the live animal killings didnt really bother me maybe they would have in another movie but not in this one because i was still recovering from watching some of the native people perform a forced abortion and hit the fetus with a rock and bury it in the sand there is also a wonderful little scene where the natives bludgeon a womans vagina with a rock or something awful like that because she committed adultery by the end of the movie when you see a mans penis hacked off you are sort of numb to all this overthetop violence dont see this movie even if all the violence was offscreen or censored somehow it wouldnt be a good movie because the acting is terrible im not one who usually gets squeamish during movies but i promise that if you see this movie it will be the most disturbing movie you have ever or will ever see but maybe thats what some people want,cruel
i saw a newspaper ad for this one in philadelphia back in 198182 even the cameramen were eaten alive wasnt sure if it was true but it definitely had me hooked whoever was behind the hype deodato deserves some kind of award the blair witch people obviously learned something from thiscouldnt take my eyes off it despite all the brutality i couldnt turn away this flick took shots at the reality tv types 25 years before they existed americans  canadians can also figure this is similar to what was done to the indians deodato may have technically capitalized on what he was supposedly against but he did it so well put this one with make them die slowly and have a double bill that will blow you away,cruel
this is a picture any shock or horror fan should see it sets the standard for a whole bunch of movies like the blairwitch project too much hype who claim a semireality feeling to the picture if anything negative has to be said it is most certainly the use of useless to the plot onscreen animal mutilation furhtermore the movie has a very well crafted structure with the first part looking for the missing ones and the second part what they did to deserve their fate anyway as exceptional as it gets and the only cannibal movie which is really worth watching look for the similarities on make them die slowly aka cannibal ferox of umberto lenzi,cruel
these guys were working on a shoestring budget and they were extremely inventive in creating nice low budget scenes that still worked and were emotionally intense the scenes with the natives were especially well donei just feel sorry for all the jungle animals that were brutally killed to serve as free extras in a brutal horror film you will consistently see scenes where a real live jungle critter is slain and chopped up for eating sometimes while still twitching and trying to escape i found these scenes far more disturbing than the simulated human cannibalism scenesthis is a fantastic achievement of horror given what they created it from very little if you want to test your grossout ability this movie will put you to the test this movie is a 70s movie and follows that classic laid back pace and displays a culture where looking dorky was still coolthe movie style itself is quasiblair witch and may have served as an inspiration for that later flick our hero films his search in the jungles for a film crew who disappeared trying to capture cannibalistic tribal rituals on film as a documentarythen we see some of their footage muahahahnot a date movie kids,cruel
this film is probably one of the scariest movies i have never seen i only knew about it after watching a programme on a scary film countdown i saw a bit when the cannibals were eating which looked like a human arm and it looked so real it made me question whether or not this film had real cannibals starring in them and if they did shouldnt they be in prisonif youre a horror fan i would recommend you to see this film i havent seen it but i was scared to death on the bit i just told youthis is one film youll never forget i havent forgotten it yet i watched that programme a long time ago because im still young im kind of the oldest new guy to filmsi hope ill watch one day and when i do ill be back with a lot more comments good bye for now,cruel
this film doesnt come with a strong stomach in the box so if you dont already have one avoid it the uncut version like the plague a synopsis can be read on any film site so ill just cut to the bone no pun intended this is the most awesome gorefest ever to grace the silver screen and with films like the guinea pig and august underground  series made since then thats really saying something for people who dont like people or animals and i dont this is the most fun you can have especially if you watch it with uninitiated types without going into too much detail a small group of people go into the amazon and with complete white man arrogance start to fk with the natives literally leaving them fair game for all sorts of nastiness they film their exploits with complete disregard for the danger that lurks all around them and their film is later discovered and shown to a couple of normal people who raise the only moral objections in the whole film with the exception of the guy who found the tapes the film contains multiple scenes of rape white on black black on white and torture including a particularly nasty scene on the coast as well as an exceptionally high amount of animal torture look out for the scene involving a knife and a screaming muskrat even i found this to be quite disturbing all in all an excellent picture with enough gore and sadism for the most twisted of us if you like it youll really like it though if you havent seen cannibal ferox i would advise watching that first to strengthen you constitution if youre just going to watch it and then complain about the content please dont bother this film is not for you,cruel
there isnt much to say about this film that hasnt already been said im sure going to try to add something to the discussion thoughim also sure that if youve read through the pages of reviews you know the basic plot points along with the gorier details however in case you somehow managed to miss it here goes anthrolpologist travels deep into the jungle in search of the remains and the footageof a missing documentary film crew 3 guys and a girl after obtaining the footage he returns to new york city and screen the footage before he makes a decision on whether or not to show it on television the footage is full of the basest kinds of human atrocity on the parts of the film crew and the nativesthough i expected a mindless gore festival of shock for shocks sake think faces of death or guinea pig this film is remarkably well made the pacing cinematographyscore editing and effects are way above par and work together to created the directors desired effect very welldeodato knows why were here that latent streak of schadenfreude malicious glee and voyeurism that lies within all of us after the comparative lull of the first half of the film the second section is a full frontal assault pushing the rubbernecking at a car accident reflex to its absolute limit forcing us to confront all of our dearly held assumptions about the concept of civillization of the acceptable lines to cross over in the name of art andor commerce and reminds us just a bit too well that humans are just a very sophisticated evolution of animali find it interesting that while much is made of the infamous slaying of the animals while probably the only unnecessary component of the film itselfit was a critical need for the cast and crew to eat there are no prefab supermarket packages in the junglethese same people will admit to a strange satisfaction with the final gruesome ends of the film crewit is a very brutal and unique film your sympathy could lie with the cannibalsas they do follow the admittedly gruesome standards of their society the anthropologist by observing and respecting their customs manages to make it out alive and with the footage the film crew comes in like a hurricaneraping murdering and intimidating those they perceive as inferiors secondary to their own fame and fortune the film indicates in the scenes with the deceaseds friends and family the conversation that the crew was rumored to have paid for the grisly last road to hell footage a crew members proclamation of this being just like a previous work when they burn the natives alive for better footage that these people have been more than a bit savage for quite some timethe natives grisly retribution seems to have less to do with sheer scattershot bloodlust than a defense of the assault on their lives and homes7 out of ten a challengingthought provoking and well made sheer horror filmbut 3 stars removed for the endurance test it is to watch,cruel
i just got the uncut uncensored version and all i can say is this movie kicks ass it is easily one of the most realistic movies i have ever seen and is unrelenting in its assault on your senses the special effects have help up to the test of time even surpassing some of todays movies the story is inventiveeven managed to be ripped off by blair withc project and will leave your mouth gaping the entire timei recommend it if you are able to pick up the new 2005 limited edition release the special features help this movie to shine even including bios of the filmmakers search team and even the tribes that are included in the movie rumor has it that the same director is gearing up for ii,cruel
actually i thought that this movie should be a little bit more shocking i presume that i saw the uk cut version since it wasnt especially offending not for me at least and there were signs of sloppy editing and music where they did the cuts this was obvious in the tortoise scene because they only dragged the poor fellow up from the water and then the girl puked and then they ate hmmwell i think im glad i missed out on that because i really hate animal cruelty but from what ive heard the animal slaughter scenes were made in hunter tradition so i guess they could be left alonenow about the story the movie is pretty exciting although the first half hours was a little bit slow and these photographers well they surely should die i think what arrogant evil bastards they werei dont really understand a few thinks about this movie the professor and the other two guys in the beginning was rather sympathetic but this gang of cruel photographerrapists was rather strange i mean first they walk through the jungle behaving like a bunch of teenagers with a camera and then when they finally reaches this isolated village with its primitive cannibal tribe they start to suddenly behave like insane where did this suddenly insanity came from we never know i guess it looks like this was only an excuse to make the viewer hate this documentary crew what was the meaning of burning down the cannibals house was it to get some respect or just to create some shocking pictures of documents to show when they returned back home i dunno but they certainly were mean cruel and stupid and they certainly deserved to diei think the best part in the whole movie is when the bitch gets it this photographer whore that was a pleasant view to see her being ripped to pieces and she had ugly tits toomy final verdictthe picture 8 this was a fine print bright and sharpthe music 6 it pales in comparison to antropohagus for exampleacting  characters 7 the acting is good no bmovie feelingexcitement 5 its always more exciting to see the unseen thenactually seeing it when youve seen cannibals eatinghuman flesh its not exciting anymore an evil thatis foreboding is much more exciting to watch because thatcreates tension,cruel
italian horror  a genre as equally celebrated as it is reviled the undisputed master of the craft was the legendary dario argento famous for his strong sense of surreal imagery and and poetic violence then there was lucio godfather of gore fulci who was something of a poor mans argento but the bulk of his work is still highly enjoyable and he has generated a cult following possibly even more dedicated than argentos and then there was ruggero deodato a director who possibly could have joined argento and fulci in the ranks of the italian horror elite if it werent for a premature ending to his career due to a scandalous little piece of work called where argento was known for visuals and fulci for overthetop gore based on holocaust it looks as though deodato could have made a name for himself based on sheer unapologetic brutalitythe film follows a researcher kerman as he travels to the south american jungle in an attempt to find a missing film crew who were shooting a documentary on the cannibalistic natives of the area the filmmakers are long dead but their footage is discovered and what it contains is among the most shocking brutality ever witnessedif youre at all familiar with classic horror then youve undoubtedly heard about and the ravenous infamy that surrounds it the question that seems to hang on the minds of those who havent seen it is does it really live up to its reputation the answer absolutely dont be mistaken it isnt gore nor is it actual violence that makes holocaust so infamous  hell almost any of fulci or romero film is gorier than this no what makes holocaust do disturbing is among other things the unflinching realism of the brutality deodato was actually arrested and the film was seized upon its completion and he had to present the actors in court to prove that he had not actually butchered them to make the film i wondered before viewing the picture if it was even possible to make film violence look that realistic especially back in 1980 but upon watching the film i have to say that i can easily see why the courts had their suspicions in 80 hell the film would probably be brought under question even if it were made today though deodato was able to prove that he did not actually murder anyone he was still thrust into further hot water due to the fact that the cruelty toward animals in the film was real even after deodato was able to release the film holocausts future was to be rough to say the least throughout the world the film was either heavily cutcensored or banned all together even in its native italy it actually holds the record for bannings sixty countriesso yes it is brutal yes it is shocking but is it really any good well the film suffers from poor dubbing a common affliction amongst italian films of the era this tends to be a big contributor in making italian horror films so famously campy and while holocaust isnt repulsing with unspeakable horrors it does tend to be a bit campy the mediocre acting also plays a role in this however deodatos direction is actually quite good as is the cinematography and the acting of those portraying the documentary film crew riz ortolanis strange score is also quite good the film opens with a series of beautiful aerial shots of the jungle accompanied by a peaceful sad almost poplike piece of score and then flashes on screen  one cant help but feel that this is an uneasy juxtaposition in fact the first fortyfive or so minutes of the film dont really prepare the viewer for what is to be unleashed upon them in the latter portionbut on top of being the most infamous exploitation film ever made holocaust is actually a very powerful piece of cinemabegin spoilers as the fauxdocumentary footage begins the viewer is subjected to a group of civilized filmmakers who commit disturbing acts of brutality on both the less aggressive natives and the jungle animals the desensitized manner in which these people behave is presented masterfully by deodato and is truly frightening to watch these men and woman slowly descend further and further into repugnant insanity and this loss of all things humane and decent comes to a climax in a despicable scene in which the three male members of the crew take turns brutally raping a young female native what makes holocaust so powerful is the manner in which it presents the demise of these maniacs yes the aforementioned rape scene is very troubling but in a subsequent scene when all of the heinous acts committed by the crew come back around and are inflicted upon them by the more aggressive natives i found myself asking why is seeing the woman from the film crew violated so much more affecting than seeing the helpless native girl violated why is seeing these reprehensible people getting whats coming to them so disturbing why am i afraid for these horrible people by the time the footage is over a troubled executive who was viewing it calls the projectionist and says i want this footage burned all of it what a powerful note to end on yes im ignoring the last who are the real cannibals line of voiceover dialogue as it is blatant and unnecessary end spoilersis one of the few films that delivers on the hype a startlingly wellpresented profile of madness that will probably rattle even the most seasoned horror fan and an experience ones not likely to forget810,cruel
while probably not for the faint of heart does not live up to the two decades of word of mouth rumors and recommendations passed from friend to friend on the web or in the classroom this film has reached mythic proportionsi sat down in front of the film waiting to be floored by nightmareinducing images and all i did was laugh for two hours at the poorly composed synthesizer background score dont get me wrong the gore is fantastic but the only terrifying thing about the film is the turtle mutilation scene if you cant stomach cruelty to animals and from what i understand they are real animals please dont watch this filminterestingly enough deodato seems to afford more emotional weight to the beasts of the jungle than the humans that dont belong there moral of the story i dont know some say the director is vilifying the violence portrayed in those jungles by the cultures that inhabit them but if thats true then all he achieves is a misplaced critique of indigineous peoples and their own set of ideologies and cultural normswhat i feel deodato is most successful at is portraying the danger of outsiders penetrating an unknown world in an attempt to expose the terrifying in said culture holocausts fearless whitebread filmmakers the main characters make a swift transition into a much more horrifying worldcommitting those very acts they have set out to demonize rape cannibalism and brutalitythe whole time i was watching while not busting my gut laughing i thought about that nietzschian warning whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster this it would seem to me at least was deodatos thesis or at best the impetus behind creating a world of violence no matter how his viewers or his critics translated that violence,cruel
i have just finished viewing the movie it is an overrated and silly bore the acting is terrible and the horror is unconvincing killing a few animals is the only realistic parts and even this is less offensive than looking at slaughter house films recent films such as boogyman and saw ii are more shocking mayube i have have seen too many horror films ad am getting insensitive to the gorei still think the best horror film are the original night of the living dead and last house on the left these older films were shocking because they were a new departure from horror films up until the 1970smy recommendation is that i hope no one waste their money and actually buys the dvd like i did i give the movie five points our of 10,cruel
there are two qualities in this film the amazon wildlife and the fact that it shows what greed is capable of when it has a helicopter and a machine gun apart from thatis not much more than a collection of rape scenesanimal torture and demented violence even the intention of introducing an anthropologist to give us a moral viewpoint over who the real savages are does not relieve all the crew involved from instrumentalizing flora and humanflora of a region that has a lot more to offer than cheap gore beheadings and impalements may be or have been part of one or another ritual practiced by amazon tribes but i still fail to see a true intent in approaching these particular forms of human existence by any meaningful wayif the images and the commercial only purpose werent enough canniba holocaust presents us with a sleazy soundtrack that is really really misplaced,cruel
before finally getting to see this film i had read the requisite amount of ranting and hype that the good old internet is full of most fans of horror or cannibal films will begin foaming at the mouth and begin to tell you all about how this is the greatest film of all time it is good but it has far too many glaring flaws to recommend without some kind of warningto begin with the version i own is the uncut version animal killings and all i should probably get this out of the way first the animal killings are incredibly morally reprehensible whether or not you want to watch them is your own decision they do however serve a purpose in the film the killings are done in long takes so there is no doubt that they can be real this shows exactly how living creatures are expected to bleed and look inside when they are beaten and sliced open in many ways the prosthetics used for the human killings are modeled to look like the animal ones this succeeds in blurring the line between fantasy and reality and making the film all the more disturbingand despite all the hype the film is not as gory or graphically violent as you might expect my first reaction as a gorehound was one of disappointment where was all the nasty stuff truth is this film is going for the shock factor not rivers of blood if youre looking for kicks you might want to go elsewherein terms of story the whole affair is very hohum documentary makers disappear new york professor goes in to find them and their footage it isnt anything to write home about but it serves its purposethe film is divided into two parts the expedition to recover the footage and the footage itself all of the acting and effects during the expedition section are incredibly hammy lowbudget and overdone in fact they almost encourage you to turn off before you get to the good stuff all of this is a device it just serves to make the footage seem even more realthe music by riz ortolani is excellent some people hate it personally i think it is one of the best soundtracks of all time the juxtaposition of the happy cheery theme music with the atrocities depicted is one of the most effective things in the entire filmoverall those looking for a gorefest will be disappointed as will those expecting a subtle moral but those looking for an exercise in clever and deliberate filmmaking will probably have a good timeand those who adore cannibal films will never see a better one,cruel
is purportedly banned in over 60 countries and that simple fact alone has only added to its notoriety in 1995 lucertola media in germany printed only 1000 copies of its haunting incredible soundtrack which may be one of the best ever realized for this kind of film the film itself has cropped up in many countries in a surprising amount of cropped and various forms leaving some left in wonder and doubt as to what its true uncut form really is many believed at one point there was a version including the infamous vice clamp on testicles sequence but it has since been learned that scene was only photographed and never actually shoton the face of it is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of flesh eating natives and savagery diametrically different from private benjamin though was made during the same yearhowever you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a largebreasted female explorer from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawnwho keeps her titties housed in nonseethru brazziersto chase after some easy laughs sticks to its business and as hitchcock once said of a good film it lacks not in the area of its mcguffin in this case human appendagesthere is another strain of moviesaboutwomen epitomized by thelma and louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths what tripeas usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater it should be a natural for film festivals nominate it for one near you if you get the chance wont youi bought the uncut version of and gave it to my 21 year old daughter better she should see it on a tv than not at all,cruel
seriously ive heard about this movie for ages and ages and i thought id be alright about it having seen many of these kinds of repulsive movies and video nasties i thought this would be a piece of cake but it really deserves its rumor its not whats on this movie that shocks its more the way it is told what is surprising is that its quite a political movie even an intellectual movie in its own right it seems to be quite aware of what it is doing its a critic of what it is itself and thats kind of what makes it so hard to watch thats what kind of makes it genius even its the biggest critic of exploitation movies ever and perhaps the biggest exploitation movie at the same time it has a very strong finale,cruel
let me get this straightall the controversy all the animal rights activists whining all the critics fighting over whether its art or gore porn and this is the movie theyre all crying about whats so amazing about it it didnt disturb me at all i was really looking forward to watching this to see if it lived up to the hype but i didnt much bat an eye during the supposedly disturbing scenes does this mean something is wrong with me completely overrated not to mention old and actually kind of cheesy oh well i suppose if youre a gorehound this one is worth watching cause it has boat loads of gore and very little story which is a good thing in my book so see it if youre a major gorehound but dont believe the hype,cruel
director ruggero deodato script gianfranco clerici cast robert kerman francesca ciardi gabriel york drama about a group of documentary film makers led by alan yates gabriel york making a film on the cannibal tribes of the amazon they turn up missing so an anthropologist from new york university professor harold monroe robert kerman goes to search for them his guide takes him into the back country of the amazon that is inhabited by three deferent tribes two of which practice cannibalism he finds the cannisters of film in the possession of the yamahoo or tree people he brings the films back with him to new york where they are viewed at a production company that wants to show the film on television but professor monroe wants them destroyed the films show how yates his girlfriend fay francesca ciardiand his two assistants grossly exploited the people and what they did just for a little bit of sensationalism we see a small animal getting cut open alive a turtle pulled out of the water and gutted in graphic detail the rape a yamahoo girl and worst of all how they burn a group of natives alive in their hut including women and children for absolutely no reason this is among the saddest scenes in film history the tree people take revenge on the film makers in a very violent way to say the least the graphic detail has been explained on many other posts needless to say after viewing the film the production company executives agree with professor monroedeodatos intent was probably to make us angry at alan yates and his group for how they exploited the people we certainly do not feel sorry for what happened to them and this gave good reason for their brutal and gruesome death by the cannibals of course the real exploiters are the film makers themselves this film attempts to make a moral play out of the revenge taken against yates and his group deodato wants to show the audience that they got what they deserved but really it is just a reason to make an exploitation film for all its notoriety this film actually does have some merit it is not a horror film at all in the classic sense but rather an exploitation film for me this is as much an actionadventure film as an exploitation film for a film of this nature the cinematography and production was not that bad it also had a beautiful score by riz ortolani the jump shots between new york and the amazon very effectively showed the contrast between normalcy and the horror that we see in the amazon the movies weak point was the animal abuse it is not only repulsive but a cop out as well just think of the artistic merit if the animal abuse was faked but made to look real now that would have been art unfortunality much of the films credibility is lost by deodatos and his casts abuse of animals which would certainly be illegal to make today this is a film that is hard to recommend to just anybody,cruel
i didnt like this film it was slow and when it got good it got horriblethis film made me feel sick even though its only a film i didnt like the display of how the fate of the victims occurredthe special effects were very realistic i must saythe film is typical of a cannibal film and i didnt like it there are scenes of live animals been slaughtered and devoured nudity from the film makers and humans being murderedthis film was too much for me that i had to exchange it for something elseif you appreciate films like this you will enjoy it unfortunately i didnt,cruel
i agree with most horror fans that this is a great cannibal film one of the best to ever eek out during the short lived popularity these films enjoyeda group of film makes have gone missing in the jungle curious parties send out a group to find out what happened to the missing crew along the way they are witness to some truly shocking events involving the natives who seem to be unduly hostile to ward them they manage to uncover the missing teams film footage but the team itself remains lost they return to civilization and view the footage hoping to find the truth they find out much more than they wanted to knowthis is one of the bleakest to come out of the cannibal cycle there is almost no humor and what little there is is just about as uncomfortable as it is funny it also has some of the most violent scenes i have ever seen put of film i dont want to strip them of there power by describing their setups just believe you will be shocked or at least shaken direction is sharp but intentionally rough there are no clean edges to the picturean important element to point out in the film is the manner in which it approaches the material the cannibals arent just a bunch of hungry killing machines and the civilized people arent all wine and roses characters are treated as such as characters not 2d cut outswhy not a higher score for one thing the film takes a long time to get going nothing much happens for the first halfhour or so also while it is well directed and written some of the actors play their parts a tad flamboyantly reminding us that this is only a moviei still highly recommend this to film to any horror fan that can find it you will not be disappointed710,cruel
this movie is really a good movie a classic the original blair witch project nowdays a movie like this will not be shown in a regular movie theater plus it has the great bolla who must be one of the most interesting actors being in movies such as spider man 1  2 and the great porno classic debbie does dallas if you really want to be shock watch this film you can still find it in those small independent stores me i am still waiting for the dvd i can not be more explicit like this if you really want to watch a horror movie watch this film now if you do not want extreme violence and gore this is not your film the film is very realistic at the end you really are wondering was this for real or what just super and the angles and action is quite impressive you really feel like you are in the filmdt,cruel
having seen the original film back in 1981 or abouts i can only say that the 25th anniversary edition is a bitter disappointment having handed over my 1999 to the store i took the dvd home and sat down to watch again a film classic well what can i say i do not know who edited it but they cared little about keeping the original element in the film the quality of my copy was not that good quite a lot of background noise it almost seemed that the dvd was made from a video copy the original although violent had a style about it but this version because of the editing seems to have lost most of the shock factor which was what made this film i was so disappointed that i rang the store and returned the dvd the next day sorry holocaust fans i would really think twice before handing over the money for such a decimated version paul m,cruel
sickening yes repulsive no for if you are repulsed by the portrayals on the screen  you are rejecting your own inner demons and the very nature of humans thats what ruggero is aiming for to make us all talk about what is sickening and horrible and to think about it of course he seeks to profit from it as well people and animals die it is the way of the world there is no glorification of the issue of death merely a representation of it if you watch the movie and comment on it you are as culpable as the next person for furthering its allure positive or negative feelings aside anyone who decided to watch it chose to thats a life lesson choices we can choose to suppress our primordial urges or fess up to them we also choose what to watch and what to believe you can hide from reality but you cant avoid it that doesnt mean we have to accept barbaric behavior i think this movie just keeps us all a little honest its no more pathetic or gratuitous than most other horror movies the message or representation it gives is what is really biting more so than what you get with cheesy high end hollywood productions with special effects galore and such bravo to the director for his vision  sickening it is but so is society to a great degree its just a movie life goes on,cruel
this is one of the only films ive ever seen that haunts me i cant quite seem to hate it for that reason having seen the cut vipco tape a few times i stumbled upon an uncut dvd versionwoah ok so its barbaric and the animal killings are completely indefensible but the sheer impact of it in whole is almost overwhelming not to mention the almost sarcastic use of riz ortalanis incredible soundtrack i have seen a couple of deadatos other films and they are all pretty crapwith the exception of ultimo mondo cannibale which was filmed so beautifully but again suffers for the animal cruelty what a dick anyhow overall id say do see even the cut version is pretty powerful but please be warned this is no sixth sense,cruel
i was not scared for one moment of this entire film its a shock film laced with rape and gore scenes to shock and make one sick i assume it could be classified as horror since the scenes are just that utterly horribleits a really harsh film to watch if youre not up for extremely nasty gore and harsh rape scenes skip thisthe story runs on about four film makers who run off to the jungle to document cannibals and their subsequent misadventures thats all you really need to know beware of very strong scenes meant to shock one and possibly gag dont let innocents anywhere near this,cruel
ok i hunted this movie down due to all the hype it was getting on various boards i managed to get an uncut copy on the internet for just under 20 buckswell let me tell you im a big fan of horror movies exorcist nightmare friday 13th series etc and this movie carves out its own little niche of uniqueness and brutalitythe story centers around a group of college age documentarians who travel to a columbian rain forest in search of a cannibal tribe possible spoilers aheadwell we see about 10 minutes of the footage and then the movie jumps to another group that is searching for what happened to these college studentsthe professor ends up finding the film cannisters from the students and takes them back to new york a movie company wants to make a movie out of the footage but the professor is totally against it now we delve into the actual footage as the professors shows them exactly why they dont want to release it to the publicthere is some really sick st in this movie the squeamish should not watch this i think a bit overlooked is that this movie does have a message who is the real barbarians savages is it the natives or those that have become civilized it makes you think whom is really at fault for some of the wrongs that go on in societyanyway the only real fault i have with the movie is that the students attempt to fake the tribal war between the tribes the burn them alive shoot a guy and kill a pig ok these are students so why all of a sudden are they the equivalent of serial killersrapists would a film maker really turn into a murderer just to make a good film i doubt it at least not at age 22 or whateverthis movie although gruesome gory and wrenching does have some bearing on humanity and i have to respect it for that i dont care for the brutality of the animal killings but they do set a tone for what happens next in the movie and the downright barbarity of the college film crew810 definitely worth watching if you can keep a level head good luck,cruel
normally id be inclined to go into some detail about the films plot technical qualities etc the film did have all these elements and wasnt just a sick fantasybut i wont do that ill simply tell you that whatever interest i may have had in it was completely washed away by a scene of real torture on an animal a giant turtle dont get me wrong i dont mean that its ok to kill people lots of which is done in this film in most brutal detail but not animals im just saying that anything to do with animals in this film looked and felt much more grotesque than anything else it was impossible to watch and any sign of quality that may have peeked through before that was gone just like that 210,cruel
well lets see here i ordered this movie because of all the comments i have seen on imdb message boards i got the movie today and i watched it well its hard to talk about this movie i mean i really think it was awesome movie but there were scenes in there that just made me want to fast forward there was a lot of graphic material in this movie that is very very disturbing i felt weird after watching the movie when i was in my car and kept thinking about some of the stuff that was shown especially the animal killings it is sad enough to see special effects fake animals die in movies but the animals were real they killed real animals i think that is wrong especially because the only reason these animals were killed was for the sake of a movie that is just sick i would have honestly gave this movie a 10 if it wasnt for that animals dying for the sake of a movie is sick that is why i will give this movie a 710 possible spoilers the plot was really genuine actually  it was one of the coolest plots i have ever seen in a movie and the question of who the cannibals really are is very neat to think about another scene that i do not want to see again is the total mutilation of that one american documentary cameraguy that was so disgusting and it looked so real he got castrated and they showed it close up eww gross the rape scenes were also very disturbing and they were very graphic the special effects in this movie were honestly some of the best ive seen for some parts it really looks like people are being murdered i still think that cameraguy is missing his penis that scene was incredibly real and so was the pole that is holding the dead girl i repeat the special effects were a 1010 i just wish that the animals were fake and didnt have to die for a movie or this would have gotten a 1010 from meit was the most graphicdisturbing film i have ever seen,cruel
i read a bunch of reviews about this movie about the animal killings and that they used real animals in it which made me think twice about watching it today i finaly watched itoh how i regret it this piece of st film should never have been made it sucks so hard i found no pleasure at all watching it it was 1 12 hour right down the toilet who would want to spend 90 minutes of their lives watching animals getting killed by a bunch of mongoswoman getting raped louzy acting bad  well absolutely everything about it is bad from 1 to 10 on a crapometer i give it 87 this movie is seriously one of the 10 absolute worst movies of all timesdear reader you have been warneddo not watch this movie,cruel
this is a deep and compelling study of the lifestyle and rituals concerning the average native cannibali understand that some might get provoked by the use and abuse of live animals but from my point of view its not all that bad its just what you could expect from a rainforest documentary really  but for those of you who have empathy for animals getting slaughtered you are hereby warned the movie starts out fair enough and continues fair enough although i must object to the selected soundtrack its silly sometimes hillariousthe movie is a moviepossible  spoilersthe movie starts out with a rescue mission that results in the discovery of the remains of a documentary crew and the salvage of some of their tape a cable company now wishes to give the tape some screen time in spite of its horrible content that includes live execution of some animalsreal animals as well as the demolition of a tribes settlement and a violent rape of a native girl  oh how they get to pay for that the professor who went in the jungel to rescue the crew objects to the companys intentions as he have seen the whole thing and they obviously haventpoor excuse for showing the tape to us here at home but so they go through the tape in all its glory and horrific images to the ultimate death of the whole crew on camerai think its a fair enough movie some of the scenes were a bit off the edge but it works as a jungelcannibal safari,cruel
bizzarei think who liked this movie may be crazy but i got myself laughing many time during the filmits so stupid that you have to laughin the beginning of the movie you can note that the voice of the soldiers are dubbed in spanish but its originally in english,cruel
is by far one of the most boring movies iveever had to watch the acting was horrendous and the childpornography involved in the movie was highly disgusting yeterotic this movie went against my strong christian upbringing iwonder what jesus would have to say about such a film i thinkthat the filmmakers were on drugs when they made this and asyou all know drugs are bad,cruel
so you thought tarantino was violent or irreversible was disturbing then youd better watch then again maybe youd better not the story has a great setup a la blair witch project footage found of dead crew but especially in the second half of it the movie becomes nearly unwatchable scenes including animals killed women raped and people getting their heads smashed in or sliced of not for everybodys stomach thats for sure in the end i was left a bit disappointed the movie only seemed to wanna shock people and completely leaves any storyline behind and the animal killings really were too cruel and im not too much of an animal lover neither 310,cruel
this is what i want in a horror film gore nudity rape and pure sleaziness from the director of cut and run and house on the edge of the park this is a great cannibal film and a must for fans of true horror films evil college kids go to the jungles of some backwards country and torture a bunch of natives in a village then justice is served when the savages eat them all up not before raping them people call this film sick disturbing graphic and repulsive it is but its a horror film and horror is suppose to scare you and disturb you so i have no idea what the bitch is i find it disgusting sure but it was really well made and i had a ball watching it the gore looked real and the women had nice thick bushes so its all good,cruel
spoiler warningthis film is probably one of the best horror films around the violence does go over the top a little i liked it 510  do not see if you do not like cannibals  the story is about students going out to film real cannibals only they get eaten instead,cruel
holy christ i just watched one of the most disturbing films ever  this film was banned around the world and i can understand why definitely not a film for everyone but i really have to say this is one of the best films that ive seen which really touched on a lot of questions about humanity i was glad the director decided to take this film to the extreme some of the modern films really did a rip off of this one such as hannibal of course blair witch project and all the cannibal films that came after iti think the director did a good job on explaining why he decided to portray the violent extremnism in this film there was the constant contrast between eating a human and eating an animal he showed both the savageness of civilized society and the jungle people the last line of the film pretty much explained everything i wonder whos the real cannibals this also brings up the usual question of knowledge and innocence such as that the jungle people eat flesh for survival which they do not know the difference btwn eating a man and a pig for they are innocent but civilized society hunt animals for entertainment we kill and consume food beyond our needs  i definitely dont think the intensions of this film was to gross anyone out but to raise some questions about us as human beings and it also portrayed a different kind of reality like all the other films out there that try to show reality as it is i think this film can be talked about in deep context and im glad i was able to find it,cruel
its a fantastic movie  and i really loved the movie although it was really horrific to watch the violence is at the top and very hard to digest most of the times but in the end the effort is well rewarding this movie has to go to the top violent and shocking movie of all times,cruel
dont watch this movieplease if you are not big i mean real horror fan do not watch this really real horror with real animal killing after 24 hours i still have stomachache and you better think twice before you watch this movie if you can get it because this movie if forbidden in 31 countries for me blair witch is better because art is not killing and killing is not art if they kill any bird like parrot i would destroy my copy of this movie anyway 710,cruel
a search team is sent to the amazon jungle to find out what happened to a missing film crew doing a documentary on cannibals they quickly discover the film crew were devoured by the cannibals but manage to return to new york with their film reels in tactonce back in new york the leader of the search team anthropologist professor monroe is asked to view the film reels before they are aired by a local tv station he is so appalled by what he sees he begs the tv executives to view the reels before they broadcast they reluctantly agree but by the time theyve finished watching them they order the reels to be destroyed so that noone else has to see themis probably the most infamous exploitation movie of them all its reputation to shock and sicken has remained in tact since its initial release in 1979  this film is a true tourdeforce skilfully made and an obvious labour of love for its director ruggero deodato who had to prove in court that the effects used in the film werent real that it isnt an actual snuff movie what sets this movie apart from almost anything else is its underlying tone of nastiness  its all about the human condition at its worst greedy corrupting and powercrazy the special effects are superb and almost too realistic the acting is also topnotch a genuine surprise given the genrewhere comes into its own is in the second half of the film when we the audience get to watch the recovered film reels of the slain documentary team deodato uses 8mm handhelds and pov shots continuously making all the onscreen mayhem seem absolutely authentic its a very clever device that was used to far far less effect in the blair witch project 20 years lateri wont say too much about this film other than the fact that it is a masterpiece it does deserve to stand proudly on its own which it does and have the huge cultfollowing that it enjoys the only thing i would say is that whatever you do make sure you watch the full uncut version  forget any butchered cut dvds going around such as the uk release missing over 6 minutes of footagea milestone and every bit as sickening and intense as youve heard  watch it if you dare,cruel
i had never seen a film like before but for the most part i knew what i was in for very graphically shows the saga brought forth by four documentary filmmakers who encounter a cannibalistic tribe depicts the horrors of reality despite many very graphic and disturbing scenes some involving rape animal cruelty bludgeoning and so on this movie was very entertaining and the superb beautiful score done by riz ortolani cannot go unmentioned all in all this was an extremely well made movie very realistic and very trueon thing i also love about this movie is its moral question which is asked by prof monroe as the very last line in the movie i wonder who the real cannibals are,cruel
this little gem is banned in my countrybut i got my hands on the cult epics uncut version and i must say wowpeople must look past the gore and see what this movie isa masterpiece of modern film makingyes there is alot of gore and real life animal killings but these give the film a surreal feel unmatched my many of filmsso treat yourself for a rare gem to come out of the italians910,cruel
just when i feel like giving up on horror movies along comes like a brick slammed in my face  much has been said both bad and good toward this strange film  i see myself being in support of it the story concerns the search for some documentary filmmakers who get lost in the amazon  their footage is found and considered by a network for prime time viewing until it is developed and screened what the filmmakers filmed says more about western intervention of other cultures than any other movie has dared  it also suggests what should happen to those who intervene this film is not for those who cant take extreme violence  it could be the most violent film ever made for those who have the stomach for it i wholeheartedly recommend it,cruel
ive seen a lot of horror and gore flicks many that my friends couldnt handle or thought were too intense so i consider myself fairly jaded and ready for just about anything on screen  bring it onafter reading many comments on i expected to at least be mildly affected by this film in spite of my jaded iron gut status this film didnt do a thing for me or to me it completely failed to have any major or minor impact on meif youve read about the film you already know all the major components and the items that got under the skin of most of those watching didnt faze me one iota either im as messed up in the head as my friends think i am or this flick suffers too many major problems or bothsome will probably say i just didnt get it but i think i did there are potentials for a great film here but it falls far short the underlying moral theme of western decadence being more savage than primitive tribal culture could have been a good hook and saves the film from being a total failure the documentary style helps some as well lending some realism and an excuse for some of the poorly done effects i have a very hard time believing there really was an obscenity trial for the director in regards to the authorities believing anyone really got killed in this filmthe most often quoted disturbing parts being the actual killing of animals just didnt bother me much the only one i had any feelings about at all was the muskrat as it was killed in a slow and painful manner and im not a fan of animal torture but as it was a rodent i had a hard time getting worked up about it  i just thought the folks who would do such a thing for funprofit were assholes i felt worse for their lack of regard than i did for the actual animal suffering and death the other animal killings were all relatively quick events mostly involving beheading which is quick and effective for the most part and while a turtle flopping its legs around after it is dead and being cut up might freak some people out with its head cut off it is already dead and the movements are reflex only ive had shark filets that were still quivering from nervous action when i put them in the skillet and i know darn well the shark wasnt feeling a thing by thenaside from the gore of butchering the animals the effects are not well done even for a 1979 film imnsho i also found the pace of the film and the amount of goryhorror content to be lacking in a big way i was mostly bored not grossed out horrified or disturbed ive seen older nongrossout style flicks have much better effects than most of the blurrydisjointed action that makes up most of the gore scenes in this film a few obligatory gut and entrailexposed brain moments and most of the rest is at least semiimplied rather than explicitly detailed the focus goes away the event happens the focus comes back some for the result about the only effect i thought was reasonably well done was the castration i wasnt looking for day of the dead spill your entrails on the floor in graphic detail but when watching a scene of primitive natives beating someone to death with rocks and sticks i would expect the blows to at least look like they come close to landing on the victim the rapes seemed thrown in perhaps as an afterthought for extra shock value and the way they were thrown in made them seem even more unreal and fake than the way they were actedi could have tolerated the very poor acting the disjointed underexplained setup the animal cruelty the slower disjointed pace if there was anything more to this film but i just didnt find anything more ive seen much better gore on a low budget from the same time frame evil dead was shot within a year or two of this piece wasnt it and ive seen better attempts at the realism style over the buckets of blood gore style ive also been more disturbed by nongore movies because of plot storyline or clever gimic shame too as i think the moral theme and later stolen by blair witch finding the victims footage after their demise premise were great hooks and could have made for a much better final productat least blood sucking freaks made me laughif you are a serious fan of the genre youll probably have to watch this one and judge it for yourself however i would advise a rental or borrowing it from a friend if possible as i would have been quite disappointed if i had paid full price for the dvdi rate it a 3 out of 10 as it had great potential but failed to come even close to meeting it,cruel
ruggero deodatos 1979 cult epic is the perfect example of how well made italian cannibal flicks can be obviously there are not many films in the same genre that come to touch the magnitude of this wonderfully shocking epic of human atrocityas the videobox states this movie was indeed the blueprint for the blair witch project  thanks to the effective use of the movieinsidethemovie theme we are presented to a host of young reporters three men and a woman who venture into amazonia in search for a cannibal tribe some months later nothing is heard of them and a rescue team  led by porn star robert kerman  is assembled to investigate what happened to their comrades what they discover will leave many shuddering in disgustthe background narrative  as often as its overlooked  is the westeuropean thirst for sensationalism in todays society of mass media its also about multiculturalism and respect towards our fellow man if we broaden our vision even the westeuropean superiority over native tribes and less developed countries etc as one the characters states the more you rape their senses the happier they are this socialcritic message is often overlooked by many viewers of this movie which is sorely lamentablegorehounds wont be letdown by this movie as theres enough gore present the massacring of the reporters should prove decent for fans of italian horror as the movie was produced in 1979 one cant expect it to look as flashy and funky as todays musicvideo styled movies neither would this work in this sort of movievery recommendable for fans of this genre others need not to applycult without doubt,cruel
i do think that what deodatos message on human society is very true that people just do stupid and inhumane acts because we can well i agree to that but omfg does he have to show animals heads being severed i mean omg whats the point in that i liked the movie i liked its message but i just dont get why the hell would a director put something so graphic that its not even connected to the message is he showing how barbaric humans are  someone explain quick   ,cruel
is the prototype for blair witch shockingly realistic and unsettling its light on plot but heavy on shock value basically the same plot as bwp a documentary crew of 3 young people travel into the amazon jungle to research a film crew who previously disappeared they encounter among other things a girl being raped which they dutifully film the 3 main characters are unlikeable from the start bickering lewd crude and annoying its hard to feel sorry for them when they are finally dispatched by a tribe of hungry cannibals the visuals of bodies being torn apart are incredibly realistic you have to remind yourself it isnt real recommended for gorehounds and lovers of cannibaljungle flicks,cruel
far surpassing any of the cannibal films ive viewed cannibal ferox mountain of the cannibal god eaten alive etc id have to say that is not only my favorite italian cannibal film but one of my favorite horror filmsthe plot for is an obvious inspiration for the blair witch project a group of young film students set out into the wild to film a documentary they disappear months later their disturbing footage is foundin holocausts case the wild is the amazon jungle as opposed to blair witchs forrest in rural maine and the documentarys subject is cannibals as opposed to a witch and in holocaust the contents found on the recovered footage is incredibly graphic and violent whereas in blair witch its what we dont see that scares us for all you haters of the blair witch project i personally loved it dont worry thats where the similarities endholocaust begins when a professor at the missing filmmakers university is asked to travel to the green inferno the amazon to find the young students upon arriving he is given a couple of guides and makes his way into the jungle after witnessing a brutal killing of a native girl they capture a native and he takes the three men to his tribe it is there that the professor finds the film of the missing students before getting the film he must go through some cannibal nastiness thoughwhen we finally view whats on the film it is an incredibly disturbing experience we see that the students arent such a likeable group and they enjoy and take pride in provoking the cannibals still as much as we dont like the students theres the inevitable dread of seeing what their fate will bethe beginning of holocaust plays somewhat like a jungle adventure just with alot more gore whereas the documentary footage plays alot like blair witch again the main difference being that holocaust contains all the money shots of graphic sex and violencethis is without a doubt the most skillfully directed cannibal film ever made notice that what the three men see in the beginning of the film connects to what happens in the documentary footage perfectly but is not even emphasized director ruggero deodato easily tops his own jungle holocaust my second favorite cannibal flik and proves himself an intelligent filmmaker with a flare for disturbing his audience much more so than umberto lenzi cannibal ferox eaten alive who seems to just want to shock his audience although i have yet to see lenzis the man from deep river the cannibal film to start them all i have to say that even though i like his cannibal films they cant touch deodatos  a 10 out of 10,cruel
i have been officially desensitized to all forms of cruelty gore death and carnage that can be put on a video camera this movie would make even hannibal lecter feel sick to his stomach the movie seems completely real as it is being filmed if it wasnt for the poor acting and they said this was actual footage i might believe them explores primal cruelty with scenes of rape slayings beating people to death actual blood letting and mutilation of animals by the way if you ever wanted to know what a turtle looks like without its shell minus a head to boot you should watch this i was interested in seeing this i was not let down good film for what it is compelled me to write this reviewthis movie is not for the faint of heart i also believe one in the us would have a very difficult time finding this movie as it would have an x rating without a doubt downloading is the way i found it not to be missed if you love horror movies or are interested in the subject,cruel
oh my god thats what i said i though it would be impossible to be in anyway disturbed by a movie but nope this one definately did it  its so reallistic in fact some of it is real  i thouht it was real when i first saw it  it was insane basically the movie is about this a group of kids go out into the jugle to make a documentary on cannibalism  they never come back  then a guy from some college goes out there to find them he returns with their footage what they see is not at all what they expected packed with castration rape cannibalism of corse animal cruelty and well and gore this is a definate classic  it doesnt get any more horrible than this i loved it,cruel
i was curious to see just to what extreme this movie actually went  i was expecting it to be extreme in terms of goreand it was at times  but i think that what is most disturbing is the evil manner in which the 4 americans exploit and torture the primitives they are filming  they really deserve what happens to them at the end  so there is a happy ending well it could have been worsethe good guy survives his trip in the jungle first part of the movie and the 4 manipulative immoral arrogant and trashy film makers get the justice they deserve  if you play with fire expect to get burned,cruel
and does it ever ill have to say as a filmmaker and a particular fan of horror film especially the italian variety is a milestone and i was never so terrified upon watching it it takes a lot for a horror movie to really get under my skin and probe my darkest fears but ruggero deodato certainly made a chillerthe plot is interesting a group of filmmakers go into the green inferno to shoot a documentary on cannibalism they mysteriously disappeared and a searchandrescue is sent out into the jungle after making friends with the local primitive tribes the team finds the cans of footage left by the dead students they are taken back to the us and reviewed thats when the real horror begins was very well done this achieved what the blair witch could not in its mockdocumentary gimmick there is also a brilliant and unsettling twist in the nightmare that will leave you thinking those nights you sleep with the lights on however what kept me from giving this film a perfect review was the appaling animal cruelty this didnt seem necessary especially since deodato created such realistic effects for the human victims so convincing that he had to defend himself in court im sure he couldve found a way around this problem i dont condone the slaughtering of innocent creatures for shock value but other than that i like the movieps i find it odd that the uk which has a rather strict censorship committee would be the only country with access to vhs and dvd copies of the movie i had to download a bootleg of reasonable quality to see it if a lesser film like cannibal ferox  made it to the states why not deodatos original masterpiece it just seems right if you can find it god bless see you at the movies,cruel
if you have not seen then this is the review for you since it contains absolutely no spoilersprior to viewing i was warned about the incredible amount of violence it contains this warning came in the form of a note written on the rental box at my local video store which basically said avoid if youre squeamish or an animal loverive viewed a fair amount of horror films which had lots of gore but this was way over the top and it didnt lighten up the situation with humor like deadalive or dawn of the dead did real animals are slaughtered and eaten some arent but if youve ever gutted a fish or watched a nature show then this will not bother you although i must admit the buffet of slimy guts the giant tortoise contained was quite disgusting fear not all common household pets were sparedthe story is about an anthropologist from nyu who ventures deep into what i presume is the amazon rain forest of brazil called green inferno in the movie to locate a film documentary crew who have gone missing and to study the cannibalistic tribes of the area paying particular attention to the mysterious tree people with a few close calls the anthropologist and his guides locate the tree people and the dead remains of the film documentary crew they also find tapes that the crew recorded for their documentary the true horror of lies within these tapes expect the unexpected any further information of the plot would be considered a spoilerbeyond all the gore sex and amoral acts there lurks something much darker in which should have been explored to a greater length if only the film could escape its own genre for this reason i felt cheated to a certain degree its as if the viewer is shown a journey with the destination being the belly or the heart of a beast but the journey ends abruptly in the beasts knee if the journey ended in the beasts heart then i could have said that is a perfect blend of the blair witch project the heart of darkness lord of the flies and natural born killersa few worthy things to notei rented on vhs tape so the picture quality wasnt good however i also saw a digitally remastered collectors edition dvd which i am sure has the best possible picture qualitythe acting in the film is good im sure the realism of the shaky handheld camera work along with some great editing enhanced the performance of the actorsall in all is a mediocre horror film which could have been a lot better while viewing the film i kept asking myself who the real savages are i did not overlook ruggero deodato and his team,cruel
as i was watching this movie i could barely get over on how real this seemed  based on what i had heard about it i could see why others found this movie so disturbing  when it was done all i could think was this movie is everything the blair witch project wanted to be but could not,cruel
when i was growing up  i saw this film on a pirate vhs tape  the quality was poor  but i could still make alot of it out mind you i was only 9 at the time  i actually thought it was real  and i kept telling people throughout my life that this film was real  imagine my horror when it was just released on dvd  and i found out it was all actingim 21 and feel such a pratgreat film  great soundtrack  great acting  shock factor 810ray,cruel
minor spoilerscalm me evil if you must but parts of this film i found utterly heart warming other parts gruesome and other parts disturbing shocking and cruel this film has it all  sadness happyiness horror shock and more watching the uncut version i found the scene where the person filming the documentry raped the child disturbing disgusting and evil i hope they edited this out in the cut but saying this  most of the rest of the film made up for it i found the ending to be great  i wonder who the real cannibals are great ending line leaving us to think about the movie for another hour or so after we watch it i gave this movie a 9 and should deserve more  go out and rent it buy it enjoy it,cruel
i didnt really know what to expect when i started to view this film i saw it at a friends house and he told me it was pretty sick so i thought i would give it a go luckily he had the full uncut versionyes it really was uncuti watched with interest as i love to see gore but then my interest turned to disgust as real animals are brutally killed now im not adverse to animals being killed in films when they are animatronic but this film took it to the extremei watched it just like i was a kid playing with a new toy and i really enjoyed it it was only after i left my friends house and got thinking about it that i felt i had had my senses raped  a movie has never made me cringe or think about it afterwards as much as this onethe violence and rape scenes were brutal too but they never disturbed me as much as the death of the animals because i knew they wernt reali guess its because they were real animal deaths that i was quite disturbed2 particularly stand out scenes are the turtle scene which is way way too graphic and a scene where one of the guys kills some kind of ratthere isnt much of a plot to concentrate on or rather i didnt notice cos of all the blood guts and gorei will give this 10 out of 10 but only because its the first film i have seen to take something to the most extreme of extremesif you can get the uncut version and beleive me there are a lot around claiming they are uncut but they still are cut then you are in for a sick treatwarning dont eat through this movie and make sure you have a cast iron stomachlast thought really disturbing,cruel
23 years after it was released remains one of the most talked about films of all time  and for good reasonin a world filled with horror films that make grandiose promises of terror with laughable results delivers on its intent to horrify  for many years i didnt really care for this film  i thought it was overrated and a fairly pointless shock film  after seeing the blair witch project an obvious ripoff i decided to go back to the original deal and give it another chanceon my second viewing of i realized a few things that escaped me the first time  the original film makers are much deeper characters than i had originally given them credit for  overwhelmed with the desire to make an award winning documentary they will stop at nothing to succeed  this raises questions as to how far is too far for ambition and how much is really enough  amazingly the actors do a quite believable job exhibiting extreme behavior throughout the filmits a shame that the questions surrounding the main characters are no more than afterthoughts mere excuses to show shocking and disturbing violence the effects in are excellent because they are very realistic looking despite a meager budget  all of the shortcomings of the effects are brilliantly masked by wobbly amateur handheld camera shakes and angles another trick used by blair witch  the final scene in particular uses these camera tricks well to build a chaotic and disturbing sequenceanother saving grace of is the wonderful score  mostly made up of creepy synth sounds and drum beats the sheer simplicity of the music amazingly and quite surprisingly highlights the despair of the film simple music simple emotion  i also found the use or rather misuse of a cheery sounding love ballad during scenes of violence to be unsettling and confusing in a rather thought provoking waythe only real beef that i have with is the deplorable act of animal butchery  this serves its purpose well as the very real animal mutilations subconsciously serve to make the staged violence seem more real this however is a natural human response  so deodatos reliance on this visceral response to actual violence is a copout and proves that he could not horrify using only his skills as a film director  almost anybody can horrify audiences using real violence but it takes skill to do it with an original work  i wish deodato had tried to do it on his own without relying on this shameful tacticif animal cruelty really bothers you you should not watch this film  if you are able to see past it and look at what really makes this movie what it is provides an experience like no other  that is after all why people cant stop talking about it after all this time,cruel
is the kind of film that brings out the emotions in ya whether you think it is a grueling gory masterpiece a sickening demented movie that perverts mankind or a boring notgoryenuff snoozer what we think of this movie matters little in the long run ch is the unquestionable master of the cannibal genre ch did for cannibal films what star wars did for scifi diehard horror fans will always see this film as a milestone in horror cinemapersonally i was quite freaked out when i watched this the first time i was having some snacks while watching and i almost choked on it what a gruesome movie easily the most disgusting movie ive ever seen not even the infamous guinea pig series can outgross this oneas for the film itself i cant say i think its a masterpiece of filmmaking or anything but at least its honest so many horror films claim to be gruesome and gory and turns out to be sesame street ch pulls no punches the film flows over in a tidal wave of nastiness slaughtering and gratitous violence its gorehoundcityi think that the the civilized world are the real savages message should have been more developed and the real animal killings are a bit hard to justify ch also works as a kick in the knickers to all the mondo shockumentaries of the late 60s or so that might have been deodatos real drive for making this film enjoy it on as many levels as you cannoblehandps some of you who thinks it disappoints in the gore department might not have the uncut version it can be very hard to come by many covers say uncut but few actually are my advice is to buy from a specialist like video mayhem of florida or midnight video,cruel
some people have been trying to justify this film as disturbing social commentary and giving it silly meanings who are the real savages dont belive them this film is unjustifiable and has no other intention than shocking its viewers and shock it does after watching the film i almost feel mindraped and god knows what horrid images now lurks in my subconsciousness if you accept that the films only purpose is to shock us it works really well you might even call it a masterpiece in its genre therefore i find it really hard to rate the movie anything from 1 to 10 seems fitting just see it i guessnew fans of deodato should skip the boring last house on the left and jump directly to dial help from 1988 it has to be the silliest film ever made,cruel
well i must say that i have been in pursuit of this film for a long time and i finally got to watch it this evening  i guess the feeling im having is an overall disappointment  im not going to say that it is a horrible film because it isnt  however i can not believe there are people that feel this is a masterpiecesome of you even go so far as to say that it is the greatest film of all time  you must not get out too much or you spend too much time watching horror filmsnow where to beginlets seefirst of all i dont really find this to be a horror film at all  i was more frightened pressing playdue to all the hype than i was throughout the entire film  in facti was never scared sure i was repulsed by a lot thats a given but because something is sick and twisted doesnt make it horror  hell what about american pie or theres something about mary  sick and twisted comediesvery good ones i might add  anyway back to the task at handi dunno maybe im just too picky but i like my horror movies to scare meat least oncethe biggest problem with the film is that the victimsthe four film makersare not likeable at all  theyre not funny theyre not attractive theyre cruel and basically reminded me of drunk fraternity brothers with their sorority slut  that being said i was glad when they were killedthey deserved it  now many people are saying that this was the point of the filmwho are the real cannibals  pleaseif you want to buy that and it makes the film work for you then thats great  im happybut it doesnt work for me  as a member of a society i am truly offended that these four heartless schmucks are supposed to be representative of us  i dont know anyone that would charge a group of known cannibals and start burning their huts down  i know many filmmakers as i am an actornone would do what these people did  so right there all validity of this message is lost  that being said lets think about  how this movie should have gonelets say we dont make these characters ridiculous stereotypes of filmmakers who will do anything to strike it richsorry folksthats a mythwhen it comes to being eaten aliveany filmmaker will notwell i dont need to tell you that  so make these characters likablemake them truly victimsnot jerks who got what they  deserved  lets have them filming these tribes from a farcapturedheld captive for weeks while still allowed to get footage and then ultimatelyone by onefor footage sakeare murdered  then you could bulk up your media types that want to release ityou could make them more the bad peoplethey were on their way to being the bad guys until you actually see the filmmakers  so you see where im goingif the people who actually are killed are cared for by the audiencethen we have a reason to identify with them and be frightenedthus the essence of good horroron a positive note the scorewhile repetitive is very effective  i jokingly said that i would buy the soundtrackhowever in its simplicity the main theme is very haunting and works well  its just a shame that ithad to be wasted on a mediocre movieone last thingive avoided the animal issue until now  i am a meat eater  i like my steaks and hamburgers medium rare  i appreciate the sacrifice that animals make to feed and cloth us  but i am sorry there has to be a line drawn when it comes to entertainment  so the animals were to be food for the nativesfinethen let the natives do what they must in order to feed themselves and live their livesbut do not use this as an opportunity to try to entertain  those that find blatant animal cruelty entertainment then i guess this is the movie for you  the fact that the animal cruelty was real does nothing for the films story  in fact it takes away from the films story  a fictional story is just thatfictionali am not impressed by the mutilation of a turtlenowif it was fakei might have been impressedbut anyone can do what they did  its just wrongand anyone who defends it as necessary for the film is someone that seriously needs to reevaluate themselves as a human beingill tell youit would have been better if the animals were spared and the actors really killed  soin a nutshellcontains the followinginteresting concept good cinematographysome of the amazon shots are beautiful good scorevery haunting and very appropriate bad actingall aroundnobody is good horrible dubbingit looked like they were mouthing englishso what the hell pretty good special effectsthe cannibal scenes did look realwell most of them unnecessary animal crueltydoes not help the film bad storywould have worked better if the main characters werent scumbags no scaresjust grossoutsserious grossouts mediocre directionalthough with those actorsnot a lot to work withits not hard to figure out why these people never became famousall in alla dud  if you want to be shocked and disgustedthen this movie will do if for youthe animal scenesthe cannibal scenesand the acting should handle that for you  if you want a commentary on society dont see this if you want to be frighteneddont see this  if you want a good filmdont see this4 out of 10,cruel
at long last in a completely uncut uncensored and painstakingly restored edition this masterpiece recieves the welcome it deserves on the big screen in america  and what a heavenly thing this is for serious students of the genre of horror  but waitthere are some of you out there who are students of serious film and have heard the rumblings  good you are about to witness the most challenging and visceral film to be made ever except salo120 days of sodom of course my first encounter with canholo was in an obscure book on horror films written shortly after the brits decided to start the video nasties controversy and it told me that this film was a genuine snuff film  i was sufficiently prepared to go to the ends of the earth to research this and of course found out the truth  what i wasnt prepared for was just how effective this film was as social commentary  and to see it on the big screen is to amplify that effect on a spinal tap marshall stack this is not an easy filmdo not see it if you are unprepared to examine yourself as a person  this film demands that you check your moral compass for about 5 years to come  it is the most unpleasant thing that many of you will ever see  tread lightly  but tread indeed there is no holding back and many people will not be able to handle the subject matter herein  but for those of you who are ready to see the most effective indictment of the way we think of ourselves as civilised you will find your brain running on overdrive trying to figure out just how the hell we call ourselves humanitarians,cruel
is easily the most messed up legit film that ive seen but tenderness aside is it worth hunting down ha and paying huge prices to watch and endure well yes i think sothe tale begins with an anthropologist venturing into the amazonian green inferno infamous tribal cannibal territory where they quickly capture a live savage who they use to lead them safely deep into the jungle in the hope of recovering film reels shot by a previous expedition the savage leads them to the land of the tree people and the team find and recover the reels in exchange for a tape recorder cut to civilization where the reels are examined and restored with the intention of broadcasting them nationwide but the network executives havent actually seen them yetso whats the fuss about well the scenes that stand out are the animal killing scenes particularly including the painful killing of a muskrat the decapitation and gruesome disembowelling of a giant turtle bear in mind this is done by the actors the punishments for adultery the gang rape of tribeswomen and general murder and mutilative cannibalism of tribesmen and explorers alike one of which looks very real a little too realthrough all this visceral gore and gruesomeness there is a basic point we may live in cities surrounded by techie advances but ultimately we are the real savages and have no real right to encroach on so called primitiveswhat i cant believe is that this film has been released almost worldwide at one time or another which is odd since rugerro deodato has made a very dubious film here nevertheless it is worth a viewing although dont expect to like it as it is utterly tasteless,cruel
i just recently order the region 2 dvd because it isnt available in us and braced myself before watching it  i found many of the acts of killing animals sad which i felt was completely unnecessary  i just dont think that killing animals for the film was rightanyways the animal killings were gross but not too bad if you are prepared for it  i felt that other than those scenes the film was fairly enjoyable and well madepoor turtleif you get a chance to pick this film up go for it if you have the stomach for gross stuff,cruel
i think that ch is one of the most powerful films ever made it takes a strong stomach to sit through it is also in my opinion ruggero deodato best effort ever it was also more intelligent and thoughtthrough than i first expectedthis is a film with both the brains and the gore i suggest that you seek out this title and buy it as fast as you canand for the gorehounds who has not seen it yetbeware of the turtlescene,cruel
there are two main categories which the humble video nasty can fall into high art where the film uses excessive violence but in a way and for a purpose which has deeper meaning behind these include the films last house on the left by wes craven and straw dogs by sam peckinpah then theres ones which simply exploit the genre and rip off  preceding classics fits into the second one although its initial idea seemed very promising its story seems very cleaver a couple of people go off into the dense rain forests in order to make a documentary about the local cannibal tribes they are never heard of again and only their video tapes remain but its through ruggeros messy and shock provoking direction where the basic principle gets lost and what remains is a vial sick inducing mess of a movie ruggero only wants to show the audience the most violent things possible in the hope of making them feel sick and depraved and in that sense he succeeds with flying colours repeated scenes of rape torture murder and by far the worse reallife animal cruelty ensue and destroy a perfectly good concept for a film see blair witch they did the basic idea much better ignore all the others on this page this is not high art just another exploitation movie which thinks its saying something of importance go and see straw dogs or the last house on the left they explore the themes of extreme fear and the human condition much better and leave this film well alone,cruel
i have enjoyed horror films now as an adult even more than when i was younger i first must say that i have done extensive reading and have read critic reviews before i even saw this film everything i have read is true this is the most gruesome and shocking film i have ever seen period the concept of a movie within a movie in this format will sway any criticthe plot centers around 4 photographers from new york that go to the amazon jungle to unearth the supposed last of the true cannibal tribes of the world when these 4 young people arrive they give you a sense that they know that they can control these primitive people in their own habitat they are controlling in a way that later backfires on them when the natives finally retaliate and destroy their bodies in the most inhumane ways possible this atrocity is uncovered in the first part when 3 other people from the united states go and recover their film footage and find their remains as a sign of their cruel death this film stands out not only for its gore attributes and animal cruelty but also for its authenticity the blair witch project has the same idea some 20 years later but could never compare to the wildness and blatant killings in this film a lot of films including make them die slowly tried to capitalize on the idea of being helpless in a jungle full of cannibals but have never surpassed ruggero deodatos true apocalypsei praise you ruggero deodato and all that were involved in the making of this film brett,cruel
i am a hardcore horror movie buff untill i saw this film id given up all hope of ever being scared by a movie  whats strange is that i would hesitate to recommend it  its so low budget most people would just laugh at it  somehow though i connected with this movie on a very personal level i hope there are some others who feel the samelike relics from the fairy tales my mother told me as a child  this film will always haunt me,cruel
this film must have been sickening to make to act out    some of these scenes mutilate the mind even though we know it is not real  i do not enjoy watching this movie it is painful to sit through  what i can say is that the music the imagery the exploitation all add up to a highly effective accomplishment of sickening horror,cruel
ruggero deodatos 1979 classic is frightening for many reasonsthe subjective camera and handheld style will not let you escape from the grasp of deodatothe films sound design is also subjectivewe can hear the documentary crew being eatenrunning through the junglepanting heavilythe acting is superb and the horror scenes hit you like a force ten hurricanewhat makes the film so good is deodatos uncompromising attitude which seems to be you want a cannibal film  well hear you go and its gonna hurtthe film as been banned almost everywherewhy the turtle being ripped apart in closeup doesnt helpalso the primal abortion and numerous rapes seem grotesquethe film also seems like an attack on the audiencewe sit and watch films for entertainmentthe debased human acts of depravity on offer here are very hardcoredeodato seems to think we are all depraved for watching his filmlike man bites dog the director suddenly shifts his film into full on attack modeis a film experience like no theri am not even ahorror film fan but i will fight in the corner for it to be seen everywhere ,cruel
as you have probably gathered from reading the other reviews for this film ruggero deodatos as a viewing experience is quite unlike any other movie  it truly is a masterpiece of disturbing horror distressing to watchthe film is split into two parts  the first where monroe rescues the stolen footage of a murdered documentary team deep in the amazonian jungle is gizzly intense but not too gory there are a couple of odd scenes that linger in the mind but nothing too over the top here we see deodato as a craftsmen easily creating a very logical and linear narrative  the characters are all developed nicely and the themes are well realised at this point you are watching an intense and unsettling movie but with a conventional feel to it  you almost think that you might just be able to make it through this film with no problems at allsuddenly we are back where the movie started  new york and monroe is inspecting with a group of tv station executives the recovered footagenow we the viewer also get to see the unedited footage that even your editors didnt have the stomach to put together as monroe warns one of the tv execs this is where our descent into hell truly begins and for the remainder thereafter deodato litterally barrages us with shocks fear and truly grotesque imageryhe uses 16mm handheld cameras always shot at pov with scratches and garbled sounds adding to the effect that we are really watching recovered partially damaged raw footage from an expedition team this effect adds a sense of realism to the events that enhances the horror one hundred fold we are witness to the terrible cruelty the team inflict on the natives to create a sensationalistic documentary then the nasty and vile revenge that the nativescannibals inflict on the crew and because of pov on jerky handhelds we are always right in the midst of the action somehow being implicated into it allto dismiss ch as a gory videonasty is niave and stupid it is a film of extreme brutality and sickening imagery but so well crafted acted and produced that to ignore it is to ignore perhaps cinemas finest and cruellest hour in the world of taboos much has been made of deodatos use of simple makeup effects combined with his pov action that renders it looking like a snuff film needless to say this isnt snuff  it actually took them 6 weeks to make and all of the actors were very much alive and well long after ch had been bannedhate it or admire it i think even the most hardcore fan would be very hard pushed to actually love it you cannot ignore it is absolutely everything that a horror film should be and so devastatingly effective and cruel that it has been pronounced a snuff film by many and banned almost worldwide at one point or anotherfor me it is a film worth watching  it forces you to go to places that you might rather not go but will leave you thinking afterwards and questioning the role of the media deodatos point for making chand how our society can be so hypocritical when it wants to becatch this if you can  whatever the result you will not be disappointed do not watch it for the gore quotent though it is certainly still there its more the pyshcological horror through distressing imagery that this film is all about and to me thats far more effective and frightening,cruel
unlike other reviewers i have done extensive research of the film read many reviews from people that have seen the uncut version and finally after all this i watched it tonightthis is a true horrorsuspense film and its done superbly by ruggero deodato and riz ortalini who conducted the powerful music in itoh yeah and before i forget the blair witch project totally ripped their ideas from this filmyeah guys i believe you  when you say the idea was originalthe movie is about 4 filmmakers who disappear in the jungle to do a story on journalismthey never came back aaaagggh from the time the movie started till the credits went down i was simply amazed by the production value of it its awesome and its no wonder ruggero deodata had to prove in court that the actors werent killed because he makes this film so realthere is some humor in it too theres foul language and jokes all over the placethough some of it is in spanishitalianbut myself being latino and knowing spanish  i enjoyed the jokes throughlyi am happy to say i never fast forward in this film having seen so many horror films  i am used to this kinda thingnext to lucio fulci ruggero deodata is a god in italian cinemasearch for it because its still banned in several countriesbut its a must see it will be worth it especially for you horror fans,cruel
quite simply one of the best horror films ever made do you watch all of it or do you turn your head i found myself more disgusted with the infamous turtle scene than the butchering of humans now does that say something about me or whatseriously though a film like this cannot really be recommended i suggest you watch it but this is not something you will be chatting with your parents about over dinnerwhen i first saw the film i had no information on it and assumed that all the scenes were real i thought i had watched a snuff movie even after doing a bit of research i still look upon this as the closest thing to snuff i have seen including the guinea pig part 2aside from the gore the film has a very uneasy edge to it the morals of the film crew and cannibals alike are called into question and in the end i could not decide who were the bad guys and who were the goodif you get a chance to see this filmdo it but make sure you have given your dinner enough time to be digested,cruel
perhaps the pinnacle of exploitation cinema retains its power to shock and repulse even after twenty odd years due to its slick production values and graphically intense scenes many of which linger in the mind long after the final credits have rolled to a finish  whilst at its heart it may be nothing more than yet another piece of shock art it is at least a film which represents the ultimate achievement of the genre and a masterpiece in its field technically innovative in its use of the film within a film the concept would later be used by the makers of the blair witch project the shaky handheld filming of much of the objectionable content gives it a realistic and therefore much more disturbing atmosphere than the sleazy polish of other entries in this notorius subgenre there is nothing to laugh at here unlike in umberto lenzis own trashy brand of prosthetic sadism since deodato creates an ultra realistic and nihilistic portrait of human atrocity the acting is quite accomplished though by no means mega budget hollywood standard the direction for the most part impeccably suited to the material and the script even makes some attempt at admittedly laughable in the contextmoral messagingi should point out however that whilst the scenes of cruelty to humans in the film are entirely fake the realistic staging of cannibalism rape etc led many to believe that this was a snuff film there are several depictions of animal slaughter that are real and very graphic while these sequences do add to the theme of barbarism that runs through the film they are carried out by civilised white man and savage alike and despite deodatos claim that these animals were to be food for the natives in any case these are still highly repellent ive only watched the butchering of the turtle once and wont again and inexcusablewatch with an open mind and you may gain something from it but it is hardly entertainment4 out of 5,cruel
i have only met one other person that has seen so i get the picture that holocaust is still a cult film only for those willing to seek it out it is not readily available for anyone to see which makes the eventual viewing that much more of a triumph but to fully triumph and proudly claim that you have experienced you must endure the entire film itself without once closing your eyes or using the fastforward button then you can truly say that you have seen holocaust i am proud to say that i have seen it and i love it dearlyruggero deodatos infamous video nasty is still banned in the uk and australia has never officially been released in the us though it did meet a few 42nd street theatres unofficially and was even banned in its makers home country of italy but after 21 years still remains the bad boy that it was then and probably will remain forever i have yet to see anywhere else so many gruesome images heartbreaking situations and nauseating violence packed into one film let alone a mainstream film the story is simple a group of four filmmakers disappear in the amazon jungle and a professor tracks down a series of film cans left behind in a native village the cans hold the secret behind the disappearance and the ultimate truth regarding humanity at its worse that is part of what makes holocaust so hard to watch the audience is constantly shown that we the civilized people have a primal side to us a primal side that is wrongly demonstrated by the tree people in the amazon the message we are all capable of reverting back to our primal ways yet the racism of the message is quite clear and can be read as follows natives of the amazon are primitives while we are not but could bedeodatos direction is almost flawless the majority of the film is gorgeous jungle cinematography that creates mixed emotions of beauty tranquility savagery voyueurism brutality and danger while i prefer the camerawork in deodatos jungle holocaust here it serves a better purpose given the storyline riz ortolanis soundtrack is simply beautiful it used to be available on cd but is now out of print unfortunately the acting of the film crew is not too bad and fits in well with the situations and realistic feeling of their situation porn actor robert kerman is good as usual and gets fully naked hereone of the problems many people have with this film is the constant animal violence there are hardtowatch scenes of a monkeys face being chopped off a muskrat being stabbed to death and worst of all a giant sea turtle dismembered and torn apart while still alive i do not condone the violence and often fastforward past it not in the first viewing though but it does aid the overall feeling that the documentary footage is real and is not faked adding to this gritty realistic feeling are several tribal rituals including a woman being raped and beaten to death with a stone dildo for adultery a gory tribal abortion ending in a fetus buried alive in mud and a native who after losing her virginity in a gangrape by the filmmakers is impaled on a pole up her anus and out her mouth quite strong stuff to watch but holocaust is still a wonderful film that easily makes my top 10 list of best horror films,cruel
i read some of the other comments to and it is very disappointing that you can categorize most of the viewers into two parts1 gorehounds they were bored they just like movies with guts and gore if the movie they watch is wellmade does not matter just splatter dont call them lovers of the cinema poor2 people who liked the movie and try to explain apologizewhy the animalsnuffscenes were fake or the animals had been already dead its disgusting but it has a message it is interesting because blairwitch is told the same waythis movie is made by one of the masters of euroexploitation in the 70s and it is pure exploitation there is no message there is no fakeall animals were harmed for real they were killed for this movie the savages who supported this movie ate them later on but they ate them everyday not only when the movie was made  what are you eating each day have you watched a butcher at workand a message  ruggero deodato had private problems in the late 70s he was frustrated and in a very dark mood so he wanted to create a very aggressive movie it worked just because of some conventions and to make canibal holocaust more cynical he put in some footage about the junglecitycomparisonwake up guys this is not tim robbins this is italy the 70s ruggero deodato everything was possible in those daysch is a masterpiece of exploitation it is a perfect manipulation of the audience it does not try to satisfy the dumb splatterfreaks but it wants to shock and to entertain you not more not less1010,cruel
i remember hearing about this movie when i was a kid and i wanted to see it i was very into scaryweird movies even as a kid but too bad that i couldntso i finally picked up this movie  too bad that i knew that the movie was fake before watching it or else it would have even been betterit is actually very good  i have seen many of the faces of death movies and the blair witch project but this one beats them both  love the gory scenes,cruel
is banned in norway so i had to track this down in a shop in sweden  i must say that this is definetely one of the sickest and most disgusting films ever made but i liked it  dont go for this if you want a film like braindead or bad taste because the violence in those movies makes you laugh unlike the violence in  this movie is like a documentary in roughly the same way as the blairwitch project but this movie is a lot better  the movie is disgusting and sick so fainthearted persons should not see this movie  but for everyone elseover 18 this is a different movieexperience than youll get from the movies at your local cinema so fans of weird cultmovies should definetely try to track down this film it is worth the bother 910,cruel
im not gonna go on and on about the blair witch similarities im not gonna go on about how this is the sickest film ever made hey guess what im not even gonna say how unnecessary the animal killings were instead im gonna tell you the way it is personally i love this movie even though i have a hard time watching it and even though its a hard movie to watch over and over i guess its a love hate thing with this movie no middle of the road its one extreme or the other wether you feel this movie was sick enough for you or not is a matter of taste but dont degrade it as overhyped violence cos it shouldnt be judged by what you see but the ideas behind it so what if the effects arent realistic enough for you when the native is raped with the rock the idea is shocking enough for it not to have to look real to all you special fx experts so what if you didnt like the message or didnt get the message  if you were looking for it you knew it was there so whats the point its not gonna shock you the irony of all this is that whether you loved it or hated you all felt strongly enough to comment on it in one extreme or the other in my eyes that makes this a brilliant movie because whether you thought it was the best of its kind or the worst piece of trash ever just try to forget it  thats the power of this movie and i urge everyone to see it,cruel
oh man was i excited when i few months ago somehow managed to get my hands on this everywhere i read and hear most violent movie guaranteed to make you puke and even real snuff flick and oh man was i disappointed when im looking for a good gore film i am not looking any deep stories or hidden meanings as so many people seems to look i look for violence gore blood  guts only blood and guts you will see is the few real animal autopsies but whats the big deal in killing animals worthless boring and when theres suppose to happen something cruel the camera gets sucked in tornado whirls around and no one can say whats happening and the much praised rape part cmon you have to be really easily offending if you can call this hard to watch this will stay in my collection but im surely not going to watch it again ever,cruel
is widely regarded as the best of the italian junglecannibal subgenre and rightfully so it is a gripping intense tale of savagery and mans inhumanity towards man the likes of which hollywood could never producealthough often called repulsive vile and gratuitously brutal is actually semitame by cannibal film standards now dont let that confuse you there are still animal mutilationskillings impaled bodies rape oncamera castrations and more but to be honest its really not that bad what makes so appealing is its combination of reality some  some  of the effects are flawless and morality although many highbrow critics laugh at its attempts at psychological meaning is not just a mindless gorefest instead it tells of the savagry that white men treat people that they consider savages with and the understandable revenge of those peopleif you want to watch something that goes well beyond the limits of what mainstream films will show you a movie thats a true experience id highly recommend you seek out a good copy of youll never forget it,cruel
the best goriest and most shocking cannibal movie ive ever seen it tops all of the other cannibal flicks the cruelty in this film is so extreme if youve seen this theres no other cannibal movie from the 70s80s that will shock you,cruel
this is a notorious and controversial film but also a remarkably well made film the story is about an expedition of four filmmakers who go missing in the amazon jungle a new york anthropologist professor named monroe is sent there to investigate and discovers the film footage of the crew on his return to new york the footage is examined and the shocking and graphic fate of the crew is revealed the crew turn out to be as ruthless and uncivilized as the tribe they burn the tribes homes kill their animals and rape one of them the final scenes are perturbing the only voice of reason and sane thought throughout the entire film is that of professor monroe and he leaves us with a question to ponder at the end this is a far better film than the blair witch project which so blatantly plagiarised this this film deserves to be seen and its outrageous that most people are not allowed to watch it,cruel
the best with ch is that it feels so real you could almost believe its a snuffmovie well it is regarding to the animal killing scenes with its realistic surroundings and the sexual violence ch is without doubt the most controversial movie ive ever seen a plus for the wonderful music of riz ortolani,cruel
not near as disturbing as id thought it would be but then i suppose i was expecting a brain dead bath of blood and gorecertainly the worst parts are the animal scenes but even they didnt bother me as much sure id been at parts of my life a vegetarian but ive jumped off of that train again and it seemed to me that the animals especially the tortoise were dispatched fairly quickly granted what they did to the turtle was pretty gross but by that point it had been long dead and im sure that equally disgusting stuff going on in the neighborhood slaughterhousethe story itself is fairly simply but thought provoking and while im sure that most people will be entirely put off by the on screen slaughter those that demand more from their films will probably enjoy the subtle  message and comeuppance that the main characters get,cruel
this is without a doubt the most unsettling film i have ever seen coming close is pasolinis salo120 days of sodom if you make it past the slow first reel youll be amazed at the rest of the film  it is brutal and unrelenting in its portrayl of violence  also there is said to be a pirahna scene that was filmed but never included in the final product,cruel
i bought this movie in november and it took me until january to watch it  i guess its reputation preceded it and i geared myself up by watching 5 other cannibal films from this genre  so on a snowy january day i got prepared to be shocked  i am still waiting  part of my disappointment is from overexposure to cannibal flicks and another part is it wasnt gory enough  if this indeed is the king of all horror as i have seen it referred to on imdb let the blood and guts flowso i am a sick pig get used to it  overall i gave it a 9 because i did enjoy it but i did not like the animal killing although i must watch too much reality tv because i watched it wo a problem   and forget the blair witch comparisons i mean the flicks are 20 years apart with one medium similarity big deal,cruel
full of sadistic and vicious imagery this is one of the few films that actually transcends its content almost purely in the way that its made  the film in film approach of the second half makes the extremely gruesome scenes too realistic unrelenting powerful and definitely not a film to entertain  more to shock provoke and admire  all of which it does extremely effectively if you want to watch a film that genuinely affects the viewer look no further  you have be warned,cruel

i for one dont see this as a shocking dreary or gutter flick  its actually a very good well made movie  not a great cast but the acting was good  the storyline was seldom boring and always interesting  came close but never really got all too close to grossing me outinducing vomit at least in my desensitized opinion  for a truly nasty cannibal experience try trap them and kill them  this is more of the emerald foresttype flick which tries more to make a point about humanity and society  the animal cruelty was there merely to increase the impact of the serious subject matter  excellent wellrounded foreign film that should not be overlooked i cant even fathom why anyone would rather see something like babe in the city when there are plenty of masterpieces out there like this  yeah right this aint for kids  i first saw this when i was 16 and it didnt screw me up any  anyone with moral values or affiliation with any religion should stay clear though,cruel
exorcist played out overrated and sleep inducing jaws awesome but more of an adventure film from the king of adventure films night of the living dead awesome as well but certainly runnerup to as the best horror film ever made by the hand of man sadly it will never get said recognition thanks to these pc times but thats all the better because that way it remains the ultimate cult movie and away from the claws of teeny boppers obsessed with mtvinfluenced garbage like scream and the ripoff projer blair witch project what a joke original my  this films pushes the envelope far off the edge of the desk see it get jaded by it revel in it and tell all your friends about it by the way good luck finding a copy youve gotta be very resourcefulrating an absolute 1010 still an understatement,cruel
this is easily one of the best horror movies ever made with some of the best gore scenes in the history of film making it is sure to please every one who loves guts and blood of all cannibal movies i have ever seen this is by far the best and about 10 times as good as umberto lenzis make them die slowly,cruel
well maybe its because ive read so many reviews but this movie didnt revolt me or give me nightmares and it certainly didnt get me anywhere close to throwing up  after getting a copy i watched up to the first scene with the ritual rape then stopped the tape before it really started  i figured i was at the top of the roller coaster hill about to take the plunge into extreme cinema and decided to hold off until i was mentally prepared  so after about a week of the tape in my house i finally went through with watching itfully prepared to have my brain assaulted with images of holocaust proportions  then i see it  whats the deal  theres no orgie of grossness or vile special effects showing some giant dildo tearing up a womens genitals  you see a little blood between her legs after the mud ball and spikes bit but thats it everything is implied nothing explicit  the cannibal dudes motion didnt even look violent obviously he didnt want to really hurt the actress and the head crushing come onnothing  this gentle violence continues throughout the movie apparently to be passed off as hideous and shocking sure the animal violence is real and i glimpsed at only about 50 of the turtle scene but it played like just some kids killing and maiming an animal because they have low iqsmaybe i saw a cut version but the only explicit scene is the dick severing no graphic decapitations no graphic eye gouge or native women playing with the guys head where was this  and the cheesie scene with the guts wrapped in clothes pretending to be the guys body getting hacked apart was so obviously just that totally fake that even i felt i could have made the scene better  at least tell the natives to hit the cloths harder and more violently since there aint no one in it  whateverall in all i did actually like the movie but not for its supposed snuff footage  the music playing while the documentary guys burned the native village was very effective  the message was there and a good one  it effected me more than any of the violence  the chickonastick scene as it is referred too was more than just a shock scenein fact it wasnt really shocking maybe because i knew it was coming though  the scene was important to the movies point that the film makers were so desparate to get an award for their work they would fake their own reactionsanyways i just dont think this movie has the realistic special effects it is said to contain  there was just no real cutting slicing or hacking scenes which made you wince or toss the cookies  the scene with a native on hisher back getting split down the center just looked like a lot of makeup with some natives gently drawing their rock hatchets up and down a body  you never saw the blades actually cutting anything or any blood coming out during the cutting  it was just a static gore scene with native obviously pretending to be doing the cutting  after i saw the scene i was thinking ohthats what they were suppose to be doing cheeeesieso much for the mighty as some mind destroying horror movieif anyone thinks what i described was a cut version email me  i purchased my cult videos title through an online auction which apparently is uncut,cruel
amazing exploitation film from ruggero deodato brilliantly made but also very disturbing it concerns a documentary film crew who have disappeared in the amazon sounds like the people who made anaconda had seen this and an anthropologist who is sent to find them he returns with their cans of film and the knowledge that they are all dead the second part of the film shows the film that they shot in which they kill animals rape and kill native girls before themselves being killed by the cannibals the way the second part is filmed is truly amazing and very realistic some rather stupid people believed that the people were actually killed in the film although such claims are nonsense banned pretty much everywhere if you ever get a chance to see it do so as you will never see anything like it again,cruel
blair witch wasnt the first documentaryhorror filmthis sick puppy is the firsti saw this movie on a dare having heard of its lurid reputation this isnt a film that you view and then forgetit grabs you by the neck and forces you to wallow in savage depravity whether you want to or nota cinematic train wreck if you will it isnt a good film nor is it a bad filmbut it stays with you long after viewing a documentary team goes into the amazon jungle to film a cannibalistic tribethey never return so a man is sent down by a televison station to discover their whereaboutshe finds many of their personal belongings with a vicious tribe of cannibals he also finds cans of their filmthe man returns to the states with the film and screens it for the tv executives the film shows the atrocities perpetuated by the filming crew itself unable to get violent footage they want they rape a few of the local women and burn down a villageas they move deeper into the jungle they find examples of cruelty beyond their owna woman impaled on a log thrust out of her mouth gives the crew a warm feeling insidethese arent nice folks naturally they meet up with gut munching tribe with the cameras rolling im sure the director was trying to impress upon us that we are all savagesbut there was a lot of wanton cruelty in this film including the skinning of a real turtle for funthere really are no lofty aspirations to this moviepure and simple it is an evisceration partyit is well done and the soundtrack is fantastic strong stomachs are required for this demented little piece of intestine chewing filmyou can live without it,cruel
forget all the hype forget any kind of message deodato tries for and forget the bannings what we have here is a one of a kind movie experience i love the junglecannibal genre of the seventies and early eighties cannibal ferox eaten alive and jungle holocaust are all entertaining but you cant take them seriously gives you no choice but to take it serious the violence is brutal and real but it doesnt come across as crass or sensationalized its almost like being desensitized to violence in war bottom line is if you like extreme horror or italian exploitation films youll love it dont approach it as a morality movie and dont approach it as a dare based on its reputation just sit back and take it in it still holds up today after numerous viewings im hoping i can throw away my mediocre copy for a dvd someday,cruel
i saw this movie with my boyfriend then and husband now for fifteen years i have looked everywhere to find this movie and i finally have i loved this movie me being a horror addict i wish they would make another updated version of it i would go see itwanda,cruel
ummm what can i say but i wasted a whole pizza on this film it was a deeply sorry son of a film the acting was wooden the effects was wooden and i was not moved by any of it i guess i was expecting a whole lot more  i guess this film had more hype than wild wild west combined but it is still rubbish do not believe what it is written on the box saying strong version as its not watch it with friends with the wife the local cat and dog heck i will watch it twenty times more i am waiting for the harder version if someone has it please let me know,cruel
its true i saw this movie on video when i was 7 or 8 years old at my grandmothers house my grandad who is still alive and kicking is one of those people that records movies on video tape from cable for no reason since he will tape over it the following week his claim to fame is a huge collection of porno which he no longer owns they moved a lot and which me and my cousins sometimes borrowed and many times kept when we were in our teens 13 years and over keep in mind that my grandparents and parents are very religious people so they tried there best to keep us away from this porn as best they could anyway i saw ch once and only once in my lifetime im in my early 20s now and i still remember some of the scenes most notably the castration and decapitation and rape scenes i probably saw all this with wideeyed wonder much the same way i remember seeing et the extra terrestrial did ch give me nightmares nope did i threw up nope was i disgusted nope even though i was rather young i know a movie when i see one the only movie to have given me nightmares was stanley kubricks the shiningif anything made me appreciate horror movies although i remember some scenes to this day the movie did not influence me in any way i love animals i was a normal kid growing up and the only thing that infuriates me is criminals of any kindits a movie plain and simple if you cant tell the difference please have your head examined sure it contains scenes of real animal cruelty i dont remember those scenes sorry but i grew up watching rabbits chickens cows and pigs being slaughtered to be eaten now if its done purely for entertainment that is just wrongthought youd like to hear the view of a one time 7 year old i plan to buy the film this week to see it again for the 1st time in almost 2 decades,cruel
how can anyone think this is entertainment this is just sicktwistedst that should never have been released anyone who think this is fun get a life cuse yer not normal if you think this is a good movie,cruel
what can you say about movie that contains animal torture sadism and raping scenes  its very hard to watch maybe thats why i kind of like it the movie has great music and nice camerawork you can just say two words of this film  pure horror  thats it,cruel
its a masterpiece of italian cinema with a very nice soundtrack and brilliant fx  a must see for gorehounds,cruel
is one of the best known of the video nasties and on viewing the movie it is easy to see why while being excellently shot some of the scenes can only be described as vile for instance the extraction of a pregnant womans fetus and the infamous impaling scene add this to the loads animal torture and you have what can only be described as a sick masterpieceon its  release in 1979 the film was immediately seized by italian authorities due to allegations of it being a snuff movie but after continuous protests by director ruggero deodato was released in its uncut form in 1983the film was released in britain in the early eighties in a version which missed 7 minutes but since 1984 remains banned on video,cruel
i suppose i had build this movie up in head quite a bit before i actually got a chance to sit down and watch it  i was surprised by a few things firstly the movie isnt as gory as i had been led to believe  that being said the cruel acts in this movie are quite graphic especially the rape scenes and the effects do look awfully real  this is a classic example of the cannibal sub genre and well worth seeking out if youre curious  the movie is well edited and the acting is about a 6 out of ten which is fairly good for a film of this genre  the pacing is great and you never find yourself itching to use the fast foward button  the message of this movie that the explorers are the true savages is anything but subtle  there are three fairly graphic scenes of animal deaths that are not faked and some might find this fairly disturbing  all in all it was not what i expected but still a solid movie  8 out of 10,cruel
a movie filled with native cannibals rape and extreme violence i simply cannot believe people who consider this film as a good movie or even calls it a masterpiece cause it is so incredibly breathtaking i guarantee that a person with common sense who likes normal films should definitely not see this movie,cruel
big hype for almost nothing sure theres moments of interesting film when they burn their huts  invasion of vietnam good music too but in the end this is overrated crap theres no fun watching animals getting killed halfbaked poorly made rapes of women and guteating why do they portrait cannibals as idiots eating raw meat all day the white american is portraited correctly as a ethnocentric imperialist without limits but besides that this movie isnt much i believe everyone with interest in film should see a cannibalflick ones before death ch is as badgood as any one else its crap but it is fascinating crap like the history of man,cruel
i peeped this movie back int he late eighties in a bronx ny movie theater i took my girlfriend along with me and bought a sausage from the snack bar to enjoy while watchingfirst rule dont eat jack while viewing this movie i started eating the sausage after the movie had been going on and am suprised to this day that i didnt ralph earl and toss it all over the guy in front of mei saw the uncut versionthe scene with the turtle is still very clear in my mindthe jiggling flesh and allyeeeccccchhhh still i walked away from the movie thinking i had seen a big secretsomething that really happened that no one was supposed to know about it makes the blair witch project look like the barelyascare witch project some would argue bwp sucked anywaymy girlfriend who is now my wife of 14 yrs god bless her was ticked at me for a long time to comeshe is not a true hardcore horror fani had no idea what i was getting us into that daywell made well acted well shota must see for all true hard corershmmmmm   gotta see the last house on the leftheard that was the bomb,cruel
well now i can say that i have seen one of the sickest movies ever made  i first heard about this movie on the internet and i heard that it was the grossest movie ever made so i bought it to see if they were right they were  when i first watched it  even in my desensitized stage i was still a little grossed out especially the castration scene  but this movie is not all about grossing you out it has a meaning to it too  it asks  us if were are the real savages and not the savages as we may think  it kind of makes you think that maybe this is the truth when you see what us normal people do  i would advise anyone who loves horror movies to take a gander at this one unless you are the lest bit squeamish then maybe not,cruel
i had read so much about this before watching it like its the ultimate and more extreme goresplatter movie that its shocking that its got a deeper meaning heheh lol i didnt expect a deeper meaning in a cannibal flick but i did expect a lot of quality and realistic gore scenes it surely is three times as good as cannibal ferox 81 which is a totally unrealistic cgrade movie for cgrade viewers who are going to take it seriously or a nice laugh with little gore for people with strange sense of humour and taste delivers a lot more than this as its filmed in a blairwitchproject way that is to say the blairwitch was definitely inspired by this movie moreover we have some more realistic acting and filming some better gore and a more serious approach of cannibal communities at least a lot more serious than in cannibal ferox we also have some really nice jungle filming overall i have to say that i bought this one for the gore without expecting anything more  it didnt quite satisfy my hunger for splatter but it delivered some decent stuff that make it a cult movie by far better than exploitative ridiculous cannibal feroxstill if you are looking for true gore look for lucio fulci  peter jackson splatter filmsthis the heavily uk cut version i reviewed though try the uncut 95 min version instead,cruel
hype was brewing around this film ever since the uks horror uncovered vipco vault of horror got permission to release in edited or uncut the video nasties of the late 70s80s i have to say that this movie in particular had a promising trailer especially with the word on the street being the blair witch project used a lot of its ideaspacing through icy snow on my way to the video store nearly slipping and breaking my neck on thin ice vipcos film sat on the nearest shelf to the counter so i snapped it upwatching the first ten minutes a cheap introduction with some badly produced music you have to trudge your way through a gang in search of a lost film crew meeting lots of cannibals the cast are completely unlikable pretentious i for one didnt really care if someone feasted on their flesh thats bad news half of the suspense of a death is actually feeling bad for the guy who has just been impaled by a poisonous dart however no one in this film appears to be good they meet lots of tribes on the way and actually become friends with them  leading them to the site of the last dead crew member and his filmthis is where the film actually livens up once the film is retrieved on a stick with the poor cameramans flesh and bones the film is taken back to new york to be viewed in fullno one could be prepared for what is in store on this tape a film crew drowned in unfamiliarity of their surroundings up to the point they have to indulge in it sleeping in the trees to avoid being poisoned by the creatures of the jungle the viewer will go through a whole variety of emotions anger disgust well  two emotions this band of morons supposedly they were meant to be portrayed that way start abusing territory which isnt even theirs using weapons never seen before by cannibal eyes  setting fire to huts raping pillaging destroying hard to watch at times they certainly did a good job on the special effects everything looks real enough to have the viewer feeling sick at dismembered limbsanimal cruelty should never been involved in the film for the viewers enjoyment thankfully the uk version as is traditional blatantly cuts out scenes which i could imagine i would be reaching for the sick bucket over here the only full animal deaths are of a tarantula and a snake being chopped to bits the turtle does not get dismembered but you get a rather chilling shot of his shell afterwards the monkey gets away as is obvious in the first ten minutes but they could have done with a better editor no reason for a discreet shot of it im also sure they cut out several rape scenes one with a rock but  thats for the betterafter the film ended i was left questioning the movie in terms of its message so who is the real cannibal the cannibals or the film crew the film crew were the real savages so what how does this render the film a masterpiece are the film crew supposed to reflect society as a whole surely an insult to intelligence tell me who in society would be sick enough to go through what we saw in the film okay i agree there will always be the odd one but the message is distorted with what we see on screen society really wouldnt go to the lengths seen here im telling you now maybe its just me but i think if i was with a film crew like that id be cheering for the cannibalshas plenty of blood and guts to satisfy any fan of grossout movies unfortunately with a confusing message it really doesnt have much else to offer35,cruel
this is probably the most disgusting movie ive ever seen in many ways the first disgusting thing about it is the seemingly total lack of plot it feels like a bunch of morons went to the jungle and shot snippets at random with seriously disturbed content then to now let this footage go straight into the garbage can they patch it all together with a pretty feeble storythe next disgusting thing is the footage quality i dont know if it was a bad vhs copy i got or if my videoplayer wouldnt play it right but the quality of the picture was godawfulnext disgusting thingthe things going on in this movie the footage of killings of animals were so real that i doubt they were faked the treatment of the cannibals might have been faked but if it was it really disgusted me in fact we were five people watching this movie from the beginning and i was the only one who viewed the whole time outif youre out to be disgusted get this film if youre out to get an entertaining movie in any other sense avoid at all cost,cruel
when my friend gave me the movie saying he didnt want it i wasnt sure what to think however once i watched the movie i understood why lots of erotic visual horror it scores points though for the plot no matter how thin about the team of four and for the underlying messages contained within,cruel
having just viewed for the first time i cant believe the film was ever released it is truly horrifying the scenery is truly stunning the soundtrack is cool but the scenes of death and torture especially involving the film crew damn there just 2 extreme,cruel
after reading a lot about this film classic cult etc i decided to rent it at the local video store and i expected a good horror film but what i got was some sick piece of crap made by the sickest people on earth im not talking about the lousy story or the ridiculous acting but about the mutilation of animalswho on earth decided not to use special effects for this besides this is one of the worst horror films ive ever seen horror films are supposed to scare the hell out of people but in that this films fails bigtime its as scary as mary poppins and the poor production values indicate that there was only one saturday afternoon spend on writing the script well the only thing that scared me about this film was that some people came up with money for this and that there are people who actually like it 33  of the voters voted a 10 can anybody tell me in what asylum i can find these peoplethe makers try to sell this film as it was made as a documentary and that everything was real a concept that was done much much better by the makers of the blair witch project this is the only thing i have to admit that was good in the film the concept the execution is worthless the main characters lack every depth andor motivation they are supposed to be professional film makers but instead they kill natives and film each other while nakedis a poor attempt to shock people but it only proofs the retardness of the makers who made it anyway some 14year old kids these films give good horror a bad name,cruel
this is the best cannibal movie ever made the music score by riz ortolani is really good and not the music you normally expect for a cannibal movie the movie itself is the definite cannibal movie actually it has disturbing animalsnuff scenes which is surely not the stuff i want to see but it has lots of really good other scenes it manipulates the viewer because the whole violent torture scenes are presented as a movie in the movie plus the violent butchering of the reporterteam is filmed in such a bad way that you could think it is really true what you are seeing mondo for me its a must see movie not only for horror and splatter fans ruggero deodato is surely the king of the cannibal subgenre,cruel
yes its true the one who gave me the video told me this is real then i saw the first one minute and quickly realized that its fake luckily well if you like watching horrors for the passion of revealing the tricks you will enjoy this cause this movie is damned realistic,cruel
as a fan of the cinema i do feel that deodatos is a must see it is not however a must like i question if those of you who claim this basic italian exploitation flick to be the best film ever made have ever seen a movie that isnt considered a cult filmdeodatos message appears to be that filmmakers will go to any cost to achieve fortune or fame ironically by making this film deodato has crossed that line himselfyes this film is better than the blair witch project but thats not saying that either film is any good this movie does not scare its audience it does attempt to shock them with one violent gore scene after another it is the most graphic thing ive ever seen and that includes the mondo films that show actual scenes of death and violence after seeing it the first time i did leave the theater disturbed therefore the film did manage to stir some kind of emotion which many films dont do i was only disturbed however by the images i saw not by the real content of the filmthe animal cruelty is inexcusible and i am not a vegetarian the turtle death scene was slow and drawn out these animal deaths had little to do with any plot the movie may have had they are just another representation of the sick thoughts that run through deodatos mindif you want to see a truly great movie go see the godfather or traffic or american history x one warning though the above mentioned films require you to use your brain to do more than just process visions of rape blood and guts to classify this movie as the greatest of all time is totally missing the point of what film is all about i think some of you immaturely rave about this film as a machismo boast about having some sort of iron stomach im laughing at you and you can trust ruggero deodato is laughing at you as well,cruel
i consider myself to have a fairly desensitised nature when it comes to violence in movies but i was not prepared for deodatos film in the least cannibal ferox was graphic violent and somehow a bit believable but ch went well beyond this the most uncomfortable time ive ever had watching a film i kept saying to myself well it cant get any worse than that scene but it consistently did so many images from the film that stick in the memory be it the real animal cruelty to the equally real looking human indignities we see during the course of the film the pov camerawork of the documentary really enhances the realism particularly in those unforgettable final scenes whether deodato was making a social comment about the difference between civil and savage or whether this was merely an excuse to display such atrocities i do not know one things for sure this is not the sort of movie i will forget in a hurry and that can only be to the directors credit   8 out of 10,cruel
the film starts rather slowly and mundane just like all the other italian cannibal movies but once the movie swaps to the pov of the filmteam the films shows tremendous energy and offers some really sickening scenes this is not a nice fluffy teenyslasher but a real horror film in the truest sense of the word which goes to the limits to shock its viewers,cruel

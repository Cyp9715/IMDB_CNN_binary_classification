i was lucky enough to be invited to see the norwegian nazizombiemovie dd sn  in a private screening in os international film festivalen in norway this film has the best tag line ever ein zwei die so my expectations were pretty high on this onethe director tommy wirkola first got famous in norway with a movie called kill buljo the movie which is a norwegian parody of kill bill he now continues in the same comedyhomagegenre field and very successfully i may add the movie really is as good as it sounds and on top of that it is actually unique i really like tommy wirkolas ability to combine homage with something new and interesting not a very easy thing to do folksdd sn is basically a teenagerslasherhorrorcomedy with nazizombies the storyline is pretty basic its about these teenagers that go up to a cabin in the mountains in the middle of winter and get ambushed by a punch of zombies yeah you know the drill but this one really delivers and all the clichs are used to benefit the film you can see a lot of influences from past genre movies and it is filled with homage towards them everyone who likes these kinds of films will have a blast at the movie theater i laughed my ass offso goo see this film i give it 5 stars,cruel
heading into i was pretty much expecting a shaun of the dead type horror flick something with more comedy than horror which isnt really the case here its consistently filled with small or big jokes but thankfully its more horror oriented i suppose i thought this because of the awesome poster displaying a decapitated halfhead of a nazizombie lying in the snow giving the onlooker a weird look not too mention a dude with a blooddrenched chainsaw behind the head im not the biggest fan of horcoms but i was really interested in this one because of the whacky premise so was it a blizzard of bliss or a storm of suckage the story revolves around a bunch of medical students getting away for some rest and relaxation during the easter break unknown to them theyve set up camp at the absolute wrong place back in the day evil nazis used these hills for an escape route or safe haven way back when and its said that this is where they supposedly holed up and eventually died well they aint all that dead they look it but they aint dead our medical students eventually meet these bloodthirsty german maniacs and the red stuff starts flowing a mad dash for survival ensues and it all ends up being a hail of a lot of funthe flick isnt perfect as it suffers some from small horror clichs like dumb decision making but at the same time they handle these clichs in a somewhat refreshing manner some cheap scare tactics are used early on to get you on edge but those are barely used later on when violence and creative gore take holdreally surprised me i wasnt expecting such a fun flick the characters were all wellfleshed out the dialogue wellwritten and funny the gore aplenty the horror nods abundant and awesome braindead tshirts and even the score and soundtrack were good this should become a pretty big hit for horror fans well i hope so anyways,cruel
first of let me just say i am a huge zombiegorehorror fan and there are few known movies i havent seen during my years on this planet with that said i have to say that is by far the best zombie movie i have ever seen everything clicked perfectly together the humor was spot on and the gore was just priceless beyond belief this film is just eye candy for the hordes of horror fans out there i loved the theme music in the opening sequence very appropriate and perfect for troll like zombies the countless references to classic movies like evil dead friday the 13th april fools day braindead and of course various zombie movies was just phenomenal the filmmakers make no attempt what so ever to hide the fact that this film is almost purely based on these movies and that my friends is a golden ticket to a inexplicable gorefest of uber zombies a chainsaw and a lot of intestines being ripped out in the best of entertaining ways watch this film and you wont regret it ill give you my word as a true horror fan,cruel
norwegian film makers get it this is how to make a cool movie balance the humor and horror special effects that dont over power the movie and most importantly actors that care what they are doing and do it well fritt vilt one and two two not being as good as the first but thats the norm were leagues over what hollywood has put out in over 20 years just small budget horror from people who care what they put out my only complaint is that its hard to get these movies in north america and even harder to get english subtitles but that is in no way a knock to these fine movies if you can get hold of the these films and are a horror buff find them you wont be disappointed keep it up norway,cruel
the mandatory circumstances to watch a movie like are as follows at a horror themed festival amongst hundreds of outrageously enthusiast and derailed fellow genre fanatics  preferably at 3am on a weekend night  and surrounded by booze and snacks if this shouldnt be possible try and gather as many friends together for a drunken movie night but whatever you do dont watch this cheerfully repugnant and positively demented movie all by yourself as it is too much of a crowdpleaser the formula of laughevoking zombie splatter movies isnt new even nazi zombie movies have been done before for example shock waves and zombie lake but spirited and ambitious young filmmakers never cease to invent original variations on the sub genre norwegian director tommy wirkola took his cast  crew high up north for a splatter film in a beautiful and isolated snowy setting a group of medical students  that are also diehard horror movie freaks  trek to a remote mountain cabin for a weekend of snow scooter fun drinking and casual sex the first night of their arrival already they receive a visit from a mysterious and grumpy old local who tells them a grotesquely absurd story about sinister events that occurred in the area near the end of wwii the atmospheric tale says that fed up villagers combined forces and chased their nazi occupants into the mountains where they all froze to death the clique laughs away the warnings but subsequently discovers a box of old coins that promptly resurrects an army of nazi soldiers in a far developed state of decomposition the first half of is slowpaced atmospheric and full of little tributes to classic zombie movies particularly the evil dead movies the students are standard horror stereotypes including the nerd and the blond bimbo and thus the first half also contains childish pranks and gratuitous sex sequences as soon as the nazi zombies emerge however is a nonstop spitfire of blood gore and intestines apparently the production of this film required 450 liters of fake blood and that isnt nearly so surprising if you watch the end result theres chainsaw action decapitations rope pulling with intestines axe murders machine gun concerts and disembowelment the effects are topnotch in spite of the obvious budgetary restrictions and the make up art on the zombies is very impressive the rotting uniformed corpses look quite menacing especially their leader the snowy landscapes are beautiful picture to behold although its even more amusing to see the white snow color red with blood tommy wirkola is a clearly talented director and hopefully a promising long career awaits him,cruel
tommy wirkola sure knows how to make a zombie film not only does he reference many classic zombie films but in turn he makes his own unique spin on the zombie tale and he does it well the plot has striking resemblance to many slashers as it starts off with a group of medical students taking a ski vacation however it takes a turn with random when nazi zombies decide to ruin their fun in order to take back their stolen treasures has many things going for it apart from its odd story it is well written and directed all the actors are very good and the gore levels are extremely high and rival almost every modern zombie flickit goes to show that foreign horror especially european is loads better than most american trash released this film comes from norway and is a shining example simple in its execution with a group of likeable characters a witty script and much disemboweling and delimbing is one of the years best horror films and should make its way into many top lists soon enough45,cruel
do i have complaints about a movie about a group of norwegian medical students who take their skis up to a cabin away from everybody only to discover to their baffled horror that nazi undead lurk and kill and go all lephrachaun over a booty of coins and jewels hidden in said cabin well perhaps it could have gone a little further in some spots the nazis are decked out in their military garb suits and helmets but only a handful have the swastika armbands none with hitler mustaches and only once does a zombie col herzog perfect name by the way actually utter a phrase which is arise for his horde of solider to stampede after the hapless teens the rest of it nope nothing much to complain reallythe director is tommy wirkola and hes done something i didnt expect going in he made a movie that is shot with a level of competency that goes a couple of notches above just simple bmovie twaddle or rather he doesnt rest solely upon it indeed some scenes like when characters are buried under feet of snow or someone goes out into the dead of night theres a dread that can be comparable to the recent film the descent its a well made movie that happens to be about 55 of the time as campy and goreriffic as anything ones seen this year outside of the japanese tokyo gore police school on top of this theres a clever twist on horror conventions one of the characters is a movie geek evil dead and friday the 13th are mentioned and the tropes like having sex and then getting killed or the stranger who explains everything early on and then gets slaughtered first are chalked up royally and then come the third reichoh its such a blast is at first you get immersed with the characters even if they are only marginally interesting or compelling and then when it comes time for these medical students who apparently have such mad skills at it they can do things like wield weaponry and sew up their body parts when need be kick major ass this movie is made for people who want a good solid zombie movie that combines comedy tension and enough ridiculous motions to go a long enough way to make things always entertaining its almost a study in how to uplift past conventional crap into something artful and electrifying its also cheesy and stupid and a bucket of crazy when it can get to that point i mean colonel herzog come on bottom line pair this with and the other midnight movie festival hit hysterical psycho and you got a smashing double feature,cruel
come on it was fun zombified nazi soldiers from the war are attacking a bunch of students and the students fight back a lot of references to evil dead here a lot of fun stupendous gore with all the guts and brains and blood you would ever wantat times the humour in the film actually hurt the viewing since it was obviously artificial so the greatest flaw of the movie according to yours truly is that it was not consistent ever shifting from parody to the real thing but eve so it was tons of funalthough i have to admit the funniest part of the movie is when the nazi zombie officer appears with a spotless officer hat i can only imagine the poor guy eternally cleaning his military attire,cruel
unfolds with a very classical setting a group of youngsters are heading for a cabin with the intentions to drink party and preferably have sex through the whole weekend but as we are talking about a norwegian film the events take place during wintertime and the cabin is located high up in the mountains in the middle of endless fields of snowwhat starts out as a fun in the snow and sun snowball fights fooling around with a motor sled and a stiga soon turns into a gory zombie onslaught as the kids find a box full of nazi gold that definitively doesnt belong to themthe unique setting in the genre gives an unforgettable flavor to the easily one of the greatest zombie films that ive seen in ages director tommy wirkola breaks most of the deeplyrooted zombie traditions with norwegian rock and metal banging in the background  the zombies run think and even talk well just one word dd sn manages to do what many have tried and almost as many have failed while trying its entertaining scary agonizing bloody fun and kicks in like a 12pack of beer the story is well written actors do awesome an job and director wirkolas comedy timing is excellent as is his ability to build up the horror he seems to know exactly how scary place an outhouse can be when its 20 degrees outside in the middle of the night added with a nazi zombie roaming outside its definitively not a place youd like to be with your pants around your anklesdd sn is a wonderful piece of film that isnt ashamed of its roots and language and stands proudly as one of the great examples of norther horror wave thats going strong right now with sauna and let the right one in,cruel
wirkola surely spent time studying the genre of zombie movies thoroughly before setting to work on dd sn paying endless tributes to the great classics of the genre throughout the movie before grabbing it and tossing it over the top and into a strange land beyondthe movie has so many things speaking in favor of it it has a well thoughtout plot it has all the wonderful stereotypes of a horror movie in place and more than anything it follows the rules of the genre to the notefrom the barely glimpse horror in the early phases to the ominous messenger who lays the groundwork for the story to the stalking danger in the dark and all the way to the outright shotgunandchainsaw last stand wirkola hardly hits a single note wrongif the region of finnmark should have one nationalromantic epic to its name it should be this moviethis movie is simply a mustsee for the zombie affectionate,cruel
the acting effects script lighting sound in fact everything about this movie is perfectly soullessly mediocre its not frightening its not funny its not clever its not even a bad movie its something much more unforgivable it is a dull movie unbelievably the creators have taken a story involving teens vs nazi zombies thrown in some sex sprinkled on shotguns chainsaws blood guts and somehow managed to make it as gripping as maidstone on a wet sunday afternoon there should be a new imdb review category reserved for movies that evoke such extreme boredom that you want to kill yourself so ignore the pr company stooges who are posting the 10 star reviews and avoid this hymn to all things bland at all costs there now i feel just a little better,cruel
dd sn which should have had the name red snow or rd sn but could not because there already is a film with such a name and from where jepp norway that one too we got a thing for snow and man did it turn out good in this one i think they somehow got to combine the mayhem and fun from some of the classics at the same time as they capture a bit of norwegian fun with the music and sceneryi definitely recommend the movie for those who are fans of zoombies and goreits been fun reading the comments and what people think of the movie and seeing such an attention for a zombie film from norway,cruel
stop do not watch this is an hour and a half of your life you will never get backi am a zombie movie fan i love gore and thought this movie was going to be great but a combination of bad acting shoddy script low budget unspotted mistakes and a severe lack of plot history and explanation leave you feeling let down it is inconsistent and appears not to know exactly which horror angle to take taking ideas from many zombie and undead movies having nothing original or well donenot bad if the director is a first year college studentwith the exception of alexander  the kings men i have never watched such utter cp and can barley believe it made it to our local video store and not a 99p bin at the flea market05,cruel
nazi zombies more evil than regular zombies a quick tell that this movie was going to be highly derivative of every other zombie movie ever made when they included a character amongst the victims whose whole function was to make reference to other movies  mostly americanobviously the influence here is sam raimis evil dead movies except theyre nazis thats what makes it funny oh except that it wasnt raimis movies were funnythe movie has this group of victims after a short introduction so we can tell them apart go to a cabin in remote norway a park ranger or something stops by to engage in some exposition about the nazis about to attack them we are treated to a bunch of gross scenes including having sex in an outhouse sorry are norweigians really turned on by outside latrines before we get a whole series of gross out gags that are more cartoonish than scarynot worth your time,cruel
move over saw jigsaw may have rocked your minds with his puzzling murders but if you thought a movie couldnt get much higher on the gory scale you couldnt be more wrong turns out that norways tommy workola pretty much tops the gore charts with his hair raising gag inducing loseyourpopcornonyourlap thriller the perpetrator of all of this gore oh you guessed it those elusive and pesky zombie nazis virtually losing all plot twenty minutes in this nordic flop brings you back to or the glory days of those 80s slasher movies remember the classics such as killer klowns from outer space or everyones favorite frankenhooker its a stitch yeah me neither is just about as forgettable with the same plot as practically every teen movie ever made the director pretty much had to use something as outrageous as blooddrooling zombie nazis s character vergard played by lasse valdal even says it himself how many movies start out with a group of friends going to an isolated cabin and that is exactly where this tale starts eight norwegian medical students take a spring break okay this is also the most overused plot sequence to an isolated cabin for some relaxation in the form of sex and massive amounts of alcohol consumption the bulk of the plot all four minutes of it comes when vergard stumbles upon a chest no not even a chest a better word is rather small shoebox in the floor of the cabin while he is looking for some lost beer the group somehow decides that its theirs and theyre going to be rich from the grand assortment of 10 coins that they found this treasure chest looks more like it could possibly fund the groups next trip the liquor store but the screenwriter has the balls to insert an indiana jones quote here fortune and glory kidsfortune and glory yeah rightnext we hear a strange noise from outside the window a strange old man enters disses the hippie girls organic coffee and chastises the group for not reading up on the local history of the area before coming on their grand vacation now i dont know about you but if im headed on a spring break to a desolate mountain to drink and flirt with cute norwegian boys the last thing im interested n is the history of a 20person shantytown plot fail this crazy old man goes on to tell a story about germanys occupation of the area during wwii stating that the nazis treated the norwegians poorly sick of the oppression this small town of stoic mountain dwellers organizes a revolt killing 300 of the nazis im a little curious about what kind of weaponry they scrounged up to overtake an entire trained armybut anyway this whole plot consumes the first twenty minutes of the movie from here on out you lose all objectivity of any sort of direction this story is going so here is where every mistake ever made in a horror movie is somehow wrapped up all in one real thriller now is probably a good time to mention that one real sporty and adventurous girl decided to ski to this cabin by herself through this virtually unnavigable snowy mountain region of norway wonder who dies first cue the zombie nazi infiltration of the movie through the cabin windows where these merciless creatures pull girls into outhouse poop rip off heads pull intestines out and you the lucky viewer even get to see a brain fall on the floor of the cabin half way through this fiasco these ever so intelligent medical students why didnt they make them state school fraternity members they must not exist in norway apparently forget that the zombies are attacking through the windows so they just chill by them again and oh you guessed it another one bites the dust youre just starting to scream at these imbecile characters when they break the number one cardinal rule of horror flicksyou never split up and god forbid you never split up boys and girls but hey the director must have figured he was already 10 feet out without a paddle so why notnow theres more zombies more running more limbripping terror it starts to get real excessive when you realize that theres 5 minutes left and absolutely nothing has been resolved i just about got up to leave when the ridiculous finale kept me wondering how this movie ever even made it to theaters if it wasnt apparent in the rest of this review i do not recommend this movie to even the biggest fan of gore movies please save your five dollars on this one youll be better off taking a nap than wasting two hors of your life on this bloody awful flickand no im not british,cruel
evidently im not part of the target audience for which this juvenile gorefest was intended i like smart creepy movies that plant disturbing ideas in your head and then harvest them with an interesting story that leads to a powerful climax nothing like that happens in this extremely predictable and totally unscary chunk of scandinavian drecki could care less about the twodimensional characters and their misadventures with a very large contingent of omigod how do they think of these things nazi zombies it was obvious within the first 5 minutes where this thing was going the filmmaker missed so many opportunities to craft better characters and a more compelling plot that i was ready to walk out after 45 minutesall i can say in this movies favor is that the audience at the screening i attended at a big film festival cheered and applauded i guess they were all zombie fans im not,cruel
dd sn is directed by tommy wirkola who also cowrites the screenplay with stig frode henriksen the alter of whom also costars it stars vegar hoel charlotte frogner lasse valdal evy kasseth rsten jeppe beck laursen jenny skavlan ane dahl torp and bjrn sundquist music is by christian wibe and cinematography by matthew bradley westona group of norwegian medical students vacationing in the snowy countryside find themselves menaced by nazi zombiesits one for the zombie and splatter crowd is this a norwegian comedy horror fusion that revels in homaging its influences as much as it does swimming in blood its not particularly fresh of course as the story follows a familiar course that sees a bunch of youngsters killed off one by one though the foe in the shape of grizzly looking nazi zombies is cheerfully put to menacing and funny usea little back story is brought into play courtesy of a mysterious hiker who stops by the cabin for a coffee and then at the midpoint all hell literally breaks loose and its the alamo out in the snow genre staples are adhered to complete with stereotype characters and wirkola has a keen eye for gruesome killings and dismemberment it doesnt add new fuel to the genre fire it just keeps it alight and has great fun doing so 710,cruel
nazis and zombies have not always been the most successful combination in cinema history early 80s shockers zombie lake and oasis of the zombies proved that this subgenre needed a lot of work moving on to the present day and we have norwegian film the question therefore has to be have things improved in the past 30 years well marginally at bestmaybe could more accurately be described as a teennazizombie flick seeing as its protagonists are students on a holiday in a remote cabin you can probably guess from that last line that this film isnt exactly original its not remotely scary either but at times you arent really sure if its being played for laughs or not although i guess that was most probably part of the intention horrorcomedy is a hard one to pull of however and this film essentially shows why its effectively neither one nor the other and you are left thinking mehthe characters are so negligible that you really cant care about them and occasionally they do things that are highly irritating ie does anyone really think that there is a chance in hell that a hot girl is going to enter a toilet and willingly have sex with a fat man who is in the process of wiping his butt postdump eh no please again it may have been intended as a joke i dunno maybe its those long winter nights in norway that has led to a somewhat strange and misguided sense of humour anyhow the nazi zombies do eventually turn up in numbers but they seem to be computer generated which takes away some of the threat as its difficult to create genuinely scary monsters with cheap cgi they are perfectly serviceable for a low budget horror picture to be fair but im just not much of a fan of cgi and prefer proper make up and physical effectsthis is throwaway stuff but it might entertain fans of modern horror films i guess,cruel
for me personally one of the hardest fought tickets of sundance 2009 was to see the movie i knew from the moment i heard that it was a film about nazi zombies that it was something that would be at minimum moderately entertaining and the film truly did not disappoint initially when i saw that it was about four attractive twentysomething medstudent couples going to a cabin in the mountains for easter break i was reminded of the gruesomely serious torture porn movies of eli roth like hostel or touristas but was pleasantly surprised that the norwegian filmmakers decided on a different approach instead they decided to take a somewhat satirical approach to the genre classic setup with quotes from indiana jones and the temple of doom selfreferential quips about the number of horror movies that start with the same premise as the characters are experiencing and overthetoplowbudget fight sequences complete with absurd weaponry and obscene amounts of blood by taking this approach and creating a movie that has been rightfully compared to the evil dead series the norwegian filmmakers have successfully done what eli roth has failed at time and again created an entertaining horror film that will truly stand the test of time if only for its absurditythe only issue that i have with the film is that due to the nature of my initial viewing among 280 something diehard fans who were yelling and groaning along with me throughout the entire movie as well as at treevenge the equally absurd short film shown before it i now fear that should i get the opportunity to see this film again it wont be able to live up to the enjoyment of that first viewing,cruel
i went into this movie after reading the high ratings given by other reviewers and i have been wondering since then what the fuss was all aboutthis is a stupid and unimaginative piece of crap disguised as a movie and i can only imagine that the others who gave ratings of 9  10 must be norweigans themselvesif that was true i think they have set the bar really really low first of all the movie plot line feels as if it has been written by a teenagertoo many holes and liberties taken throughoutsample thisa bunch of zombies surrounding a farm house and viciously attacking and killing the inhabitants from outside then dozens of them being dispatched in a ridiculously easy manner by two dudes armed with a small hammer and a kitchen knifesaid dudes killing numerous zombies with kitchen implements inspite of having a chainsaw and a shotguna local who warns the city kids about the dangers in those mountains himself camps out in the same mountains and gets promptly killedthe treasure chest left in the resort for decades yet when the kids discover it the zombies decide they want it back and attack thema gorgeous chick in the group gets desperate to have sex with the fat guy and wraps herself around him at the worst time possible when he is taking a crap in the outhouse this film is just a stupid excuse to show people getting slaughtered in the most brainless manner possiblethe zombies in this movie can run climb trees locate people through binoculars and take orders from a zombie generalyet it is utterly easy to kill them even with kitchen knivesif this was meant as a comedy there was not a single humorous situation not even black humor in the entire movie this really is a very unimaginative and silly moviei cannot even classify this as a guilty pleasurethere are loads of other movies which are way better in all aspectsthat is why i cannot understand other reviewers getting swept away and giving 9 and 10 ratingswhen you give a movie 10 out of 10 it means that the movie is one of the best ever in that genrewhich is not the case at all with this filmi would not give it more than a 4 or 5 yet to balance out the ridiculously generous ratings by other reviewers i am giving it 2 coz i wasted my time downloading and watching it on the strength of collective rating by others there is really nothing here that is not available elsewhere in much better ways if you wanna see a really neat norwegian movie with loads of black humor go for the trollhunter,cruel
when i first saw this film i was unaware that the zombies portrayed in this movie werent normal zombies instead as i recently discovered on imdb they were a norse version of walking corpses called draugr once i realized this it started making more sense as normal zombies usually dont have the intelligence to use things like binoculars neither do they have the motor skills to do anything but essentially walk very clumsily and devour people these zombies run and while that isnt necessarily new it also isnt necessarily standard not only that but they follow orders from a leader and stab people repeatedly anyway once a person realizes this isnt a normal zombie film i think they might be able to accept the fact that the normal rules dont apply and therefore make allowances if necessary in order to give the film a fair chance that said the film had some good parts and it had some bad parts as well first it is being billed as both a comedy and a horror movie it is actually neither i didnt find it very amusing at all ridiculous would be a better word to describe it likewise i didnt see much horror in it yes there was lots of goreand while that is certainly normal in any zombie moviei found the graphics were a poor substitute for actual horror so perhaps a better description might be to call it a splatter filmbecause thats what it is second i believe more attention should have been focused on building up the characters because although the actors did okay i would have much preferred to have someone to cheer for and hope he or she manages to escape unfortunately this was not the case i must confess though that i found the scene where liv evy kasseth rosten woke up and found herself being gutted somewhat of an artistic touch i also liked her solution to the problem on the flipside though i thought that the amputation scenario was just plain stupid no doubt some folks thought it was humorous but i thought it really lowered the films value same thing with the idiotic outhouse scene totally asinine third i noticed that several people have given this movie very high marks it even won an award for best feature film at the toronto after dark film festival thats fine but even though it injected some new possibilities into the zombie culture i found it very disappointing it wasnt funny it wasnt scary and the ending was too predictable and unsatisfying in short the film had some good resources to draw from very nice alpine scenery and a cast that the director tommy wirkola could have probably gotten more out of if he had given them a better script to work with instead he took a different approach and went for cheap laughs and graphics its a shame that he did,cruel

this is one of the worst movies i have actually ever seen i mean like the crap acting and the awful story line lets start with special effects first of all if your making a movie in the snow make it in the snow instead of having a green screen behind the characters secondly the plans that the characters make a pure sht like lets hide in the house and lets run to the car or hide in the shed and also climb in a tree thirdly the zombies i mean if youre making a zombie movie do it right zombies dont run they dont climb trees and they defiantly dont stab people they eat people so ill say dont watch this movie even if youre board just miss it it does not deserve the rating it has now and doesnt deserve the fame its getting if i could give a 0 i would,cruel
undead nazis are not an entirely new concept see 1977s shockwaves for an early example of jackbooted zombies but they are an undeniably cool one particularly when combined with as much ott gore as a budget will allow in fact so assured of the awesomeness of such a premise are the people behind that they dont even bother wasting time to think of a decent plot to support it opting instead to go for a derivative cut and paste approach using elements pilfered from their favourite horror movies which include the evil dead trilogy splatter classic braindead and arguably even john carpenters the fog the result is undeniably fun and goes some way to prove the theory that originality isnt absolutely necessary just so long as you have chainsaw dismemberment and shotgun action unfortunately one cant help thinking that with just a bit more effort and ingenuity in the plot department this film could have ranked up there with the true greats of splatter cinema that its makers so obviously lovebeginning in a similar vein to sam raimis evil dead writerdirector tommy wirkolas movie sees a group of medical students travelling to a remote cabin in the mountains for a weekend break there they are attacked by an army of undead wwii german soldiers who rise from a labyrinthine network of subterranean wartime tunnels in order to claim a cach of gold that lies beneath the cabins floor wirkola fills the first half of his film with silly hijinx the occasional jump scare and a halfhearted attempt at explaining the existence of his bloodthirsty zombies but holds off on the good stuff till later on when the gore finally arrives it doesnt stop flowing until the very end and the sheer quantity and quality of the graphic violence is quite staggering a mans head is torn apart and his brain spills onto the floor with a satisfying plop a zombies unravelling intestines prove to be a life saver for one character when he falls over the edge of cliff a snowmobile is used to reduce several zombies to paste a guy amputates his own arm with a chainsaw after being bitten and one poor bloke is pulled apart in a zombie tug of warhowever no matter how awesome the effects they still werent quite enough to stop me from asking questions about the poorly developed narrative i wanted to know how the nazi zombies managed to cheat death i didnt understand why the creatures had waited so long before trying to get to their gold how they had remained undiscovered for decades was a complete mystery to me whether or not the bite of a zombie would cause the victim to turn was never properly addressed and precisely what that blonde bird found so irresistible about a fat guy wiping his ass in the john i will never knowwhilst im sure well be hearing a lot more about wirkola in the futurehe definitely possesses the talent and enthusiasm required to succeed in the world of horror moviemakingi do hope that next time a bit more effort is spent in developing ideas before shooting commences armed with a really fresh script this guy could be legendary,cruel
if you like bad acting badly cut scenes bad music and a very boringly stupid teen horror flick well maybe theni just hope that this movie did bad money wise and the people who did this never get any funding from anybody to continue making films people like this must hate culture and are probably idiotsdont watch this actually i did not get even to see zombies because i had to quit watching feeling little sick this movie was just so badteenage crapi really dont know what people who make movies like this are thinking they have watched too much big brother and their brains have meltedwhat was the guy doing the script thinkingi really dont know,cruel
with the possible exception of mega shark vs giant octopus this is the worst film ive ever seen it reminds me of what pirates of the caribbean would have been like if made on a shoestring budget and with an r rating predictable story dislikeable characters i was actually rooting for the nazis and what one reviewer thinks are nods to genre classics i think is just laziness on the part of the writerdirectorproducer to come up with anything new this genre has been revitalised recently through films such as shaun of the dead and 28 days later in these films we see the people involved in the conception coming up with new angles and interesting story lines its perfectly ok to reference iconic films but in these days of remakes for remakes sake this particular film brings nothing new to the table with the exception of location forget it,cruel
how do you create a unique take on the cabin in the woods motif how about undead nazis in the norwegian mountains tommy wirkolas starts off terribly like every uncreative zombie movie youve ever seen but by the films end you might even be impressedthe film written by wirkola and creative partner stig frode henrikson follows a group of medical students and their friendssignificant others on a ski trip to the remote village of oksfjord when they arrive at their cabin a creepy old man scolds them for being ignorant to the history of oksfjord where german soldiers tormented the locals during world war ii until the people ultimately had enough and drove the nazis into the mountains where they froze to death or did they the friends soon find themselves under attack by hordes of nazi zombies nazombiesalmost the entire first hour of the 91minute film unravels slowly and predictably to the point where you might start guessing which characters will die first out of sheer boredom its almost an uncomfortable watch knowing a movie about nazi zombies has to descend into bizarre bloody chaos at some point yet theres all this waitingbut the final act delivers for fans of horror comedy and is by and large worth the wait the grayfaced nazi zombies are stupid but also malevolent and fastmoving and the characters face all kinds of unpredictable obstacles in trying to take them down youd think filmmakers wouldve run out of ways to kill zombies by now but wirkola finds ways to turn the action in completely unexpected ways with outcomes that are at times way beyond the norm for the genre wirkola plays it by the book stylistically for the first half of the movie with suspenseful fake outs and bad jump scares but then gets creative later visually his style is slightly reminiscent of how edgar wright handled shaun of the dead his skill set on the whole appears much better suited for action and tension than for pure horrorfeatures some seriously lowbudget effects but no cgi the zombie makeup is average and there are a few moments that appear to involve green screen but fans of old fashioned blood mixtures and flesh and guts in gooey puddles will praise the film for its commitment to oldschool values the sense of humor also shines in the end redeeming the clichs of the first hour it doesnt ever reach too far for laughs thanks in large part to not taking itself too seriously after watching the beginning youd swear not a single clever person worked on this movie but by the end youll realize how wrong you wereputs a strange and oddly satisfying twist on an alltoo familiar genre but it comes too late not too late to salvage the film but too late to be classified as one of the best modern zombie pics steven cthanks for reading visit moviemusereviewscom,cruel
id seen this pop up believe it or not on a best zombies movies ever list and though skeptical after watching trailers for several months ago it happened to be in the freezone of my cable on demand so i thought id give it a shotand im glad i did because whats wrong with is whats become wrong with horror and helped me see it its a lot easier to make a film than it was in the heyday of the directors whom these young filmmakers so desperately wish to emulate as a consequence this and other indie horror flicks have no weight to them anymorethey simply feel like a series of cheeky references only diehard horror fans would understand and in the case of it seems as if a bunch of uninspired but somewhat technically talented film students were given a little too much money and time to live out their teenage fantasies in the woodsand heck its just not a good movieits a pretty typical setup college kids head up to the woods for a weekend of skiing and partying a stranger imparts to them a creepy story about nazis that died in the surrounding hills and a dire warning about not disturbing the evil and then for reasons that arent particularly clear the nazis rise from the dead and terrorize the living hilarity ensuesthe film never really breaks free of its prosaic structure glossy finish on the final product notwithstanding the zombies whose motivations we care little about are predictably calculating monsters who are easily dispatched theyve little menace and all seem disposable at least george romero treats his zombies with a modicum of respectthe script and editing are awful both working in concert to show a confused narrative and the filmmakers willingness to cut corners and for a horror film that opens up with dialogue referencing the dos and donts of other horror films the scriptsomewhat surprisinglyslips into humdrum stupidity with characters suggesting the group split up and then not doing it and then  huh they split up after all see the bad script complaint running off into a freezing wilderness when staying put is clearly the best option etcmost insulting of all is the cute referential camera cuts closeups and the blatantly derivative final battle oh look at this another raimi fan we dont have enough of thosethe sam raimievil dead thing is getting really old i swear it seems as if more and more of these horror films are being written by 14yearolds on an ash high as far as im concerned the evil dead camera tricks pushed this film over the edge of forgivabilityis another one for the heap yet another small film by smallminded people which will quickly and hopefully be forgotten when something more inspired comes along,cruel
ive read comments on this board about how much this movie will blow your mind dont believe them they are truly lying this movie disappoints in pretty much every aspect the script the acting the humor the horror the characters anyway the nonexistent story overall im a zombie fan and this was below average even if it is supposed to be a bmoviemaybe if i hadnt read the comments before i watched the movie i wouldnt be so disappointed i would just think its another forgettable hitandmiss at the zombie genreif you want a zombie comedy go watch evil dead or shaun of the dead4 out of 10 because the fx were good and because if you dont buy the hype its not that bad its just bad,cruel

i have to admit im not a great fan of horror films but i was prepared to give this one a go i mean how bad could it be a scandinavian norwegian in this case horror film with subtitles that involves nazi zombies how could i turn it down well i have to say it wasnt as bad as i was expecting in fact i quite liked it to a certain extent but more of my thoughts later heres a brief summary first summary haters please chainsaw your own arm off while i write the next paragraph pick it up aftera group of young friends martin roy hanna vegard liv erlend and chris are meeting at a cabin in the mountains for the easter holidays the cabin is owned by vegards girlfriend sara who is skiing there and will arrive later during their first night a stranger knocks at the door they let him in and make him coffee he tells them the creepy tale of the germans who occupied the area during world war ii they were particularly evil to the locals and when they were about to be defeated many of them escaped to the mountains with a horde of cash and jewels stolen from the locals which was lost in the escape some say they still search the mountains for the horde the stranger leaves and the group are slightly creeped out by his tale then erlend searching for some beer finds a box under the floor bet you cant guess whats inside needless to say the group is picked off one by one until the final few are left for the big showdown at the endalthough this film does not really do anything different to most in this genre it was quite nice to see it from a different standpoint what i mean is its nice to see the norwegian take on this type of film i loved the soundtrack some classical and then everything up to some really hard rock all in norwegian of course i wont say too much about the performances everyone was ok and nobody really stood out although vegar hoel as martin and stig frode henriksen as roy had a few really good comic moments towards the endso overall pretty gory with a nice soundtrack it doesnt really add much to the genre although the zombie nazis move a lot faster than in most american zombie films i really liked the sound design they actually took their time and mixed a proper 51 surround sound track hollywood please take note some really great comic moments particularly towards the end but it does have subtitles which may put a few off over all recommendedmy score 6210,cruel
zombie nazis whats not to like well wasnt great but it was a good time especially in the last half i liked that it took mostly place in daytime instead of the usual night to hide the clunky makeup and special effects speaking of which the nazi zombies only looked like zombies from their dessicated faces the nazi angle was in fact exploited very little which is a shame as the nazi zombies could have been any other slightlymoreintelligentthanusual zombies in uniforms there was acceptable makeup but ive seen better there were some good gory moments some were copies of other films or hommages some seemed original but i havent seen everythingi particularly liked the parts with intestines no im not sick  because they were clever i didnt care much for the characters or future victims as they were cardboardthin basically one trait for each one if that and sometimes acted stupidly one of the last confrontations and what ensued after a bite was brilliantly funny in a dark twisted way there were other funny moments but not that much scary not so much but some tense moments it veers more towards comedy than horror but doesnt go fullblown ridiculous as in the characters stay serious once the bloodshed begins you could do worse than rent thisrating 6 out of 10 good,cruel
to limited effect overall it was a better film than i expected never mind the dubious raves ive seen here and elsewhere but sadly not up to snuff with the aforementioned hype nonetheless auteur tommy im no household namenot even in norway wirkola shows a talent for filmmaking that may yet come to fruition at least if the trailer to hansel and gretel witch hunters is to be believed hopefully his new writing partner will have reined in the sophomoric scatology and harebrained plotting that torpedoes by and large he knows how to stage an action scene if nothing else and manages to get fairly decent performances from his cast of unknowns all of whom seem to have continued working so there is thatdoesnt really know what it wants to be is it a horror movie not really because its not scary its too silly for that is it a comedy not really because theres very little humor in it thats worth a listen shaun of the dead this aint let alone dead alive or the evil dead the story is derivativethink john carpenters the fogand worse suffers from a lack of internal consistency and very difficult suspension of disbelief the result is an insult to the intelligence of the audience a typically unforgivable sin in the realm of cinema a med student with an aversion to blood okay who later amputates his own arm and then cauterizes the stump with no great ill effect okay long dead intestines with the tensile strength to hold two men dangling over a cliff uhhuh a woman who gets all frisky in a noisome outhouse sure i could go on but you get the idea on top of that we get essentially generic characters who fail to endear themselves to us so we dont care what happens to them at all not goodonce again sturgeons revelation holds sway contrivance does not make for a compelling story fountains of grue are old hat regardless of the quality of the effects and camerawrangling let us hope that wirkola has learned some lessons and has applied them to hansel and gretel witch hunters the trailer looks promising but we all know how deceptive trailers can bemeanwhile dont be snowed you wont lose any sleep missing this one,cruel
zombies every horror fans loves them right nazi zombies sounds even better right nazi zombies in norwegian mountains sounds even much better right well in one way this film delivers  the zombies the nazies and the gore but to my biggest surprise and i know this is a just a horror movie but originality and characters take a back seat here which is makes it all feel very stalethe movie has some very fun moments the girl and the fat guy on the toilet seat is very repulsively funnyick but the house in the middle of nowhere and zombies trying to eat you is so so old now i founnd myself getting very bored the scenery is lovely with mountains of snow but characters are so bland and boring couldnt careless about them there is no plot to speak of why not if they spent more time on the script and the characters than with the gory sequences it would of helpednow ill end on a positive note the stitching up of the sliced neck scene was wonderful great job effects guy i just hope the filmmakers who made this come up with an original story and characters next time because us paying audiences are not braindead sorry for the pun,cruel
my god was this movie made with a budget of 100 eur camera included if this is something that a few kids from film school homemade i would give it a passing grade thats why i rated it 2 out of 10 this is one of the worst zombie films ever i have no idea why oh whyit has such a high rating started watching this film thinking you cant go wrong with nazi zombies well i was wrong awful effects worse camera bad jokes no plot and overall bad movie imagine getting together with a few friends and your camera to make a home video have a few drinks while someone writes down a plot get up and say action that is what this thing looks like to me,cruel
this movie is horrible the setting the people and the plot make no sense whatsoever the characters seem very fake and unrealistic even for horror movie standards at one point a wise native man randomly appears to warn the group of collegemedical kids about some evil in the mountains but then himself decides to camp out in the mountains and dies as a result of the evil also half of the movie is a buildup to a very unrealistic and predictable fight scene where zombies constantly appear out of nowhere i came in to this movie with good expectations but was severely disappointed i couldnt bear to watch the whole movie just dont watch it it is a waste of time,cruel

as it says on the box of the blu ray zombies nazis blood on snow it doesnt get any betteri wanted this movie so badly every since i heard of it at some festival i attended my expectations grew and grew ever higher then the title was finally released in the uk on dvdblu ray on august 31st i got it about a week laterby that my expectations were skyhigh and let me tell you i was not disappointedat first i was a little mad that the movie only came with english subs and was in its original norwegian language but honestly it didnt bother me one bit you get used to it so fast when the movie sucks you inthe movie starts with 4 guys and 3 girls on their way to a secluded cabin where they want to spend their easter break at night they get a visit from an old fellow who tells them that evil lives in that mountains since the time the people there had to cope with the nazis invading their land and using it as a marine base and such and they werent really nice to the people living there they abused them terrible until they had enough they killed the invaders and buried them in the mountains after finishing the story the guy leaves with a warning well from then on its about 50 minutes of hardcore splatter action very well made one too and funny at the same time like two guys hanging off a cliff with only the intestines of the guy who is still on top of the mountain to hang on toothey find a lot of ways to kill the resurrected nazisbut its not really a comedy more a splatter movie real hardcore that doesnt take itself seriouslyi dont wanna tell you anymore but you should see that movie its just greateven with my skyhigh expectations i still found it really awesome,cruel
a group of college friends are caught in a frightening attack by nazi zombies in a 2008 slapstick horror film that entertains for an hour and a half despite a complete lack of plot and characters the film directed by norwegian director tommy wirkola centers on a group of college friends spending easter break at a cabin in northern norway on the night they arrive a stranger shows up looking for a cup of coffee during his visit he informs the students of the history of the area involving the nazi occupation during world war ii he tells of the horrible atrocities committed by the germans and warns the students of the presence still felt in the woods surrounding the cabins after the nazis defeat the carefree students hardly take him seriously except for vegard lasse valdal whose girlfriend sara ane dahl torp is skiing to the cabin he leaves the next morning on a snowmobile to find her that night both vegard and the remaining campers are faced with the presence the stranger warned them about they come in the form of frozen nazi zombies who occupied the region during world war ii in their lifetimeis a film that is not serious in the slightest it was simply made for the actors director writers and audience to have fun and it should be appreciated in that sense the film is very funny and inventive probably the most inventive feature of the film is how many hilarious and entertaining ways the characters kill zombies they use as many weapons as they can find including a chainsaw a hammer and a sickle shown one after the other in reference to the russian communist party logs from the woods grenades from the zombies a machine gun and even the belt on a snowmobile this list is very incomplete i spent the entire film wondering how they would kill the zombies next and laughing when the next crazy killing spree broke out indeed this film is a great example of cinema that is not to be taken seriously but simply enjoyed for its ingenuity and comedydespite the lack of seriousness in this film it has many artistic moments i was impressed by several scenes in which there was a great deal of creativity and art that went into their making the best example of this was a scene in the middle of the movie where the audience sees a firstperson view of a major character dying the girl involved ran into a tree branch knocking her out and allowing the zombies to catch up to her the audience is shown how the zombies are killing her through her own blurred vision giving the scene an intense reality and adding to the film one of its only airtight scenes this scene and several other artistic scenes really add to the movie creating a further sense of wonder and amazement over the creativity and cleverness of the writersthe cleverness does not guarantee a perfect movie however and this film certainly has its flaws firstly the actors in this movie hardly need to be recognized for this film because they really had little to do the film really never focuses on the characters and does not develop them at all it also does not develop a plot the movie starts with a group of carefree kids arriving at a cabin and basically turns into a killing spree after that the audience also watches as individuals wander off from the group which could have created interesting side stories but instead these characters run into nazis that they have to deal with on their own this creates for a quite boring story if thats what one is looking for however as i mentioned earlier this film needs to be approached with the expectation that it does not need a good plot or good characterizations in order to be entertaining the film is supposed to be enjoyed without too much thought and those who do not like to do that should avoid the film because it really is not for themoverall delivers by being fun and entertaining it is certainly not the most complex or airtight of horror movies but its not supposed to be its a slapstick horror film that should be enjoyed with an absent mind and a carefree attitude it is definitely not for drama lovers or for those who get easily queasy but for those who are simply looking for a good time it delivers with creativity humor and vast amounts of blood710,cruel
nazizombie horror isnt a new idea for decades horror filmmakers have attempted to capitalize on the greatest tragedy in modern history by giving the dirty nazis their comeuppance   in undead form the only bad thing about the cinematic destruction of nazi brains is that most of these nazombie flicks are just plain awful the french for example did it a couple times with appalling flicks like oasis of the zombies and zombie lake i guess they were still angry about losing paris so they didnt even want to give nazombies the benefit of a quality movie a rare diamond buried in the pile of rotting nazi flesh however is the new norwegian zomcom dd sn aka in a group of twentysomething medical students head up to a mountain cabin for an easter vacation ski trip after only a short while the inevitable happens a crazy old man barges his way into their lives and bores them with a ridiculous tale of evil nazi curses and stolen treasure when have crazy old men in horror movies ever been right not too long after that those wacky nazis show up seeking the gold that well wasnt really theirs to begin with but they still want it back anywaywith films like zombieland and shaun of the dead being released over the past few years it is very difficult to gain any kind of recognition in the zombiecomedy subgenre since every zomcom will undoubtedly be compared to one or both of them however can definitely withstand the comparison from the wicked fun opening scene and all the way through the nazombie horrorcomedy is hilariously gross and grossly hilarious it even has some good scares to go with it from a technical standpoint tommy wirkolas direction and matthew westons cinematography very well capture the beauty of the snowcovered mountains but the shakicam got a bit frustrating in a couple scenes the gore is fantastic and overthetop especially the excellent little deadalive moment maybe to go along with vegards tshirt the writing is fresh and well paced leaving most of the characters onedimensional enough so that its not too much of a worry when theyre executed by the nazi horde sometimes shallow characters are useful it does have some clichd elements but the film seems selfaware of them even mentioning a few of them in their references to other films what will be more frustrating to horror fans than the clichs is the ridiculous statement made about evil dead ii being a higherbudget remake of the original but this is neither the time nor place to get into thatoverall dd sn is a fine addition to the zomcom subgenre if you want a fun zombie romp with some laughs and scares check this one out   then check out shock waves for really the only other worthwhile nazombie film final verdict 810ap3,cruel
i will start with why it is excellent the movie open with a group of hikers going on easter vacation their destination is a small cabin so far from any civilization that there is no reception there every character is a stereotype a blond bimbo a nerd a shy reasonable guy a caring girlfriend and others they all speak norwegian or is it swedish and are not at all known actors at least not in hollywood however they give a great performance that on top of great cinematography and costume design you would never had guess that this is a small lowbudget production it is simply beautiful how the director managed to pull this off now the promise is that during ww2 some nazis were stationed here and murdered locals for their gold now the civilians gathered up and chased the soldiers to the mountains were they seemingly froze to death of course they didnt and they are back to make a pretty nice threat for the first hour this is greatnow why the movie is disappointing after the first hour the director run out of ideas you see pulled intestines three  times there is a battle between the nazis and the survivors armed with tools from the shed its great but it only lasts for 3 or 4 minutes and they only use a chainsaw and a hammer what is with the other tools especially that we were show to a pitchfork and also we can imagine using a monkey wrench or a vise or many other things having the chainsaw in the next 5 gags feels repetitivealso there is a problem of making a movie entirely out of clichs is problematic they are only right when the event still happens in many films if it was a clich 20 years ago it is not so recognized anymore some are perfect like having zombies and a stranger appear from nowhere seemingly sneaking up on the character this is exploited to the limit in and it is funny but what would be a clich ending  does everybody die or are there some survivors there is no answer because there is as many examples for one as the other  now director has to choose one and he cant be right why should you watch it thenits hard not to compare to shaun of the dead which had a richer satire and more interesting characters i know i know thats not the point of even though comes first when you count makeup and cinematography yet like many reviewers stated it is a movie to have playing in the background of a drunk party while some scenes are brilliant the movie as whole doesnt have enough jokes orand clichs to fill 85 minutes watching the 10 minute clip of a mentioned battle is well enough for most movie goers i assure you,cruel
the moment you hear even a dollop of the plot from the norweigian fright flick you are drawn in with unadulterated curiosity the catch nazi zombies and while premise goes a long way when marketing a film like this you need substance to keep the premise supported and it is something that never quite realized in this gory bmovie camparamasprinkled with moments of hilarity even genius perhaps does all that it can with its onenote gimmick but regardless of intention i topped out at around the hour mark and than the watch checking began really this film is a very conventional horror film simply with unconventional antagonists where the film truly succeeds is in its uniquely dark humour because as the nazi corpses mount at the climax so does tedium i am certainly not going to nitpick at the plot and continuity of a film like this but even under no intentional scrutiny i began to be struck with numerous inconsistencies which only detracted more from the actionfor open minded western audiences the norweigian leads will be a relief from the aura of convention that masks many of hollywoods horror efforts the subtitles alone demand more attention and the crisp mountain summit on which the heroes reside becomes almost a character of its own the group of friends comprised of either very new or first time swedish actors all do solid jobs as well and lend to the charm of the click nicely you have all the conventional players the cool guy the jokester the hot hussy and the coward but as i said the leads pull it off and the nazi zombie factor drowns out such clichs nicely enough the plot itself is really a moot point the gang are in a remote cabin for a weekend of drinking when the goosestepping starts and they try to escape still with me one of the more frustrating aspects of is the egregiously varying strength of the zombies some are killed with a single kick to the head while others amble around with an axe in their head and im not going to nit pick on physics but when seventy year old frozen corpses spurt blood like its a tarantino movie you cant help but notice the final thirty minutes is a single tedious chase sequence and really detracts from the charm built up by the dark humour and bloody fun of the middle segments this void is made even more depressing as it unflatteringly highlights against the former acts and reeks of what could have been while a fun enough film to have running in the background on a drunken night with friends never reaches the level its premise boastsread all my reviews at simonsaysmoviesblogspotcom,cruel

i had the pleasure of being present at the pre premiere in tommy wirkolas home town alta and i have to say noch ein mal he impressed me ive never been into either the slasher the horror the zombie or the nazizombieslasherhorrorcomedy genre but now i am what surprised me most was the comedy factor if yourre at the cinemas to be frighten you can see another movie it has its moments but the comedy kills most of the horror effect if your out for a great time at the cinema this is your film if you dont like blood you probably could see this film despite that youve never seen this amount of blood in a film ever before because of the amountwirkolas kill buljo became a success much because of the humor and the low budget it was a cult film even before the premiere this time wirkola and co writer and actor stig frode henriksen has kept the humor its still not a big budget but the production of the film costed more than 10 times the production of kill buljo and it shows the fx team have done a great job and this time they have real actors no hard feelings martin hykkerud the line up is fantastic bjrn sundquist who plays the hiker is one of norways most used actors and hes born to play this kind of role guess thats why they asked him and the other actors are great in their roles ane dahl torp maybe the biggest norwegian actress at the moment plays a minor part in the film just to get her on the team says a bit about this filmi wont give you any spoilers just go see this film americans the film is ready for the sundance festival go there watch it then you can say ive seen this movie months ago when your friends want to see it when it hits cinemas all over us,cruel
this is a a retroslashercollegecom in a similar vein to feast or brain dead it starts of quite professionally and the actors and writers eagerly display there talents then a load of zombies turn up and it gets really stupid when i say a load i actually mean a torrent of unkillable fodder after about the 50th zombie was cut down only for another platoons worth to spring from the ice ninja style i felt something in my brain switch offthe film is very silly to the point of monotony and no i was not expecting shakesphere but evil dead or dog soldiers would have been nice the humour was also totally lost on mezombies are scary stuff i mean the undead coming to eat you is terrifying the corpses ideology doesnt really come in to it yet somehow nazi zombies didnt seem as scary if anything i found them a bit depressing and pathetic then it struck me they can eat me eat my whole family in the end even from the grave they still lost,cruel
is at once grotesque and hilarious a film that needs to be seen by all horror fans it takes its well worn premise with gusto giving it an energy and fun that most genre films never approachthe premiseas if you care about plot in a movie like thisis that a bunch of norwegian medical students take a ski trip to a remote fjord blissfully unaware that they are about to get a blast from the past a group of very unhappy undead nazi soldiers are in the area and they have some time to killthis film has everything a zombie movie should have humor graphic gore and power tools put to some very interesting uses the actors playing the medical students are about average but the actor who plays the head zombie colonel herzog is a standout who knew that grunts and screams could be so emotiveput this on the top of your rental list now,cruel
a group of norwegian college students on a mountain vacation are terrorized by nazi zombies from wwii gore brief nudity and some decent jokes followthis is the best zombie movie ive seen since the last romero extravaganza the acting is good production values are high the premise is as believable as any other zombie movie and its just plain enjoyable to watch the students make some of the usual mistakes you see in every horror movie but then go on the offensive and that is one of the better parts of the filmto summarize this is an enjoyable zombiehorror film with good action gore and humor its not a high budget blockbuster but is an excellent example of what can be done with a little money and a good story,cruel
i found to be so disappointing because it started out great i thought it was really atmospheric and intriguing for about a half an hour then the zombies showed up and the movie turned into yet another postbraindeadevil dead 2 gorefestthe movie takes its time letting us get to know the characters and their surroundings and these first scenes are nicely paced and effectively eerie the movie switches gears abruptly when the zombies attack leaving behind its refreshingly restrained approach for the more audiencepleasing mixture of overthetop splatter and armedtotheteeth protagonists sam raimi and peter jackson did it already no need to do it again and again and againinstead of atmosphere we get buckets of blood instead of style we get increasingly elaborate ways for people to die instead of suspense we get the usual loud noises and bursts of musicso much could have been with the scenario not that the idea of zombie nazis is new in the first place but its obvious the filmmakers chose to use the story as nothing more than a clothesline for a series of gory setpieces gore simply doesnt do it for me anymore and thats about all has to offer,cruel
a group of medical students head to a cabin in the middle of some snowy mountains for a drunken sexfilled holiday from school little did they know the mountain range was where a nazi company escaped to and vanished at the end of wwii now they will facenazi zombies disclaimer the movie is in norwegian with english subtitles i dont know if they dubbed it or not but i dont really care i like dubbed anime but i hate dubbed liveaction the premise of the movie actually makes it sound quite comedic i mean how serious can nazi zombies be even people on the imdb forums claim this is onpar with shaun of the dead in terms of zombie comedy however i definitely did not see it that way other than a few choice fight scenes the movie had a quite serious tonethe story is slightly aboveaverage for a zombie movie at its heart it is a watch these kids get terrorized by the undead movie but there are a few nice bits that set it apart the back story of why the zombies are there is way more indepth than the normal here are zombeeees they wanna eat you clich in other words it isnt a clichd zombie moviei feel like im being redundant nowthe zombies themselves are not as dumb as normal ones but not too bright either they can run and use weapons such as knives and clubs but thats about as far as their intelligence goes their makeup is really good and they didnt just smear some blood over a normal guy they actually gave them all rotting parts and so forththe special effects are quite good im not sure if they used any cg gore or not because it all looked pretty real as real as movie gore can look there are some really sick scenes also so hopefully hardcore film violence doesnt gross you out the director must have some intestines fetish or something because everyone and their mom gets their guts ripped out in some odd way there are disembowelings decapitations stabbings eyegougings shootings etc it really is a horrorviolence hat trickim horrible at judging acting by people speaking a foreign language but i was pretty convinced of the casts ability there was some english spoken usually by the nerdy fat movie buff in the movie who had a really good scwarzenegger impression by the way but other than that it was pure norwegian which sounded quite cool i definitely enjoyed but then again im a sucker for zombie movies and independent horror in generalif you like zombie movies you will love this subtract 2 or 3 from the score if you dontfinal score  8510,cruel
i watched this movie because of the hype it had over the net plot is simple as it is preposterous a group of medical students go for a weekend getaway in a cabin in the mountains and are attacked by nazi zombies yes guys is a zombie filmi like horror movies but not really those with zombies i havent watched evil dead or brain dead or friday the 13th but i can imagine the director being heavily influenced by these classic zombie films these were even mentioned at the beginning of the film as some sort of tributeno question about it this film is gory yes the setting of white show emphasizes the bloodiness of the action we see all forms of dismembering and disembowelment of the characters we see parts of the body being ripped off or ripped apart there were some images i have never seen on screen before i think this would be the only movie where you can see how someones intestine can be used to keep you from falling off a cliff quite educational lol but at the same time it does not take itself seriously the nazi makeup is quite obviously tongueincheek you watch it and wince and yet you also laugh in spite of what you see it is all over the top i recalled sam raimis drag me to hell in the execution and plot devices used in this moviedefinitely not for everyone its so confidently proud to be a bzombiemovie that is can actually be good recommended for a group of rowdy pals on a nightout wanting a good scare and a have good time laughing about it,cruel
the movie was decently funny but there was a lot of ripping out zombies organs one of the reviews compared it to shaun of the dead it wasnt anything like it shaun of the dead didnt have this much gore and was really funny this movie made me laugh twice and i wanted to vomit the rest of the time,cruel
i dont know maybe i was expecting a lot more im not sure but really with all the truly entertaining zombie movies out there not to mention some of the great nazi zombie movies eh this one just left me kinda cold and it wasnt just the snowi mean outpost 2007 and the bunker 2001 ht even 1986s the supernaturals starring lieutenant uhura were way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay the hell better in just about every way that counts at least to me of course i understand that those were meant to be completely serious and this one isnt still its just that there isnt anything for me personally to grab on to in this film in order for me to say that i really liked it frankly and i hope you dont mind my calling you that i just didnt see what the big deal was there was a lot of standing around and breathing heavy that got kinda old i dont know i just think that somehow it could have honestly been a lot more clever genuinely funny creepier something it was just kind of nothingthere were some individual parts that were okay i guess i liked the cool kind of laidback guy who was almost always smiling some of the parts with him were all right some of the individual stunts and effects i guess were okay it just all seemed to me anyway to be kind of lazy by the numbers nothing really stood out not the mood not the humour not the horror nothingim not saying that it was totally lousy or anything thus the tepid 5 that i gave it  and quite honestly i am not that enthusiastic about giving it that much but these days with like a billion zombie movies and about 12 billion zombie  comedies i just think that there should be something that stands out at least a little as far as the mood the effects the suspense the acting especially the writing again somethingi havent seen the more recent film iron sky about finding nazis on the moon dont know if they are zombies though but i bet ill like that one betterlike i said in my title summary even shock waves as dated and cheeeeeezy as it is surprisingly is a lot more moody and effective and much easier to immerse yourself into than this soso offering sigh and i also have 2 on bluray sitting here waiting for me to watch it oh boy i can hardly wait,cruel
contains possible spoilersi love zombie movies i love world war ii movies i love playing nazi zombies on call of duty so when i had heard about this movie i was excited i saw the trailer and was even more excited because it clearly made homages to the evil dead and other similar flicks then to see the characters making a stand instead of all just running around screaming and crying like idiots and actually take the fight to the zombies had me all the more excited much more pleasing than the similar movie outpost with ray stevensen idiotic characters with a serious tone and hopeless plot anyways back to the movie started out promising a bunch of friends having fun without the gratuitous sex nudity and drug use clichs that always ruin movies like this for me while there is a sex scene its brief nonudity and more on the comical side then once it gets in to the action it still remained promising though i have to say a little tedious on the intestines then the whole movie comes crashing down at one pivotal moment the film makes the exact almost frameforframe same mistake that the movie the descent makes at a key moment ill try to keep it vague so not to ruin the movie but lets just say if you see someone hacking away at a zombie with an axe dont walk up behind them and put your hand on them wait till theyre done or call their name for gods sake at this point it was obvious what the outcome of the movie was going to be so i was getting impatient and just wanted them to hurry the hell up and get to itsome people may find that im being to harsh and just accept the movie for what it is which is something im all for thats why this movie gets a 7 it probably would have gotten a 9 or 10 for me considering its a low budget norwegian movie it starts to succeed where others of its type have failed but then in the last 10 minutes it follows the same path and ruins itselfbottom line if you want to make a lighthearted comedic gorefest then stick to that tone dont try and be comedic one minute then deadly serious the next zombieland is a perfect example of how to make a zombiecomedy,cruel
i am quite happy to see more movies coming out with a horrorcomedy evil dead kind i saw drag me from hell the other day and loved it scourged around for more and stumbled upon this and i have no regrets what is required from such a movie is lots of blood check girls check characters that will make you laugh check and creativity check oh and double check the zombies part zombies are welcome from anywhere in the world and nazi zombies yes i do have some misgivings about some parts of the movie including the fact that not many zombies were hurt in the process but on an overall creative aspect this movie gets my nod,cruel
a norwegian shaun of the dead not in the slightestmany half baked directors thought it was easy to make a film like the shaun and have success but almost all failed shaun was intelligent and smart this film is boring the most times and dumb the other times many scenes and ideas are stolen from other films there is truly not one original idea in this filmhere and there are stupid references to other much better horror films a brain dead tshirt  how wittyonly the actors are decent the rest of this film is not enjoyable even for a horror film fan like me,cruel
norwegian horror comedy full to the brim with delicious splatter is indeed a true crowd pleaser successfully alternating between being gory genuinely suspenseful and incredibly funny its selfaware without going overboard in terms of hip dialogue the characters are aware they could be in a horror film situation but dont obsess over the idea the story wilfully submits to genre conventions while also playfully pointing them out and that snowy mountainous scenery sure is beautiful all in all director tommy wirkola and company have made what is a cool addition to that familiar kids go to a remote location and get terrorized horror plota group of medical students and their girlfriends travel to the remote norwegian wilderness to have a good time only to hear of a local legend from a wise older man a crazy ralph type character only not so crazy about nazis who came to the area long ago and plundered valuables from the area residents well it turns out the nazis are still around over 60 years later and now theyre zombies characters such as martin vegar hoel and roy stig frode henriksen must fight for their lives while the zombie hordes start to overwhelm themyou know youre in for some fun when one hilarious highlight has a major set piece set to a peppy pop song extremely significant is the moment when one of the characters successfully amputates their arm only for something else to happen ill leave you to discover this brilliant bit of dark comedy for yourselves thankfully the gore seems to be largely of the practical variety and should have viewers howling with appreciationthe music is great throughout including the umpteenth use of the classic public domain composition in the hall of the mountain king and the way the bright colours  not just the blood but the costumes of our potential victims  contrast with the monochromatic background is strikinghorror lovers should have a fine old time with this oneeight out of 10,cruel
aif you want truly entertaining horror these days youve got to lean more towards the foreign releases ill be fair and say around the new millennium american horror began to dip in quality sharply compare american werewolf in london to american werewolf in paris or the 1980 something dracula to dracula 2000 all they seem to be capable of is spewing out remakes such as the wretched 2007 the fog remake of course with their creativity well gone dry they turn their eyes overseasis an awesome movie coming from norway the movie seems selfaware of what it is and plays on it in a very badass fashion one character early on references to the evil dead trilogy of which i am a diehard fan and the majority of the movie is about paying homage to cult horror movies the gore is just fantastic and overthetop as hell but thats the point of the movie the real treat of the movie is that while sticking to many of the general rules of horror films it also manages to break a few in the process such as killing off the character we perceived as the hero when you least expect it of course im not gonna give away exactly who survives and who doesnt thatd be cheating but the movie is definitely a horrorcomedy mix that serves as an exciting thrill ride of gorethe makeup effects are quite well done and any movie that opens with in the hall of the mountain king edvard grieg has my stamp of approval,cruel
i love the concept of this movie maybe because i play a little to much nazi zombies on call of duty anyways i wish this movie wouldve been a parody of call of duty other than that i was looking for a good horror that wouldnt be like any of the trash that comes out here in the states oh how i was disappointed they took a lot of the crap that comes off as scary here in the states and put it in their film everything was down right predictable as a horror film i give it a 210 for any comedy they could have thrown in there they didnt ill admit i laughed once at a joke but thats it i have no idea how people think this movie is funny so comedy side gets 110 i always think that the last scene of a movie makes a movie though thats about the only part of this movie that was truly good so ill give the last scene a 710 adjusting for inflation i give this movie a 310 not a completely horrible movie but not great like everyone else seems to think dont waste your time if you arent a fan of typical american horror movies,cruel
what the hell have i watched i can not believe that in years when i hereby make great films makes a film in a way that the statute of limitations at least ten years please directors does not waste time making this kind of staff if you just need income do porn and please in future at least talk with someone who understands movies for example kusturica you would charge for a lot of advice on what not to put in the movie means forget about the zombies at least try to copy an idea and advance it to drop even better please really does not take away peoples time forcing them to watch these movies thanks in advance,cruel
norweigian writerdirector tommy wirkolas was an intriguing film in the first 2025 minutes when we hear the wanderer bjorn sunquist tell some medical students the story of the mysterious disappearance of nazi colonel herzog orjan gamst and his men during the second world war herzog and his fellow soldiers the wanderer tells these skeptical students have terrorized the locals who ventured into the mountains ever since then i wondered why on earth possessed the wanderer who was so perceptive to camp in this area in the first place no matter it was entertaining stuff but after those 25 minutes are over this film degenerates into a predictable monster fest with all the blood and gore and none of the wit and humouri think the only character i liked in this film was chris jenny skavlan who did a great sex scene but then she was killed by nazi zombies so that was the end of her a pity really because i did not find much to like about the other good guys in the film but maybe that would not have mattered so much if the villains were a bit more interesting couldnt wirkola come up with something more imaginative than frozen nazi zombies with base instincts even the head zombie colonel herzog is not very interesting i think the main reason why none of the zombies work is because they lack any goals that might interest us like global domination and because they are completely lacking in any intelligence or humor the film also failed to explain the simple things like why the nazis were able to live as long as they did in the mountains or why they even became zombies wirkola also gave the zombie very little to do but kill people who trespass on their territory in very gruesome ways a formula that grows tired very quicklyso if you are the sort of person who likes to watch copious abouts of blood and gore decapitations squashing human heads and the tearing apart of limbs for no apparent reason then you will have the time of your life watching this film and you probably will want to own it too if on the other hand you have had your fill of blood and gore then watch 2025 minutes of this film only or just give it a miss,cruel
a group of medical students on easter break decide to spend a relaxing weekend in a friends cabin located in the isolated mountains of norway however they are unaware that during world war ii a group of nazi soldiers disappeared into these very mountains never to be seen again well it turns out that these soldiers are all but dead and are now zombies who murder anyone unlucky enough to cross their paththe good the cinematography in this film is breathtaking much like the norwegian slasher film cold prey the isolated mountain setting is used to full effect here the production values are all top notch and it is refreshing to see a genre film that looks this good similarly the acting is pretty decent across the board and the actors obviously took their roles seriously the film is pretty fast paced and plays homage to several wellrenowned horror films most blatantly the evil dead suspense is well built particularly with the outhouse scenes and the zombie attack scenes on the tiny cabin the film really picks up the last 20 minutes or so and gorezombie fans should not be disappointed these zombies also use weapons such as bayonets and hammers as well as their teeth to attack their victims and the ending of the film is an adrenaline pumping blood soaked good timethe bad the film has so much going for it in regards to the horrorsuspense elements but decides to play up some comedic elements that seem at times out of place the film would have been much more effective without the unnecessary comedic elements had amped up the horror there are some confusing elements mainly concerning a box of treasure that may or may not be the reason for the zombies attack on the group of friends and makes the ending rather confusing the characters are pretty likable but do some pretty questionable things for example late in the film after several of their friends have been murdered we discover that a character or two has had a cell phone the entire time and they actually get a single why they didnt decide to call for help earlier is a questionable point and like the treasure is an example of some holes in the scriptoverall is a great entry into the zombie genre its a great looking fast paced film that isnt without its flaws which come mainly from weak writing definitely worth a look for horror fansmy grade b,cruel
even some outstanding production values arent enough to make this one worth watching like most of the romeroinspired filmmakers these guys seem to think that its all about the gore period well it aint and this is a good example of why it aint if theres a single sympathetic character in the movie she slipped right past me the cinematography is great and the makeup and makeup fx certainly pass muster but the juvenile attempts at humor and the fumbling filmmaking which could be overlooked or at least forgiven in an amateur or no budget production cripple what couldve been an outstanding entry in an often unfortunately justly maligned genre,cruel
this movie starts with a great concept  nazi zombies in the snow  and manages to do nothing with it instead the creators seem to be progressively seduced by the fun of throwing gratuitous gore at the audience this might have seemed clever a decade ago but its totally redundant in 2010whats more even campy splatterfests need to observe the rules of dramatic structure and this film throws them all away characters we care about come to undeserved fates and by the end we see that all their strenuous efforts were in fact futile as is any effort to actually enjoy this filmits a shame because the actors are quite good the setting is excellent and the direction is reasonably stylish theres just no story if there was one at the start it got eviscerated somewhere along the way,cruel
a group of teens go to a cabin in the middle of nowhere to do what teens in horror movies involving cabins do zombies come inand theyre nazi zombiesthe term youve seen it before is used often that term fits to a tbut this time it actually works the movie wears its influences on its sleevea few times to the point of annoyancebut the whole thing is so enthusiastic fun and energetic that you dont care plus its done with plenty of skill and style and it never wears out its welcomeits the right length and has the right toneand what a great tone it finds it takes the well worn zomcom path and while its not as good as classics like return of the living dead and the recent zombieland it still stands great on its own thats because here the jokes are actually funny and it comes up with some great gore gags one liners and creative kills to please its intended audience add to some surprisingly strong performances and a great electronic score that perfectly fits the frozen norwegian atmosphere and you have a winnerwont win any points for originality but thats just fine it just wants to entertain horror fans and on that level it succeeds,cruel
literally this film suckedit made no sense what so everwhy did the zombie killed the girl in the beginning they where awakes by the chess but still they killed the girl long before it ruined the hole film for me the next thing is that i have no idea what the hell that drifter was doing out there bjrn sundkuist hes like just put in the film to tell this terrible boring and not good story about the nazi doing all this crap long ago tommy wirkola did a good job for less money in kill buljo but with he show me that hes not my kind of director the cinematographer is terrible as well boring shots and all the space the hole time cgi effects that look like crap the two things that was good was part of the acting from the blond chick and from the guy from kill buljo and the zombies look good rest was crap i cant understand this movie went to cinema in the statesps when you make a splatter put some effects that we havent seen before everything was from braindead and the evil dead with a little of romeros in it and more bloodyes ooooh yes no more jenny skavlan she looks like a ragdoll and plays like a girl with no drama houers behind here,cruel
clearly the norwegians dont get it this movie is listed as a comedy horror movie i dont know maybe you have to be norwegian to understand the jokes the only scene that was in any way funny was right after one of the main characters gets bitten on the arm and explains to his buddy that he will now have to cut off the limb to avoid infection and proceeds to lop of the arm and cauterize it with fire a zombie bursts up out of the snow and bites him on his crotch the look on his face when he realizes what he is going to have to now amputate is funny other than that this could have come right out of the hollywood zombie mill all the predictable scenes as well as annoying subtitles the norwegians seem to have a real fascination with people having their intestines slowly drawn out too now lets move on to zombie physiology 101 these zombies bled profusely when wounded moved like olympic athletes and were obviously breathing now anyone should know that the dead dont bleed that requires a working circulatory system to provide blood pressure the dead cant move fast as the strain on decaying muscle and tendons would be too much the longer you been dead the slower you are some might argue that these zombies were fairly fresh as they had been buried in the snow all these years that means they would be frozen solid and unable to move at all and lastly being dead they would not need nor even be able to breathe if you want to make a zombie comedy then follow the same formula as shaun of the dead or army of darkness plenty of sightgags and parody if you want to make a serious zombie film try making your protagonists at least moderately capable otherwise youre just rehashing the same old garbage,cruel
norwegian movie about nazi zombiesokay got your attention cause when i say thats what this movie is about thats really all its about once you get past the concept as in you read the line norwegian movie about nazi zombies and got all excited because of the concept then thats all there is to it enough well yeah of course its enough i mean this is norway home to some of the most famous blackest of black metal what is more metal than nazi zombies what place could do nazi zombies better than norway oasis of the zombies wasnt that great that other nazi zombie movie wasnt that great leave it to norway right well sort of i mean the movie takes a while to really get to it once were clear what were in for the characters waste no time in revealing their selfawareness and general stupidity a few cutloudnoisecut misscares and the annoying useless dream sequence inevitably occur and then finally finally someone falls in a cave and discovers the nazi layer and though at that point the carnage has already begun now the meal this movie has represented moves past the long appetizer from the server who seems to distracted by other things to the main course of what matterssetpieces of general gore carnage and blaring music as the few remaining characters grab whatever is in site and begin to take those nazis head on pun intendedoh there are some standout sequences the guy realizing what hes up against and instead of freaking out like normal resigning himself to his fate and pulling himself together for the battle the fact that the zombies are intelligent and communicate with each other the few intelligent characters medical students at that who are willing to get into the nittygritty of survival without whining like little kids oh yes this movie has some things going for itoutside of that and the awesome soundtrack however this is a washeddown evil dead with little to add but the fact that theres a hammer and sickle to fight the nazis with get it hammer and sickle the movies selfawareness really does not add anything to the general idea of the narrative hey you know evil dead friday the 13th and april fools day great so what are you going to do with that a few scenes are straight out of tired camp clichs that scream attempted to move us away from in the 90s dont split up and the buildup itself is common horror fair that anybody with any interest in the genre has become familiar with by the age of tenbut did i mention its awesome soundtrack polarisdib,cruel
director tommy wirkola wears his influences on his sleeve using derivative horror tropes and familiar source material in this snowbound nazi zombie action filmwirkolas failed hansel and gretel witchhunters movie was referred to as the best evil dead sequel we never got by felix vasquez jr at cinema crazedcom and that pretty much sums up this better but inessential horror comedy project story features a group of puerile foul mouthed teens actually late twentysomethings and further hanging out in the snow in a holiday hut their combination of mallfriendly potty mouthed humor and smug peerbonded contempt is reminiscent of practically every movie in the 80s friday the 13th genre or actually reminiscent of the worst aspects of public school life for fourteen year olds that are too mature sensitive or intelligent to find tasteless sex and poop jokes to be a sign of great leadership and charismaanyway these freaks get drunk out in the snow and then theres sex and various hey where did danny go scare gags until horribly it turns out that theyre being hunted by zombie nazis preserved under the snow for decades the nazis are violent mostly speechless and like ripping heads arms and stomachs to pieces the actual zombie makeup is very second rate but a lot of the gore effects are top notch if you like this kind of thing moreover low budget productions for this generation look a lot better than their poor cousins from decades ago due to digital compositing and color grading tricks that make the film look great although somewhat limited due to unusually long periods where the director of photography uses only medium closeup shots if theres a language of cinema camera director matthew weston apparently has never heard of it because large chunks of the first and second part of the story are framed like cameraphone footagethat aside the film also suffers from a total lack of originality from the 80s slasher setup in the plot to the fact that numerous gags and scare scenes are lifted directly from sam raimis evil dead 2 and peter jacksons braindead to its advantage the movie does feature a hell of a lot of snow and the idea of zombies emerging from beneath snow and numerous scenes where characters are submerged or fighting in snow ads a bit of a novel twist also the sequel was rated as considerably better than this film by most major critics which is pretty cool i guesssubtitled in norwegian,cruel
a group of medical students take a vacation to the remote snowladen norwegian wilderness  while they are in a cabin they are visited by a strange man who tells them about the time the nearby town was under nazi occupation and how towards the end of the war the townsfolk drove out their occupiers  as it turns out those nazis might have been killed but theyre not going to be staying dead for much longer is something of a cult horror film in the english speaking world  one doesnt have to dig very deep to see why because it is something of a familiar story where hormone motivated young people visit a remote rural location  share these hormones with one another and then get killed one by one almost as if the hormones have a cause and effect on their deadly situation  in many ways it resembles an american movie  though the idea of nazi zombies would be slightly difficult to transcribe to a north american location but it doesnt matter that the zombies are nazis  theyre zombies first and foremost what is interesting and again this ties in with the english speaking culture is the slightly tongue in cheek tone has  in this way it resembles something along the lines of shaun of the dead  its never as manifestly humorous as the simon pegg comedy but neither is it dead pan and serious and the scene where a character mentions that hes of jewish descent and therefore nazi zombies wouldnt want to convert him caused a wry smile  its also rather gory but again this gore doesnt really exist to shock but to amuse the audience and in that sense its somewhat similar to peter jacksons early splatter comedies bad taste and brain damage  its hardly laugh out loud funny or radically original but is a moderately entertaining movie,cruel
this review comes tardy to the party i write because i so wanted to love but in the end could not i watched this film dubbed and then with subtitles it is of course far better with subtitles frankly though in the end the really grim premise just gets buried in an avalanche of silliness too much poo humor too much goofy slapstick and not enough context or creepy storytelling just make this the undead weekend skitrip version of severed without the brilliant cast not unwatchable lots of cleverclever bits but ultimately very disappointing and predictable zombedy entry i know i swim against the tide oh boys of fan but can no longer restrain my cri de couer,cruel
is set in norway  starts as several medical student friends travel to a remote log cabin in a small town called oksfjord the friends intend to spend the weekend enjoying themselves in the snow a man suddenly appears  warns them about the surrounding mountains about a curse that centers on a sadistic group of nazi soldiers who apparently froze to death there during world war ii but are said to still roam the area killing anyone that are unlucky enough to meet them the medical students laugh his claims off as silly but its not long before the nazi zombies have risen from their graves  are trying to kill the students who have to use whatever they can to try  survive as they fight for their livesthis norwegian production is known as dd sn in its native country  was cowritten  directed by tommy wirkola  has ridden on the recent success of the big budget hollywood zombie film it is actually part of a small sub genre known as the nazi zombie film which include shock waves 1977 oasis of the zombies 1981 zombies lake 1981  night of the zombies 1983  i have to say that doesnt particularly enhance the reputation of the genre but its an enjoyable enough way to waste 90 odd minutes while a lot of people seem to be raving about i didnt think it was much more than just a good zombie film the script for instance isnt that great with unlikable  bland characters  absolutely no explanation or reasoning behind anything that happens theres something about an old curse theres some gold in a wooden box  lots of nazi zombies but how they are all tied together is left unexplained the pace is good  theres plenty of good moments but overall i would struggle to call a classic the script also tries to mimic scream 1996  have lots of little references to other horror films  genre itself but these seem quite forced  deliberate  i think lack the wit that scream showedthe film looks nice enough  it looks to have a decent amount of money spent on it the isolated snow covered mountain locations look great but director wirkola doesnt inject any suspense or tension into the film as when the nazi zombies show up he is more interested in splatter effects which in itself isnt a bad thing theres some good gore here theres a slit throat a ripped open head spilled brains pulled out intestines knives in eyes people are ripped apart bits of flesh are bitten off theres plenty of blood  someone cuts their own arm off with a chainsaw in a scene that surely was lifted from evil dead ii 1987 the character who wears a braindead 1992 shirt didnt go unnoticed either the zombies themselves dont really act like traditional zombies  the nazi backstory aspect feels cobbled together at the last minute  is vague  forgettable maybe the makers didnt quite know what they were trying to go for here but no one aspect really excelswith a supposed budget of about 800000 looks pretty good  is well made the special effects are impressive  the lack of cgi computer effect is welcome filmed in norway available in either the original native norwegian with english subs or an english dubbed i saw the dubbed version which is horribly out of sync at times the acting seemed alright but none of the characters stand out  i never particularly rooted for any of themis an enjoyable zombie film with some good gore  a few nice moments theres some humour  scream style dialogue but as a whole i was left wanting a bit more enjoyable enough but i didnt think it was any sort of classic  cant really see where all the hype comes from,cruel
sure they look like zombies but thats allzombies have no business running showing anger or thought and they do certainly not have any part of an old curse these guys may look like zombies but they feels like agile mummies but even though they missed on the zombies it a ok horrorsplattercomedy decent actors and a good production but if you are a hardcore zombie fan you will be disappointed or you should stop calling yourself a hardcore zombie fanps regarding angry running zombies 28 days later pulled it of nicely introducing me to a new breed of zombies both running and showing anger in this case the body is alive just infected so it seems plausible while in they where long dead,cruel
simple plot a group of college kids take trip to the snowthey end up shacked up in evil dead type of cabin in this cabin is a old treasure chest and thus anger the zombies so anyway somewhat of a slow start when this zombie movie picks up tho its none stop zombie violence now is one of the best zombie movies of the 00 decade maybe i think so this and flight of the living dead are great thats my opinion check it out a must see for zombie movie fans also some creative gore and a lot of the red stuff at the end part of the movie i wanted the blu ray of this but it was no where in my city that sucked im happy with the dvd tho very clear with great sound i recommend the dvd 2 dick set,cruel
after hearing much praise and being a big fan of scandinavian movies i delved into pretty much to be disappointed like with other later norwegian movies like rovdyr or fritt vilt while the latter two were plain generic ripoffs with plots so dumb that every us mainstream horror could top them is rather meant to be an underground splattercomedy with some weird charm ok sure nazi zombies are not really new and we have seen dozens of zombie soldiers but the idea here works pretty good with some wwii nazis spooking the snowy norwegian plains as a zombie army led by a creepy evil colonel if you expect something in the vein of brain dead  and i sure did after many things i heard  be ready for a huge let down while obviously tries to be funny it definitely isnt the introduction of characters is as boring and worn off as in fritt vilt honestly the whole beginning with the group of students going to an abandoned hut for a skiing holiday is much equal you get a geeky film nerd who squeezes in some references but i never laughed throughout the movie and when that guy dies right in the beginning you know the humor is done there is some splattering amputations a regular fixation on strung out intestines but although some are meant to be funny like one guy getting stuck to a tree with his intestines while fleeing they dont work because the movie for most part recycles common horror stereotypes like the lame spooked and killed in the outhouse and scares a lot of it plays in utter darkness which gets damn boring and the mix of characters seems pretty schizophrenic with an annoying hero guy speeding around on his skimobile and screaming for his girlfriend or a medical student with fear of blood like i said this movie although with an interesting premise is utterly generic so you know what to expect from the guy bloodfearing doctor in the end its all predictable and beside some nice splatter scenes honestly not too much and loads of fake cgi blood anyway i often was bored because the movie stretches without throwing in the expected jokes to ease off the mood which often is too damn earnest for such a humorous subject if you are looking for a splatterhorror movie with higher production value for an evening with some beers will surely do the job but dont expect too many laughs and especially dont expect this movie to be smarter than most us horror movies it absolutely isnt,cruel
this movie starts out alright and could very well have been taken to a higher level but the characters and their relationships are never really developed into something the spectator cares about their clich comments are mixed with utter fear bravery and carelessness from one moment to the other throughout the whole film resulting in a rather confused cast who all seem to care more about themselves and little about anything else as a viewer i ended up rather careless the visual effects are ok for a budget movie but they would have been better if there was more of a point to the situationssorry but this movie is not worth the effort,cruel
sorry but this should have been better the actors first of all dont have any chemistry the fun moments could have been way more fun if the timing and actors had been better the whole movie seems to have a director who is still learningi hope wirkola learned a lot during the making of this one cause next time i dont think people will be as forgiving wirkolas first film kill buljo by the looks of this seems like a lucky strike i hope to see something better next time it seems like the effects and whole idea of the movie seemed so fun they thought the movie would make itself i enjoyed kill buljo cause it was playful and fun far from perfect but it didnt have to be since the comedic moments worked well people seems to still want to make a new shaun of the dead movie but its not a good idea if a movie is going to be a combination of comedy and horror the comedy has to be the strongest part in this movie the comedy falls through much because of the actorsand directing its a brave movie but even brave people die if theyre not smart better luck next time i really wish wirkola the best of luck and hope he learns from his mistakes norway do need people who love movies as much as wirkola seems to do,cruel
so tonight i started watching and about halfway probably less than halfway i fell asleep and wasnt even particularly tired its not a bad movie a nice homage to read as borrows heavily from many other horror films 80s slashers in particular but a smattering of many others it tried to avoid being predictable the whole thing between the fat movie nerd and the hot chick was awesome but the most interesting characters died first and i just couldnt really care what was going to happen to the rest it has zombies but they arent really zombies not the romero style of ghoul anyway more like ghost nazis the acting for this level and quality of film was good the makeup and costumes were very good the big problem was when you have too many influences on a film it becomes watered down it lacks style you quickly feel like youve seen this film before because basically you have this filmmaker has potential but put more of your personality into the movie and dont save the mediocre characters for last,cruel
well before i start saying anything bad i think this is a quite funny movie really you see so much blood and gore and killing in this film that its obvious that it just cant be serious well i guess thats a problem i have with movies because i enjoy more serious movies i do can appreciate funny actionviolent movies but this i really laughed at some scenes in this film but overall i just think it sucked seriously the acting is the worse ive seen in a long time and this is something i notice a lot in movies i dont know very much the good norwegian actors but they should have get a phone call at least to save this film nope it looks like they just took some random people who are so not in their roles of medicine students the way some of the scenes are shot is just pathetic its obvious that at the final cut they just wanted us to see the gore and the blood splashing everywhere that is not what i want to see not in a movie with such a topic like nazi zombies it looks like they tried to put some mystery in the screenplay to frighten us and to intrigue us with all the story told by the old guy in the cabin well my friend this is a total failure i yawned the whole time in the film except the funny parts which are not so funny at the end the screenplay is terrible and the zombies are just ridiculous in fact they dont really look like zombies in my opinion watch this for a friday night drunk or high with friends when you dont want to watch a movie thatll make you think then youll probably have a lot of fun but otherwise to avoid at all cost,cruel
i never watch a flick when it comes out and it becomes a hype you are influenced by reviews and everybody says that you must like it therefore i wait until the hype is over before i watch those flicksof course due the hype the expectations are high and most of the hypes are a big flop to watch but not this one you can easily see that this was made by lovers of the genre and i would even go a bit further that it can be filed under flicks like the evil dead it sometimes goes over the top with a bit of humour but it all works perfectlygorehounds can watch it this without a doubt i could even say that all horror buffs must see this excellent flick it starts slowly and you really get to know the characters but once you think please let the horror begin it starts end it doesnt stop until the end this will surely end in my top 10 list of all time horrors even as you dont like zombies you will like this excellent acting and great effects and makeup for the zombies be sure to see the full uncut version clocking in at 91 minutesgore 45 nudity 05 effects 45 story 35 comedy 25,cruel
with their black leather jackets and deaths head badges theres no denying that the nazis looked kind of cool but that doesnt change the fact that they are a symbol of all that is wrong with humanity and a cinematic villain that audiences love to hate that may explain why three nazi killing splatter fests are being released this summer iron sky inglorious basterds and from norway the ridiculous nazi zombie flick set in the desolate mountain regions of norway a snow sports holiday goes horribly wrong for a group of young friends when they encounter an army of undead nazis from wwiithis film is a composite of cheesy horror clichs but the film is conscious of its own predictability and features a character named erland a zombie film fanatic who points out the obvious plot technique of opening a film with a group of friends heading to a remote cabin he even going so far as to name drop the movies that writer and director tommy wirkola felt it necessary to plagiarise the character is later disembowelled shortly after a bizarre toilet sex scene thus fulfilling the tired conventions of a genre that desperately requires creative innovation to remain relevantthe only original aspect of this horror film is the inclusion of nazis but watching the film one cant help but wonder at the meaning of it all are the nazis rising from the dead a metaphor for a revival of right wing politics that needs once more to be put to death or is it simply that nazis are the only human villains who it is acceptable to depict being disembowelled and torn asunder by chainsaws and machine guns whatever the reasoning behind the ludicrous plot it has more holes than a bullet ridden zombie corpse the nazi resurrection is attributed to the fact that the group of youths find some stolen nazi gold kind of a curse of the mummies tomb deal personally i always find the nuclear radiation or voodoo magic explanations of zombism easier to swallowthose who want nothing more than a blood soaked brain splattered orgy of violence peppered with a few cheap jokes will be thrilled the cinematography and building of suspense is at times more mature and intense than the infantile plot warrants the bleak featureless snow covered peaks of norway provide a superbly atmospheric setting for a horror film and wirkola knows how to get the best from the landscape but breathtaking imagery cannot excuse a plot this lazy or such brief and shallow characterisation i find myself caring less and less for the fate of the two dimensional nordic youths as they are killed off one by one until ultimately i just wish i was watching evil dead instead,cruel
director tommy wirkola does a very good job of combining gore horror and cheeky situational comedy in this movie i have seen it three times and it has a lot of staying power the scenes and characters are very creative it has everything a horror movie should have college students going to the mountains to party for the weekend a creepy old guy to warn them of the danger and innovative death scenes although sometimes a little over the top the movie will leave you with something to talk about to those who have not seen it i would recommend watching with a group of people who are open minded to this type of movieits not terrifying and will not give you nightmares but it is bloody and funny,cruel
when i start checking my watch for the time  that is telling me big time that im in for a bad movie i dont know where to begin it was not funny or scary at all it did have the potential to be scary in some scenes but they did not utilize it to their full advantage i cared for no one except forthe wanderer he had a nice intro and a good spooky storytelling scene but then he was killed off by a socalled nazi zombie who stabbed him to death this movie tried so much to like imitate americans i mean its like this is how the norwegians perceive how americans act and are i was completely disappointed with that perception because i would have like to see how norwegians are themselves and not trying to imitate other cultures how did the nazi zombies come back to life were they really more like ghosts than zombiesif that was the direction director tommy wirkola wanted to go he was way off and did it poorlyi mean john carpenter did a way better job with that theme with his film the fog 1980 carpenter had also ghost zombies like figures that went after people all because of some socalled treasure is that what wirkola was doing with this film i dont know and i dont care i truly was disappointed with this socalled zombie flick i was expecting so much more from it since i had heard so much hoopla over it even my own cousin who is a zombie fanatic had said it was a great zombie movie wrong i was so hyped up when i 1st started watching it but by the 1st 15mins i knew it was a stinker just like the disgusting scene when that idiot makes it with the slutty chick in the outhouse toilet no less and then he doesnt even have the decency to wait for her to finish using the toilet and walk back with her thus to some extent preventing her death but i didnt care by this point as i was hoping the zombies would kill all these idiot losers and have the movie thus end and i could move on to a better and scarier zombie flick i mean this crap was so boring i actually fell asleep a couple of times during it no horror film is ever suppose to do that ever ,cruel
summary a bunch of med students hike to a solitary hut in the norwegian mountains for a fun weekend what they dont know is that there is already someone in those mountains and they are not here for funreview whats worse than a big bad zombie right a big bad nazi zombie and theres a plenty of them here the movie is really funny makes you overlook the many plot holes and inconsistencies like the nazi zombies having the strength to rip someones skull apart with their bare hands and in the next moment get knocked around by little girls or that the zombies dont die then they die by head wound then they dont die even by head wound then they die from everything anyway i recommend it to any zombie fan though its not your typical dead meat zombies but intelligent tool using smartshighlight intestant ropenotable actors nonegore level 55,cruel
nazi zombies a pure and simple hook that id have hoped would deliver unfortunately it fell apart with cheap attempts at thrills and scares and tried to sustain itself with copious gorei think my overall problem with the movie is that it did not establish any rules and made no attempt and building up a store with solid cause and effectscenes were put together for effect sudden surprises ironic death scenes etc but didnt make much sense in terms of how or why they would happen that way movies that have a solid internal logic to them are gripping because you can get into the world and as an audience member think and anticipate what might happen next if you throw out that logic then all you have left are a lot of shocker moments where something jumps out or indulgent gory scenesi wanted to give the movie 4 stars as i thought that visually the movie was fairly well put together someone had a pretty good eye for composing shots the gore and other effects worked wellit really comes down to the overall narrative structure and writing of the film far too many elements are made reference in the movie but then have no resolution later on and what ended up being scary were cheap shots with things jumping out or the action magically coming together to keep to a tight paceif the visual presentation could have been matched with a tight premise of being attacked by nazi zombies in a cabin then it could have become a cult hit unfortunately they went for cheap thrills and the movie will ultimately be a throwaway,cruel
just an outstanding norwegian zombie gorefest a group of med students goes for a ski weekend to a remote mountain cabin and pisses off a group of nasty nazi zombies a similar movie named shock waves had resurrected nazis attacking a group of people on a caribbean island that was played for straight drama whereas this one has some of the knowing humor found in the evil dead movies the actors are all good and there are some real scares and yes even some laughs along the way as the kids fight for their lives in over the top battle scenes reminiscent of peter jacksons dead alive braindead the pacing is good though the movies first half is a little slow this is a director with a fondness for the genre and some ability too if youre looking for a flick that takes itself seriously stick with shock waves but if you like the evil dead zombieland or shaun of the dead this should be right up your alley,cruel
a norwegian shaun of the dead not in the slightest for a start its much better im sorry but what is all the rave about shaun anyway  that film isnt funny and apart from someone walking through life  one day without zombies and another where everyones a zombie  the big gag theres nothing to itthis is a good film  made on a very low budget and looks a whole lot better than its price tag i was pleasantly surprised and entertained it doesnt drag it has some funny moments and its not made in hollywood  thank godif shaun was supposed to be intelligent and smart  then this is as good original  ahh  maybe not references to other horror films a brain dead tshirt  so what the acting is good  the cinematography is good and the location is out of this world or is it finnmark,cruel
medical students on vacation in the norwegian mountains run afoul of an army of foul decaying nazi zombies bent on retrieving a box holding precious jewels and gold doubloons the plots as simple as that as outrageous gore is gratuitous and plentiful with lots of bodies being torn into and apart closer in spirit to evil deadlots of homages to the first two films particularly the second one and both are even mentioned in the dialogue by a movie nerdthan night of the living dead director tommy wirkola and his filmmaking team choose a breathtaking location to set this ultraviolent splatter movie the nazi zombies are a ghastly breed their flesh rotted to a vast degree suited in deteriorated uniforms and helmets that are worse for wear wirkola takes about twenty or so minutes to establish who the characters are and then turns the zombies loose upon them with lots of gaping blood gushing wounds chainsaw and ax damage with even a face split open not to mention violence involving intestinesthe highlight for gore aficionados would have to be the stitching of an open neck wound using a fishing hook cgi is noticeable but there are enough practical effects to satisfy purists i believe while the film goes completely overthetop in the department of relentless gruesome carnage there are some instances of pure meanspiritednesssuch as the accidental stabbing as one of our heroes is so caught up in continuously assaulting a zombie he turns and impales his own girlfriend and wirkola allows this to progress as he watches her choke and gag on her own blood and it spurts outto be seen as well funniest scene might be when one of our heroines is up in a tree hiding from two zombies looking around her position given up by a squawking birdthat or the nevertiresome decapitated head gag where one of the girls thinks her pal is peering from outside the window when in actuality a zombie soldier is holding up her head hilarity ensues including how an attempt at hurling a molotov cocktail towards the zombies results in the setting afire of the cabin removing their own place of refugeas well as how a snowmobile can pulverize zombies eyes are gouged with sticks and faces  heads are crushed under foot strong stomachs required a must see for zombie fanatics,cruel
i really liked this movie but it could have been so much betteri loved the references to other movies the actors were great and the action was fantasticbut it just became too much it was like a video game where the bad guys just keep respawning until it gets silly everyone like tabasco sauce but no one wants a bowl of itthe gold angle was just stupid are we really to believe that the nazi zombies were doing this for gold that is like saying the demon possessed the kid in the exorcist so it could see cable tvand we didnt get enough of the good guys kicking nazi butt if you are going to emulate ash from evil dead you have to let him do his thing and really go over the top the characters should have gotten mad like ash and then overpowered the bad guys in the last third the movie didnt do a good job of swinging between camp comedy and serious action it got a little confusingdont get me wrong this movie is certainly worth watching but with a few story tweaks it could have been a classicplus any story where they kill off all of the characters is just not fun nowadays they do it to try to shock you but it too has become predictable only exception is open wateri love the fact that the norwegians know their horror movies so well it is exciting to see these movies have a world wide impact but to declare hollywood dead is very prematurethe ending was soooooo predictable arrrr two more rewrites and this movie would have been a 10see this movie and then go see dance of the dead which i gave a 9,cruel
this film was fantastic i was looking around the internet for a good zombie film and all of the recommendations were your typical night of the living dead dawn of the dead braindead al great films but i read a review of this and i have to say that once i watched it i was so impresseda comedy horror of a group of medical students being attacked by nazi zombies what a great idea oodles of gore albeit a touch ridiculous at times a bunch of laughs which are kept in tone with the film and a group of characters that are easy to relate to and to side with or not for one of them in my case either way you will be rooting for some and not for others and at the end of the film you will be wanted number 2 to be out instantaneouslyif you are a fan of shaun of the dead and comedy horrors then this is for you ignore the fact it is in norwegian it doesnt damper the movie in the slightest utterly enjoyable,cruel
a group of mostly passable clich teens travels to an isolated cabin in an area once occupied by the ss in world war ii and after meeting a guy who wonders out of nowhere to relate the history of the area and tell them theyre doomed the kids find a box of gold jewelery under a trap door in the cabin and are slowly picked off until only a few are left to showdown as nazi stormtroopers begin rising from the sn to lay siege and crack skulls literallysome great fx and visual work with the gore and the zombies make up and weatherworn uniforms look greatthis was a pretty fun and wellcrafted zombie flick alternating from satire to suspense then back to satire nazi zombies are great symbolic imagery as well and here theyre treated kinda like the treasureseeking pirate ghosts of carpenters the fog in fact the ending might be a reference much of the film is interlaced with references to classic 80s horror flicks including some of sam raimipeter demings brilliant cinematography from evil dead 2 dead by dawnthe fact that the nazi zombies return to kill to get back their illgotten or hardwon fortunes suggests perhaps a deeper subtext and understanding of history than appears on the surface a balance you usually dont find with reference to the motivations of the german soldiers in the wwii eraalso theres some nice hooters to check out brieflybest nazi zombie film since shock waves the kind of nightmarish way the zombies emerge from the snow is somewhat reminiscent of that films zombies rising from the ocean recommended for those who love nazi zombies boobs exposed brains plopping out of peoples heads and subtitles,cruel
this horror film from norway is a cut above us slasher films in that there is a great idea for a villain nazi zombies based on a legend from world war 2 about nazis escaping in the mountains a strange local tells 8 students of the tale and lo and behold it comes to life some of the scenery is beautiful owing to the snow and mountains which is a great contrast for this film there is some inane dialogue but overall its a good film im giving it a 7 not because of its production but because of the version i saw it was english language dubbed and that detracts somewhat id rather have seen the film with subtitles its funny also in the dubbed version that everyone speaks english yet the radio plays norwegian songs so an 8 to nine for the subtitled version 7 for the dubbed its still worthwhile and a must for anyone who is a fan of horrorslasher films,cruel
what a great surprise  and from norway well this movie surely kicks some serious ass even included long time sought after zombie movie daylight scenes it is an absolutely hilarious movie and the actors are convincing and not over the top hysterical as we usually see in american zombie flicks its a crying shame this movie has not seen more attention  as it is in my opinion easily the best zombie movie i have seen in a very long time i was rather surprised to see how much they had put into the movie  costumes and makeup was as close to realistic  as you can come in these kinds of film and the amount of nazi soldiers was actually way more than i had anticipated even the violence and the dismemberment was right as we all want it  in abundance several times i thought to myself  how weird it was to see a gore movie where i was not irritated about acting performances or exaggerated special effects i sure hope we have more in store from the director of this fine movie,cruel
this movie is horrible not as a horror movie but as a movie i cant believe i could watch till the end bad acting combined with mentally sick script writing the idea sounds good at the beginning but after the first ten minutes you realize that the whole thing is pointless scenery is the only good thing about this movie acting is plain bad no need to talk about it if they were trying to make a funny movie this is not funny if the aim was to make a horror movie it is not scary there is a lot of blood so if you are one of this mentally sick people who wants to see pointless violence like saw this is for you a waste of ideas and time nothing more,cruel
starts out like a typical horror movielets meet the cast and get to know them basic frolics in the snow stories drinking etc it takes about half the movie to get into the thick of things but once you do it takes on a great romp with a hoard of zombies love the way they introduce the zombies slowly taking out the cast one by one it heats up near the end with the nazi zombies on the attack there are so many clever things they do to stave off the zombies including some humor which is one of my favorite scenes in the movie  they are told dont let them bite you but when one of the cast gets bit in the arm he decides to stave off being a zombie by chopping off his arm with a chainsaw he is then very satisfied with his actions until a zombie pops out of the snow and bites him in his junk he looks horrified and his friend tells hims  dont do itsorry but you just have to laugh it was a great movie in my opinion it is dubbed but they did a great job i love zombie movies with a touch of humor it also has plenty of gore in very creative ways i loved it,cruel
i have a question how many movies begin with a group of friends going on a trip without cell phone reception sound familiar this question was posed to the group by erland played by jeppe laursen while they were on their mountain trek towards the cabin a group of friends traveling to a remote location without cell phone reception has been a common theme in many hollywood horror films and now has surfaced in a norwegian film as well director tommy wirkola has been known for his love of 1980s slapstick horror films and it has a clear influence on his production of the film follows vegard lasse valdal and six of his friends on their easter break trip up to a remote mountain cabin they were relaxing on their first night in the cabin when they receive a visit from an unexpected wanderer bjorn sundquist he informs the group that their current location used to be occupied by the nazis during world war ii and that they still haunt the area today instead of packing up and leaving the next morning everyone except for vegard chose not to heed the wanderers he never mentions his name words and continued to enjoy their snowy escapade by sledding tubing and having snowball fights after the wanderers story vegard becomes increasingly worried about his girlfriend sara ane dahl torp who was supposed to ski into the cabin the night before thinking she might have got lost vegard left the group and took the snowmobile to go look for her in hindsight they should have all taken the warning seriously because later that night mass quantities of nazi zombies decked out in military attire would show up to wreak havoc on the remainder of their vacation the battle which ensues and continues throughout the rest of the movie is not for those viewers with a week stomach if you are looking for some comedic action with plenty of gore and violence then look no further tommy wirkolas will deliverwhat tends to go unnoticed in this movie is the beauty of the norwegian nature displayed in the film too often i think viewers will find that they are too memorized by the fight scenes that they fail to notice all of the breathtaking scenery in the background the movie is filmed in the mountains of norway and wirkola does an excellent job of showing them off in the film surprisingly for a horror film the majority of the film takes place in broad daylight whereas most other films of the genre consider the night to be a scarier atmosphere the daylight definitely lowers the scariness factor of the film but i think wirkola was more focused on making more of slapstick horror film instead of a truly scary one another theme the movie portrays is the norwegians love for taking holidays to their cabins it is a popular vacation spot especially around easter time where norwegians go to take some much needed time off from work and school the film is set over easter break which i think will help norwegians better relate to the time setting and to the location as wellas previously mentioned gore and violence is a major theme of this film if this is your cup of tea this movie certainly fulfills the nazi zombies are relentless and are willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done whereas vegard and friends are trying to hold on for dear life limbs are frequently rippedslicedsawed off and intestines are strewn about for me personally the gore was a little over the top and could have been scaled down a little bit but if you were able to withstand the first twenty minutes of saving private ryan then you should not have a problem with this film tommy wirkola has gone on record of saying that he will never create a drama film and he stays true to his word with his comedic horror film i loved the nature aspect of this film and enjoyed the beautiful norwegian scenery throughout i think wirkolas decision to film in the daylight not only enhanced the nature shots but the lighting helped to remove some of the scariness of the film and shifted it more towards a comedic horror film the acting in the film was not the best in the world but i would not expect any movie based off 1980s slapstick horror films to have superb acting anyways for the most part the costumes are pretty well designed and the nazi zombies look just like you would expect them to if you love gore and violence will fulfill and likely exceed your needs but i would strongly recommend not eating directly before or after watching this film,cruel
a group of young norwegians are camping in the mountains when a mysterious visitor shows up and tells them the history of the region oh no it turns out that the area was full of nazis and they have a hidden treasure things go from bad to worse when the treasure is foundthere could be some debate whether or not these are actual zombies in the romero sense the film geek erland warns them not to get bitten but there is no real evidence that bites will turn you into a zombie or a nazi these could be simply evil incarnate or dybbuks or something who knows at the very least they are closer to voodoo zombies than infection zombies and based on the way the blood spurts they apparently still have pulsesthat discussion aside the film is really good it is not extremely well plotted out but if you want a bloodandguts horror film this is for you the one character erland again has a braindead tshirt on and that really sums up the vein of this film horror and gore comedy through and through you might find plot holes about the nazis but ignore them you will see the most disturbing sex scene but roll with it and be impressed when one woman escapes an avalanche despite not being part of the conversation on escaping avalanchesnorway is starting to get something of a horror niche a few years ago the country produced naboer which is a dark psychological tale and vastly underviewed by moviegoers and now this one  with less substance but more fun seriously you know you were interested as soon as you heard nazi zombies right despite the slower first half it more than makes up for this in the secondduring my second viewing of this film at the wonderful house of horrors in oshkosh another person in the crowd remarked that this is a remake of leprechaun while this is obviously not true it is an interesting way to view the film i assume that reference was not intentionali recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed braindead or evil dead ii both of which are given a healthy homage or films of that nature with an emphasis on blood and humor as long as you do not mind subtitles this is one that will probably remain on the cult radar for quite a while,cruel
no need to rush out to see this one at the flicksa fun but ultimately throwaway undead romp set in the norwegian fjords poor dialogue and acting thats not funny even in a b movie kind of way are saved by the films location stunning scenery  made me want to get my backpack and head for scandinavia and some nice actiongore sequences at the endunfortunately the film fails because it simply has nothing new to add to the genre there are a million references to many other better horror films that this aspires to but you have to give credit to the director and crew for trying hard with what must have been a low budget there is lots of passion and energy here but the story and characters are a let downbrain dead and evil dead have raised the bar so high that films like this just cant get close at the recent sydney film festival i much preferred the other zombie film pontypool which at least offered something new and some fresh ideas rather than just gore,cruel
is an absolute gem of a zombie film its as funny and as it is gory with some genuinely scary bits and it has a great storyline and soundtrack it sounds like it ticks all the boxes and it really does deliver it is subtitled its norwegian but as ive said to many people to whom ive recommended this film aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh is the same in any language so it doesnt really matter if its subtitled but they are very easy to follow and dont detract from viewing the film at allthe gory bits are spectacularly gory but the comic overtones prevent any lasting frights i think its not a film that has given me nightmares but i still jump at the scarier scenes when rewatching it the cast were unknown to me as i hadnt delved into norwegian cinema before but were thoroughly believable as the characters they playedthe scenery is stunning and the brilliant white snow offsets the blood brilliantly  lots of the action takes place in daylight,cruel
has a wellcrafted and suspensebuilding opening 40 minutes but this goes for nothing when it turns into yet another gorefilled comedy ripoff of the evil dead shaun of the dead etc as each scene got more improbable than the last and more and more entrails amputations and oneliners are introduced i wondered if id make it to the end i did just shame as the set up was good if theyd kept it nebulous and shadowy and reasonably serious they might have had a little classic on their handsyes it is funny but weve been here before so many times movie references abound in this film but so what the filmmakers prove they are familiar with horror flicks is that supposed to make this movie better of course the usual psueds will call it post modernist or something  which really means it has no originality at all steal from er sorry post modernistically allude to the thing evil dead the descent etc all you want but it will not make a good filmin fairness the movie is welldirected and the cast likable and engaging but still not enough to make it work so great first 40 minutes then bereft of ideas,cruel
this movie has nazis zombies in the snowy mountains of norway and since the movie origins from there there will some badly english dubbing lines for the english speaking audience members i watched the non dubbed version and the dialog made a lot more sense than english the movie makes the dubbing so bad due to the fact that the voices are in the center it makes it a bit hard to know whom talking due to that the voice acting is a bit cheesy too another thing is that the male voices is bit too similar to each other the film centers around a group of students surviving a nazi zombies attack at those mountains there is no point explaining the characters because they all just the same archetypes copies of other horror movies teenagers with having a tramp smart guy athlete and a fool there honestly these people are all dumb weak and weird they love to choke each other with pillows they also sleep with each other while going number two in the outhouse they give bad jokes about hiking last they allow strangers to diss their coffee the old guy who came for coffee bjorn sundkvist is a top notch norwegian actor and really underused in this film he does a weak exposition of the story plot by explaining that the nazis zombies are after some buried treasure near the end of the war with germanys defeat looming the soldiers looted all the towns valuables however the citizens stage an uprising and ambushed them killing many the survivors nazis were chased into the mountains and it was assumed that they all froze to death we soon find out that zombies are not gone but undead spirits to be truth since this is a norwegian movie the zombies are actually draugrs draugrs are from norse mythology and the scandinavian folkloric is about undead greedily protecting its often stolen treasures since the movie didnt explain that were labeling them as zombies this movie is stupid not to explain that zombies are supposed to be merciless simple minded creatures that cant feel anything they should never be able to use knives and weapons and be able to look you in the eye plus a gun comes out of nowhere for one of the survivor without being explain since the zombies hardly use any guns in this film yes zombie soldiers dont have guns here it was pretty funny to see a hammer and sickle being use to kill them its like a symbolism about what really ended the germans in world war two the jump scare are weak and the movie is hardly scary at all the movie feels more like gore comedy than horror the death scenes and gore were so ridiculously over the top it just added so much to the humor one scene in particular that got me laughing the most was the one with the molotov cocktail being thrown the outcome and reactions by the characters were excellent idiotic i felt this movie was a little too slow to get going for me but once it did kick in it was extremely entertaining and highly gory and bloody the comedy elements didnt bother me too much in it as the comedy was never at the expense of the action and violence the creative kills was interesting you know for seeing a lot of b films i didnt think was that bad in fact id have to say it is probably going to be a cult classic but it will never meet the expectations of a film fans about the music choice i think the heavy metal fits the film while edvard griegs in the hall of mountain king doesnt fit the movie but its interesting to hear it just hearing it makes me want to pull a prank on someone this is the music for setting up the prank not horror director tommy wirkola gives us a hitlerious stupid movie i like the idea that they can be smart and arent your typical zombies but this movie could have been better if you love killing nazi zombies just play call of duty instead,cruel
dumb norwegian medical students decide to spend a few days in chalet on snowridden mountain with no mobile phone signal and an outdoor toilet for no apparent reason nazi zombies appear but fortunately theyre pretty crap and mostly get knocked down by a couple of good punches furthermore unlike american zombies these undead ss soldiers dont bite or eat peoples flesh theyre party trick is to surround you and then pull you apart with a couple of tugs maybe us kids are made of sterner stuff than their norwegian counterpartsgranted there are a couple of funny scenes including a very witty ending but not enough to salvage what is essentially a very lowbudget boring filmfor those who find hagar the horrible exciting or who have never seen a zombie film before go ahead and rent this youll enjoy it however fans of the zombie genre will find the special effects poor and the zombies very lame,cruel
i finally got around to this one and how this gets rated as one of the better movies from norway is a surprise to meyou can just bet the guy who made this was savin up his whole life to make this gorefest he took from every major gore film and combined it into norways answer to shaun of the dead and dead alivefor a while in this you will just get creepy atmosphere but later on its just full on ridiculous gore i mean to the point tis just not even goreits just an obvious attempt to uber shock you i mean if you gotta see this cause your friends say its awesome then id say give it a try but dont think youll walk away feeling like youve seen a cinematic gore masterpiececause that this film isnt im bettin anyone under 25 will think this film is one of the greatest things since hello kittyjust pretty norwegian faces a lot of blood and nazi zombies in the snow storylinehow could this not succeed,cruel
alright what these brilliant norwegian film makers managed to do with a very limited budget here was amazing this movie rocks would be so cool to see them take on another project with a bigger budget backing them upas a fan of zombie movies i had to watch this i was interested at the cover already come on zombie nazis that is always good for a blast and they made it come out pretty cool in this movienow the movie is not scary per se but it has it moments of thrills and its moments of laughs there are lots of humor in this movie as well if you were a fan of shaun of the dead then you should definitely give this movie a chancesure some of the effects were of questionable quality but you look past that with this movie because the entertainment is goodi was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie and even stuck around for all the extra material on the dvd this was one hell of a ride zombie nazis hahaha,cruel
theres just something about this film that make it stand out from other bmovies this horror comedy is equally haunting as it is slapstick this is a bmovie in every sense but it is so wacky and demented that you gotta love it if youre into mindless comedy horror with a lot of bloody cringe worthy effects then this is perfect it was actually quite gross at times and even suspenseful at times the film had its wow moments but in general this is actually quite badyet also entertaining,cruel
i know what youre thinking  nazi zombies for real trust me i was just as skeptical as you hell i was skeptical for most of the movie the director tommy wirkola said in an interview when we were about to sit down and write the actual script we started thinking what is more evil than a zombie a nazizombie fair enoughthe premise of the film is similar to that of the draugr  a scandinavian folkloric undead greedily protecting its often stolen treasures in this case the nazi zombies were on a mission to find the valuables they had stolen from the locals back when they occupied the area during world war ii i mean i get it when something i stole from innocent people is missing i kill and eat people toothe main characters of the movie are honestly all fairly weak characters you dont really get too attached to anyone which ultimately makes it hard to feel much of anything except excitement about yay zombies when they start getting killed and the pacing is so damn slow  it takes half the freaking movie before anyone in the main group gets killed i have a hard time shutting off movies even when im bored so i stuck it out and im glad i did because this movie is easily the biggest turnaround ive ever experiencedthe last 30 minutes or so are pretty much nonstop action violence and some pretty intense and very welldone gore the movie up until this point has very little of any of the above aside from a pretty amazing head splitting shortly before the zombies are somewhat unique in the sense that they are stealthy armed and fast as hell these are not your slow stumbling zombies they will mess you up quickthe last 30 minutes also really finally showcase the fairly masterful combination of horror and dark comedy before that i think it is lost in just casual dialogue between the characters while theyre in the cabin but once its a fullon battle scene theres some pretty brilliant lines and hilariously gory moments one of the dudes holding onto a nazi zombies intestines as he flies over a snowy cliff comes to mindzombies to me on their own arent super scary even when they are fast as hell and wielding bayonets but this movie really plays on the hopelessness of sheer numbers they keep on battling and killing off what they think is the whole group and then another group pops up they keep on coming and then the leader of the group  who has been very menacingly skulking around the whole time  stands on a bank and thunders arise as hundreds of them rise up out of the snow i got chillsbasically if i judged this movie on its entirety it wouldnt rank very high with me but judging it just on the real action the last 30 minutes its a solid zombie movie in my eyes gore for days great special effects creative and personalized killings truly funny oneliners and some moments where you cant help but put your hands up to your face while saying is he really no no awesome,cruel
2009 starring charlotte frogner stig frode henriksen vegar hoel jeppe beck laursen evy kasseth rsten lasse valdal jenny skavlan bjrn sundquist ane dahl torp and rjan gamst directed bytommy wirkola review eins zwei die hello kiddies your pal the cryptcritic logging in another piece of film i saw yesterday night this is exactly the kind of stupid bad but yet fun horror film i was looking for eight medical students on a ski trip to norway discover that hitlers horrors live on when they come face to face with a battalion of zombie nazi soldiers intent on devouring anyone unfortunate enough to wander into the remote mountains where they were once sent to die like i said this is the kind of stupid fun i was looking for i do feel that it doesnt become as fun as it is until the hour and fifteen minute mark the last 15to thirty minutes are what saved it from being just awful and boring but the actors do a fine job and look like theyre having fun the direction is pretty good and it just becomes very fun to sit through im giving a three out of five,cruel
this movie almost reminded me of 1977s shock waves except its much more updated more upbeat and takes place in the snow its also a little bit like cabin fevera group of people go up to a ski cabin on a snowy mountain for fun a stranger comes to their door and tells them a creepy story about nazis and the area they are in and soon enough there are zombies picking them all offthe makeup was great the zombies really looked goodthe death scenes were good as well lots of goremy only complaint was that we could have used more characterization i just didnt care about the characters all that muchthere are some funny scenes in the movie but id say its more serious than funnythe movie does leave open for a sequeli liked the movie and i usually dont like anything new thats out it was worth sitting through the subtitles its very entertaining and i can see it becoming a classic so if youve been waiting to see this film id say its worth the wait and will be worth getting on dvd,cruel
i have never seen a stupid horror film that would involve nazi zombies and a lack of humour i think this is such a rip off from well known horror films like the evil dead nightmare on elm street friday the 13th and frigging shaun of the dead seriously this is like a really lazy way to get people liking this movie and trying to get into the box officeim more shocked that the sequel has more nominations then this first one because it is just so poorly scripted poorly casted and poorly everything i would avoid the sequel at all costs i just wouldnt go there after watching 20 minutes of this im keeping away from this such rubbish,cruel
the other commenters talk a lot about how this movie is in terms of gore comedy and whatnot so im not going to bore you with that instead im going to share what made this movie truly awesome and what i havent read here yet the three main male characters the movie guy dies quickly so i dont consider him to be one each have a fantastic approach to the inevitable hell that has descended on them boredom apathy even they dont flinch squirm or even blink their eyes twice as theyre slaughtering zombies with chainsaws and hammers while covered in entrails this total lack of what i call being a whiny slasher flick bitch makes this movie so unique together with the superexposed highdetail camera shots watch this movie just to marvel at how utterly weird the reactions are to impending zombie disembowelmentps i love the shaun of the dead quick montagehomage brilliantly done,cruel
first the only reason why this movie is getting two stars instead of one is because of the bloody gory goodness of it that was the only good thing about this movie my netflix recommended this movie because i loved shaun of the dead this movie was nothing like shaun of the dead there was no real plot apparently the makers of the film could not decide on who the hero should be they obviously couldnt decide on whether or not to make it a comedy or horror there was nothing consistent about the movie the same general rules of zombie movies didnt apply either example one of the characters is bitten not just once but twice and does not turn into a zombie another of the characters actually bites one of the zombies and does not turn into a zombie if youre looking for something that is comparable to shaun of the dead this is not your movie if youre looking for something with no real story line or plot or hero then you might like it oh and be prepared to read as this is a german movie with english subtitles i was very disappointed in this movie ,cruel
a group of medical students go to a remote cabin in the norwegian alps for a ski vacation they wind up stumbling across a lethal battalion of savage undead nazi soldiers director tommy wirkola who also cowrote the compact script with stig frode henriksen relates the familiar yet still effective and entertaining story at a quick pace makes fine use of the bleak wintry landscape delivers plenty of inyourface graphic and nasty gore and tops everything off with a wickedly funny sense of pitchblack humor the young protagonists are personable and drawn with some depth while the nazi zombies are fast ferocious intelligent and hence quite creepy moreover this picture not only pays affectionate homage to such horror cult favorites as the evil dead peter jacksons braindead and shock waves but also warrants extra praise for thankfully eschewing the tired endoftheworld apocalyptic angle thats a common clich in the zombie horror sungenre matthew westons striking cinematography astutely captures the isolation and desolation of the snowbound location as well as boasts several cool zombie pov shots christian wibes lively shuddery score hits the spirited shivery spot while this film doesnt break any new ground it nonetheless still entirely succeeds with what it sets out to do with a hugely enjoyable blend of warped glee and infectious goforbroke gusto,cruel
im going to try my best to keep as much of the plot out of this review as possible as to not give any spoilers is a 2009 norwegian horror comedy film about a group of friends and hopeful lovers going to a cabin in the snow covered mountains for a get away trip that promises fun and hopefully a little bumping uglies the opening of the film sets the tone perfectly for what youre going to be watching and is an easy highlight to the feature from there on we are introduced to the characters to be quite honest theyre a little bland and really only serve to give us a forward look at the menu the movie kind of drags the first 20 minutes or so with the introduction of an outsider character that delivers a monologue about evil as all crazy old men must do in horror movies the first real kill doesnt come in until about 30 minutes in and the movie has the traditional false finish situations you know the old clich type situations in movies where someones looking for something the scenery gets all dark and the music kicks up then a cat jumps out or something yeah there are a few of those kind of situations here i will say though once the action begins it keeps up rather well not feeling too rushed but not making you wait too long between scenes of violence and gore and on another note with so many movies today using cgi effects when it isnt necessary its good to see a horror film with a rather traditional focus on practical effects to get across the gore and death scenes and that being said there are a few death scenes in the movie that are a bit standard for this sort of thing but some that are really good and throwbacks to good old 80s horror the movie sort of downplays our main characters in a way which makes them zombie bait and nothing more the male characters are all portrayed with a harsh stupidity and the female characters as almost helpless we dont root for them very well and as i said before just wait for them to be chewed up but this severe lack in character development kind of plays into another of the movies strengths comedy has a subtle sense of comedy from hilarious character reactions to legitimately funny dialogue and moments that made me laugh well chuckle really out loud this sort of haplessness portrayed by our victims makes the films second act pick up work even better than had it just been tons of blood theres even a couple solid homages to the evil dead films in there one real highlight to the movie is a hand to hand fight scene between one of the campers and a few of the zombies that comes across as a mix between a 1980s hulk hogan wrestling match shaun of the dead and the captain kirk vs lizard man fight thats become such a popular internet meme theres even a little classic 007 thrown in there just for good measure some other good moments are the very interesting scene where one of the girls in the film is getting eaten with the camera in first person as she comes to but this buffet session has a nice comedic twist another good mention is a particular zombie death that brings back to mind the put your face on the curb moment from american history x now being a movie about nazi zombies a topic that is at large relegated to video games its kind of hard to not include some solid sense of humor the zombie make up is solid for the most part and with the exception of one or two of the undead national socialists they all for the most part look good and as the films director tommy wirkola said they are nazis first then zombies in case you are interested to know were not dealing with shuffling brain munchers in german wwii fatigues we have fast vicious organized third reich supporting flash chopping throat cutting all around evil bastard full on aryan and nazi brain munchers another thing that needs to be mentioned is the music to be honest its kind of hard to place you see because this is a foreign film we get foreign music so im doubting that anyone will recognize any of the songs present but the movie crosses over a few different genres and thats definitely a problem the norwegian scream metal song just doesnt work in this film but for all of the music that doesnt work there are some moments that have songs that are just perfect the noteworthy opening and when our cannibal chow heroes gear up for their final battle against the ss from hell overall this movie is pretty well done it has a good balance of comedy and gore even if there isnt a scare to be found its definitely a film i would recommend especially if you liked films like tucker and dale vs evil the evil dead series cabin in the woods and shaun of the dead and by the way the last 15 minutes of this movie are great so take the time and check out its absolutely worth a rental or a watch on netflix and pick it up if you can find it for under 20my final rating 82 not as good to me as dead alive on par to me with tucker and dale vs evil better to me than survival of the dead,cruel
as a dane i was starting to think that only danes could make good movies  well sweden do a good job on crime related series  but norway  nothing since flexness just kidding  u had aha  oh wait thats not a movie  this one is great  first of  the quality  its so crisp and wonderful  humor is great  gore is greatand its suspenseful 810  keep it coming norge okay  i have to keep writing to meet that stupid 10 lines rule  im sure theres a way around that  but im tiered now so id prefer to get some sleep  but still having waisted 10 min writing the first  genuine  part  ill do this then cheers,cruel
when the first time ive see the poster this movie sound promising a zombie movie which nazi as the zombie sounds good but this idea become useless with the poorly act and clich script at the same time i love zombie movie i love gore movie  i love nazi movie but this is not the film that i want the comedy which brought with this premise idea is not funny its weird and absurdis boring from the first half but for the good ones the last half its pretty entertaining the blood  gore at last half save the rating from this crp movie510,cruel
if you have never seen a zombie victim cut his arm off with a chainsaw only to be bit in the nuts watch this film intestines are not that strong and would probably steam in the cold conditions we loved the way the zombies could run infinitely more fun hey that last line rhymed we watched the dubbed version which is not usually my cup of tea but it was very watchable and gave me a new appreciation for the norwegian sense of humour classic zombie action such as undead hands reaching through the doors and wall of a cabin were given a new and scandinavian twist if you are a fan of the genre or are even just looking for a bit of zombie fun i can recommend this film its not every day the nazis win,cruel
i find it hard to believe that the current rating for this movie is 65 i can understand that there are a lot of zombie and gore fans but i cannot understand why people are satisfied with such clich and predictable plots this movie offers absolutely nothing new except making zombies out of nazis the classic story of evil dead funny because one of the characters actually mentions evil dead it is such an obvious tribute bunch of young people going up to the mountains to stay at a cabin and they get attacked by zombies who are supposedly the nazi soldiers who took refuge in the forest during world war ii yes there is a lot of gratuitous gore peoples faces always covered with blood not sure why they wouldnt wash their faces with snow that to me would be an instinct but i guess these guys like blood on their faces also not sure why anyone would want to fight with a zombie knowing that you cannot actually defeat a zombie by beating him up common knowledge this movie reminded me of the cabin fever a similar attempt at making something new by using old familiar horror elements there are so many stupid moments in the movie i am not sure i remember them all these guys have cell phone but for some strange reason they dont think of using it until they burn down the cabin a zombie sticks his fingers in the nose of one of the victims and opens up his head like a melon i mean the victims head cracks open in the middle like a melon in another scene bunch of zombies tear up the limbs of a victim not sure how that is physically possible i know zombies are not supposed to be realistic but that shouldnt mean every physical law should be compromised the original night of the living dead was pretty good only 4 points that i give is because of the location they used makes it interesting a zombie movie in the snow and some scenes are pretty wellcrafted for a norwagian picture other than this is a mediocre movie you wont find anything new in the story,cruel
appears on the surface as a zombie movie actually when watched it appears as a whole lot of ideas rolled into an hour and a half its a whole lot of scary movie cabin fever night of the living dead pirates of the caribbean donkey punch and evil dead but zombie movie well sort ofsure the movie involves vacationing college kids in a remote cabin  sooo original  when all of a sudden a creepy old man tells the tale of evil nazi baddies who died previously on this very hill and seek revenge for gold etc thats one of the many subplots explored and then dismissed they come from under the ground and are eventually sliced and diced and killed in the very fashion most moviezombies are slaughtered and yet they get hurt andor return to kill some more in multiple sadistic ways unlike most moviezombies are portrayedfor fans of the previously mentioned genre and films you might enjoy this little independent film if youre immune to the gore and believe me  theres a lot of it and like a little and i mean a little movie reference humor then this movie might be set for you its a tad bit choppy poorly edited  scenes kind of begin and end with no rhyme or reason and its not so much fun following the subtitles along with the action furthermore you never attach onto any of the characters  cardboard galore and finally it just wants to be too many movies rolled into one forgetting to make its own marksee it just for fun watch the movies it mimics for true entertainment,cruel
blood guts gore and more no there is not much more to zombie spoof titled written and directed by tommy wirkola the movie opens with a group of medical students traveling into a remote part of norway to entertain themselves at a cabin drunken horny students stranded in the middle of norways winter what could possibly go wrong as the movie unravels any audience familiar with the typical hollywood thriller can pick out numerous examples of typical horror themes first off the group of youth must travel by ski snowmobile or foot to a small cabin where of course there is no cell phone reception en route to the cabin the group discusses how to dig themselves out of an avalanche an obvious example of foreshadowing at the cabin they entertain each other telling stories drinking and well having sex a knock on the door disturbs the festivities and creepy weathered old many enters here the audience gets a glimpse of what might be to come wirkola pulls from norways brutal war torn past when the old man tells of the nazi invasion and the norwegian rebellion that occurred of course a dark presence can still be felt in this area and the youth are told to heed his warning which obviously they dont as if the number of cliques could not get any greater the group decides to split up and go their separate ways after a battle with a few nazi zombies in most movies cliques are looked down upon however in this movie wirkola uses them to a humorous advantage which i must say i found very entertaining though originality is lacking in the great majority of the film there are several elements that stand out as completely unique the most significant being the zombies though zombies are already frightening wirkola amps it up a notch by making them nazi zombies nothing provokes fear and anger into an audience better than a combination walking dead and hitler saluting soldiers the second item that is unique to this film is that of winter never before has a zombie movie been filmed on top of several feet of snow the snow adds an element of surprise new to the horror world as we can never be quite certain when a zombie arm will blast out from beneath the snow another very pervasive theme is that of blood guts and gross this is the epitome of college guy humor my disgust began when two of the horny students hook up on an outhouse toilet seat i cannot imagine a least attractive place to bump uglys the repugnance continues throughout the rest of the movie every character seems to be dripping with large amounts of zombie blood several of the most abhorrent scenes involve the use of zombie intestines as a climbing rope the use of a chain saw to remove ones own arm and of course the young woman who wakes to her innards being eaten out of her limp body the amount of gore becomes very comical by the end of the film and has probably entertained many a teenage boy however i find the use of excessive blood a little much and it detracted from my enjoyment of the film the last theme i noted regarded the vulnerability of the young college students for starters they are basically stranded their only mode of transportation a snow mobile takes off early in the film additionally they are so far from any sort of civilization that not a single soul can hear them screaming to add to this blood creates a great amount of contrast against the pristine snow making it hard to hide every time they are splattered with more blood they become a little more obvious to the zombies following them a young woman wearing bright red coat even attempts to hide from zombies in a tree as though she blends in a couple of these students realize there is no way to hide but instead they must fight their way through the army of nazis using a chainsaw and snowmobile all and all i would rate this film as mediocre for a low budget film made by a young male with an obsession with gore it serves its purpose many audiences are sure to enjoy the comical side to this film that is if they can stomach the blood i however was left with a feeling of nausea and an even greater dislike for nazis as for the rest of tommy wirkolas films i believe they too have a similar comical feel which may be of interest to anyone who enjoyed ,cruel
this movie isnt great or original by any stretch of the imagination and its certainly not as funny or clever as shaun of the dead but it is entertaining enough in its own right still again not the roaring success its made out to be its actually kind of spotty and its mostly that its reasonably wellpaced that it isnt a disasterthe movie includes the standard stupid teenagers or twentysomething vacation goers in this movie medical students caught in an isolated place references are even made to this by one of the illfated campers in this case a cabin in the snowy norwegian mountains just asking to get picked off by something in this case nazi ghouls who at one point are stealthy enough to swiftly run past a man to slit his throat or strong enough to physically pull apart another mans skull then later fall down at will or have their heads kicked in and burst apart like rotten melonsbut its not these incongruities that are the main problem the film evidently has a twist at the end apparently all the ghouls are after is a small box of treasure theyd amassed during ww2 and that one of the twentysomethings found in a hole in the floor of the cabin apparently it was finding this box that awakened the ghouls and one of the characters revealing it to them seems to appease them but if this is the case it fails to explain why two other characters who have nothing to do with the treasure are killed if the answer is that the ghouls kill because they are ghouls then whats the big deal about the treasurebut it has some good makeup and effects going for it and as i said its wellpaced certainly not the worst movie of its type,cruel
a norwegian zombie movie well well and its good too starts a bit slow and the six medical students off for an easter break in the snowy mountains arent too appealing but when it gets going it doesnt mess about plenty of references to previous movies but original touches too and there is always the snowy scenes to constantly remind that this isnt hollywood actually there is a lot here to remind one of that not least the level of gory violence as well as an absence of sentimentality and indeed nothing to slow up the non stop and fearsome violence once it starts having the zombies be of nazi origin is a masterstroke and informs the whole film providing some humour and more than a little gleeful vengeance,cruel
i saw some good reviews here on imdb and heard some good things about this norwegian flick not an amazing movie but tons of fun or something along those lines unfortunately i bought the hype and decided to watch the movie is nothing more then a crappy gore b moviethe story focus on a group of medical students who go on a ski vacation somehow deep in the mountainsnazi soldiers from world war 2 have survived and turned into zombies as they attack the students we get to see this group of friends fighting for survivali have to say the concept of the moviealthough simplistic is pretty cool actually who can be a better antagonist then nazizombies even the acting is not that badwell at least until the craziness begins what seems to be an interesting horror movie quickly turns into one of the lamest and corniest gore movies of all timeall of a sudden we see characters not reacting to the zombies instead of freaking out as anyone would the zombies who seemed to be really strongfast and agile in the beginning of the movie suddenly can be easily fought offits just too sillyplus there are plenty of clichs that make the film unbearable to watch or at least impossible to be taken seriouslymake no mistake this is more a parody then anything else510,cruel
there is one major problem horror comedies have these days most of the times when the gorehorror kicks in the humor goesflies out the window not with this movie though it stays right on track and achieves to stay funny and scary at the same time maybe gory would be a more appropriate wordwhile there isnt much of a plot a few people somewhere have to fend of something evil there is a fun ride hidden in this movie even the illogical attitude shown and some script failures dont really mess up a genuinely funny movie and yes while it might be considered more of horror movie lots of blood this is mostly a fun watch especially for those who think braindead is a great movie  references to other horror comedies included tshirt,cruel
seven friends go to a remote cabin in the snowy mountains and near a lake there are 4 guys and 3 girls a 4th is to arrive later once they get there they drink beer and suddenly a stranger knocks on the door he asks for coffee and tells them a story about the place during wwii nazis put a base there they didnt get along with the locals and stole all their riches until the entire population got together some nazis escaped others were eliminated now evil lurks in the place sure enough one of the guys finds a chest full of gold jewelry now the nazi zombies want it back finally when the zombies arise they go after our friends and kill in gory ways the remaining guys who are all med students will have to man up and get brutaltakes a while to get going 45 minutes or so to be exact the first half is watchable we dont learn a whole lot about the kids one of them is a horror movie buff the other is terrified of blood another is constantly horny we are told the geeky horror movie fan will actually run into a girl who has similar tastes shes also the prettiest girl of the group and unfortunately the first to get killed but otherwise the group isnt exactly compelling but the nazi zombies sure are the second half is bloody and gory fun this movie is very much inspired by the evil dead and dead alive theres a lot of similar imagery and all these movies have likable but goofy characters that leads to plenty of mild humor and then theres the violence and gore thanks to a variety of ways to kill the zombies when all you have is tools from a shed and well a machine gun at first the zombies are very fast killing in the blink of an eye fortunately later they are slowed down by the snow but they sure look mean none of that cheap makeup and pasty faces these nazi zombies look well dead not like regular dudes with flour on their faces and a bit of ketchup on their lips is a very good zombie movie its funny gory violent and it just doesnt have regular zombies but wicked nazis,cruel
this movie was fantastic i totally loved this movie honestly i never had the chance to watch a norwegian movie so this was my first norwegian movie i ever seen i have to say that this movie is a blast you would see this movie all over again this movie has everything horror action suspense zombies nazis and history thats how a director makes a good movie like that initiative part of the movie was epic the woman running from the zombies that was epic this movie should watched by everyone in this world they wouldnt waste their time by watching this epic movie i give it a 1010 i highly recommend it,cruel
when i heard the premise for this i didnt really have any motivation to watch it i just thought it would be a lame cashin on how popular nazi zombies are at the time because of call of duty but i was really wrongthe film starts off in a really generic manner with someone being chased down and murdered by the antagonist but then you start to pick up that the characters are sort of aware theyre in a movie and it really starts picking upits really amusing at times and badass at othersdefinitely worth a watch,cruel
hearing mixed reviews i finally brought myself to watching i will admit i liked certain parts and others i really didnt like with some other moments leading me to scratch my head theorizing how the script could have done much betterthe cast though quite generic as a group of partying medical students undergo their trip to their clichd isolated cabin in the woods retreat in the winter time they involve themselves in a drinking game listening to an old folk lore told by an outsider warning them about the danger of the nazi zombies looking for some gold when soon after this stranger goes against his own advice and camps out alone to be murdered one scene later after wards these zombies set their sights on the group of college kids and pick them off one by one they fend for themselves by mauling other zombies in rather creative ways and dying in a less predictable fashion i will give them points for that the death scenes are gory and some of the action scenes are rather creative and almost comical there was some impressive camera work involving one particular victim being eaten alive by the nazi zombiespoints are lost for another bone headed plot hole involving a belated cell phone call the day after two of their buddies get killed shouldnt they have called the police especially when they were within cell phone range another rather weird moment is one guy deliberately sawing his own arm off which can be seen tucked in the actors sweater after his self amputationsomething else i wished what would happen is maybe some exposition just enough for me to understand how these nazi zombies came to be rather than just accept their conceptual existenceoverall i am still debating on whether i can actually say i would recommend this movie to anyone this really isnt a thinking mans zombie genre movie but watch it for its creativity,cruel
this may not be the first movie to put a pomoquasiironicselfaware spin on the classic zombie movie genre but its definitely the most recent is what you get when you take evil dead throw in nazis and replace the woods with well snowcovered woods thats not to say its regurgitated tripe of which there is a lot in this movie it casts a knowing wink to its inspirations sam raimi and peter jackson should be collecting royalties but it treats its subject matter with the utmost sincerity and production value this isnt just a couple norwegians with an hd cam there is a lot here great guts good costume work a pumpin soundtrack and gasp witty dialogue the pacing is spot on though some may complain that things go into zombie frenzy mode a little to quickly and the movie never outstays its welcome my only gripes would be that there is just a little too much scene lifting at least 3 evil dead homages by my count maybe more and the editing is a little wonky at times when did those people start running methinks we forgot to shoot an establishing shot gleefully made with wit and love and guts is an import zombie flick that wont transcend the genre but is just damn fun enough to be a great addition,cruel
now this is the perfect movie to watch during the winter olympics eight medical students on a ski vacation in norway you know they will have some fun but the real fun will be a surprise to themvegard lasse valdal goes out looking for his girlfriend sara ane dahl torp who was to join them after cross country skiing he becomes concerned when a passing local tells of nazis probably dead in the mountainsall the laughing and partying quickly ends as chris jenny skavlan disappears and they find saras backpack poor erlend jeppe laursen what they did to him vegard find sara and more than he expected there are nazi zombies everywhere and everyone is fighting for their liveslots of blood and gore as you would expect but humor also as well as an innovative use for duct tapethe zombie makeup was fantastic just when you think it has reached the ultimate in gore with a chainsaw axes and a snowmobile it goes even higherrambo had nothing on martin vegar hoel best zombie movie i ever saw,cruel
in all honesty this is the most exciting zombiefilm i have ever seen its not the best zombiefilm but its the best actionzombiefilmthey did not spend too much time on the things that you dont really want to see in a zombiefilm like partying teens and such they introduced the threat the characters and then went straight to the actionthe location is perfect theres really nothing there but snow which puts the focus on the important things blood guts and nazi zombies the only thing i wasnt pleased with was the music it seems out of place in some scenes and its really quite obvious that it was premade and not written for the scene but the volume is low so it can easily be overlookedi still give this movie a 10 its one of the best zombiefilms ever madeif you loved shaun of the dead put it in the attic and forget about it this will be your new favorite i promisealso consider that im swedish it pains me to give a norwegian film a good review but this this was awesome,cruel
on the surface looks like a typical slasher movie a group of friends go on a holiday in norway where theyre picked off by a brutish monsterthen come the nazi zombiesis a brilliant norwegian horrorcomedy with overthetop gore some laughs and plenty of funwhile theres some forced exposition from a mysterious stranger  basically the nazi zombies are after a box of world war ii gold hidden in the cabin that the group are staying  its forgivable and gives us more gore timerefuses to take itself seriously with so much gore but so absurdly fake that its not offputting grotesque zombie make up and plenty of great killswhile the sequel takes the premise to even more ridiculous levels now the nazis are fighting the russians with amateur american zombie hunters joining in the original is pure fun,cruel
one of the best zombie comedies of recent years and what i like is not only the implementation of evil nazizombiecommandos but the good shot of blood and guts it is a comedy yes but it has enough splatter so even the connoisseur of all horrors and bloodbath in us is not only satisfied but pleaseddd sn directed by tommy wirkola hansel  gretel witch hunters belongs into every collection of a serious zombiewalker related stuff addict dd sn 2 is also a fine one with more production value but if i would have only the choice to choose one of both movies i would prefer the first movie,cruel
given my scandinavian origin and being a bit of a fan of all kinds of science fiction fantasy action and horror movies i of course had to have in my collection last saturday me and my son got around to watch itis a pretty classical teenagegroupgetsintobigmesswithsupernaturalbeings kind of horror movie in this particular case a group of teenagers goes for a hike in the norwegian mountains where they camp in cabin not very original of course but what the heck it is a zombie horror movie so one thing that makes the movie a bit original is that it is not so totally over the top with foul language and insane consumption of all kinds of drugs as the standard hollywood crap these teenagers actually behave fairly normally drinking a few beers and having a good time well that is until the mysterious stranger who is in the movie just to set up the mood shows up and tells his story about a unusually cruel nazi officer and his men of course we all know where things are going from there here the movie starts to follow the usual recipe for these kind of movies naturally one of the teenagers needs to take care of some natural needs and separates himself from the rest of the party then follows the obligatory boy and girl having sex scene this time in a oldfashioned scandinavian skithus separated from the actual cabin anyone who has ever used one of these i have and they stink would know that you have to be pretty horny drunk or both to have sex in one of those anyway that was one less teenager in the partyslowly the zombies become more frequent and the dire situation the party is in becomes more and more evident as the zombies become more frequent so does the gory sequences and eventually the movie turns more into a comedy than a horror movie i have to say that the tommy wirkola have little to learn from his hollywood counterparts when it comes to horror movie violence body parts external as well as internal flies around like there was no tomorrow which for most of the characters involved is exactly the way it ison the whole this movie was one part classical horror movie and one part comedy and i found it quite entertaining but you have to be into these kinds of movies to feel that way of course,cruel
my name is brandon  i am 14 years old i was just given this movie last month by my dad and i like this movie i would recommend this movie to youthis is the only zombie movie i have seen where they have an army like this onethis movie is about college students go on a ski trip to a cabin they find a box of stolen nazi valuables when they disturb the box it wakes the zombies they go out on a killing spree killing every one in sight the nazis kill all but one the one goes to the burned remains of the cabin and gets their box he gives it to the nazis and runs to the car but he still has one of their coins he gets killed right there in the car i liked this movie and i hope you enjoy watching this as match as me,cruel
i was ready to give up on this film about halfway through when all of a sudden it completely redeemed itself the last section of this movie was so much fun i completely forgave the stagnant buildup that preceded it the nazi zombies look great and are fearsome and funny in equal doses theres plenty of gore and i was hooting and hollering during a handful of sequences the music choices are also great and really add to the mood of whatever scene theyre played over the only gripes i have are that it really does follow every single horror movie clich during the buildup to the final battle another issue i have is that the character you think is the tough survivalist hero is written out of the film for a good half hour so he can conveniently not be there while the others run around like idiots getting themselves hilariously owned theres also the obligatory old man who warns the youngsters of the curse round these parts of course his dialogue is completely made up of exposition and he leaves just as soon as he arrives if the place is so dangerous why is he wandering around there by himself that said its still pretty fun if you dont take it seriously at all if you find yourself a tad bored in the beginning just wait for the ridiculously awesome finale  youll thank me later,cruel
a ski vacation turns horrific for a group of medical students as they find themselves confronted by an unimaginable menace nazi zombies plotreally surprised me i wasnt expecting such a fun flick the characters were all wellfleshed out the dialogue wellwritten and funny the gore aplenty the horror nods abundant and awesome braindead tshirts and even the score and soundtrack were good and when the movie was finished i remember some films like this example zombieland and shaun of the dead and both films was great and this one present a simple story with a lot of blood and hunting funny scenes finally i definitely recommend the movie for those who are fans of zoombies and horror films,cruel
 im glad these filmmakers did itthe setup is the same as most horror in woods films and the plot is barely there but i watched this expecting well for it to be completely terrible like one of those syfy channel unwatchable creature flicks it wasnt the acting was surprisingly good and it was done with care and respectsure nazi zombies buried in the mountain snow of norway sounds like the dumbest plot ever and it is but the filmmakers know this too it was a thoroughly enjoyable horrorcomedy overthetop yes weird yes fun yesthe budget couldnt have been more than 1million maybe 2 million tops syfy should learn from these guys or better yet platinum dunes should learn from these guysfor fun give it a chance i know youre curious nazi zombies in norway who wouldnt be,cruel
first of all youre going to have to excuse the pun but this is one seriously cool picture it is stylish well written brilliantly acted genuinely shocking wonderfully gross and absolutely hilarious im not joking folks this made me laugh more than any movie ive seen all year if you need a comparison then think shaun of the dead but from norwaywith nazi zombies or think evil deadfrom norwaywith nazi zombies and if youre thinking to yourself something like can i sit through a foreign language film let alone a lowbudget foreign language horror film then i understand your reservations but i can only assure you that you will not regret taking the time to watch and give it a fair chance the americans might have the funds and the british might have redefined the genre with 28 days later but this is by far the finest example of the genre made for many years and certainly the best nazizombie crossover ever made love it,cruel
what do you get when you cross nazis and zombies a bloody damn good time it would seem after viewing the norwegian horror that was previewed at the 2009 toronto after dark film festivaltaking place in the remote snowy norwegian hills we are introduced to our cast of expendable characters that have ventured to the remote cottage as part of an easter ski vacation all signs point to a romping good time they snowmobile have snowball fights and play twister all to a rock and roll musical score what funthe setting would lend more to a sexual teenage comedy until nightfall that is when the sun goes down the first fright of the film comes innocently enough with the introduction of a strange old man who ventures upon the cottage and plays the part as seen in millions of horror movies as the mysterious man who warns the group of their eventual fate  the terrain is the least of your worries things have happened here things the people dont like to talk abouthe goes on to explain how a german troop in wwii lead by colonel herzog who tortured and killed the locals over time the locals had had enough and gathered all the weapons they could find and they ambushed the nazis one night herzog and a few soldiers were able to escape where they ran to the hills and likely froze to death theres evil here he goes on to warnstupid old man should have taken his own advicethe story unfolds without real surprises the group splits up as people are want to do in horrorlifeanddeath situations and the zombies appear in full nazi gear to terrorize and rip apart their victimsthats where the fun really beginswas directed by tony wirkola who wrote and directed the awful kill bill spoof kill buljo the movie but where buljo looked unpolished looks and feels like it was in the hands of a master of the genre blood spills and leaves its trail on the white snow as the group goes down one by one to the undead war soldierswhere the film could have used some consistency is in setting the rules for how to rid yourself of the zombie attacker sometimes just punching them and giving them a kick to the head is enough to stop them from their continued appetite for human flesh other times you this criticism aside there are some real memorable moments in a woman who awakens to see her guts being pulled out is one and using a zombies intestines as a climbing rope is another with each scene it just gets bloodier and bloodierloud ridiculous and hitting all the necessary humor notes the character the cuts off his own arm was a belly chuckle provides horror fans with an overdose of blood and guts to compliment a predicable storyguaranteed that your 90 minute investment will go by quickly and meet all expectations is a sleeper you dont want to misswwwkillerreviewscom wwwrobertsreviewscom,cruel

watching this movie was a true successor to the evil dead from the hay day of horror movies delightfully campy just cheesy enough to be ridiculous without being over the top cheesy it is difficult to tell if this is what they originally set out to do this is how you make a low budget horror movie you make it for what it can be not what you want it to also thanks to this movie i have spent many a night debating are they nazi zombies or zombie nazi while retaining the worse qualities of both i do feel they are the later where this movie seems to be lacking is that it wasnt longer i will probably be purchasing it on blue ray for additional deleted scenes,cruel
a norwegian movie what norvegian a zombie movie oh wow so original guess what if you like me thought this you were so wrong the acting was good special effects were simple yet functional and great considering the low budget and the whole atmosphere is well done weve seen funny horror movies before the cabin in the woods to mention one of the best if not the best of this subgenre and i found this to achieve the objective this kind of movie which is mixing horror with fun some scenes werehorror wise well done but then a funny sentence or a funny happening cracked the tension the balance is great even though the first part of the movie is more scary and the second one more funny and when i say funny i mean that i really laughed out loud in particular the scene when they fight the nazi zombies and someones shows them a sickle and a hammer almost had me in tears really nice to watch only one thing its a bit gross in some parts but i promise you its for a good cause 910 just because im expecting the sequel to be a better version of it,cruel
ive always loved european horror films but for the last several years ive been watching a lot of european horror films because they hold little or nothing back they openly show grotesque scenes which amounts to realism and creativeness which amounts to a good story one without the other is no good for a horror movie because too much gore in a horror film without a story is stupid and a great horror story without gore sucks however the two of these elements together make a great movie scandinavia doesnt come out with nearly as many horror movies as the us but when they do theyre monumentalie  the seventh seal 1957 sweden nightwatch 1994 denmark sauna 2008 finland dragon tattoo trilogy 2009 sweden trollhunter 2010 norway etcto me is a movie with great effects and a creative story although i dont like slasher films where young people especially women are killed by some psychopathic human weirdo friday the 13th and halloweenin this film they are killed by nazizombies monsters for stealing from their nazizombie loot i guess its a satanicoccult thing where everyone is at risk regardless of whom you are then again i wonder why these nazizombies killed turgerhe didnt steal anything and he wasnt in the group who did i guess he just got caughtup in the unfair gears of satanistoccultistnazism and was killed through association whatever i find this to be a very good horror movie with a good story and a lot of gore which is somewhat based upon nazinorway world war ii fact that a creative storyteller built upon and madei give this eight stars,cruel

must we see another nazi movieand oh no this time its nazi zombies run this is s00 over played both genreswhats next when rabbis attack hollywood is so biased with the same types of movies over and over  you would think that they would evolve past the previous 72 years and look to something newbut even now hollywood still never ceases to amaze me am i the only one that is tired of the same things or am i the only one that sees it for what it is propaganda and conditioningget over it please hollywood k thank you your ever soo grateful movie watcher the public,cruel
as far as zombie movies go this is worth seeing keep in mind its about nazi zombies so your gunna have some zombies who were once nazis attacking poor unsuspecting people in ways which a zombie perhaps doesnt usually attack get used to it theyre organized and surprising inconsistent and apparently verbal at the end the zombie leader yells rise but what do you want its a movie about zombies who were once nazis enjoy the great zombie kills great gore and hopelessness of a good zombie flick too much zombie material these days have no good zombie kills at least this one delivers an entertaining and funny ride give me more nazi zombie flicks like this keep it coming i dont care how low the budget is you can do wonders with zombie material with a little creativity and maybe some nazis it looses one possible rating mark higher simply because they had to be attached to some gold or somethingwhy itsa bunch of nazis they dont need reasons to kill theyre nazis if you liked this film try outpost another fantastic nazi zombie film which is in a league of its own,cruel
luckily i was able to watch w english dubbed in so i didnt have to exercise any brain power reading subtitles its a norwegian film unfortunately i wasnt able to completely shut my brain off during this film which prevented me from truly enjoying it when things like common sense  an expectation of a consistent plot kept getting in the way this movie makes no sense plain  simple someone in the special effects dept clearly got a great deal on fake blood  intestines bc this movie went all out with the spurting blood  gore to the point where it was beyond gratuitous also the sick obsession with guts was baffling  there was literally a scene where one of the characters gets hit in the head with a hammer as hes running through the snowy mountains he grabs his head attempts to stumble on but cant move  why his intestines somehow got caught on a tree limb not ridiculous enough how about 2 people hanging over a cliff literally holding onto a zombies intestines as some makeshift rope i didnt realize that ones intestines could support the weight of 2 adults wo not only snapping but allowing one of the characters to shimmy back up it to safety  no the intestines werent tied to a tree they were hanging out of a body the whole timethe slasher type antics actually didnt bother me that much the movie was low budget  was supposed to be campy  generous w the blood which it was  my problem was the thin plot  the actual zombies themselvescan you even call them nazi zombies sure they were supposed to be dead  had zombie makeup on but unlike zombies in other movies these nazis were agile athletic  could easily outrun the characters in the film huh arent zombies supposed to be slowsleepy not these zombies they were practical olympians also zombies are d ead so why did these zombies bleed a lot they were gushing blood as a result of wounds  we actually saw close ups of blood spurting from wounds as one would expect from someone living as his heart pumps the blood out why call them zombies at allnow the plot unlike other germans in the army during wwii the group stationed in ksfjord lead by colonel hertzog were mean to the locals when it became apparent that the germans were losing the war  the russians were closing in the germans went too far they demanded valuables including coinsgold from the locals  whoever refused was killed after years of being treated poorly the 3000 people of ksfjord got together gathered all the tools they could find like axesshovels  took on the 300 soldiers  trained soldiers w weaponry for a war and won ridiculous locals killed some  those that survived retreated up into the mountains where they supposedly froze to death hence our nazi zombies  the evil that can be awoken at any momentwe learn the story about the nazis from a random creepy man that shows up at the cabin the cabin occupied by the 7 main characters who are on spring break from school this man explained the story to the characters and in turn to the audience which is just lazy storytelling why was the man randomly in the middle of the mountains especially when he knew the legend of the evil that lurked there never explained he just shows up tells the tale and leaves pure stupidityso why is the plot an utter failure simple the core group finds a box of gold vintage gold from wwii in their cabin when 1 character who pocketed a piece drops the coin outside upon going to the outhouse  the attacks start on the cabin it is made clear especially at the end of the film that the money is what attracts the zombies and if you take it you will be found and hunted problem sure 2 people are killed in the film by nazi zombies before the gold is found in the cabin what huh why is the female student killed at the very beginning of the film why is the random man who told the nazi story attacked in his tent neither of these people had coinsgold on them  the evil hadnt been unearthed yet since the coins werent found you simply cant ignore this plot hole its criminal in spite of all the bloodguts being thrown amok in this film the grossest part has nothing to do with killings sex in an outhouse between a hot girl  chubby guy literally on the makeshift toilet after the guy just had a bowel movement nasty throw in sensual finger sucking right after he wiped pukes how did the girl even know he was done going before she mounted him unwatchablethe whole movie is a campy gorefest where 7 college students are attacked by athletic scary nazi zombies the plot makes no sense the death scenes are gratuitouslow budget one character literally falls off a mountainous cliff  walks away unharmed someone uses a cell phone to call for help after a fire breaks out the problem the killings started the day prior so why wait until the next day after a bunch of people were already dead to seek help is fire more serious than gruesome murders just stupidity all aroundlastly  how did the nazis turn into zombies dont bother asking this question bc the movie doesnt even attempt to explain it at all like i said stupid 410,cruel
this is a movie that gets interesting because it manages to avoid the usual horror clichs and also the makers of the movie have dumped in world war ii nazi soldiers as the dead man walking whatre they doing in the 21st century well thats kinda the story its difficult to predict which of the medical students would die first or who would finally survive or even if there would ultimately be a hero at the end of the day performances of all actors are good too and all the gore shown are quite bloody it has touches of comedy in it which makes the movie for a funviewing too verdict could have been more chilling but nice creeps anyway ,cruel

on a trip up to a cottage in the snowy mountain tops a group of friends encounter some mean nasty nazi zombies thats right nazi zombies can they survive will we care why are we watching a film about nazi zombiesthere was a lot of hype around this film simply for those two words nazi zombies the only other film i remember having hype around it based on a few words was snakes on a plane is a norwegian horror film that plays up the comedic aspect of actually having nazi zombies in the film the entire first half of this film is rubbish but i couldnt help but have a smile on my face once the sht hit the fan the film falters on many accounts lets see the acting is atrocious the characters are dumb and clichd as hell some aspects of the film scream low budget the story is non existent some characters exists for expository dialogue and dont even get me started on that outhouse scene all of these things exist in campy crappy horror films this is a campy crappy horror film if there is one thing i hate about recent horror its when they reference older horror films as if to say to the audience hey kids weve seen these older films so that means we know our stuff it is so obvious and lame that i want to hurl evil breed did it and does it one character is a film buff and there are many obvious horror references such as the evil dead and friday the 13th he wears braindead tshirts and tells the characters not to get bitten by zombies vomit all of the night attack scenes are boring and hard to actually see nothing new yet its not until its actually daylight does the film begin to get where it needed to be 30 minutes ago this is where the film is having fun and the audience can too this isnt your typical zombie film these guys run fast and they actually fight you like throwing punches and dropping elbows the makeup work on the zombies is adequate as are the costumes they really do look like nazi zombies the story never tells us why they are zombies though they either forgot or they want you to fill in that blank there is a small bit about the soldiers stealing gold and jewelry while they were alive it seems that if you take one they come after you but this plot point is really inconsistent there is a character who randomly shows up tells us everything we need to know about the history of the nazi zombies and then he leaves thank you very much for this riveting character the gore is great even if a lot of the blood is obvious cgi the moment i had the biggest smile on my face was when two characters arm themselves with a shed full of weapons yes even the obligatory chainsaw the comedy really hits its stride in the rising action of the film intestines flying everywhere machine gun snowmobiles amputation it goes on and on i can only recommend this film if you dig what its selling nazi zombies if that sounds like fun join in if the thought of it makes you wonder why people bother with this trash obviously skip it its not the best horror comedy but its something that will put a smile on your facenumber of times the words nazi zombies is mentioned 8 the film 6,cruel
could there be any more natural bedfellows than zombies and nazis as the dutch worst case scenario rots in indie fundraising hell we can look to norway to find investors with the balls to exploit national socialist iconography for a few cheap scares the story is simple very simple a bunch of twentysomething medical students vacationing in the desolate frozen wastes of northern norway find the region infested with vengeful undead nazis thats it the screenplay follows the genre template to a t and the lack of experience of both cast and crew is obvious save for the fantastic bjrn sundquist the movie is inspired a little too much by romero and evil dead but im a sucker for anything scandinavian and though the characters are purely generic idiot placefillers and the nazizombies dont make an appearance until the halfway mark the film is somehow held together by the inherent coolness of its premise it doesnt hurt that the special effects are straight from the diy school of tom savini augmented with lamentable cgi blood splatter  ugh with gut munching and intestine fondling galore just when your interest is flagging another flesh ravaged zombie in full ss regalia appears on the horizon and the heart flutters true love its just a shame that it wasnt filmed in grainy 16mm to complete the grindhouse authenticity admittedly the appeal may be limited but for those of us desperate for a renaissance of the no holdsbarred politically incorrect mashups of seventies grindhouse dod sno or at least its second half wont disappoint,cruel
your enjoyment of hinges on your desire to see creative ways of displaying gore judging by the reaction of a college audience most people enjoyed itfollowing a brief intro sequence that gives a hint of what to expect later starts off like any standard horror film it briefly introduces the characters and has them set off to a secluded location of course its not really a horror film its one of many recent comedyhorror hybrids i never imagined that comedyhorror films would be so popular but they seem to be working the characters are mostly interesting and the plot is unpredictable there seems to be an attempt at a story early on but most of the second half involves action basically all of the realism and consistency goes away at that point the characters seem to die in a random patternthere isnt much innovation in except for one thing the way that zombies or humans are killed and gore is displayed i found myself laughing at some of the bizarre connections that were made there was one death that appeared to be a reference to tyrells death in blade runner another one that had me laughing was when a character used soccer skills to kick a zombie head into the trees however i think that the gore was overdone and got into the way of any potential that the story had in fact the beginning of showed some promise over other similar horror films mostly because of the cinematography overall the audience clapped several times and was very involved with the filmthe film gave nothing for me to take away from it except for wonderment of how such a violent and gory film could be a comedy there are unpleasant and disturbing visuals but somehow everyone was able to not take it seriously im not sure whether thats a good thing but it does show that the film succeeds on some level,cruel
i was really disappointed by outpost especially with the nazi zombie format but then i heard about this norwegian film and i decided to try it basically a group of medical students are going on an easter skiing vacation in the snowy norwegian mountains with a small cabin near ksfjord owned by sara ane dahl torp girlfriend of vegard lasse valdal one night while drinking the students let in mysterious hiker bjrn sundquist who tells them dark history of the region in world war ii with an army of torturers lead by herzog rjan gamst when he has left soon enough he is attacked and the cabin also encounters the most unimaginable horror nazi zombies the fast moving kind but not flesheating and able to be killed not just with a blow to the head one by one the students try to escape this terror killing these creatures in more gruesome ways but end up dying themselves until one survivor martin vegar hoel is left over with one arm sawed off to get to the safety of the car only to have herzog smash through the glass also starring jenny skavlan as chris jeppe laursen as erlend stig frode henriksen as roy charlotte frogner as hanna and evy kasseth rsten as liv this is exactly the same feel you would get with the evil dead with bucket loads of blood and guts and made even funnier because of it with a good hook on the regular zombie theme this is a most watchable comedy horror good,cruel
tommy wirkola reinvents the term gory in his zombiecomedy film the young director captures a genre that isnt typical of nordic film utilizing local history to construct his evil zombies norway was occupied by german nazi soldiers for a short period of time during world war ii and who could make a more evil zombie than a nazi soldier wirkola has noted his inspiration by films he grew up watching like the evil dead and braindead both are movies that aim to twist gory horror scenes with comedic relief has been received positively because it has attracted a new audience in nordic countries and has even begun to attract me to a genre of film that i havent cared much for in the pastthe bloodbath begins with the death of one of the travelers sara unaware of her death her friends make their way to her cabin the collegeaged friends think they are in for a vacation full of drinking sex and fun when a mysterious man arrives informing them of the sinister history of the area they are staying in he tells them that during world war ii the nazis occupied the area and tortured people for years at the end of the war the people staged an uprising killing many soldiers and sending the rest into the mountains where they presumably froze to death he enlightens them of the legend of the undead nazis who roam the nearby hills the strange man leaves and the group laughs him off  only to learn the hard way later on that he was right all alongoverall is a wildly entertaining movie in terms of excitement and gore  but besides that there is not much to it this film could have accomplished all that it had if it had been formatted to a short film if you are looking for a movie with a plot and character depth then this movie is certainly not for you the first third of the movie does very little to build the characters the only things we know about the seven victims is that martin is a medical student who is afraid of blood roy is a pervert erlend is a film nerd martin and hanna are dating and that they are all on their way to saras cabin to have a good time i would guess that wirkola intentionally did this to make it more comical and less dramatic due to the lack of character development i cannot even commend any of the actors or actresses for their performances the most i can praise them for is their ability to scream and act frightenedon the other hand this is a great film if you look past the small flaws that make it a clich the simple plot was not unlike most other horror films and consisted of getting the characters to the middle of nowhere so that they can be killed it was pretty funny how some of these victims were medical students but still made awfully stupid decisions one other minor clich was the dumb scare tactics used early on in the movie however these tactics went away as the film picked up and the killing spree really beganthe completely ridiculous deaths that the characters of this film undergo are the reason that this movie is good without the humorous and unusual deaths this film is just like any other horror film the movie has more unraveled intestines than any other ive seen in fact at one point during the movie someone is hanging off a cliff by another persons intestines other death scenes are especially bizarre and occur in odd settings if you cant find it hilarious that someone gets killed in an outhouse by a nazi zombie then you hardly have a sense of humor in this movie you also witness a mans eyes being gouged out which then leads to his head being ripped into two pieces these are only a few of the outrageous acts performed in this filmif you love the horror genre you will be satisfied with this film is not for the faint of heart and definitely does not use blood sparingly  in fact the snowy white background amplifies the goriness of this film with its strong contrast in color and texture wirkola is neither trying to give a historical statement on the nazis nor trying to be completely original his work is similar to directors like sam raimi and peter jackson who have created slapstick horror films but wirkola shows his own style when the garden shed tools come out his goal seemed to merely be to create a hysterical film that also strikes some horror into the viewer i am generally not a fan of horror movies but this approach to creating a horror film was very entertaining get a group of friends together and be ready to jump out of your seat one moment and laugh your rearend off the next,cruel
let starting american filmmakers with limited resources and finances take some notes from this movie one thing that this movie does very well is that its fun to watch due to the fact that it doesnt take itself too seriously when youre making a movie of this sort with only the available resources at hand this is a very important thing to do you dont necessarily need to become a parody of the genre but take into consideration what the viewers want and expect from a movie like this some pure simple fun entertainment with some gore thrown into itbut having said that dd sn itself is obviously also far from a flawless picture it mainly benefits from the fact that it has a greatly awesome concept and some nice scenery to shoot the movie inone thing that the movie doesnt do very well is its storytelling the movie doesnt really put the emphasis on its characters very well the one moment in concentrates for 10 minutes on one or two of the characters and than it suddenly cuts to others without given a clear view of what happened in between all with all of those characters it doesnt feel too consistent all and we as the viewers start to loose track on some of the charactersit also isnt being a very consistent movie with its approach the movie starts of as an usual typical horror movie in which a bunch of people gets visited by the undead its pretty much being a straightforward horror flick a fun one that doesnt take itself too heavily but pretty much straightforward stuff nevertheless it had a pretty much realistic approach in its last halve hour however the movie suddenly goes way overthetop and becomes more like a shaun of the dead type of zombie horrorcomedy with all of the blood and gore but also some overthetop comedy and far from likely moments its fun but it just doesnt feel very consistent with the rest of the movie as if the filmmakers during production decided to suddenly take a different more comical approach with its movieits a movie with some nice scenery and good locations for a movie of this type its also rather good looking even though i would imaging that it didnt had the highest budget to work with there is really plenty of gore and graphic moments in the movie though it also all gave me the impression that the movie was being simply gory and shocking purely for the sake of being gorybut despite all of these complaints dd sn remains a movie that deserves plenty of credit and is still a great movie to watch for the lovers of the genre and is entertaining to watch for basically everyone else as well71httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,cruel

i am beginning to realize what creative hindrance nostalgia is directors particularly in horror genre are so fixated with recreating the past that they are foregoing the future most of these bankrupt productions are headed by people one generation ahead of ours is this some kind of premidlife crisis it wont end this decade and once we arrive at our late 20s we will be part of it im still going to attempt to not skew my criticism in favor of these movies and ask the same of you lets not encourage lazy filmmaking this writing is actually going to be a film review now i promisei have read many film reviews of a norwegian slasher from 2007 called cold prey it was apparently an effort to get young people in theaters and it worked now another youth pic was released in 2009 i read an interview with the director who admitted his interest in reaching hollywood someday as unimpressive as his latest film is im sure he will have no problem directed phail remakesso a group of medical students take a vacation in a mountain cabin which of course is out of cell phone range some wise weirdo warns them that many people have been killed and tells them about a local rural legend during wwii a band of nazi soldiers looted a nearby town and fled to the same mountains where the cabin is located and froze to death some say their spirits still search for the treasure they stole whatever so the weird guy ignores his own advice and camps nearby and is attacked by zombies the kids are too end the films premise is centered on the treasure which the college students find in their cabin basement after 70 or so years the nazi zombies never thought to look there even though they are drawn to it of the many shortcomings i simply cant ignore one that obviousthere are some amusing sequences where people attack zombies set to inappropriate music but nothing distinct the film flounders in its attempt to be evil dead homage or a serious picture the entire project reeks of nostalgia and its stench has a pervasive effect why would characters feel the need to discuss april fools day and friday the 13th the final attack scene is a recreation of army of darkness with a chainsaw being held in similar style its like the film crew took bits and pieces of better and worse films and reanimated them it results in a bland effort that doesnt warrant a viewing you would have a better evening watching most films this one referenceszombie fans may have some trepidation too this is another fast picture not only that they use weapons and formulate strategies on defeating opposition flesh eating still occurs but it is not their purpose i found this decision unusually appropriate if the zombie picture is to regain any relevance innovation must happen these creatures are quite intelligent and even understand the advantage of camouflage as the only rebuke of the past it works as unintended parody of stupid young people movies i probably wasnt supposed to cheer for the zombies but i found myself doing itif you live in the united states you can only watch this film by renting it from blockbuster its part of their monopolistic distribution agreement with ifc there were many better horror films last year even from scandinavia i wouldnt bother but im an elitist film critic,cruel

this movie was great if you are into the comedyhorrorzombie thing this will entertain you not like shaun of the dead more like an exaggerated evil dead with nazi zombies it has the scary origin story told by some random stranger the sex scene in an outhouse in the snow the blood the guts plus the leader has such a well kept outfit it has all the clich moments that we all have come to love toothe real highlight is that the cinematography is actually quite nice the landscape is beautiful but soon it gets stained with peoples parts and nazi zombiesit is quite ridiculous and the only time i have actually enjoyed watching nazi soldiers kill other people not great acting but a great time especially the end yummy crunchy balls,cruel
in the past few years horror movies have become less than creepy some people even consider them to be comedies now the thing about horror movies is that we know what to expect we have learned the music cues the fake outs and the tones of voice we even know what to expect with particular camera angles we usually know what is coming and when it is coming movies such as scary movie scary movie 2 3 and 4 were popular comical spoofs of the everpredicable horror filmthe element of surprise and the unknown is what scares the audience not knowing what to expect is a key element in horror was a successful zombie film for the most part because it was foreign the music actors and film making cues are different in norway than they are here the audience is not accustomed to their way of film making because of this had a few elements we were unfamiliar with here in the us the zombies in were former nazis they werent like the usual zombies we are accustomed to they reminded me of the zombies from 28 weeks later aside from the nazi part as zombies they were fast more human like and murderousi suppose as nazis werethe film was pretty slow and uneventful for a zombie movie but it has a creepy feel nothing really occurred until more than half way through the film there was too much building it was actually good until the zombies appeared once they did the movie got a little ridiculous the blood and gore was not convincing at all the characters werent likable so i didnt really care if they diedthere was somewhat of a plot hole that i noticed but i cant state it because it might give something awayemail me at moviesaccordingtodesgmailcom if you have seen the movie and want to talk about itoverall it was a good movie but not that great of a zombie film i was disappointed by the second half,cruel
was probably the best zombie film ive seen period this film has so much going for it and handsdown deserves all ten of the stars that ive awarded it the premise of the movie alone gains it at least eight stars two words nazi zombies need i say more not only does it have the greatest set of antagonists ever but the film itself was very well done good cinematography good special effects and surprisingly enough a really good plot the story starts out with a group of medical students in norway as played by vegar hoel stig henriksen charlotte frogner lasse valdal evy rsten jeppe laursen jenny skavlan and ane torp going up to the icy north for a bit of a cabin trip for easter vacation this is pretty much the standard operating procedure in norway so it doesnt have the i just inherited a mansion from my crazy aunt in the bayous of louisiana feel that many american horror films have immediately limiting the plausibility of the events that will go under way its just a bunch of students going on easter vacation as thousands do every single year they drive as far as they can in cars after which the one whose family owns the cabin drives there on a snowmobile and sets up while the rest follow his tracks on foot again no surprises here the norwegians love the outdoors and their cabins are often in very secluded mountainous regions that are too snowy to travel to via automobile midway through the night that follows a day of romping in the snow one of the women claims to see a figure out in the dark while she was using the outhouse one of the guys goes out declares it to be just the wild imaginings of a hysterical girl and just as he returns theres someone right behind him dont worry hes just a hiker as played by bjrn sundquist making his way through the area in need of a cup of coffee while enjoying his cup of coffee he spins a yarn of the terrible things that happened up there during the nazi occupation and warns the youths of not waking the evil that may be slumbering in those mountains after he departs the night passes uneventfully but the next evening thats when the bloodbath starts im sure you can fill in the blanksall in all this movie was made as perfectly as a movie can be made in my opinion the actors and actresses were perfect for their roles the effects though gruesome were convincing the plot was as feasible as zombie film plots are concerned there was just enough humor and most importantly little was said after the zombies came you may be thinking to yourself well that doesnt sound right they should say things right wrong the main issue i take with many other zombie films is that people run around saying inane things like zombies are attacking or grab weapons those are all things that i feel can definitely go without saying and in this case they did this film had everything it needed and nothing it didnt even at the end when the last surviving character realizes theyre after the gold he says nothing he just digs it out of the ruins of their cabin and leaves it for them to collect running to safety the real reality of the situation is if zombies attacked you and your familyfriends youd be so busy dealing with the situation that you wouldnt say anything either there were also a few references for the educated audience which were just perfect for example in one scene the zombies and two of the humans are running at each other and one is armed with a hammer and sickle which during the charge he crosses this is a reference to communists who were also enemies of the nazis during wwii and his action really enraged the nazi zombie leader commander herzog who was played by rjan gamst so after all is said and done this movie starts with the perfect premise nazi zombies and mixes it with a plausible back story good special effects a sprinkling of humor and a complete lack of stupidity on the part of the shall we say victims mixing it all together in the perfect recipe for a great horror film,cruel
have to say up front that i loved this norwegian zombie flick that plays by its own rules a group of medical students go on easter vacation to a cabin in the mountains and find themselves under siege from some nazi zombies about 300 nazis were stationed at a village near by towards the end of ww2 and were known for their cruelty but the town rose up against them killing some of them and the rest just disappeared in the mountains never found and this is pretty much not explained but their uprising seems to have something to do with a treasure they had stolen from the locals that was never found this is an excellent mix of black humour along with some outstanding gore effects with some cgi mixed in just right this went far far beyond my expectations and i enjoyed everything about it very cool zombies and lots of references to gore classics like evil dead 1 and 2 and brain dead and other horror flicks these filmmakers did it right and this demands a sequel i would say it ranks as one of the best zombie movies i have seen in recent years and also a lot of fun dont miss this onenote and a very good soundtrack that starts off with a rousing hall of the mountain king along with quite abit of death metal also this is a very loud movie which is great i had to turn my amp down from normal level,cruel
obviously influenced by the likes of sam raimis evil dead trilogy and the early films of peter jackson this deliriously bgrade splatterfest from norway is something of a guilty pleasure a group of horny goodlooking medical students head off for a weekend of skiing sex and drinking but then they receive an ominous warning about some evil force lurking in the remote forest from a wandering stranger and before long our heroes find themselves under attack from a horde of zombie nazis who have been hiding in the area for the past sixty years there will be blood a blitzkrieg of gore body parts and intestines strewn over the snowy forest the characters are a cross section of the usual stereotypes hollywood has established for this genre director tommy wirkola is something of a horror film aficionado and he gleefully takes a chainsaw to the clichs and conventions of the genre deftly mixing gory carnage with tongueincheek humour the first zombie horror film from scandinavia is a brilliant homage to the bgrade horror and cheap gory effects of those early raimi and jackson films and will satisfy fans of the genre,cruel

i had been wanting to see this film for a while and when i finally bought it it was certainly not a disappointment this film is first class it just works perfectly the story line can be a bit shoddy in places but the overall film is an incredible achievement i have recommended it to all my friends and will recommend it to anyone who shows interest absolutely top class film loved every minuteif like me you love b movie horror  the type that is gory to the max but for some reason it is so bad that you laugh your head off and are engrossed all the way through then this is for you a cult horror flick of epic proportions there are some fabulously icky pieces of hilarity throughout this gorefest film,cruel
this was a surprise i was worried it might be a real horror but thankfully it doesnt take itself seriously at allthe pace is quick with some good and most surprisingly believable banter between the friends as they make fun of each otherall the clichs are present and deliberately so from the movie buff to the chainsawthe plot is silly and makes no sense but its a comedy so it only has to hang together well enough not to get in the way of the jokessome of the jokes are really funny the scene where one of them is bitten by a zombie is excellentits not shaun of the dead but its the next best thing,cruel
before i had viewed this movie i was under the impression that this was just going to be another horribly bad cheesy not in a good way zombie film and ill admit at the start of the movie i was still believing this to be true but once this movie really starts going it is epic yes parts of it are cheesy but isnt any good zombie film this is a really good modern day take on a zombie movie i watched this with the subtitles and it still was amazing the zombie murder scenes were amazing and creative and really hold true to zombie lovers i have yet to see something creative as this as of recent years i can not say enough about the creativeness of the zombie scenes i havent seen anything like it before and was really impressedit takes a lot for a movie with subtitles to hold my attention and this movie did it please give this movie a chance as i did you wont be disappointed,cruel
is completely aware its a horror film it even admits it in the beginning of the film by reminding us of classics like evil dead and friday the 13th saying that this is how one of those movies start out by having a bunch of teens shielding themselves off of technology and going to a remote cabin it just flat out knows its being played which is extremely annoyingto begin with going into this film with interest in the subject by the half way mark i thought it was overdone it uses elements from the 2004 parody film shaun of the dead which is not the problem ever since that film came out its been copied and sampled in numerous movies is a comedy and like i said its one hundred percent aware its in troubleplot seven medical students take a vacation to a cabin in the town nowegian of ksfjord the cabin is owned by one of the medical students girlfriend sara its not long after they get settled that sara and her boyfriend vegard disappear vegard goes to look for sara but gets lost and finds a subterranean cave he finds out that sara has been captured by nazi zombies thats right zombies in nazi commanding outfits the remaining five must all learn to survive in the cool environment and must cope with being the bait for undead dictatorsthe seven are warned about nazis by a hiker who comes to their cabin asking for a cup of coffee he tells them about standartenfhrer herzog and how he abused and tortured people with his countless number of allies the discussion with the old man is the best part of the filmis a full norwegian movie its subtitled in english which gets a little annoying i havent seen a movie that was subtitled in a long time the last one i believe was toy story 3 in june but that wasnt even the whole movie i dont have a problem with subtitles but when the entire movie is like that they become hard to readfocus after a while thank god the film has a long drawn out chase scene that gives itself a break from the damn subtitles no matter what country we all scream the samei dont know if being a nazi zombie makes your knowledge any less but it may be the case one scene a girl with a blood red jacket climbs a tree and gets completely missed by the zombies until an annoying crow wont keep quiet how why next scenethe film is typical for twentieth century horror its characters are stereotypical the events are predictable and its a walking clich the ending is open for a sequel like every film nowadays and its just one of those films that you watch once its done dont press play unless its been ten years has an interesting killer but its victims are one dimensional and sillystarring charlotte frogner stig frode henriksen bjrn sundquist ane dahl torp and jenny skavlan directed by tommy wirkola,cruel
as soon as you see the tag line ein zwei die on the cover you know this is a film reluctant to take itself too seriously the best thing about this presumption is that where in places its actually pretty creepy it takes you by surprisehowever the thing i liked the most was that the humour they chose to use is very dryblack this for me is the most original aspect of and provides a refreshing take on how people would react to such apocalyptic circumstances it also means the film makes you laugh without looking like its trying too hard in addition the fact that the film is well shot and subtly low budget means that the laughs dont simply stem from the film being so bad that its goodtheres lots of gore too which is always appealing but especially so in the zombie contextall in all well worth watching,cruel
this is a movie with a simple premise a group of medicine students go to a cabin for their easter vacation to have fun but unfortunately they run into some nazi zombiesthe first 24 minutes of the movie is almost unwatchable the acting is horrible and the settings are poorly made i almost turned the movie of at several occasions during these 24 minutes the group are making old bad jokes in a mixture of norwegian and english arnold imitations playing twister and blaming it on hollywood yelling beer beer beer etc and the plot is revealed by a random old annoying guyluckily gory things start happening after these 25 minutes for that point and till the end of the movie there is gore gore gore the makeup of the nazi zombies is great and the gore is both inventive and wellmade for the guys looking for nudity youll be disappointed if you survive the first half of the movie the bad acting annoying characters and bad jokes and if you are a huge gore fan then this movie is for you the gore is at times close to some of the gore presented in braindead dead alive but only close the movie is pretty similar the movie cold prey instead of this movie id recommend movies like outpost and severance they are way better,cruel
norwegian horror film that has nazi zombies running about on a snow covered mountain looking for lost gold the plot has the zombies colliding with a bunch of medical students on holiday which is interrupted first by a warning from a local and then by the zombies more a horror comedy then straight horror film the film begins with a stunning opening of a woman running through the dark thats set to hall of the mountain king from there the film nicely sets up the characters with two sequences that highlight the boys and the girls the sequence where the vacationers are warned is also very good but it kind of indicates that not everything is well with the rest of the film yes the sequence sets everything up but it leaves too many things hanging its like sequence after sequence that follows where you have these small little bits that work great unto themselves but they dont connect to anything else logic and reason im talking internal logic breaks down and things dont seem to fit from sequence to sequence worse is the fact that the film develops a funny but very out of place sense of humor dont get me wrong i was laughing but at the same time i felt all of the blood red jokes took away from the scares it also made me feel that the filmmakers were laughing at their characters instead of with them the shift in tone just didnt work for me i was and am disappointed i liked the concept and the trailers i just find the execution very lacking worth seeing for the things it gets right however id wait for cable,cruel
taking a ski trip into the norwegian wilderness a group of friends find the relaxing trip interrupted by a horde of nazi zombies looking to recover their stolen goods uncovered by the group and must try to get away from the situation alivethis is one of the greater zombie efforts ever theres just so much to like about this one that its hard to pick a spot to start with but what must be mentioned first is the blood and gore this one has so much that it could rival the alltime greats in the genre all the while done with hardly any biting of their flesh to do so the bloodbath that ensues from this one is a combination of defensive tactics against the zombies and their methods of capturing the group both of which results in an impressive display of carving butchering and bloodletting that leaves this film drenched in splatter from a body drawn and quartered to hatchet decapitations stabbings or simple slicings done to every part of the body chainsaw dismembering and much much more as a splatter fest this truly delivers that leaves this with a lot of action thats utterly enjoyable and keeps it moving along at a frantic pace so as not to be completely dull the comedy is interjected at the right moments to add brevity to the situation and off course the overthetop nature of the film is entirely engrossing which when added with the wintery setting and fine suspense provides this with plenty of great points the one minor flaw here is that the zombies dont behave like typical zombies and instead tend to run around wield tools and have a slashervillain sense of the dramatics rather than like mindless hordes but its a completely forgivable offense that doesnt interrupt the good will established withinrated r extreme graphic violence graphic language brief nudity a clothed sex scene and drug use,cruel
zombies in horror movies are base level creativity villains there were three or four serious zombie films that came out centered around the evilness of man and social entropy and then the genre has basically spent the last 25 years taking the piss out of itself because hey zombies are funny the story isnt really important here seven friends go into the mountains for a cabin campout and then zombies start attacking yada yada ya i was amused that all the characters got assigned a single trait at the beginning one likes movies one likes extreme sports ones horny one has big feet etc like we are actual supposed to care for these characters when we know they are only food for the proverbial zombie meat grindernow if zombies are base level creativity villains then nazis dont even register on the pyramid this movie has the doublewhammy of tongueincheek by not having just zombies but nazi zombies the only really scary parts happen in the beginning before the whole film descends into campiness like the creators were planning on making serious horror but then saw how silly the premise was and threw that plan out the window and im glad they did because there is something so silly and fun about mowing downs waves of nazi zombies with a machine gun that you recently mounted to your snowmobile while krautrock plays in the background these nazi zombies are even sillier than usual because they insist on engaging in fistfights before eating you its just a great friday night movie to sit around with your friends and laugh at,cruel
in order to play characters that are probably in their early twenties they hired actors  that look like theyre in their mid to late thirties and directed them to behave as if they were in their early teens it doesnt get any more unconvincing and stupid than that ive enjoyed many zombie movies shaun of the dead among them and have just watched a norwegian movie about trolls that was pretty ok troll hunter this one here is just plain silly no horror no twists bad costume design immature jokes that dont land,cruel
four medical students along with three women with a fourth to join the group later go to a remote snowy mountain cabin on easter break they have a good time and seem to have no problem with the odd house in the freezing cold while at the cabin the proverbial visitor warns them they should not disturb the evil in the hills as legends of wwii german soldiers still roam the mountainsi think we know where this is headed unless you got a dvd without any cover art the dialogue was pretty good with some humor and dark humor the zombies were not the foot dragging variety but moved rather quickly and with some forethought the soundtrack was excellent ranging from classical to european industrial the cabin aspect brought back memory flashes from the evil dead plus the fact they mentioned it in the film the blood and guts effects bordered on troma style it was comical to watch a brain fall out of a victims headsorry i laughedi bought the 2disc version at my local walmart for 996 it defaults to norwegian language and english subtitles i watched it in english with english subtitles the spoken english was a bit hipper than the written subtitles which appeared to be more of a word for word translation without bothering to create a loose feel great entertainment i wished they had reused the classical music somewhere in the final scenes which they had opened the film with bringing us full circle i dont know if i would place this in the top 25 zombie films as the cover claims if it did make that list it would be nearer to 25 than to number 1 but then again i watch a lot of zombie filmsparental guide fbomb sex no nudity,cruel
this norwegian horror comedy follows familiar tropes as we are introduced to a group of seven medical students taking a holiday in a remote cabin in a mountainous snowcovered area on their first night they laugh and drink while waited for the eighth member to arrive then a stranger arrives and tell then of an evil lurking in the area during the war a particularly brutal group of german soldiers oppressed the local population till they rose up and killed some and drove the rest into the mountains where there presumably froze to death we dont have to wait too much longer before we learn that they are now undead nazis the students will have to use all their wits and a variety of weapons if they are to have any chance of survivinghorror comedies seem to go one of two ways either dialling down the horror and adding obvious gags or turning the gore up to eleven and getting one to laugh at the ridiculous level of violence this is certainly of the latter type we get several clichs talking about horror movies with a similar setting stating that phones dont work and the stranger who warns them of the danger this isnt much of a problem though as this is just part of the set up when the nazizombies turn up things do get very gory as both students and nazis meet grisly ends the special effects are pretty good and the settings are spectacular there is plenty of tension when the action gets started and some genuinely scary moments there are also plenty of laughs to be had sometimes at the same as the gore is most extreme overall id certainly recommend this to horror fans who like over the top gore along with some good laughsthese comments are based on watching the film in norwegian with english subtitles,cruel
i watched this one on a festival first and was very positively surprised  a well made zombie comedy with a serious amount of gore after its release it got its well deserved place in my horror collectionif some youngsters in the snowy mountains getting in trouble with some blood and fleshcraving nazi zombie soldiers sounds appealing to you you should know this oneps dd sn 2 got after the success of part 1 a bigger production and is also a good one but part 1 is imo the one you should watch,cruel
sara is chased and killed by mysterious figures in the snowy norwegian wilderness seven medical school friends go to saras isolated cabin expecting to join her they are surprised by a creepy old man who tells them about a nazi force that occupied the area during wwii the nazis led by colonel herzog were ruthless against the locals and disappeared when the soviets arrived the old man leaves and is then killed by a nazi zombiethis has some good homage to evil dead including the chainsaw and self amputation there is loads of good blood splatter the snowy isolation and the nazi zombies are good however i do have a couple of problem first the cell phone needs to be useless instead one character actually calls 911 the weird thing is that the guy calls after a whole night of zombie attacks apparently nobody remembers to call the cops during the attack they have to wait until the next daythe bigger problem is that the movie needs to take place all at night zombie action during the night is more intense than out in daylight there is a great intensity trapped in the cabin there is no good reason for the zombies to relent in the attack theyre still around during the day also that girl has the reddest jacket possible the movie needs to show that zombies see black and white because that red jacket sticks out in snowy white landscape overall this is perfectly good bloody fun with lots of homage and some good moments of horror,cruel
nonspoiler part this is a very uneven film in the beginning it uses every clich of the cabin in the woods group of young people in isolation zombie flick no funny twiststakes on zombie in fact the nazi zombies could be just zombies and practically nothing would change i thought they could have done something more fun and interesting with the zombies being nazi but they are just zombies ok the outfit looks cool but thats it i was bored out of my mind at the hour mark and almost gave up on the movie but then the fun really picked up the final battle is epic its almost like they started conceiving the film with that last battle and then they worked out a very generic beginning extremely gory with silly brutal violence that last fight really worked at least for me the nazi zombies motivation for the killing spree doesnt really make sense given their actions but ill give my thoughts on that in the spoilers part the film is so uneven that my rating should be done in two parts first hour 3 12 stars ending 8 stars spoilers   the plot nazis aside is quite unoriginal group of young guys go to an isolated cabin attacks ensue except the initial tone doesnt really work it plays almost as suspense but we already know who is attacking them its shown in the first scene when one of the ladies of the group who was going to the cabin by herself gets killed by a nazi zombie so whats the suspense all about then a guy shows up all mysterious to the cabin his only role is to explain how the nazis ended up in the region and how some evil is going on in the region in a suspenseful way which again doesnt work at all since we already know that there are nazis there but worst he gets killed immediately after that in his tent so no character just a guy that shows up in the film and explains to us what is happening in the film bad writing all the characters are very generic i didnt get invested in any of them so other than thinking the ways some of them were killed was really cool i didnt feel anything for them then the nazi zombies motivation for killing the group revealed at the end they just wanted the gold they found to the point of letting the last guy go when he gives them the gold doesnt make sense at all the first lady that was killed did not find the gold yet so why was she killed by a nazi zombie anyway the last battle between the two last guys and the nazi zombies was fantastic it made up a lot if you like gore that last part alone makes the film worth watching,cruel
well no subtitles maybe  but thats a personal preferenceanyway is a norwegian zombie film where seven friends head into the mountains for a weekend of oh it doesnt matter why only that they encounter some pretty nasty zombies  and nazi zombies to boot so i guess that makes them doubly nastythe one thing you should know about is that it doesnt take itself too seriously think of it as more of a horror comedy than anything that will really scare you its very open about paying homage to other horror films one character even wears a braindead tshirt so the blood flows the body parts fly the pretty girls scream in terror  what more do you want oh and as i mentioned there are subtitles if thats a turn off for you you better know before you watch however the song near the end of the film during one of the most crazy and amusing slaughters ever captured on film if definitely better sung in the films native tongue than englishif you like daft if you like zombies and if you like blood then you should definitely get an hour and a halfs enjoyment out of this,cruel

this is a low budget norwegian zombie movie that is directed very well despite the budget it doesnt seem like a really cheap movie at all the build up is alright but when the zombie elements hit its pure entertainment this isnt a serious zombie flick but more of a zombie comedy the humor works without getting overly silly although it does get ridiculous at points they actually made a new genre with this onemaybe because the zombies in this can actually think communicate and be able to wield weapons the mystery behind the zombies is what drives this movie this is a fun movie to watch with your friends with some snacks7610,cruel
i am not a devotee of horror films and saw this only because a relative rented it for halloween to say i was pleasantly surprised would be a tremendous understatement and yet pleasant is not exactly the appropriate word working with a superbly honed script the masterful director of this incredible norwegian film has defined horror anew and anyone who sees it can not possibly be unchanged the imagery created will be some that you will never forget as the film delivers shock after shock the tension is unrelenting in its intensity and the utter ghastliness of some of the most graphic horror ever filmed is simply overwhelming in its power this is not a film for the unprepared audience the small audience that surrounded me were genuinely terrified and some so profoundly that they were driven from the screening in tears i was nearly one of them but i was so entranced by the directors artistry that i forced myself to endure the graphic depiction of violence and found myself greatly rewarded as a result however the visions are still haunting and may be with me until i breathe my last there is humor in the film but it is sparsely used to give the viewer a very brief respite some very necessary relief from the seemingly continuous nightmare they are watching it is like a horrendous look through the gates of hades itself and the most hardened soul will have to look away at times this is cinema for the psychologically stable and those who have been warned just how intense the experience of watching it will be i felt our halloween host had perpetrated an unquestionably cruel joke upon his guests and may have done actual emotional harm to some by springing such a powerful motion picture on unwitting people only there for a good time and ready for hollywood bloodschlock holiday fare this is certainly not and there must be a clear understanding of that this point is to be emphasized this is nothing like the exorcist or any other pop film that thrilled crowds with cheap tricks and clichd scares this is something quite existentially gripping in its realism and profound in its message the evil shown is much too real for most and i admit that some disturbing scenes i wish i had never witnessed they are seared into my entire being in perpetuity however when the credits appeared i felt i had seen something stunningly unique and fulfilling artistically those involved in the production surely have great futures in cinema awaiting them and have done much to put norway on the very cutting edge of film an underrated film that has earned a place on the top tier of the horror genre and has crossed over to the realm of important works in film history which will be discussed analyzed and praised by serious students of cinema for many generations to come,cruel
now this is the perfect movie to watch during the winter olympicseight medical students on a ski vacation in norway you know they will have some fun but the real fun will be a surprise to them vegard lasse valdal goes out looking for his girlfriend sara ane dahl torp who was to join them after cross country skiing he becomes concerned when a passing local tells of nazis probably dead in the mountains all the laughing and partying quickly ends as chris jenny skavlan disappears and they find saras backpack poor erlend jeppe laursen what they did to him vegard find sara and more than he expected there are nazi zombies everywhere and everyone is fighting for their lives lots of blood and gore as you would expect but humor also as well as an innovative use for duct tape the zombie makeup was fantastic just when you think it has reached the ultimate in gore with a chainsaw axes and a snowmobile it goes even higher rambo had nothing on martin vegar hoel best zombie movie i ever saw,cruel
this is yet another zombie movie but this time with a refreshingly different setting it doesnt add a lot to an already overcrowded genre but at least it succeeds in being pretty entertaining what makes this a pretty decent effort is a young and extremely likable cast who unlike with many american horrors you arent glad to see the back of after 5 minutes the plot is basic and whilst it isnt particularly scary the zombies are pretty good and there is a decent amount of gore and a few nice ideas thrown in there are also some nice comedic moments which raise a few welcome laughs isnt a great film it hits the target more than it misses well worth a watch for fans of the zombie genre,cruel
the decision to utilize cheerful classical music over the brutal murder of sara in the first scene of the movie is moronic this scene has happy music on it so you may start laughing viewer theres no chance the movie is going to get me to laugh at an unfunny gagdevoid scene just because some confused optimistic writer suggests it must be funny one should place cheerful music over something violent only if that violent act is amusing which clearly isnt the case as a result the opening scene has neither menace nor humour in it the scene had been robbed of any horror potential by using cheerful music so the director neither gets the cake nor eats it still the scene isnt entirely pointless it serves as a warning that the following events might just be quite stupid this genrerelated confusion exhibited straight away in the prologue sets the tone for the rest of the movie ds exists in that wishywashy netherworld between allout horror and a zombie comedy which never works the movie continually meanders between serious and goofy and thats its main detriment if only the filmmakers had decided on what kind of film they wanted to make this would have worked out much betteras for the rest of the music some of it is rather awful rockmetal a dire reminder never to let your frontman sing in a scandinavian language unless its being growled hence incomprehensiblemany decisions and much of the behaviour of the 7 humans make little or no sense because this isnt a straightout comedy i give myself the option to nitpick  an option i gladly choose 1 a fairly solidlooking woman is attracted to the sloppy fat guy i dont care how high on dope she is this is too ridiculous to be either realistic or funny tom arnold is adonis next to this guy 2 out of the blue she volunteers to sit on his cock while hes taking a dump  in a freezingcold outdoor toilet or are we to believe that norwegians are so accustomed to snow that its not much different than sand to them is winter merely a slightly less mild form of summer for them she even takes her shirt off in what must be below zero 3 the fat guy exhibits no concern whatsoever that the girl  five leagues above his whod just volunteered to shag him  is missing 4 the one guy who is too cowardly to shoot keeps wielding the only shotgun they have  and nobody complains to him about it or tries to take the weapon away from him in order to finally give those bullets a purpose 5 no man on the entire planet would hesitate to use a shotgun no matter how mentally weak he is when faced with a nazi zombie its not as if anyone would have any moral qualms there or might be considering negotiations followed by a peaceful settlement 6 the man in question has been studying medicine for six years and yet he is disgusted and scared by the sight of blood not funny merely stupid comedy has to be based in reality to at least some degree in order to be funny 7 they decide to split up in spite of the fact that there is obviously more than one nazi zombie lurking in the woods splitting up only makes them even more vulnerable individually again not funny stupid 8 the women leave the cabin without previously arming themselves with knives and the like 9 the old there is no phone signal here clichexcuse is made well before the humans are even attacked and yet after setting their own cabin on fire a signal suddenly miraculously comes into existence not funny but definitely stupid 10 the shotguncarrying guys girlfriend approaches him from behind just as he is busy hacking and slicing up zombies would anyone in their right mind or even halfright mind enter the radius of a person who is waving around with a chainsaw and a large blade very obviously highly predictably and totally stupidly he unintentionally slices her 11 before being accidentally killed by her man her solution to escaping a zombie at the edge of a cliff is to get an avalanche going she and the zombie both fall from a very large heighti could go onds is not a bad film its very well shot the action scenes are fun when theyre not excessively moronic and not without some entertainment value but norwegians have a very long way to go until theyve mastered the horror comedy genre having one of the characters wear a braindead tshirt does not do the trick alone peter jackson could certainly give them a tip or two or a dozen on how to make a horror film that works as an allout comedy still ds is a step in the right direction baby steps success doesnt come straight away comedymaking isnt the same as crabbing next time they need to decide for one clear path and then run with it this schizophrenic approach can be quite annoyingds ends the same way it had begun and the nazis still control the mountain so what has been accomplished is there any point to all of this is this ending just a reflection of the producers desperate hope for potential sequels if the point was to introduce zombie nazis into the world of horror films its already been done many times before there had been nazi zombies as far back as the 40s then they became quite fashionable again in the 70s with films like shock waves zombie lake the treasure of the zombie dead night of the zombies operation nazi zombies and then again more recently with the outpost movies there are too many to mention,cruel
this is one of those rare movies that make me love it and hate it at the same time of which ill speak later first some base noticesfirst of all the base plot is quite clich considering the cabin in a allofasuddennotsolonely mountain which students went to for a vacation but this really cant be taken as a big flaw since the main marking of the genre is notsoinventive scripts and plots second the landscapes and visuals are quite admirable including handsome looking good ol nazi zombies being the role models of abomination third i find the acting in this movie rather poor as if all of the actors were taken randomly out of a number of people caught by accident at one place with their quite narrow span of emotions and in general acting abilities with the exception of main male character which seems to be vegard not to mention they look like anything but students finally the music was obviously so elaborated that i didnt even notice itnow what made me really upset while i was watching this movie were episodes of great and horrible impressions it left on me some characters were annoying to that extent that i wanted them dead as soon as possible and i blame it on poor acting skills but then again there were moments when i surprisingly caught myself cheering for the students the other thing is really low quality humor every joke i noticed as such was followed by my pokerface the humor was just misused opposing to these scenes come the nazi zombie scenes which are quite exciting and interesting enough for a movie of this genrethe disbalance of good and bad things in this movie led me to give it only 5 stars which is mostly a product of poor acting i mean if i dont care about the characters then the whole movie has no point right fortunately its not a total disaster thanks to some very good action scenes and the main male character who saved the whole crew,cruel

is an indie zombie flick from norway shot on a presumably very low budget in the best tradition of classic indie horror movies the characters in the film even make reference to the evil dead franchise in dialogue and there is a scene where characters arm themselves that is an obvious homage to similar sequences in the evil dead series it is an entertaining zombie movie that oneups traditional zombie films by adding the only thing more evil than zombies nazi zombies it is an extremely gory film with some brutal deaths and graphic violence and for some reason the director really likes having people have their entrails ripped out happens at least 3 times that i recall if youre a fan of the zombie genre or liked the evil dead movies this one is a cant miss film if you dont like those types of movies then dont take the time to see this,cruel
this movie has basically no plot the characters are nearly all the same except having maybe one novel trait each such as this is the guy who likes movies however three of the mains characters lack even that it has about two moments of humour that have more to then that just a character swearingthe special effects are reasonably but it is certainty nothing most people havent seen before the scenery is quite nice which saved this from getting a 1the novelty of having nazi zombies is not enough to carry this otherwise quite below average film,cruel
from the title and movie synopsis i expected a bgrade zombie flick with some scary scenes a little comedy mixed in and perhaps some sex appeal that is what was deliveredthe plot is not overly complex if you have any prior experience with zombie movies then reading the synopsis of this movie will pretty much tell you all you need to know some medical students male and female in their 20s go on a vacation in the snowy mountains and they encounter zombies and the zombies are also nazisthe acting seemed on par with what youd expect out of a movie like this the special effects were acceptable there was a few comical moments mixed in which scored this movie some extra points and as if its not bad enough that evil rotting corpses are out to kill you they are also nazis 1 point for that boom thats a 6,cruel
dd sn is a norwegian horror movie about group of students on easter vacation in mountains only to find that theyre not alone zombies are here but not regular zombies nazizombies yes pretty crazy now the good parts of this movie are most of the killings theyre done in convincing and sometimes crazycool way like probably the best scene in the movie when martin and roy confront the nazizombies and wirkola keeps the tempo of his movie right until the end there is no stopping of action or slashing once that nazizombies reveal themselves as you probably guess these are all the good parts the bad ones include illogical story about zombies i know it doesnt matter in this type of movie but how did they actually become zombies how much soldiers are there cause it seems like there are hundreds of them and that doesnt work with the part where they tell us that villagers killed some of the soldiers and some escaped in the mountains to put these questions aside deals with typical slasher movie problem where there is no room left to work on character development and so we end up not being sympathetic towards the characters but it seems like that was the intention of the director slash first talkquestions secondnazizombies are well made they act like tougher versions of barbossa  his crew in first pirates movie where their curse needs to be broken with pieces of gold  here zombies search for the same thing in all this slashing and killing there is time for some funny moments which i particularly liked and presumably slasher lovers wont be disappointed with this title because it is better then most new american slash movies but doesnt add anything new to the genre but it does make a fun maniacal 90 minutes of your life,cruel
i first watched this movie when it was first released i must say i was a little disappointed to find out it was a norwegian movie not that i dont like foreign movies but i just dont like watching subtitled movies but once i finished watching it i was pleased with what i had seen i mainly wanted to see it as i am a call of duty nazi zombies fan and although it is not a gametomovie adaption it does remind me very much of the gamethe opening of the movie was a bit slow and did take a while to get into but once it gets going it never stops until the endingthe ending left me satisfied as there could be a sequel i do feel this movie was a little underrated all other movie critics were focusing their attention to other movie that are nowhere near as good as thisthere is plenty of on the edge of your seat suspense and a load of bloodguts and gorehopefullythe film industry will make more movie like this onemy rating 710,cruel
nazis zombies blood snow really what else do you want director tommy wirkola is obviously quite familiar with the conventions of horror and zombie films and he tweaks them to amusing ends in this very enjoyable nazi zombie flick the traditional group of young pretty naive things which people films such as this have left for a mountain retreat with the expectation of some sex booze and rock n roll and things seem to be going according to plan for some time during their weekend however when a taciturn mysterious old man shows up and warns the students to tread carefully they get some very angry nazi zombies wirkola builds the tension up via typical horror staples such as the grumpy old man the false positives and some clever references to other horror movies when the blood starts flowing it really does start flowing the med students are quite adept with various fleshripping implements people are killed in horrific ways zombies fall out in graphic fashion its all done with a light touch and an ease that shows wirkola to be a confident competent directorif you like horror gore zombies and have an appreciation for the conventions of the genres youll enjoy this film,cruel
a group of people go into norwegian mountains to spent their holidays but then things change as those same mountains are full of nazi zombies and then theres lots of blood guts and some amusing dark humoraint the greatest black comedy ive seen as a movie its okay nothing really exceptional besides the idea of using nazi zombies but other than that the structure and pacing is more than a bit unevendespite the movies opening is a bit more serious in tone the further it goes the more ridiculous it gets the last part of the movie is almost slapstick comedy when the zombies blood and gore is used mainly as a punch line of a joke the horror elements of the story are non existing in the end as the movie gears towards bad taste braindead and evil deadso in a nut shell if you are expecting a horror movie dont bother as really isnt one its more of a gore comedy than anything else,cruel
so much better for not being another run of the mill hollywood jobby as per usual you get used to the sub titles and they take very little away from this raw norwegian nazizombie film i am an avid fan of zombie films foreign films and unique films of any genre so as you can imaging i was enthralled when i saw this filmit is very rare for a film of this genre quality and level of gore to be set mostly in the daylight hours this allows the viewer to actually see what is happening to the characters i applaud the bravery input from everyone involved in the film the film contains shots from almost every possible point of view dying girls nazi zombies and random creepy men in tents well written well filmed and a genius concept i am sure you will agreei also liked this film because the characters were a bit more believable unlike those in other films where they all do the exact opposite to what any sane person would do great film from start to finish or finnish and i hope to see it again sometime i have some friends who will enjoy this flick,cruel
dd sn is set in mountains of norway with the movie acted out in norwegian it opens with a woman being chased through the snowy countryside by zombies to a well chosen jingle if i do say so myself before being caught and well ill let you guess the rest fast forward a short period in time to where we meet six medical students who have gone on a holiday picking a remote cabin as their choice of location which sets the scene for our stereotypical horror movieafter larking about in the snow and having fun with skidoos during the days and drinking away their evenings they are visited by a strange man he gives them a history lesson of the region and why they should therefore tread carefully so as not to disturb the evil that lies in the mountains which the students take with a pinch of salt low and behold after a long build up zombies do indeed arrive on the scene and yep you guessed it they are nazis to bootwith a movie tag of ein zwei die attached to a plot about nazi zombies this movie does not fail to deliver on what it promises with lots of zombie action and basic horror movie 101 lessons not being learnt they split up get just that bit too near the window at the worst possible time etc and many other comparisons that can be drawn from its zombie movie predecessors where so many of the older and newer zombie movies have failed though tommy wirkola strikes up a very good balance between the humour and horror yes at some points it seemed like the producers only had enough money for one prop intestines and spent most of their time thinking up evermore elaborate ways to use it but there is always a laugh to be had alongside thisalthough being classed as a horror you will have to have quite a jumpy personality for this movie to get you cowering behind a cushion the first half of the movie is more about character banter with most of the laughs written into the script and some suspense but during the second half this turns into gore and more of a slapstick comedy feel develops think shawn of the dead for this kind of movie overall the second half tends to work better than the first but only justthe actors and actresses all do their jobs but there are no outstanding performances amongst them to be worthy of a mention where this movie succeeds is in the writing of the script and as mentioned just the right amount of comedy the zombies dont look half bad either dressed up in their nazi memorabilia and although they lose some of their scare factor with most of the second half shot in the daylight i wouldnt want them running at me any time soon to sum up then dd sn is nothing original in its premises borrowing heavily from similar movies evil dead ii dead alive etc around but it does so in a refreshing way that has some genuinely funny moments as mentioned think shawn of the dead but with more gore and ominous surroundings its one of the best zombie movies about and it covers a couple of genres to boot if this is your cup of tea then i strongly recommend you add dog soldiers to your watch list toofor further reviews feel free to check out httpwwwfanaticalaboutfilmscom,cruel
anyone who watches this is most likely a fan of zombie films im no exception and i was keen to get stuck into the silly funthe trouble is that its not funny enough to be funny and its not dramatic enough to be dramatic horror comedy is such a tricky one to pull off  evil dead shaun of the dead and george romeros efforts stand out as exceptional had a good go at it but it felt like i was trying to enjoy two very different films at the same timeand thats why its frustrating it had all the right bits to be a very enjoyable film but the execution meant it was neither one thing nor the other,cruel
one of the few norwegian films i have seen is fritt vilt a modest but very entertaining horror film which made an efficient interpretation of the slasher cinema something which was tried by other european filmmakers with bad results in films like der tod feiert mit and drowning ghost more recently the horror film took a subject which was exploited in many occasions in north american cinema the zombies and interpreted it with a norwegian taste and i am happy to say i was left very satisfied by this hugely entertaining movie which is full of blood and humor and never forgets the most basic rules from the genreincluding the use of a well achieved suspense interesting villains nazi zombies and brave victims who are easy to empathize withdue to its tone and its occasional references to fantastic cinema some people might consider as a bloody comedy but i prefer to describe it as an excellent horror film whose intelligent sense of humor is one of its best attributes the cast is another positive element from this movie unlike some north american horror movies for example the final destination or the remake of prom night in which the actors are so bad and antipathetic that we want their characters to die as soon as possible the performers from are natural on their roles and so they make us to get worried about the destiny from their characters the special effects work very well and they help to make the violent scenes more shockingbesides represents the return of the zombies subgenus to the european horror cinema something which was kinda popular in that continent during the 70s and the 80s and the nazi zombies from are the perfect villains because besides of being unredeemable and very easy to hate they suggest pure evilness which transcends the mere cannibalism oh and i cannot forget to mention matthew westons extraordinary cinematography which portrays the white desert preserving the greyscale of snow without losing the definition of the imagesso in conclusion i had a great time while watching and i very enthusiastically recommend it specially if you are a fan of horror cinema it was truly refreshing to watch a movie like this one which cleans the palate after so many north american craps from the same genre,cruel
this is by far one of my all time favorite moviesit took me a while to actually get my hands on this film and oh boy when i saw it i did not regret waiting so long well the film tells of a group of friends that go up to the mountains of scandinaviathey find gold coins that belonged to nazis and with that they are released this time as zombies i enjoyed this film because the story is very nice and i liked the craft and oh my the characters are just believable i can actually relate to these characters for example the movie kid except i get more girls so i actually felt like i was in this film i liked the music a lot the girls were cute not hot but cute i recommend this movie to all movie fans  a must watch film 9 out of 10,cruel
a group of medical student hole up in a cabin high in the norwegian mountains and discover a box full of gold coins from 1942 this awakens a horde of nazi zombies who come after the gold and the students the plot is hardly original and the zombies do not begin to compare to the creatures in the descent or the vampires in 30 days of night however the film moves along at a breakneck pace after the initial setup and the killings are way over the top also the cinematography and mountain locales are gorgeous giving the film a very different look than say wrong turn or the hills have eyes or 28 days later or even evil dead which it owes much to subtitled worth a look but youll probably end up watching it on the internet as i did as a foreign language film it is unlikely to ever turn up on chiller,cruel
i truly would give this movie and 8 10 but i gave it a 9 to help with the low low ratingim not sure why more people dont like it  i thought it was a fantastic filmgreat directing acting suspense building and shock  gore factor and they pulled off a goofy horror movie without following the easy bake recipetheres no nudity and no main protagonist that wins the day  perhaps thats why people didnt like iti personally found the film very entertaining and couldnt stop watching ithighly recommend to anyone who enjoys horror movies or goofy horror movies like army of darkness evil dead shaun of the dead et al,cruel
author and attorney mike godwin observes that with enough elapsed time any given subject will inevitably turn to or include hitler or the nazis and so it now is with the zombie genre it was only a matter of time i suppose im sure a less publicised bmovie about nazi zombies may have slipped by relatively unnoticed but now the variation on the theme is in the mainstreamwhen i first came across the film it was the box art that struck me first an evident zombie dressed in a highranking standartenfhrer  as i later came to learn nazi uniform im not sure but i think my initial reaction was to hold my head in despair but on to the film which ill admit was not so deserving of my disdain from the getgo i wasnt alarmed to find all the boxes ticked this being a veritable mashup of the zombie and slasher genres a woman is tearing through flora and tundra evidently trying to get away from something in a hurry and accompanied oddly enough by greigs in the hall of the mountain king a piece of music oft used to advertise roller coasters and the like and only relevant  as far as i can tell  because it includes the word mountain which is where the corpus of the film is set nevermind it serves a comic purpose which i shall not spoil for youthe chase prologue complete we are introduced to our cast of vacationing students in very much the conventional clunky manner interior shots of two cars one containing the guys the other the girls outline whos who and their relationships to each other in a matter of sentences most notable are brave handsome vegard lasse valdal plausibly strong female hanna charlotte frogner tagalong chris jenny skavlan and filmbuff erlend jeppe laursen i single these out for various reasons but primarily everyone onscreen is typical of the genre the only anomaly being erlend who provides the film with a selfparodying referential conscience at numerous points he makes references to the sort of films that came before and at his most basic is that most uncommon of things a character in a zombiemovie who has seen a zombiemovie once the intrepid group is assembled in their cabin their reasons for being there soon become less and less clear evidently they are on easter break but are they on a skiing holiday or what the only person who knows the area is vegard and upon his departure to look for his girlfriend one is left wondering if the sole reason for their isolation was to set up their eventual slaughter i suspect this is indeed the case anyway once settled they are paid a visit by a mysterious and somewhat unnerving hiker who proposes that they be careful where they tread lest the evil in the mountains get them in brief his tale establishes the hows and whys of there being zombie nazis or is it nazi zombies and is alas a gossamerthin justification for the films premise and so it begins one character after another is gruesomely dispatched by increasing numbers of undead nazi soldiers in evermore graphic fashion and thats ok thats what youve paid to see what appears on the screen in terms of makeup and special effects is at its worst amateurish but at its best competent overall there are decent moments of suspense the gore is liberally dished out and at times the film is genuinely funny there are references aplenty for any avid horror fan to spot and it is accessible in its simplicity and familiarity however the thing that prevents me from praising it on its merits is that it has few there isnt any real innovation to speak of its one of those films where the writer and director got together and thought wouldnt it be cool if paul w s anderson makes those kinds of films uwe boll makes those kinds of films and its unfortunate to have to tar these competent newcomers with the same brush but lets not be unfair this is an independent lowbudget film and what wirkola and his team accomplished is certainly noteworthy in fact within promotional material the crew themselves speculate that audiences may comment on its amateurish feel but that is part of its charm and once you recognise it you see past it and enjoy the film for what it is an unapologetic bloodbath paying homage to exploitation horror cinema it owes a lot to everything that came before it but at least it doesnt try to hide it like so many lesser and more expensive films id call it a surprisingly good effort entertaining but nothing to scream home about,cruel
after seeing this ive come to the conclusion that foreign horror movies are so much better than the ones made in the uswell recently anyways where do i begin this movie is simply a great splatter comedy it pays homage to other horror comedies such as evil dead and dead alive delivers on the humor and goreand yes there is a ton of it including brains and intestines and some of the deaths are sort of funny most of the characters are funny even the nazi zombies what i like about the zombies is that they are not your average slow moving mindless killing machine these zombies are much smarter and it seems that they retained their memory most of the characters are great i personally loved erlend he reminds me a lot of myself him being a movie buff and all the first 30 minutes are a little slow but after that it really picks up the story while kind of cheesy is still good i loved the directing if you are a zombie fan then this is a must see but lets just hope america doesnt try to remake this,cruel
interesting zombie flick im glad to see the revival of this horror sub genre even if its more based around black comedy these days but that makes sense doesnt it zombies are so easy to poke fun atwell unlike most zombie films this is actually very entertaining well done film that doesnt take itself too seriously typical horror formula whoever has sex first dies theres always a last man standing etcone thing that bothered me was the painfully apparent cgi sometimes the actors were outside but i could not see the steam from their breaths or the blood was just very cgi looking why not just do pure real special effects anyway if you enjoy zombie films check this one out,cruel
when i first heard about this movie i admit that my interest was perked up i like a good zombie movie and i liked the idea of the zombies being nazis even though this isnt original  see the movie shock waves but i have to admit that even though im a fan of low budget horror movies this one didnt do anything for me for starters take the characters while they arent the typical braindead youths you often find in american horror movies they still seemed pretty feebleminded at times none of them were memorable or terribly likable i didnt care if they would live or diethe second problem i had with the movie was that it was slow it takes about half of the movie before all the characters find themselves in real danger then the movie slows down again and things dont pick up until the last 20 minutes or so  and not as much as youd likethe third problem i had with the movie came from the obviously low budget for example the cinematography doesnt look colorful and sharp and some important stuff happens offscreenas for the gory stuff well the movie does occasionally have a memorable splattery image or some creative carnage but they are few and far between it wasnt worth slogging through the stuff i described abovehow bad is this movie well rex reed gave it a positive review that should tell you something,cruel
horror movies are a dime a dozen most center around a group of college age kids taking a trip to some secluded location where they meet some creepy traveler who tells them the mythic evil that lurks in the area which of course they dont believe because theyre cocky and stupid thats the way that director tommy wirkola who also wrote the script along with stig frode henriksen fashions his norwegian horror movie its conventional and many of the jump out of your seat scares usually coming in moments of darkness or quiet just come off as predictablejust a movie about nazi zombies cant be all bad and thats the real hook the makeup on these guys looks really good and they growl and attack with rapid speed you can take or leave the characters but zombies are what your on the edge of your seat to see and in that way works as a gory and guilty little pleasure it offers up enough horror for those fans with enormous bloodlust and wirkola also keeps things fun and light with some laughs sprinkled here and therethe plot centers around a group of med students taking a trip to a snowy mountain cabin they include martin vegar hoel who wants to become a doctor despite a fear of blood vegard lasse valdal whos girlfriend owns the cabin and erlend jeppe laursen a big horror movie fan who creates some foreboding before even reaching the cabin by asking how many horror movies begin some place without cell phone service well this one happens to be one of them a traveler bjorn sundquist tells them of how the mountain used to be a nazi post in ww11 and the civilians of the area drove them into the mountains where they froze to death now they want theyre treasure which is buried underneath the cabinlet the blood and gore begin snow references such other movies as the two evil dead films and friday the 13th and this is clearly a homage to both series heads and bodies are severed and ripped apart people are disemboweled blood flies and nazi zombie ass is kicked using everything from axes to chainsaws to machine guns another character dealing with claustrophobia after an avalanche elevates the suspense even more there are a few funny bits one of the best has two characters used as bait but for the most part this is just fun bloodsplattering horrorbrings nothing entirely new to the horror genre and is it even worth mentioning the senselessness of the plot like being told that there is no cell service on the mountain but later a character uses a cell phone or why zombies even need treasure but who cares its a guilty little pleasure that shouldnt be taken as anything more or less than that,cruel

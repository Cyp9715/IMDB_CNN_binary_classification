so theyre trying to squeeze a few cents more out of the hype around the sawtype movies sadly the ones making this movie has no idea on how to keep the audiences interest up no idea on how to create believable characters or make a decent movie that holds up for more than 15 minutesit begins rather believable with the two young girls going to a party if you see them as mentally defective and do not scrutinize their personalities too much and getting car trouble thats about what works in this moviethen theres a series of highly improbable events with completely unbelievable actors and it devolves into a simple type really bad scatmovie search the porn shelf for those and youll see the similarities ooohh no cell phone reception in germany do americans know that germany is an industrialized country and their cell phone system is much more advanced and has more coverage than anything in the states ooooooohhh we cannot fix a flat tire because we have too many cromosomes going rampant we dont even bother to check if theres something in the trunk of this rental car that can be used in some way oooooohhh we wont even try to drive the car with the tire flat because then the entire universe will explode sure itd thrash the rim and everything but it should hold up for at least a couple of miles when going slow ooooohhhhh we need to walk for help lets not follow the road or anything lets go into the dark scary woods in our high heels and no sense of direction and lets not check if the cell phone gets some reception back eitherthe movie keeps going in this fashion and if you do not shut off before the real action begins you are greeted with a couple of unbelievable characters going around on all fours with their mouths connected to each others rectums eating fecesthank god that i didnt pay to watch this movie maybe i should sue the movie company for wasting my time like thisbelieve me it doesnt get any better as the movie continues either100 medically accurate too well then it must be good people vomiting in theatres well thats just because the movie is such utter crap that you cannot help yourself dif you see it make sure you have the option of fast forwarding through 90 of the movie and just getting to the perverted fecaleating scenes that the movies creators probably got a good decent sized erection by creating,cruel
this movie is trash its a sick fetishfueler for some weird cult to get off to the plot is nonexistent if you want to know what this movie is about in a nutshell here are some key plot points  mouth sewn to anuses swallowing feces and humans turned into slaves without dignity people will say its an original idea but of course it is its never been done before because no one has thought of something as sick as this yet after watching i felt like i needed counseling or something to make me forget the entire concept on top of that there is pathetic dialogue acting and directing the movie literally ends without anything resolved and you just think what was the point of this theres no greater idea or hidden metaphors the movie is about swallowing feces do not watch it,cruel
the entire point of this film was to shock but the way it shocks is more by giving you the image with no point and no reasoning of course the film never sounded like it was ever going to be remembered for its script but this is beyond badwere first introduced to the two american girls who pretty as they may be seem to lack any form of intelligence or general common sense they are driving to a night club as you do when they take a wrong turn and end up getting a puncture now this is where things get bad so the girls are stranded failing to know how to operate a jack and attach a spare wheel the girls decide to look for help cue a three minute pointless piece of film making where a randy german man gives his thoughts about the girls in german laughable honestly so the man drives off and the girls decide the best thing to do is to go and look for help by walking through the woods and coming across a house in the middle of nowhere with a man that answers the door with the most evil face in the world whos first question is are you alone welcomingsee the film goes on with its rather pointless set ups like these which just make you think who would do that i mean there is one moment in the film that really grabbed my attention the girls are tied to the patient beds and the doctor goes out to bury the truck driver in the garden he then goes out and gets the japanese man from somewhere the doctor then tells them all his dastardly plan then goes off later he comes back to start the procedure by injecting them to put them to sleep now only at this moment does the one girl decide she can undo the one wrist with her teeth and get out i understand you have to make the film but bloody hell thats just ridiculous i mean hed buried a man and found a new man before the girls even tried to escape they could have boarded a flight back to the us or even tried to find that night club if theyd have just stopped crying for however long they had beenso we come to the birth of the and things go from bad to worse im afraid see the purpose of this film is just to make you feel sick there are no scares no moments of suspense and really there is just no point worst film ever,cruel
starting from a good idea the directorwriter totally screws it up in my humble opinion i started watching this because of the 100 medically accuratemarketing as im a student in medicine it was far from accurate or realistic not medically not in any way im only a student and still see some big mistakes obviously they hadnt even a nurse on the setthe odds that two random persons are compatible to each other are quite low thats one of the problems with organtransplant how lucky is he that the two girls match and since the third guy isnt he just go grab a random japanese guy out of his backyard who apparently hasnt a clue what hes doing in germanylet alone europe he doesnt speak neither english nor german nor any other language except for japanesegirl number 2 shows rejection signs at the end of the movie which shows that a the doctor hasnt worked sterile he scratches his forehead during the operation an error a regular surgeon would never do or bhe didnt gave immunosuppressing medication a real doctor would never oversee such a thing or c they didnt matched but as you can see prior to the operation he had them testedabout that test as far as i know its not the kind of test you can run in your basement and i really doubt that you can make a lab do that from anonymous people for someone without a practitioners license anyway as he is retired most likely fired for his dogexperiment it s very highly likely that he hasnt got his license anymore  no professional secrecy possibleby far the most hilarious error is when he has his stethoscope in his ears he has it in the wrong direction a stethoscope should be worn so that the earcanal and the branches of the stethoscope are in the prolongation of each other like he is wearing it it makes a small angle this is something anyone with paramedical knowledge would see right away please feel free to search the internet for proper stethoscope wearing instructions if i didnt made myself clear on this pointif i were a very sickminded exsurgeon i would have connected their bloodcircuit without it survival is impossible from the start first you cant survive eating excrement from just one person second as the urinary tracts are not connected either the second and third subject would die from dehydration even before theyd die from hunger and third connecting the rectum with the mouth makes it possible for bacteria from the lower gastric tract fe ecoli to infect the upper gastric tract of the second person resulting in diarrhea in the first place probably followed by generalized infection and death later on theres a reason why the intestinal tract is segregatedand my last point is the following the second girl dies apparently from generalized infection if thats the case the first girl would be evenly infected you should also be aware that dying from generalized infection is quite a slow death involving very high fever and tissue necrosis which she doesnt shows symptoms ofexcept from the medical point of view there are other illogic things the polices behavior towards the doctor the neighbors hearing screamsbut not another house in sight and the police shows up very late compared to when the screams might have been heard and how the hell did the doctor managed to plant the scalpel in the first policemans neck while unable to do anything else but crawlingfurthermore there is nothing innovating compared to other horror movies see colleagues reviews i think i made my point clear but if realism doesnt bother you you might like it although i really doubt it,cruel
this is a disturbingly twisted absurd yet original movie  and it is the first of three made on a miniscule budget gives its audience some truly horrid moments two young and annoying american girls are in europe and headed to a club when their rental car blows a tire in the middle of nowhere after dark in these types of horror films  surprise surprise needing assistance they seek out the nearest shelter  which just happens to be inhabited by dr crazypsychosickbrainedbastard offering the girls water while he calls for help he has secretly drugged them to get them where he wants them them along with another unfortunate thirdfrom the very literal and nonmisleading title of the movie  one can pretty much assume what he wants them to become this is one of the sickest movies i have probably ever come across and yet  it is watchable  highly watchable as one continually asks themselves what is coming nextgerman actor dieter laser plays the mad doctor who was worldrenowned for separating siamese twins very well as he is mostconvincing as a warped genius who has lost it he may play for some slight camp  but in this movie its allowed to work there are many many many plot holes or craters here and there throughout the movie but they can be overlooked because something with a titlelikethis is given some libertieswhile this film was titled specifically for the curiousminded it is not for the feint of heart or queasy disturbingly twisted and absurd is not a film that one will quickly forget,cruel
wow what a pointless and redundant filmit would seem word of mouth has spread into the anus of the internet and shat out this crap filmdespite the hype does nothing interesting with its premise or characters  its almost as if six thinks the concept can do most of the leg work for himand apparently those taken by the original concept require little else from a film  like working through the implications of its own premise or delivering an experience that can stand on its own feet take away the striking image of three people turned into a and you are left with an indistinct film with few thrillsthe mad scientist trope barely transcends hackneyed clich and the film completely squanders a great opportunity for subtext what for example is the meaning of a male asian as the head of the andor what does two american women following him mean the plot is threadbare and takes the path of least resistance  the pointless film leads from point a to point b despite the logical linear approach of the narrative the characters motivations generally defy logic and rational explanationunlike great horror movies this film literally has nothing to say about modern culture gender roles human fears or scientific hubriseven worse the cheap thrills are standard fare the only thing that can be said in its favor is that some of the images creep in the car the itself are perversely funnythe film fails to suspend disbelief or encourages identification with its own protagonists either instead of say feeling sorry for the two female characters in the film you pity the two female actresses playing bare breasted women on all fours and eating crap in the form of sixs scriptdieter was typically creepy as the mad scientist but he can do this stuff in his sleep anyone familiar with his work on lexx knows how remarkable he can be  his mantrid is amongst the great scifi villains and the image of mantrids floating head on a jar remains much more incisive than anything on display here,cruel
this movie got a lot of hype for how bizarre shocking and original it is unfortunately the hype is wrong the movie is a onetrick pony once you get over the idea of connecting a bunch of people into a there is nothing else going onthe shock comes when the evil doctor sews everyone together that gets old after a few minutes before and after that you get the standard horror story youve seen a million timesi watched this because everything i heard said it was original shocking and different from any other horror movie out there there is a bit of originality but basically the movie just isnt that good maybe in the sequel they can keep it going,cruel
it is very difficult to review a movie called first sequence there is little chance one will be lured to a viewing under false pretences so if a movie delivers what you expect is it not then an undisputable success yes and no as the film is a struggle between concept execution and nausea but what is admirable in addition to its fearless boundary pushing is its restraint yes you read that correctly restraint contrary to so many of the torture porn films that try to punch up the shock value through sadism has almost no blood and lets your imagination fill in the horrific blanksif you know nothing about this movie allow me to enlighten you the film revolves around a deranged surgeon who propels the old hallmark of a mad doctor to delirious extremes he kidnaps people and sews them together mouth to anus yes you also read that correctly through that procedure which involves removal of the teeth and stitching together the skin of the forward and rear victim the gastric system is thereby connected this combined with slicing ligaments in the knees to prevent erect walking and you got yourself one likely your mind is already made up on if you want to see this movie you are either intrigued or repulsed likely both what elevates from its high concept is the tension the elements of pitch black humour the subtle skewering of horror conventions and finally the performance of the main villain the good doctor heiter is played by german dieter laser or as i like to pronounce in a bad arnold schwarzenegger impression deeder lazer and he is truly terrifying icy ruthless and completely unsympathetic towards his captives he has no motives behind his motives his drive to create this abomination stems from the death of his 3dog which im sure you can fathom what that entails but his desire to attempt anything in this realm to being with is never exploredis directed by tom six and the man knows how to terrify and disgust in unison the movie does lose some of its momentum around the  mark but bursts back to life at the finale the final scene is perhaps the most powerful and affecting in the entire movie and stayed with me far after the initial shock had faded the slogan for this movie reads 100 medically accurate and while im unsure of the validity of that statement it really stands as a moot point plausible or preposterous does its job the best since the original sawtom six is already planning a sequel entitled full sequence the dark cloud that looms over this project will be the tendency of directors to try an oneup their originals usually through increased gore instead of expanding upon the elements that worked such as the tension and the allowed space for the viewers mind to go wild necessity of a followup aside this is one of the single most brazen and memorable works of horror in many years see it if you dareread my review of the sequel httpwwwimdbcomtitlett1530509reviews106,cruel
im really glad and thankful there exist such as thing as fantastic film festivals where else would you be offered the opportunity to watch sickspirited and repulsive independent flicks like on a big cinema screen this is truly the type of movie that would never reach video stores or even ebay and is directly intended for the international festival circuit this film commonly known already under its abbreviation thc is everything you could possibly expect from a midnight crowd shockerpleaser and then some the plot and its main character are completely overthetop absurd the depiction of gore is gratuitous and nauseating and the tone of the movie is continuously surreal its the type of film where you are practically forced to think stuff like what kind of sick and depraved human mind could possibly have come up with such a horror concept the answer dutch born writerdirector tom six starts out like approximately ten thousand other horror movies already did before two american girls traveling across europe get lost with their rental car in a remote german backwoods area its the middle of the night and naturally their mobile phones dont detect any signals obviously you expect them to end up in a type of torture hostel or in the dungeon of a deranged inbred hillbilly family but no they end up at the luxurious mansion of the highly respected medical surgeon dr heiter the good dr is retired but still very obsessively working on his lifelong ambition to create the very first unnatural human siamese triplets but simply attaching three people together isnt good enough however as he wants them to function as a heres how this works in three simple steps 1 you capture three persons and remove their kneecaps so that they cant stand up anymore 2 you attach the mouth of the second person to the arse of the first person and the mouth of the third person to the arse of the second person 3 you connect the obligatory intestines and organs to each other so that persons two and three nourish on the excreta of person one does all that sound slightly disgusting inhuman and revolting well it is actually needless to say movies like are only intended for a very select audience how can you possibly legitimize your motivations for watching a movie that depicts three people agonizing and undergoing humiliation for no reason other than an irrational and implausible but apparently anatomically attainable medical experiment i usually say that im constantly looking for new horror and cult movies that go far beyond expectancy patterns and commonly used themes definitely fits into that category what with its sickening footage and utterly despicable insinuations the true star of the film is undoubtedly dieter lasser who gives a marvelously grotesque performance as the dedicated dr heiter ive seen quite a bit of mad scientist portrayals in my years as a horror fanatic but lasser could easily be described as the ultimate stereotype for this role hes a sneering german obviously psychopath with dementia in his eyes and nazi echoes in his voice,cruel
well where to start sat down and watched this after being told you have to see this to believe it what did they mean itll make you sick itll make you turn your eyes away i was very intrigued i have been watching horror movies since my teens at the cinema and even earlier if i include the hammer horrors on late night tvso i like to think i know a decent horror when i see one i am so used to the hype around these movies i used to fall for the tag lines scariest movie ever etc etc etc more often than not deflated and let down at the failure of all the claims made in advertisements which means in recent years i have become picky about what horrors to watch did live up to the hype as far as i am concerned on many levels it did i thought i was going to hate it once you get over the extremely twisted premise of an evil doctor attaching humans together in a very disgusting way this is a really good little low budget horror there i said it i liked this there is nearly no gore most of the horror is built in the imagination in the tense build up and a genuine sympathy for the victims of the mad doctor oh and what a mad doctor he is scary sadistic and as mad as the maddest hatter this movie achieves a certain sense of foreboding and dark oppressiveness that big budget horrors never manage ok i agree the premise is totally bizarre but it is a horror movie and it makes a great change from the usual slasher movies and supernatural flicks in a few years this will be regarded as a great example of tense thrilling and yes horrific filmmaking,cruel
i think there has been one or maybe two other films in nearly a thousand that i just cant simply put a score to is one of those films i cant just slap a 1010710110 on it because i simply dont know it isnt a filmnot in the sense of entertainment i would almost describe it as a snuff film because its that graphic and horrifying in its idea and feels almost real its sick and twisted and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone as a form of simple entertainment it would be horrible to spend money to see this and yet a film connoisseur a horror buff i suppose it needs to be seen and it tells a story that is unlike anything ever shown on screen i am certain there is a twisted awful and yet awfully amazing performance by the doctor and you think it has the typical college girls on a lonely road breaks down crazy family andor person finds them but the obvious twist to this story is the sick idea of that is where it all comes together so to speak ive had friends and seen other reviewers call the film boring and that is perhaps it isnt exactly your typical horror film but i know i stayed horrified beginning to end and it leaves you feeling dirty that you even watched itprior to being sewn into place actresses ashley c williams and ashlynn yennie play best friends driving across germany their acting before meeting the doctor is nothing short of atrocious their lines are delivered like a middle schooler that cant read once you get into the meat and potatoes and they are turned to scream queens then their performance is slightly better they manage to pull of scared and tortured better than tourists once their mouths are full of butt well then the hard part of acting is over really akihiro kitamura is probably the best actor of the film he does a great job beginning to end as the man who is tortured and eventually gives up his screams and pleas for help and safety will get right through your skin the highlight of the film for me is the absolutely awful and yet deliciously so dr heiter played by dieter laser he is right up there in my books as the silliest but perhaps brilliant serial killer his twisted demented and absurd performance is memorable to say the leastgains its following from its reputation of being twisted and i can promise you exactly that you cant enjoy the film because it isnt entertaining and yet its the true definition of a water cooler film because everyone who has seen it will talk about it it is incredibly grotesque and disturbing and a lot of the implied gore is thinking about how being in that position would feel throughout all of its incredibly morbid moments you will feel ashamed at laughing at some of the more ridiculous moments like dr heiter trying to train his like a dog one reviewer described that as stupid but it is ridiculously funny amidst the terrifying moments in the film writer and director tom six made this film with one goal in mind and that is to shock and that is what it accomplishes i would never recommend anyone seeing this but if you have a morbid curiosity and a love for horror films than you will see it however for me i cant say whether i liked it hated it or what my feelings are im torn between feeling really awful about watching it and how unique the concept was i simply cant put a grade to this i will however make myself see the sequeli just dont know what to think 10,cruel
okay american tourists with a car that breaks down  of course they go wandering through the dark german woods you could play a drinking game and have to take a shot every time they say lindsay and jenny to each other  youd be wasted  and they come about a remote house and wouldnt you know it  just their luck  the house belongs to a complete nutjob surgeon who used to separate conjoined twins and now is obsessed with stitching people together im no doctor but there seem to be major flaws in his medical design  oh well the film is kooky but well made the lead guy who looks a bit like lance henrickson gives 100 and is fine as the mad doctor but the whole concept reeks of teenage boys getting stoned for the first time and playing a game  lets come up with the grossest thing that could be done to you in surgery thats what it plays like  a teenage boy horrorfantasygross out but with films like saw and hostel it was only a matter of time before there was something like this and before long theyll be other weird concepts that will try and top this one look out for manbaby  see we sew a baby on the back of a guy who hates kids its creepy and its funny hoo boy of course theres an itch to see something like this  the same itch that made people pay money to go see a freak show back in the day,cruel
epic faili wasnt expecting much when my friend talked me into watching this one but this movie isnt just bad it is without a doubt the most horrendous film i have ever seen the only reason i even kept watching to the end was to see just how much it would suck so i could come online and rant about it i love horror movies and can put up with more cheesy idiotic ones than most people but takes the cake as the most painful to watch pathetic example of a movie that has ever been made ive seen porno movies with better acting and nothing about this movie is suspenseful or terrifying just shock value grotesque scenes in a ridiculous plot that never develops into anything interesting for even one minute i feel sorry for the no name actors that chose to be in this film because their careers all ended here do not waste your time watching this crap you will be very disappointed i would have given it zero stars if i could have,cruel
here be spoilersill be honest  the only reason i got this movie was because i was intrigued by the gruesome concept so i watched it the other day and was left feeling dirty ashamed of myself bored and disappointed there was very little in the way of scary moments in this film other than a few escape attempts by the victims i found myself squeamishly anticipating the capturetortureoperation of the victims but even that was a letdown and once the is created it just gets boringthis was essentially a lowrent version of silence of the lambs a guy kidnaps people and puts them in his basement where he turns them into a perverse personal art project this movie however has horrible acting and implausible situationsthe american chicks were so dumb and annoying that by the time their mouths were sewn to each others asses i was glad just to not have to listen to them talk any more the cops were bumbling and stupid  what police officers would accept a drink from a possible murder suspect and the weird scenes of the doctor training the like it was a pet dogwas that supposed to be funny it was just offcolor and weird bad bad movie tom six  you suck,cruel
just gonna do a quick review here theres way too many reviews that go on way too long about the the whys and wherefores of this movieits a relatively low budget horror film about a very loony very angry scientist who clearly does not like humans yes there are clichs in the film but theres also much originalitymore than anything elsethis is a film noir oddly for a horror you find yourself initially feeling annoyed and angered by the stupidity of the hapless female victims nothing unusual there but strangely sorry and saddened for them at the end contrary to what many have said i thought the acting was commendable considering the tough awkward working conditionsin summary forget any dumb references to 100 medically accurate thats just silly forget the whys and wherefores  thats just missing the pointtake this film for what it is  a sick black comedy horror about a sick loony scientist and his sick obsessionyou wont need a vomit bag really,cruel
after reading an internet article asking whether was the most disturbing movie ever made i had to put it to the test as a horror and thriller buff i check this film out low budget with little gore this movie struck a nerve with me given that i was impressed someone would even make a movie like this i enjoyed the simplicity of the movie with many low budget movies you expect to have some suspect acting and visuals but i didnt find either to be a problem instead i found the movie to be entertaining even given the gruesome story plot most people have said that they couldnt even get through the movie because of its disturbing themes of the surgical aspect my opinion the movie shows its best aspects after the first 30 minutes no spoilers but the last hour is truly where this movie goes bizarre but in a good way as i dont believe too many people saw that coming this movie isnt a gore fest nor is a killer gone wild movie its a horror movie that is difficult to place,cruel
when i read the plot of this movie i thought this movie must be incredibly sick and sure it is but the movie has nothing but the basic disgusting idea going that you can read in the plotits pretty cheap shock value in that department because the movie is a basic horror setup with 2 dumb girls having a break down and ending up in a mad scientists house rocky horror picture show anyone from here on the movie takes an incredibly slow pacing in order to fill a feature movie with one basic sick idea its all set in the house of the evil doctor who drugs his victims with roofies or a tranquilizer gun when hunting outside the doctor who specialized in siamese twin operations soon introduces his reverse siamese twin operation to the unsuspecting victims with an incredibly ridiculous overhead presentation using some sketches that look like drawn by a child at this point anyone must realize that either director tom six is an idiot or he has a strange kind of humor showing these sketches in a movie with a tagline 100 medically accurate is a joke by any means the previous experiment with dogs that is presented with the doc sadly watching photos of his 3dog and having a gravestone engraved with my sweet 3dog in his backyard are a jokeand after the operation which is hardly shown you just see the 2 girls plus 1 guy in the front walking through the doctors house the front guy is japanese and talks japanese throughout the movie which is stupid for a tourist in germany the girls are americans the other actors are german and so they keep talking in all these languages with subtitles while the doc makes them sit by the pool or teaches them to fetch the morning papersee this is a joke a really bad one that seems to try to be artsy with the long use of crane shots and mixing several languages using no music etc bestpart is when the polices comes watching for the missing persons and the doctor decides to also drug them to add them to his experiment wtfthis movie is ridiculous the characters have no depth or motivation the acting is often mediocre and the horror is nonexistent except for the basic mindfk everybody hooks on toi wont even go in the basic absurdity of it all that would leave the front guy with everyone behind him poisoned although director tom six seems rather serious in his interviews i hope for his own sake that this movie is the misguided comedy i take it for everything else would be a slow and idiotic horror movie a lousy drama or an incredibly childishexperimental movie with nonexistent soundtrack and entertainment value,cruel
i chose to watch this film based on its title all i had heard were negative things and i was honestly preparing myself for a man that would explode into a poor quality cgi that ate people or something i had not watched a trailer beforehand or really read any synopsis or critic reviews i was really expecting a terrible film which i could laugh at after watching the film i was very surprised and immediately came online to check what others thought to now feel somewhat embarrassed to say i felt like this film had me pretty gripped on the edge of my seat feeling a lot of tension some slightly sadder feelings and generally pretty satisfiedi want to give this film an 8 out of 10 based on its production quality the acting and the atmosphere and tension created throughout the filmi dont normally enjoy horrorscifi films as much as i used to simply because i have grown tired of the cheap thrills the obsession with unrealistic cgi with high budgets and using the same old tricks to scare youthe types of horrorscifi type films i had really enjoyed were rec the orphanage alien the thing the evil dead etc now im not saying is similar but i did feel like it created similar tension to that which i enjoyed in the other filmsi also felt that the main character was played incredibly well and made the film feel more believable ignoring the concept of stitching people together into a but more so the way he would talk act and stare he was such a disturbing character i found myself feeling more terrified in ways a disturbing person felt a bit more realistic than an alien popping out of my chest one day not comparing the films in any way just stating why i was allowed to feel scared by a humanthe film perhaps was somewhat formulaic regarding traditional narratives i guess of how scifihorror films were made in the 90s00s regarding deaths and perhaps the ending not to make it any less enjoyablemy only real criticism of the film was probably the core concept of stitching people into a i feel as though i didnt really learn quite enough about the doctor to understand what the incentive fully was we know hes a retired surgeon who had dogs that he stitched into a but thats about it so i do find that concept a little odd i would have liked to know if there was more of a reason for the doctor being the way he was with his ideas there are obviously little bits and bobs here or there where i think but in real life police wouldnt do that etc but i always try to let that go in a filmi also think the title of the film immediately gives it a bad stigma as i said i was expecting to watch something more like giant cobra vs komodo dragon or sharktopus or something i think had the film kept the same actors and atmosphere but perhaps changed what the doctor was doing to people this film would have received a much better response as i can understand to a point why people would be in a bit of an uproar about what you see but then again would the surgeon be as disturbing as a character if he hadnt done something as outrageous who knows if you want to watch this film go into it open minded i dont think it is as bad as people are saying but maybe thats because i was expecting something horrendous the operation looked very realistic as well and i really felt the actual production of the film was to a high standard but if you want a horrorscifi film which creates suspense and tension and leaves you not having to worry about something jumping out at you every five seconds you might enjoy this,cruel
where to beginthe plot of this movie is terribly overwrought having been done any number of times two attractive young women are alone and get captured by some crazy guy he does bad things to them this movie takes it a step beyond thatmany horror movies have the victims fight back against the bad guy typically to no avail in this movie the bad guy is human and thus is vulnerable to any of the hundreds of ways to kill him that the victims had at any given timethe main character lindsay escapes from her four point hospital restraints just before the evil doctor can sedate her she does this in about ten seconds why she didnt think to do that during any of the previous eight hours or so is beyond me its not like she was in the hospital for a procedure she knew that she was in a really bad situation but doesnt bother trying to escape until the last minute when she does free herself she runs through the house bleeding a sobbing despite having an iv stand right next to her it would have been a far more interesting film if she had bludgeoned the doctor right then and therelater after the three victims are connected they finally fight back with the japanese man stabbing the doctor in the knee with a scalpel he then takes a bite out of the doctors neck because obviously cutting his throat would have been way too smartim not saying that the heroes should always win but they should demonstrate at least the reasoning capacity of a chimp for some reason though this movies victims apparently lack basic intelligence even well before the really bad things start to happen and also appear to lack any kind of fight instinctfor a complete list of things wrong with this film see every other review,cruel
i must say that i had expected something more from this movie as all people said it was so gross disturbing and twisted well hardly so there are far more disturbing movies out there wasnt that badsure the concept idea of connecting three individuals together in that matter is twisted but it hardly qualified to be as gross as people made it out to be the concept idea was interesting as bizarre as it was but it just never made it up beyond mediocritythe story is about two american girls lindsay played by ashley c williams and jenny played by ashlynn yennie who is traveling across europe they are on their way to a party in germany when their car breaks down with a flat tire and they seek shelter at a nearby house that belongs to dr heiter played by dieter laser the notsogood doctor drugs the americans and makes them part of his insane ambition to make a i will say that the story progressed nicely at a good pace and there were some great moments throughout the movie but this movie doesnt really gross out the audience and the shock value of what is going on is fairly tame compared to other movies out therethe movie was nicely acted and dieter laser was really the one carrying the movie with the stereotypical maniacal doctor who wants nothing else but to make inhuman experiments dieter lasers character dr heiter also had the best comment in the entire movie i dont like human beings and i guess it must have been some challenge for akihiro kitamura ashlynn yennie and ashley c williams to spend most of the movie on their hands and knees together face to rear partdespite its predictable story and lack of a shocking value then was a good enough movie the movie had potential for something more disturbing but the end result was mediocre yet watchable,cruel
beneath the visuals and suspense this movie is ultimately psychological if tom six by way of keeping this movie under two hours manages to lose some peoples attention span or oversaturate the viewers with shock its because he didnt make the invitation to his mindset alluring enough but this movie is an invitation nonetheless and he would probably prefer we stay much longerits too easy to get lost in the kneejerk reaction of how this movie must eventually play out but i find myself moving past that and trying to put myself into their shoes all three pairs i first say that there wasnt any hate on the dear doctors part something incredibly wrong yes but there was no hate he punished the and disciplined thembut taking out the aspect of hate or mindless brutality or torture we would expect from someone twisted we as the viewers are left with not much to base our discomfort with this movie which ultimately adds very subtly a dangerously disturbing feeling where does one channel the mental fallout while watching this moviethe doctor even takes on a jovial mode as he tries to motivate them to walk in unison definitely not someone who hates people like he states in the beginning he approaches the segments with care enough to heal them and not leave them neglected a good owner he even buried the previous attempt his sweet threedog and left a pretty expensive headstone like i said not hateful in the leastwhat i found myself thinking about is how the directors use of madness has a way of drowning out the things the doesnt need so there is some clarity given to them the madness reveals their basic needs bsegment will give up anything to not be put through that ordeal not said explicitly but other things suddenly not as valuable ie money csegment wants her mom asegment confesses his subpar life and wants to be human again all noble things when done voluntarily when done under madness of becoming the i think the realization of what we really need just hits home for them to the fact that asegment feels that the only way to left for him to feel human is to dieit disturbs me that i cant find any hate for this doctor and its scary to be invited to tom sixs head wondering what this movie may have demanded of him to create i say we can always decline the invite to delve deeper into that thought process but it would be wrong to label this movie as his gratuitous way to live out this weird fantasy that maybe the doctors agenda but not the directors definitely worth a second lookps if you dont like my review watch it for the sake of seeing how this unravels you know you want to,cruel
a slow moving terribly boring sadist moviethere is no gore no horror no thrill no special effects nothingalso i guess there wouldnt even be enough sadism or porn for sadism lovers just pure stupiditya pure waste of time and money so better go buy yourself a coffee or just go out and get some fresh aireither imdb really needs to scrutinize there reviewing mechanism or something has really gone terribly wrong in the human evolutionary processany two individuals can be surgically stitched together in any number of ways you dont need to mention 100  medically accurate for that the thing created here though stitched accurately is totally stupendous and sadist and definitely not a new species it just is 3 individuals sadistically or rather stupidly stitched together asstomouthfor those who still wish to watch this one you have been warned,cruel
i decided to give in and watch bluray this morning ive been watching plenty of bad movies for fun lately the last ones ive seen were the worst horror movie ever made troll 2 and the room all very fun and entertaining bad movies but was the opposite of fun and entertainingi went in with no expectations and ended up just screaming at my tv for an hour and a half i havent seen so much stupidity in a horror movie since hostel rob zombies halloween martyrs gutterballs and return to sleepaway camp its rare for me to hate a movie only minutes into it but this gave me no choice it starts with an old german man who looks like butthead with a little beavis bone structure hes sitting in his car early in the morning and looking at pictures of what appears to be dogs sniffing each other butts then a truck stops behind his parked car the truck driver walks to a chain link fence in a very public area with several dozen cars passing by the second so he can go number 2 the german man takes a rifle out of his car tries to conceal it under his coat and nonchalantly walks behind the truck driver shoots him and we see the opening title im not sure how there were no witness or anyone who heard the shotthe main plot is about two obnoxious american girls on vacation in germany who want to attend a party they leave their room and drive through the woods in the middle of nowhere when they suddenly get a flat tire they have no idea how to change a tire so they start bickering and crying for minutes while an old pervert who speaks no english pulls up to harass them eventually they wander through the woods while screaming at each other and saying their names in every sentence because i guess thats how people talk they do find a house so they knock and butthead answers the door and invites them in he then gives them drugged water freaks out when one girl spills her glass demands she drinks more water and eventually he gets suspicious enough for the girls to worry but by then theyre already drugged they wake up in restraints only to find out that the doctor is going to kill the trucker because he isnt a tissue match he leaves and comes back with a japanese guy that is the very depth of this character the only thing he ever does in the entire movie is screams in japanese at the top of his lungs when he has the three people he needs he shows a slide show of his evil mad scientist plan to create a medical experiment that makes absolutely no sense and has no practical applicationfor a while not much is really going on aside from dr butthead ranting and acting like an idiot and the three victims crying like babies that need a diaper change on the day of surgery one girl tries to escape and its one of the most pathetic escapes i have ever seen its logic hurdle over logic hurdle like refusing to leave through the front door and steal the doctors car eventually the doctor catches the girl and makes her the middle of he the surgery scene is incredibly boring you see some teeth pulled off screen and theres a circular incision that is barely shown that is as gory as this movie ever gets 1963s blood feast had a ton of gore and while looking laughably bad almost 50 years later it is much more gruesome than 46 minutes into the movie you see the actual which is three people with stitch effects on their faces and tons of bandages the doctor parades them around the house tries to teach them tricks makes the front guy eat out of a dog dish screams at them a lot and the three of them do the usual routine of crying and the japanese guy screaming in japanesethere isnt any more plot i can reveal without spoiling the movie but it only gets stupider by the end it just creates a void where any sense of logic or humanity should be the movie is just very boring nothing much happens there is just barely enough violence for an r rating little nudity no real plot no characters or development and just a very dull movie i think what could have saved this movie is just taking the idea and making it into more of a comedy like replace the german doctor with tommy wiseau or the iron sheik and replace one of the girls with someone like paris hilton just outright spoof your own movie and it could have some watchable content there is just nothing in this movie that i can possibly recommend it isnt the worst movie manos the hands of fate and birdemic shock and terror were much worse and a lot more boring just goes nowhere and doesnt even make any attempt at being an interesting or original movie,cruel
it is very hard to write a review for a film like this a film which is completely unrealistic poorly written and directedbasically a mad german doctor wants to try an experiment create a he had already tried the same experiment with 3 dogs but they didnt survivethe crazy doctor is very lucky in fact as soon as the movie start 2 young american girls on holiday and up into his house he also find a japanese guy the film doesnt explain how and where after having sedate them the doctor sews the 3 people togetheri actually wanted give 0 stars but apparently it is impossible so i give 1 star,cruel
so i found out about this movie from a dutch friend and i just have to comment on this movie first of all i think the idea itself is bold daring and quite creative but reckless no matter how creative and boldly disturbing the concept of making a is in such a way for it to be quite an attentiongrabbing horror movie it is still using the usual cliche storyline which is not creative and moreover this is just not consumable as a movie id say to tom six to keep that idea of his as an inside joke no need to make visuals and share it theres this thin line between omg thats gross im gonna keep watching and what the put that away man which makes the latter should not be shown for large consumption personally tho i think itd be more successful when treated as a comedy instead still yuck nevermind that anyway i dont see why i should criticize on more aspects of the movie and i dont need to give spoilers and the only thing that crosses my mind to sum it up is hitler meets two girls one cup and as for the rating sorry i was even reluctant to give that one star just no,cruel
i will at least give this a 3 since they tried i mean they made a movie what did you do659pm  i received a text message from an old friend im watching im really creeped out by the concept of the movie terrible terrible u gotta watch it dont look it up just see itafter watching it i drove home at midnight and almost had to pull over cause i thought i was gonna puke but i felt the same way after being tricked into seeing 2girls1cup and other awful imagesi agree that the characters all lack any depth o hai japanese guy with playboy tattoo but some people seem to be curious about why the doctor does what he does i didnt get a mad scientist vibe from this character at all as others do the first scene of him caressing the picture of his dogs  obviously some kind of strange fixation and when our girls ask him do you live here with your wife he says something like no i hate human beings isnt that reason enough he sees us as dogs but again due to bad writing we are never sure if hes creating a creature out of passion or if this is just torture for the humans he apparently hatesthe blown up images of siamese twins around his home might offer some insight though it seems as if his career and skill revolved for years around separating beings to save their lives now he wishes to put beings together and destroy them instead1147pm  i replied to above text message dude i fckin hate you for recommending that movie to me,cruel
i was expecting more of this movie when i first saw the trailer i was hoping for an original movie that was somehow different from the standard horror movie but the movie was boring and when i saw it i was hoping to see something beside the girls screaming and the dude shoutingi felt like half of the movie all we saw and heard was the two american girls screaming and in the other half all we saw was the just standing there looking dumb so all in all i think that the movie was boring and not at all interesting i will admit that it was a new story but the writer should have made the movie into a little less screaming and shouting and more talking instead i know the girls must be terrified in the movie but please weve seen enough screaming in horror movies and why cant they understand that screaming doesnt help a bit,cruel
as was stated in previous reviews this movie is senselessly grotesque and has no true pointbut most horror movies dont need a point it had a very twisted yet very unique plot how many people have redone the whole damsel in distress horror movie the monster tearing people apart has been done to death i understand that six meant this as a dig in response to getting such poor reviews beforebut it really is a work of art my argument it has a unique plot it has a believable character in the doctor and it certainly goes to extreme lengths to set it apart from cult classics and new generation gore fests it is a work of art six should be applauded for his creativity and gall to go where no one went or wanted to go before he meant to make a statement and he didlike it or not it makes an impression ps i wasnt a fan but i dont have to like it to call it a work of art,cruel
well well now this is a little gem we have here a rarity in the world of horror a film that refuses to pander to a moronic audience the braindead audience that is expecting the happy ending to come soothe their souls the audience that truly believes that i know what you did last summer is pure horror oooooh how exciting and a little bit terrifying ill go along for the thrill ride but i expect that everything returns to normal afterwardsfor me horror is not about cheap scares creaking doors horror is about a pervasive life denying sickening atmosphere horror is pure misanthropy an utter negativity that is alien to petty human existence and that is why this film is so brilliant in its design and execution there is absolutely nothing redeeming here there is not the slightest glimmer of hope you feel a wonderful calm when you know that these sheepish human beings are being sent straight into pure hell without a chance of escape now that is true horror ladies and gentlemenand i dont know which of the critiques i find most funny on the one hand you have the boring moralistic naysayers pettily warning other people to not watch the film because of its disgusting horrifying nature ha ha congrats naysayer you could not have given a better review a more healthy recommendation your pointing finger is like honey to flies on the other hand you have the intelligentsia the academic highbrows who seems completely unable to watch a horror film without soiling its pure and visceral nature by dragging it down into the mud of multilayered meaning well i guess it is much easier for squeamish minds to digest a horrorfilm of this nature if you consider the film to be a giant metaphor if you intellectualize it you thereby pacify it are you really unable to watch a horrorfilm of this sort without demeaning it to a lowly position of a social commentary how sad but that is man for you always trying frantically to create cosmos out of chaos insert meaning where there is none this film is greatly recommended,cruel
i finally got around to seeing this film and frankly i was not shocked probably because i had read about its grossness far in advance what i wasnt prepared for was the fact that a large part of the grossness was not actually shown but rather spoken of and indirectly seen through bandage attachments at some points it was very hithcockian in the fear was instilled indirectly graphs showed how the surgery would be accomplished only bits of the surgery were actually shown the graphic defecation scene was verbalized and intimated very hitchcock were the master of suspense a tad more mad however the scariest part of the film was dieter lasers performance i cant recall ever seeing a mad scientist on film that projected madness and insanity as deeply as mr laserevery time he was on screen you could feel your skin crawl with fear brilliant performance mainly because it went to the edge of over the top but never actually got over the top ive also read reviews which damned the actresses for not being good actresses a bunch of hooey for sure from those observers id like to see them top the girls tongue in cheek performances i never for a moment didnt see fear in their eyes which btw is also another means of showing more fear than the actually surgery which was done while the cast was under anesthetics in the beginning of the film you could feel the chemistry of the girls as they giggled about in their hotel room a definite chemistry one which would be needed as they got closer to each other at the drs house hats off to this film for sever reasons suspense fear and scare without an overload of blood and gore as in other films think of the akitamuras job of convincing us that he was frightened angry and scared in his native japanese tongue while again having tongue in cheek fears to contend with of his own character bottom line an original at the edge horror film where does on go after thatkudos to the cast for braving out a fully developed and overly imaginative filmand to mr six for following through can you imagine the sales pitch he had to prepare besides our news media shows more graphic crap than this on their 247 newscasts eg there was more gore with kadhafi killing etc,cruel
not since the brilliant french film martyrs 2008 has a movie come on the scene grabbed you by the throat and essentially dared you to watch it without flinching this is what was promised with which has gained quite the cult following does it deliver in a word not even close this film is full of bad acting pacing problems and is a victim of being overhyped so much that it couldnt possibly deliver what it promises but whos fault is thisas the film opens we join dr heiter dieter laser resembling the lovechild of lance henriksen and udo kier who is sitting in his car in the shoulder of the road hes staring fondly at a picture of a canine in which he joined three dogs to make one long creature the opening ends with the good doc drugging and kidnapping a fat trucker flash to our heroines lindsay ashley c williams and jenny ashlynn yennie two american tourists traveling across germany theyre getting ready to go to a party that is apparently in the middle of nowhere judging by the roads theyre traveling on on the way their car gets a flat tire on a very remote road and after an encounter with an older very creepy german guy they decide to walk and find help guess which house they end up atis any of this sounding familiar it should  its the set up for about 1000 flicks the strangers lost in a strange land is nothing new but those who bought into the hype will remain patient i did unfortunately this patience is never rewardedin case you havent already noticed it becomes obvious that theres something very wrong with heiter we learn that he was a worldrenowned surgeon who specialized in separating siamese twins now retired hes doing research in his home lab  thats never a good sign hes obsessed with creating a threesegment in which three subjects are connected mouthtoanus sharing one digestive track heiter sees the arrival of lindsay and jenny as a windfall opportunity he already has the fat trucker so he does what any good hostmad scientist would do he drugs the girls chains them up in his basement operating room and preps them for surgery it turns out the truckers tissue samples dont match the girls so heiter kills the trucker and then kidnaps a japanese tourist perfect matchnow has all his pieces in place and you can just feel a sick combination of dread and anticipation welling up inside as heiter explains to his subjects what hes going to do to them remove their teeth remove the ligaments from their knees and alter their anuses in order to connect them mouthtoanus then just as he starts the procedure the scene fades to black and the operation is overwheres the horror we were promised  the stuff that was supposed to challenge us to keep our eyes glued on the screen presumably that was left on the cutting room floor in order to rush to reveal the titular abomination about 3040 minutes into the running time we see the yawn and then watch as heiter trains thats right trains his new pet this is a huge problem after writerdirector tom six blows his wad in a most anticlimactic way you quickly find yourself losing interest theres just nothing to keep our attention after is revealed the entire film suffers from a very slow and lumbering pace and lets be honest here theres barely enough material to fill a short film let alone a feature length movie and is this material all that original i seem to recall a novel written by hg wells called the island of dr moreau  in 1896 in it dr moreau is basically turning people into animals yes there are a lot of differences in the two stories but if tom six focused on the story characters and social commentary more than trying to make a disturbing and graphic film he would have had more successthe only interesting character is dr heiter theres no doubt hes completely crazy but what makes him so dangerous is that hes focused intelligent and determined he doesnt look at his prisoners as people theyre simply subjects to help him with his research and are no different than a lab mouse its pretty clear heiter doesnt like people and seems to have grown tired of the human race people to him are subjects to be experimented on laser plays the part beautifully  the one shining performance in this otherwise annoying cast the girls at least after being captured are whiny and annoying during one of cinemas most epicfailed escape attempts lindsay makes so much noise you just root for heiter to capture her at one point she actually tries to hide under water while heiter stands by the side of the pool theres not one second when you think shell succeed this entire escape scene feels tagged on in order to pad out the running timefor a supposedly disturbing flick with a totally twisted premise is actually quite bloodless one tag line for the film is 100 medically accurate and thats the main problem the approachisso clinical that theres no overthetop mayhem that could have catapulted it to cult classic status  or at least made it a midnight movie favorite in fact all the the disturbing imagery is included in the trailer so if you saw the trailer youve essentially already seen the entire film besides dieter lasers performance theres nothing here to recommend and on top of everything else the sound quality is terrible apparently theres already a part two in the works with a 12 segment meh skip this one and go watch martyrs again,cruel
the very idea of this film is so sick and twisted it actually made me nauseas just thinking about it the films main idea is the best thing that it has going for it past that it will all depend on your imagination i was actually impressed with how restrained the film was there was never anything too gruesome or exploitative even the stomach churning feed her scene is mostly left to suggestion the acting isnt great at the beginning but once the girls are sewn mouth to ass its obvious they were cast for their ability to show absolute terror and disgust its the kind of situation you never want to think about not just because of how disgusting it is but how helpless you become and how degrading it must all feel never boring and probably made more of an impact than i would like to admit,cruel
this movie was ridiculous it wasnt close to a good horror thriller suspense movie it was a downright stupid movie and whoever actually made this move was well i cant come up with a word yes the title of the movie and concept of the movie was very intriguing for a horror fan it could have been a great movie if it had been done in an entirely different way i am a true horrorthriller fan and i couldnt persuade myself to stick it out and watch it based on the title of the movie i expected to see a hideoushorrific transformation of a human to a monster dont waste your time as this is far from that idea very very disappointed and i have no idea how this movie got rated over a 1 awful just my opinion,cruel
one joke horror film about a doctor who sews three people together mouth to anuswell kind of he does it because he can it serves no purposeand once it created it just kneels thereultimate artificially created cult horror film is sure to split the horror community since some are going to find it cool in some form while most are going to find it really stupidi find it really stupidwhat the heck did ifc think when they picked it up sure theyll make some cash but theres a limit since the number of suckers liable to pony up will be small most will borrow it from friends then again many will be like me and get it on ifc in theaters for potentially no extra cashplot holes there are chasmsthe is just three people on their hands and knees with faces in butts and once the is created about half way into the film it doesnt do anything it just sits there because its so stupid its impossible to do anything with it beyond creating it seriously for 95 of its screen time it just sits there its trying to be funnier than scary i mean teaching the to fetch but at the same time why worse its got long dull scenes where nothing happensits a ten minute film stretched to 90 minutes seriously as a ten minute film in an anthology of body horror films this would have been chilling as a 90 minute horror film is a snoozerhow they are getting a sequel when everyone is pretty much dead at the end is beyond mea rip offa waste of time,cruel
the one word that comes to mind about this film is sick this film should never had been made the script should have been destroyed as this should never had been made 2 american girls break down as there tyre blows out the stumble through the woods and after an hours being lost in the woods find a house inside the house is a man who lets them in the girls ask the guy to ring for the break down service and he gets them a drink of water which has been spiked with rohipnol the guy pretends to ring the break down service even though the girls did not give him a telephone number they drink the water and it gets worse from there he ties them up in beds in the cellar he kills a guy and buries him in the garden he then gets a chinese guy and drugs him later on he then shows a slide show of how he going to stitch them all together between anus and mouth to form a the man then does this and he believes he has made a great new species i cannot tell you how many times this film has made me want to be sick i beg of you if you like sick films this is the one for you and you are not a normal person  you too are sick if you are squeamish in any way do not watch the director and film board should not have let this film out for general release i will do what i can to get this film banned from all countries starting in the uk,cruel
i have to admit i wasnt really all that stoked to see i had heard about it when it first came out and while it sounded interesting it really didnt strike me as my cup of tea several months later i found myself snowbound with my two best friends over winter break with all of us sick with the flu to slow the insanity one of them proposed watching after hearing about it from his dad that morning being exceptionally sick  blazed as hell my other friend and i decided it was a better option then moving downstairs that was when things started to get weirdthe film itself was definitely worth sitting through from start to finish while i normally dont think much about the jokes that my friends and i make during films this movie in particular sticks out in my head for some of the odd remarks that you really could not use in any other situation dude 50 says that she is going to be in the middle among others tom six did a good job of constructing the perfect twin horrorfilmstrawwomenthatyouhavetohate the movie also did a great job of burning into my head what has to be the greatest one liner of all time feed her all in all i would describe this as a okay movie that i personally would never want to see again but it was fairly well done and i have to admit that ive never seen anything remotely like it beforei think its worth pointing out that does the same thing as texas chainsaw massacre in that while people remember it as being a disgusting and violent film its practically bloodless honestly if you can get past the fact that this is a movie about a mad scientist that sews people together mouthtoanus then you can watch it the premise is the hardest thing you have to swallow,cruel
ive been a horror fan all of my life and love the thrill of being scared but was sickened and depressed by this movie i called my sister another horror fan and pleaded with her not to watch or let her kids watch for some inexplicable reason i was compelled to see it through to the end and was truly sorry i did its been over a month and i still have nightmaresi cant remember seeing any other flick that has been so repulsive  there was no entertainment value and really no point to it from what ive read the idea for this movie arose during a conversation about a deserving punishment for child molesters well maybe i can relate to that and could conceivably derive some sick sense of justice from seeing hitler and his evil cohorts mutilated in such a fashion but the victims in this movie were totally undeserving of their fatethis was totally unsatisfying as entertainment just sick,cruel
the first i heard of this film was the various campaigns to get it banned so when watching it i expected the sort of film which would push the boundaries of horror to a new level the only boundary it did push was my ability to stay awake whilst watching itit would seem that the writer has come up with the concept of a then spent the rest of the film trying to come up with some halfarsed attempt at some sort of storyline to accommodate this the storyline is so full of holes it is nearly nonexistent and in true honesty nothing actually happens at allthe film fails to shock or keep the viewer interested at all and i think that instead of watching the sequel ill dedicate my time to eagerly watching paint dry,cruel
i honestly dont understand what the big fuss is about this movie ive had countless people tell me that its oh so bad its the worst thing ive ever witnessed this movie shouldnt have even been made i vomited watching it news flash1 you dont see anything aside from a nipple or two the entire operation wasnt shown aside from one or two surgical incisions2 the whole waste product being used as food bit was shown once and by shown it was just the japanese guy praying while the german guy got his jollies all this worst movie ever made is utter nonsense by retrospect cannibal holocaust a serbian film or even twilight were more disturbing not by much but still i rate their frights higher than for everyone thats seeing all these reviews about it being horrible suck it up honestly its not that bad when my friend and i had finished watching it all we could think about was how the scientist looked really excited about his injections in fact we were laughing by the end of it 710 good comedy and no this isnt a joke review im being dead serious,cruel
the first sequence 2009  12 out of 4 a couple dumb american girls ashley c williams ashlynn yennie are on a road trip in germany when they head out to a party but suffer a flat tire they decide to get out and walk and soon find themselves inside the home of dr heiter dieter laser who drugs them and then takes them hostage he captures another man and starts his dream operation of making a theres a lot of hype going around about this film being the most shocking disturbing and outrageous horror movie in decades but dont believe it this isnt an exploitation movie so dont expect any gore shocking violence or disgusting situations based around what actually takes place in the film for the most part this is a pretty straightforward film that goes by the less is more belief yes what these three people go through is horrific but the film doesnt try to exploit the situation so those just looking for scenes of gross shocks are going to be disappointed i think for the most part the film works because its simply too original not to the idea of putting three humans together butt to mouth to create a dog that can walk around with its master the doctor and take orders is a dark matter but its interesting the basic idea of this taking place is rather ridiculous and the film knows that and thats why we get some dark humor from time to time this starts early on when the girls first get stranded as a perverted german man drives up to them talking dirty the film also falls into some very stupid moments like who and why the girls end up at the house they are on a road which they could follow to get back to town or at least find someone yet they decide to walk through the woods where theyre bound to get lost why would they be dumb enough to walk through the woods because if they had done the smart thing the movie would be over as i said this movie is rather tame in terms of violence and gore but i found this to be rather refreshing the director constantly keeps us off guard because there are times when he throws things in that we wouldnt expect take for example the scene where the two police come to ask the doctor if he knows about the missing girls in most movies the person would act innocent and make sure not to raise any suspicion not here as our man has a meltdown and makes sure that the police will come back the visual site of is actually pretty good and i give all three actors credit for making it work i really didnt care for any of them in their human roles especially the two girls but as one long creature they work laser on the other hand is rather brilliant as the coldness he brings to the role really makes it work yet at the same time theres just something about him where you never really hate him strange that someone so evil could be so cold that it pretty much numbs you to the horror hes doing its certainly a very good performance but dont expect him to be welcomed at next years oscars the movie isnt going to appeal to everyone but i do think the subject matter is going to keep people away who would probably find themselves into the movie more than theyd expect,cruel
sometimes in life you have to make a stand even when its unpopular to do sowe here in the usa and in many other countries have become societies where just about anything goes in the name of entertainment or making a profit you want to play a game where you can blow off peoples heads then watch the blood squirt in high definition  no problem you can buy a variety of them easily you want to see porn films where the actress pretends to be underage or that she is getting raped mercilessly its out there you like snuff films they have simulated ones of those too for your viewing pleasure probably even real ones if you look hard enough there are even films of women and men having sex with animals for those of you into that i suppose the people that watch and support these films justify it by thinking hey im not doing it myselfim just watching someone else do it but what does that say about you as an individual if this is where you seek entertainment and a sense of fun these films are all an insult to human dignity something you would think wed all have a common ground to stand against how could they instead become something viewed for enjoyment this film reminds me of the various medical atrocities the nazis inflicted on unfortunate prisoners even the doctor in it is a german i wont list those atrocities here but they were real they happened they werent fictional or simulated if you could get your hands on actual films of those nazi experiments and there outcomes would you watch them for fun is squirming uncomfortably at a visual assault to your sense of right and wrong a thrill for you does that thrill justify whatever you are watching if so you might consider some therapy to find out why that feeling watching the suffering of others is a pleasure for you what if a victim in those films were someone you loved your sister brother or child perhaps instead of total strangers how would you feel knowing someone watched their suffering for enjoyment if you wouldnt view those experiments then dont watch this assault on human dignity either fictional or not make a stand be proud of having morals i feel ashamed to be a member of the human race when i see a film like this is making money for some sicko movie makers no its not just a metaphorical comment on anything as some would like you to believe stand up and say enough  dont be afraid if youre insulted and ridiculed for having a sense of morality in a world where a growing number of people have none do what you know in your heart is morally rightplease do not spend money to view this film send a message to those that try to profit by making them these people are exploiting human dignity our dignity for the sake of their own wealth dont be a part of it,cruel
i have mixed feelings about this film i liked the originality of the concept and some thrilling and suspense filled chasecrawl scene when the victims were trying to escape the mad surgeonits sorta like a psychological thriller the actors were good specially the guy who played the surgeon  he really creeped me out but of all the merits of these film  sadly it is over shadowed by a sick and disgusting concept its original but i think only a person with a fetish for eating human waste would like the idea of a horror moviehonestly i would prefer senseless gore rather than a concept as tasteless as this film is i just feel that some ideas were not meant to be put on film such as this one hadi hear they are making a sequel i definitely am not gonna see that one i already had enough disgust for this one,cruel
hated this really didi have seen a lot of people going on about the originality of this film i have to say im not convinced if you break this down into two key elements they would be eating faeces and stripping victims of their dignity straight away a film comes to mind equally disturbedsalo or the 120 days of sodom not so original after all same story new age man in power captures victims humiliates them makes them eat faeces thats itnothing else to this film not even fun to watch not recommended,cruel
motto behind every great man there are two great women gives the viewer a voyeuristic glimpse of the life of hobbyist dr joseph heiter whose ambitions are both exotic and daring in the opening scene we find joe sobbing about his failed past projects we watch and feel joes strength as he makes the decision to put the past behind him and to face the future with renewed optimism but as joe soon finds out a hobbyists life is not easy the next day joe learns that a true hobbyist has to make great sacrifices if he is to complete his project in the best possible way the enfolding scenes serve as a reminder to all of us that a passionate man does not settle for less than perfection joe rests at nothing does not sleep and does not eat until his project is finishedafter what is truly a great start of his project we follow joe as he is dealt a setback and faces it headson fearing for the worst in an exciting turn of events joes inventiveness ultimately gets him back on track from there on he is heading straight for success when the last part of his project is finally completed we experience joes intense fulfillment through a rare display of affection while he is a passionate and intense human being joe is not a peoples person in an emotional scene we find joe celebrating his success and taking pictures of his accomplishment in a particularly gripping moment joe holds up a mirror to his project as if for it to see its own beauty the scene concludes with joe lifting up the mirror like a trophyan obvious tribute to the many successes of the german football teambut his success is shortlived it all starts with a phone ringing before joe realizes what is going on agents of an intrusive government are at his doorstep threatening to jeopardize all that joe has accomplished will the forces of bureaucracy prevail or will joe conjure up a clever plan to save his project his spiritual livelihood you will have to see for yourselfthe international cast delivers an enticing performance no one plays a german like dieter laser joseph heiter watching ashlynn yennies convincing characterization of an american tourist jenny it is hard to believe this is her debut role in a motion picture it is a privilege to see ashley williams perform as the character lindsay even a novice viewer should be able to recognize her extensive background in theater and musical theater and her worldclass training at the american academy of dramatic arts last but not least although he did not speak any lines in a language that i could understand i think akihiro kitamura played the part of some japanese guy wonderfullyall in all the film makes for a promising start of what should proves to be an exciting franchise not unlike such hits as look whos talking now and harry potterviewer discretion some scenes graphically depict the consumption of alcohol furthermore the word ficken a german verb is uttered early on in the film finally throughout the film brief flashes of nudity nipple slips can be seen,cruel
this is beyond effed up i mean seriously this has gotta be the most disturbing movie i have ever seen so far and im sure theres a hell lot more out therenow keep in mind im still new to the horrorthriller genre i personally dont mind it but bare with mecrazy german doctor traps 2 chicks from nyc and a chinese guys imprison them in his basement and sews there heads to each others aes creating a and preform disturbing experimentscredit for originality in torturing but that doesnt changed how sick this movie really is and by the way you do not want to know how they go to the bathroom whats worse is that the two girls in the back are crying and moaning throughout the whole movielook kid i hate to say it but youre pretty much screwed there your moaning is only making it worsehowever there is a huge plothole i noticed in the middle one of the girls uses her teath to free herself from the ropes restraining her and theres a phone right in the room why the hell couldnt she do that before while the doctor was gone also this is when they still had there bodies but no instead she tries to escapeim not giving anything else away but dont expect a happy endingwell whatever this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart even i found some parts disturbing as hell but fortunately it takes more then that to scar methat said i give it a 5510,cruel
seeing this movie made me realize just how much the horrorindustry is focusing on nasty plots and how little they care about the rest if you havent seen this movie yet dont bother rather than merely writing just how laughable this movie is i do have some questions about the logic in this moviefor one we never quite learn why this doctor is creating this what possible purpose would he have in mind we all know hes going to make the fking thing so then what was he planning on keeping it the logical thing to do would be to kill them after a few snapshots of the accomplishment but instead he just sort of teaches them to retrieve a newspaper none of this made any sense to me so the fact that the writers wanted to add some action to this nonsense is quite transparentand as if that wasnt enough the doc implies that he wishes to dispose a weakened link for the benefit of two cops thus making it a quadruplet how far was he going to take this thing he did it alreadyim no surgeon nor involved in any medical business but how is stretching out the intestines going to help nutritionwise as far as im concerned there isnt too much nutrition in feces not to mention water a human can only survive for like 23 days without water and after surgery i suppose they would need a lot morethen there is the cops with people disappearing in the immediate proximity of docs house not to mention screams i would guess routine cops would have brought that warrant along with them the first time if they managed to get one after 20 minutes being in the middle of nowhere i meani could probably be writing all night about this garbage of a movie but i really dont feel like spending more time than i need to keep people from seeing it you are hereby warned,cruel
dont watch it dont watch it dont watch it why noti like horror terroralthough less  gore just for a laugh i have watched many at festivals 8 hours straight i fell asleep at silence of the lambs texas chainsaw massacre and others this is how numb i ami registered to imdbfor one reason only to warn youthis movie should be banned the director  producers should be admitted at a mental institute the movie is too sick to watch if you liked it have yourself admittedthe only reason i watched it until the end was in hope of some relief there is none i wish i hadntyou have been warned and this is not an i dare you its an i beg of you you brain will be a happier place not knowing what im talking about,cruel
a lot of free speech believers claim this movie should be banned that fact alone garnered an additional star from memr laser is a phenomenal mad scientist he barely even has to act his face alone is enough to creep you out the concept is twisted and the execution is depraved if youve seen films like hostel or salo and not freaked out or fainted dont expect to see something worse the gore in this one for the most part is implied this lowbudget gagfest does a great job of giving you just enough indications to keep your mouth open and your eyes glued aside from dieter laser the acting in this film is atrocious the two lead females are two of the most annoying characters prior to both of them not being able to talk ive seen in a long time to be fair they do a decent job of onscreen crying and looking really scared the japanese guy is decent and has a really wellacted scene at the endoverall this is a decent lowbudget horror flick with solid scenery and great usage of lighting and atmosphere the is twisted enough to keep a horror fans interest but not so overthetop that it looks cheesy anybody that says any film should be banned should reevaluate their values this is fiction and everyone has a voiceeven if its one you dont like really this movie is a 510 or 610 if im feeling generous but because it has offended so many mainstream moviegoers so badly that they feel the need to sign up on imdb and warn the world and call for a banit gets a 710,cruel
when i first watched this movie i was sorry that i saw it it was incredibly disturbing and i knew that i wouldnt be able to shake its images from my mind maybe ever after about a week i dared my girlfriend to watch it with me so that i wouldnt have to be alone with it anymore and of course i really wanted to see it again now that i was over the shock i was able to appreciate the brilliance of this movie dieter laser is amazing this guy is as creepy and demented as they come this in combination with the isolating atmosphere of the movie creates a depressing sort of dread inside of the viewer that is palpable it makes you feel horrible while youre watching it but oddly drawn back to it once you step out of it for awhile isnt that what great horror does i remember feeling the same way about friday the 13th halloween nightmare on elm street the exorcist and the shining tom six took horror to a new level with this film in my book this is an absolute gem and a must see for any hardcore horror fan it is definitely not for the faint of heart i loathe people dr heiter,cruel
there are two kind of horror films fantasy and realistic some even try to do a little mixture of both and can get away with it a little low budget film that just got a lot of word of mouth made it pretty big the way i heard of was a challenge from my fiancs brothers girlfriend she knows my love of horror films and she said i would never be able to handle this movie i laughed and said that i would check it out and i was expecting something really horrific after all ive seen a serbian film and irreversiblewas this really worse than those two so i actually bought the film without seeing it first my mistake i watched the interview with the director first on the special features because i knew what the film was about but was curious if the director was going to talk about where he got the idea from he joked about how a child molester should have his mouth glued to a fat truckers butt at that point i knew i was in for one heck of a ridelindsay and jenny two american tourists in germany are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon dr josef heiter when they seek help at his house after their car breaks down when the women wake up heiter has secured a male captive japanese tourist katsuro the doctor explains that he is a worldrenowned expert at separating siamese twins but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together he describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouthtoanus so that they share a single digestive system heiter performs the surgery on his victims placing katsuro at the front lindsay in the middle and jenny at the rear during his procedure heiter severs the ligaments in his victims knees so they cannot stand and are forced to crawl and sticks the victims together in a line with their mouths surgically attached to the anus of the person in front of them now heitler treats them like a pet and takes on the role of god as the victims want to escape this insane housethe director to me seems very full of himself and depends too much on the concept of the film and looks to shock people into remembering the movie is the film gross yeah i think so is the film outrageous yes i think its a very original idea however he states that he got a surgeon to state that this film was 100 accurate which is very hard to believe because if this was to be done in real life the victims would die of infection or dehydration the plot holes are a plenty as the doctor can take his upstairs downstairs inside and outside without any issue or explanation the doctor removes the victims knee ligaments to prevent them from standing up and having a better chance of escaping when they wake up from the surgery they somehow can already stand on their knees how is this possible without physical therapy first it wasnt believablealso the two female victims are completely obnoxious and stupid that you dont feel any sympathy for them the clichs are insanely outnumbered no cell signal taking a crazy route to a night club that leads you in the middle of no where flat tire in the middle of a storm and the crazy insane creepy doctor that everyone plays dumb around like hes normal and also accept drinks from him to be honest hes the only thing thats good about the film and thats because of dieter lasers performance youre sympathizing with the villain here folks the leader of the played by akihiro kitamura was also very good because hes given more development and human depth but also the torture factor wasnt there enough to really make an effect on your soul ive seen much worse ill put it that way this film had a lot of potential to be something special and really was a let down have a message have a meaning if youre going for realism not just because it would look funny or cool to have peoples mouths attached to a butt410,cruel
open mouthed i watched 10 minutes of this movie and then i skipped through it to the end what an incredible heap of garbage this is to my horror i discovered that a lot of dutchmen were part of the crew who created this piece of junk my sincere apologies to the rest of the world they should be jailed for life i have seen bmovies but this one is really approaching the z status other people have already commented on the flaws the story the characters the acting etc all has been said do not watch it it is a complete waste of time and money it is not even funny now i know why a friend gave me the dvd and told me i could keep it you do not want that garbage in your movie collection,cruel
alright im a fan of horrors and thrillers but this is just wrong and not in a good way it is one thing showing blood gore and the rest of the human organs but this is just wrong it is one thing when one makes a movie which is most certainly fictitious and has no significant relevance to ones everyday life but exclude even slight possibility of occurrence zombies vampires demons etc they do not exist therefore one can make that movie as gory erotic pornographic violent disgusting or anything else that comes to mind as heshe wants this particular film might in fact inspire some notsostable medical graduate to do something stupid is mankind seriously running out of ideas for horror films,cruel
it boggles the mind that movies like this get made and it is an even greater mystery that people will actually go and see films like this granted i have been one who most enjoys movies that aspire to the highest ideals of humanity horror has rarely registered high in my personal ratings with a few stellar exceptions alien being the first that comes to mind horror films often descend into the world of just trying to be out right offensive by pushing the limits of what they can get away with putting on the big screen i am all for an occasional good scare take for instance the first halloween film that when scared me half to death when i was in my early teens that was good horror achieving what horror is meant to achieve scare your wits out of you this film is just twisted and wrong makes me think of the saw filmsout to just make you squirm in your seat i admit that i walked out of this film after just a short while but i refuse to waste my precious time on such garbage i also must admit that i only watched what i did so that i could write a review to try and discourage others from subjecting themselves to this filth stay away from this one dont encourage these film makers to make more garbage like this spend your time and money on movies that leave you feeling good feeling inspired or excited about life and living,cruel
what most drives my love for the genre of horror is the room for creativity its levels of creativity can stretch further than any other genre well i think so anyways and this nimbly bimbly thought process of mine is backed up with the ridiculousness that is and im speaking for myself now so dont get all prissy but one of my favorite ideas inreally any genre of film is when the mad scientist is involved and luck be true what we have here is basically a story that revolves around a monstrously evil mad scientist and to make matters worse hes german first sequence they should skipped out on that last part begins with a couple of highend broads who are traveling europe and just living and loving life so theyre heading out for the night to meet up with german hottie and party it up but of course along the way they break down the cell phone doesnt work theyre accosted by a pervy foreignerand then sht really hits the fan if youve heard of this movie before you know exactly what is going to eventually go down so i dont need to say anymore if you dont know about the moviejust read the titlebesides that other serbian film being talked about so much this year is easily the other most talked about horror film coming out its supposed to be disgusting vile and downright gross well put those party hats on because for more or less it is youre not shown extremely graphic stuff but what you do see and what is implied is done well enough to get you squirming in your undiesthe film delivered of course in the insanity department but it also succeeded almost perfectly in how they casted the mad scientist i first thought it was udo kier but soon thereafter realized not only was it not mr kier but this guy is arguably cooler than kier this guy was a stonecold villain with menacing stares peculiar expressions and an overall evilassin demeanor hats off to that guy for carrying the film as if his character wasnt as strong as he was this film could have possibly come off as some joke film some of the lines he delivers are just pure psychotic german gold my sweet hahaagood stuff the film aint perfect though setting up the movie was clich as the girls were entirely unlikeable and rather stupid actually even deep in the movie the decision making on their parts verged on mental retardation and this is where youre supposed to realize its a horror movie led by a mad scientist the good stuff is what matters and believe me the story itself and how its presented was all goodi admittedly had high hopes for i wanted over the top sickness i wanted to enjoy the acting and i wanted something just memorable and thats exactly what i got expect a fun performance by heir doctor a and sickness and you should have a fun time with this,cruel
this review is practically all spoilers so if you actually do want to see this film i suggest that you dont read any furtherthe concept for this film is a rather good one when it comes to thrillers but it was done rather poorly first of all in the beginning of the film when we first meet our lady victims the more and more they actually talk the more and more you want their mouths to be sewn skipping forward the first time we meet katsuro the japanese tourist he is being dragged out of dr heiters car and there is no further explanation than that heiter wakes katsuro jenny and lindsay up and then tells them what he plans on doing to them after his whole presentation he drugs katsuro and jenny again but lindsay escapes at the last second and darts upstairs heiter follows her and they eventually end up in his swimming pool room where she falls in rather comically heiter leaves with lindsay still in the pool and then we watch as lindsay tries to get jenny and drag her back upstairs there is a 5 minute sequence of this when they finally make it outside and heiter poisondarts lindsay in the neck the middle is just weirdness although somewhat comical as heiter tries to train the to get his mail for him skipping to the end katsuro grabs a scalpel when heiter is upstairs dealing with police of course and hides around the corner so when heiter comes back downstairs katsuro can stab him in the legs and feet youd think at that point too if they were trying to escape that katsuro would slit heiters throat too but no instead katsuro bites heiters neck and leaves the scalpel in his leg the then crawls upstairs to a room with a supposedly open window and when it turns out the window is closed katsuro grabs a lamp and tries to smash the window open by this time heiter has made it up the stairs and is now in possession of a scalpel that had been left in his leg you would think that katsuro would attack heiter with the lamp he has in his hand but he chooses to instead set down the lamp and grab a piece of glass then after making a speech which no one but himself can understand he kills himself with the glass the police are back at this point so heiter drags himself to the pool room and waits for the police to come in so he can shoot them and he in turn can also be shot in the head back to the lindsay and jenny are left there and then jenny dies we are left with lindsay the middle piece of the still alive and then the movie endsthese are just the surface problems i have with the film but they are the major ones hopefully you wont be like me and waste two hours of your life watching this,cruel
dont get me wrong i like scary movies saw 1 is one of my favorite movies actually but this its a creepy idea for a movie so it could have been ok but the problems here are two major the actors are really really bad i mean really bad like in a school play  they convey no authentic emotions at all the whole point of a horror movie is to empathize with the victim how is it otherwise even scary the special effects are horrible in the end when the doctor fires his gun i mean cmon to bad to describe i wouldnt recommend this to anyone and btw i did not throw up as reported people were doing in theaters its not that scary,cruel
wow this movie was bad no plot development no answered questions and no point at all why even bother making it it is clear that this director is severely demented so i can only assume that his funding came from a source who thinks that shock value will equal a nice bankroll when its all said and done the story is almost nonexistent and seems like an afterthoughtthe one thing i will give this movie credit for is the acting of the two american women while they wont be winning any academy awards for this filth they do play the part of the tortured tourists very well you can definitely see the suffering and downright agony in their eyes after the procedureif you want to see people in crazy situations youd be better off watching the saw movies heck even hostel part ii is better than this and i thought that was pretty bad as well dont waste your time seeking this movie out to watch it it really isnt worth the effortanybody calling this art needs to head out and find their nearest museum so they can see what they are comparing this trash to,cruel
after reading several reviews i expected first sequence to be a real dud it wasnt and i suspect many people viewing this film miss the point altogether its like a laughable horror film from 1939 updated to 2009 standards dieter laser is wonderful as the mad scientist and brings to mind bela lugosi as dracula the background music that is played when the camera is looking at something evil is a real kneeslapper ashley c williams and ashlynn yennie as the two chicks without a clue do a great job with their rolls and they almost look into the camera and say you know we are pretty scared when the mad doctor hauls out a victim from the back of his car it is revealed that the guy was drugged from a dart gun the colorful dart still sticking out of his butt clear as day funny when ashley c williams is darted she goes through all kinds of facial expressions before dropping to the ground when she finally falls the evil doctor is seen standing behind her still pointing the gun like now there is no doubt he did it this is a very funny movie and i recommend it,cruel
as i have been endlessly disappointed by ifc film presentations of the horror genre i practically knew i was making a mistake when i ordered this on comcast id heard enough talk about it that my curiosity simply got the best of mei was shocked to find myself giggling giddily at the close of the filmthere was so much to like about this movie for instance the villain is superbly portrayed as the ultimate mad scientist i was quite impressed with how absolutely disconnected from humanity he is he never communicates with his victims in any single instance but simply communicates to them at all times regardless of anything they do or say or scream i dont think ive seen that done in a villain quite to this degree mr laser does a magnificent job herei was even impressed with the two female leads they conveyed their parts very well in my opinionthe camera work is also terrific there were honestly a few very impressive shots in this filmnow the premise as you all know is very sickening to think about thankfully theres nothing too graphic other than a few quick shots of the surgery theres not graphical depiction of nature taking its course shall we say i think its a good move  the thought of it all is enough honestly considering the subject matter id say it was presented as tastefully as it could beone more thing i loved the end it was horrible and i loved it i would say if the premise of this film doesnt absolutely turn your stomach to the point that you wouldnt want it spelled out for you in more detail and you love a good horror yarn you dont want to miss this oneit is one of the best ifc films has ever offered,cruel
i wish i could say this movie was self aware of how bad it was executed sadly i truly think tom six is not only proud of this but finds it revolutionaryhere is a quote from mrsix himself paraphrased why make movies unless they are original and i respect that quote on a lot of levelsnow lets review this moviea mad doctor is kidnapping people totally original in his house thats in the middle of nowhere and apparently never checked on unless of course you are a lost tourist undeniably original so he can experiment on them and make his mad vision come to life most original concept ever amirite so generally speaking this movie kicks tom sixs own quote in the balls put thats fine why cant there be a good movie about a mad scientist and his whacked out brutal experiments the answer there is none but there is a reason why it didnt work heresix seems to have problems moving his characters out of the first dimension and this starts to show almost immediately instead of a proper prologue of some sort the film just simply begins we are almost expected to know why this scientist is a mad scientist and why he wants to make this at this point we met our loosely put protagonist 2 american tourists who get lost on the way to the clubapparently there are no highways in germany so their car gets stranded in the woods toms originality once again shines in such a plot device after not being able to get help because their cell phones arent getting reception there goes that loss end they stumble into the doctors house where we begin our last 75 minutes of useless shenanigans another tourist is kidnapped off screen and brought in then seriously it plays out like every movie involving a kidnapped person ever hasand to top it off there is some tommy wiseau quality acting in this baby that comparison being made there is a lot of similarities between this and wiseaus work id go as far as to call it the room of horror moviesits badly acted written directed and just plain annoying to sit through it doesnt even have the camp value movies like troll 2 or plan 9 have its just all around bad film creatingbut then again tom six did make it,cruel
the new yorkers lindsay ashley c williams and jenny ashlynn yennie are on vacation traveling through europe in germany they meet a waiter that invites them to go to a party in the nightclub bunker they rent a car but they get lost in a lonely road in the woods when they have a flat tire they do not replace the tire and prefer to seek for help instead they reach a house and they are received by the sociopath mad scientist joseph heiter dieter laser that drugs them when lindsay and jenny awake they find that they are tied to a bed in a laboratory in the basement of the house sooner dr heiter brings the japanese tourist katsuro  akihiro kitamura and introduces himself as a former surgeon specialized in separating siamese twins further he exposes his insane project of creating joining three human beings through the mouths and anusesfirst sequence is a gruesome and repulsive film with excessive black humor and bad taste but also an original trash movie after the polemic in brazil with a serbian film i have decided to see several polemic films to see how far directors and writers dare to go first sequence is nasty but not nastier than for example pier paolo pasolinis sal o le 120 giornate di sodoma that is considered artfilm by the professional critics when dr heiter orders katsuro to feed lindsay i have almost vomited but i was warned before seeing this film and i had to option of not watching it but despite the heavy hand of the director i did not dislike this insane film actually i prefer films like this than those that are predictable and full of clichs my vote is sixtitle brazil a centopia humana ,cruel
i really did try i stayed awake the whole time lasted through this thing that has the guts to call itself a movie i love horror i love sick stuff what a weird thing to say and i love trash but this movie is in my opinion just plain stupid and doesnt manage to be good in any of the three mentioned sections its not scary enough not gory enough although the idea is twisted but in a really dumb way and its just not good trash either as the idea for the movie seems to have arisen from a joke unfortunately so is the implementing of this joke a joke tom six shouldve saved about 80 of the money and shortened the movie by 80 and we would all have a funny and fairly interesting short movie that would say everything this movie says in a lot less shorter time this whole neverseemingtoend movie with a constantly yelling japanese guy two really bad acting american oh my god oh my god oh my god chicks and a doctor that is so stereotype nazilike is just retarded and i dont mean that in a funny way its not that it made me mad or something like that but its more annoying and a waste of time it does still get 2 stars for some nice pictures in between and the funny fat dude in the beginning andwatch out cause germans are exactly like that,cruel
a low budget poor quality film badly acted i have seen more scarier disney films really over rated i wish i could give it a 0 but sadly the lowest score is one i have watched house of a thousand corpse and the devils rejects those are sick films this is no where near sick its like a film from pound land but worse i really do not know what the hype is about but obviously the producer loves this because people will pay such good money to watch a peace of rubbish like this really i advise you all not to watch this film unless this is your very first horror film and you are a real big wimp i would not even class this as a horror more of a thriller due to the fact that it is so stupid and im only blabbing on because it has to be ten lines so sorry,cruel
there are two reactions one seems to get after watching this movie1 what a great movie 2 this is the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire lifepersonally i think it was fantastic im getting very tired of horror movies being exactly the same this was a unique plot ive never seen any movie like this before in my life there was lots of twists and turns that had me on the edge of my seat for almost the whole thingthere was also a bit of humor i got out of it im not really sure if it was intentional or not but the demeanor of the scientist i think was kind of funny occasionallythe best aspect of is how disturbing it was i mean thats the whole point of it but it really delivered unlike many horror movies i will admit there were times that i couldnt look the last time i remember that happening was in hostel 2to finish it off no pun intended the ending was absolutely great unpredictable and unexpected,cruel
saw thc at the frightfest in the uk it caused a sensation what a ride and hype the audience loved it this is probably one of the best horror films since hellraiser highly original mouthtoass sickness pitch black humor and unforgettable jaw dropping imagerybut above all very scary and intelligent i wouldnt recommend eating before viewing this movie dieter laser baltic storm performance as drheiter is brilliant so are the beautiful middle and tail girl writer director tom six is a genius compared with the early work of david cronenberg and takashi miike thc will become a cult classic mark my wordsa masterpiece 910,cruel
considering the bad reputation that this movie had prior to its release with some rumors pointing it as one of the most disturbing disgusting films i was getting ready for the worse before seeing it now that ive seen it i have to say that this movie is not even close to be one of the most disturbing movies ever madeis not that i have a problem with that after all i dont mind if a horror movie is gory or disturbing if it is good sadly this is not the case the grotesque premise aside this is a pretty generic horror movie with dumb characters that make very stupid decisions and a cartoonish villain that its so obviously evil from the beginning that it is almost laughable except that this movie takes itself way too seriously and tries too hard to proof that is something very deep or artistic forcing a lame tragedy ending which is so predictable and clich that is not surprising anymorethe scene where katsuro confesses the doctor that he deserved what happened to him in the movie before committing suicide is idiotic his comment about how he treated poorly his family just came out of nowhere with zero foreshadowing and without any justification in the context of the events thats why it feels as something forced as if tom six was trying to portray this film as something more deeper than it actually is this attempt results in something quite poor generic and unoriginal which had zero interest for me lacking both in the artistic or entertainment aspectits a boring uninspired film that doesnt add anything new to the underrated horror genre in fact i think that it is for the works done by hacks like tom six that horror movies doesnt get the respect that deserve,cruel
im a film lover and a horror fan i can suspend disbelief perhaps a little better than others when i watched the sixth sense i didnt see the ending coming im not sitting in a horror film trying to fault the writer and the director i want to like it until i dontis a story conjured in a mind much different than yours or mine when you watch the film you and you begin to put two and two together youll laugh a little and if youre watching it with your girlfriend youll probably start making a few jokes trying to break the tension but theres a part of you deep down that isnt laughing its crawling into a dark corner kudos to the writer for having the integrity to write it to the producers for financing it to the actors for taking it seriously knowing it could be the last role in their careersto make a seasoned horror fan like myself turn away to reach for the fastforward button i think thats an accomplishment and not because of simple gore its not that its because the film forces you to put yourself in their shoesif youre on the fence about watching this film you dont need to read any reviews just look at the title the title is first sequencenow say it out loud its called first sequence,cruel
this movie is all yuks the doctor is a madman from nowhere the people are scared and dont know what to do cause all are attached to one another by anus only the chinese can eat and drink but those 2 ladies eat only sht i was totally uncomfortable while watching this movie cause i couldnt understand why the hell this movie was made in first place this is not horror or thriller but one of the disgusting idea to make a film without any storyline or a meaningful concept if you are watching this please dont sit with your wife or your child they gonna puke on your shoulders also the doctor is quite sick in his experiment which doesnt show any point of view to make a of human i was quite embarrassed with the ending that left me with lot of questions that doesnt fit in the movie itself,cruel
shocker movies are a guilty pleasure kind of like eating nasty junk food or reading trashy novelsthere is something rambunctious about a welldone shocker movie they usually contain overthetop acting and doses of black humor the first couple of saw movies the final destination series and classics such as reanimator come to mindunfortunately is just gross if extreme or shock horror movies are on your radar then you already know the premise the actor playing dieter the deranged surgeon does a great job with the part and definitely has the look for such a role he would make a great ss agent in a nazi movie the two girls and the guy who become the title character also show the right amounts of shock and disgust when they realize what will become of them the movie is also shot and edited well thats where the positives end howeverits possible that nowadays people make movies with an eye toward what fans on forums such as these will say about them with that in mind its much more interesting to read reviews and message board postings about than to actually watch the movie,cruel
i read through a lot of the other negative reviews written about this movie and i honestly cannot understand the complaints voiced at all they sound like the typical rumblings from todays younger attentiondeficit generation of moviewatchers that need to see a ton of overthetop cgi effects cars blowing up ridiculous slowmotion martial arts stunts nude girl scenes and senseless gore to keep their attention on what they are watchinghow can people this movie be described as boring it was anything butriveting is more the word i would chooseit did not show enough gore a good thriller can scare more with what is implied rather than what is shown on screenand it showed plenty surgically attaching three people anustomouth as horrible as it sounds is even worse when the creator of the movie does not miss any of them medical complications involved from creating such a monstrosity if you can make it through the scene when the first guy in the human chain cries that he cannot hold it any longer and has to defecate in the next girls attached mouth without feeling any ill effects you must be completely insensitive to human suffering whether fictional or realsome complain the characters werent believable i beg to differ dieter laser provides a performance that far eclipses hannibal lectors most disturbing scenes the actors acted the way one would expect human beings to behave when under such visceral distress and being under the control of a madman who threatens to remove their teeth and perform surgery without general anesthetic i guess some viewers are not able to accept movie characters that do not spout off catchy oneliners or that are not invincible action movie heroesthen folks said it was stupid because everybody spoke different languages doctor spoke german japanese tourist and two american girls really of course whomever said that is probably the type that never questions why aliens from other planets always have two arms two legs and all speak english in scifi of course the language barrier was part of the terrorthen some criticized it as bland because there was no political message or human message in the moviereally what was the higher message for viewers in silence of the lambs what was the transcendental message in the 5th element what was the political message in saw100 medically accurate welli will call bs on that one but that does not cause me as many problems suspending disbelief as say a guy who suddenly has his powers outside the matrix as well as inside matrix reloadedor a dorky hero delivering oneliners like welcome to earth while the whole earth is under attack by aliensindependence dayor aliens and predators being a common occurrence on 20th century earth even though there was no knowledge of either in the 24th century when the other aliens movies took placeanyhow i digress the movie starts out with two really stupid girls getting stuck in the woods somewhere in rural germany at first the movie seems to be drifting towards the cliche but soon departs far from anything i have ever seen beforeit is hard to rate this movie on a star scale for me on the one hand i give at an a for concept directorship mood and for creating such a suspenseful successful psychological thriller as a bodydisfigurement horror movie this one delivers on so many different levels but it was so genuinely disturbing in concept what was shown and what was implied that my wife literally got sick while we were watching it and i almost passed out myself keep in mind i am no stranger to bodydisfigurement horror flicks or gore either i loved alien the exorcist the thing etc played football and saw plenty of greenstick fractures and two deployments in iraq where i got to see battle wounds everyday and laughed at how corny the saw movies were besides the fact that i already figured out who the guilty party was in saw about 2 minutes after i started watching it of course it was the dead guy on the floor he was the one you would least suspect while those other movies successfully thrilled me they did not make me go searching for the eye bleach and mind eraser to wipe any memory of having seen this one afterwardso in summation i have to rate this movie on two different standards as a psychological thriller it has no equal strangeland cannot even touch this one and saw is like the preschool version of this movie they did such a convincing job with this movie it is hard to rate it as anything than superb and give it the respect it is due but it is so disturbing that i dont think anybody would ever want to watch this one a second timeso in that sense i was not entertained i was nauseated to the core i cannot honestly recommend this movie to anybody i care forit will shake you down to your bones,cruel
it looks and sounds ridiculous  and to be honest it is this entire movie revolves around the work of the classic mad scientist who sets himself to the task of kidnapping three people and turning them into a  by attaching the mouth of the one behind onto the anus of the one in front yeah it looks and sounds ridiculous and in all honesty it is ridiculous through the entire 90 minutes i couldnt figure out just exactly what the point of the experiment was why was dr heiter doing this what was dr heiter hoping to accomplish by doing this i suppose the only accomplishment would be to prove to himself that he could in fact do it  but once hes done it so what he cant show off his work instead hell just be stuck with this hideous three person thing crawling around his house sure hes a mad scientist hes crazy hes insane but he seems well enough in touch with reality that you wouldnt think hed take on such an apparently complicated experiment with no return possible once hes finished its ridiculousthat all leads me to admit with a certain degree of embarrassment that i actually liked this ridiculous it may be  but it is definitely one of the creepiest in a totally gross sort of way movies ive ever come across there are parts of it that i had to turn my head away from and the actors who were portraying the three who were experimented on seemed to capture the fear and horror of their characters absolutely perfectly in the same way dieter laser who played dr heiter was also perfectly creepy and coldblooded and made sure that heiter came across as totally fixated on and obsessed with his work to the exclusion of any of the obvious objections that could have been made to it the ending of the movie leaves you absolutely squeamish wondering what in the world is going to happen to the poor girl in the middle of the who ends up as the only one left alive in the house is there any hope for her to escape this insanity or does she just stay there and wait to starve or to die of thirst since theres no way she can drink any liquids or eat any food even if she could get to a source of eitherits ridiculous and its completely without any explanation as to why this experiment is even being conducted or whats going to be accomplished by it and yet  surprisingly enough  it works quite well if youre in the mood for an absolute creepfest,cruel
the european gothic story usually begins with a dark and stormy night this black horror story written and directed by tom six began as a sick joke on such a night but somehow ventured onto the silver screen as a mad adaption of saw the movie is called   and is definitely not for the squeamish or easily offended this macabre story is of dr heiter dieter laser a world renowned surgeon who once was a knowledgeable and well respected scientist his specialty was in medically separating siamese twins now completely mad he wishes to create a new species called a thus ashley c williams ashlynn yennie and akihiro kitamura some unlucky tourists are kidnapped and become his guinea pigs what soon becomes apparent to the audience is that most of the medical procedures are horrifyingly possible as the movie progresses one tends to believe that the mad genius will be stopped yet every opportunity is soon wasted and the victims are left at the mercy of the evil man a good and scary film which is not to be seen by the easily frightened or medically disturbed for horror addicts and film buffs this movie despite it warnings will become a classic ,cruel
the curiosity before pushing the play button  keywords ran through my head with little information i had from the trailer words like nazi doctor frankenstein udo kier gorefest cannibal rimjob the directors idea intrigued me alone since i had doubts about how something like this could be shown on screenwatching the film okay time to state the opinions firstly i liked the fact that the two girls werent the typical blonde personality whores of the usual horror flick instead you were coaxed on by grown women dieter laser was amazing just what i had in mind with an added sprinkle of insanity tom six has a eye for cinematography a step by step dissection of the subject matter and ballsy enough not to shy away from the reality aspect i didnt find it distastefully gory though  to my surprise it was more about the concept itself that shocked me simply because we can all make funny jokes about flaming farts assassinations methods of torture but to see an idea in action is a whole different experience also the use of having no soundtrack songs was great good old composition music at appropriate intervals  basically it builds tension this movie is appropriate for the times were in if you think about it  these are the days of 2 girls 1 cup man dies from being bummed by horse war crimes in various countriesetc i find myself thinking right now as im typing this it says a lot about how much weve evolved in the last 100 years of cinema final thoughts brilliant explorationexploitation horror hints of black humour made it easier to digest pardon the pun hope the sequel is as good if not better to be honest this one aint for the squeamish ones out there who faint at the sight of blood yes the images and concepts you see will stay in your head probably for a couple days but its so worth viewing ill end it like this with the iconic words of colin clive in the name of godnow i know what it feels like to be god hehe enjoy,cruel
will definitely repulse most of its viewers its not so much as gorefilled as say hostel or zombie but its the idea behind the movie that will leave a lingering nauseating feeling days after youve seen it the story is simple 2 american girls on vacation in germany are invited to a party they rent a car and on their way they get a flat tire unable to fix the problem by themselves they walk in the middle of the rainy night and arrive at what looks like a decent upper class residence a creepy old man lets them in so the girls can use his phone right from the start we know this guy is evil through and through it seems the german guy is a respected surgeon known for his siamese twins separation procedures but the guy who is ironically called josef a nod to the angel of death himself josef mengelewants to try a new surgical procedure on the girls and with the help of another victim a japanese guys he will create what he dubs no explanation is given as to why this josef guy wants to do a procedure that serves no purpose at all unless he wants to sell freaks to traveling circuses nor any background is ever mentioned or hinted at it seems the director wanted to avoid any audience sympathy for this deranged doctor still remains a harrowing experience to watchwhen the movie was over all i could think of was that the girls wouldve save themselves from a lot of trouble had they known how to change a flat tire sure they were going to a fancy party were all dressed up and stuff but they never ever checked for a tire replacement in the trunk they thought it would be much easier to walk in the middle of the night with the pouring rain on them in a country where they barely knew anyone or the language if it was me directing id call this flick the flat tire,cruel
for someone who is a great lover of all things horror i was very pleased when i heard about this film finally a new creative idea i thoughtneedless to say i was wrongtypically being set in a very clichd style girls break down in the words in the rain in the middle of the night with no signal on their phones and end up getting drugged by some random man with the storyline being so new i really was hoping there would of been a lot more imagination having gone into the script as i found it very flat and boringthe victims themselves were also quite tedious for example the one girl who had her chance to escape seemed to take actually forever fair enough she was dragging her friend along but it was so slow paced i just wanted to turn offthe surgery scenes themselves did make me squirm a bit and the overall idea was quite shocking to see but that was pretty much it and you knew what was coming most of the time as the trailer pretty much summed the entire film up in less than 3 minutesthe ending was dreadful seriously everyone just starts getting shot how can they even transform that into a sequel theni only watched this film to see what all the hype was about trust me it seriously isnt worth watching wait for a boring night in and rent it if you can be bothered,cruel
after reading the reviews and looking at the overall rating 46 i was pleasantly surprised with this filmsureits off the wallbut it surprises me that this interesting little film gets such a bashing if it was not for the lead actor dieter laserit may well have been drosshowever he is sufficiently cold and sick to have made me really rather enjoy this piece and the notion that a doctor well practised at separating bodies would have the notion to join some isnt really that ridiculous i found the girls like most b grade horror to be fairly poor actors  and yestheir lack of ability to even attempt a tyre change and then to traverse thick woods instead of walk along a roadwellthat fits with b grade well enoughso i wasnt phased by it but i found the anxiety and distress of the resulting creature rather moving and realistic and a wonderful little exercise in horrorsure the christian family person who loved titanic and mission impossible who thought precious and the killer inside me was sickand who doesnt like horror is always going to slam this kind of thingbut for the toughnuts who like black stuffi actually think this is quite well done and satisfying once you get past the initial bore of poor decisions it has its weaknessesbut overallfor the horror aficionado for the people who are sick of hollywood for the real film buffs for whom no genre is too muchid say give it a watch i enjoyed it its not an academy award winnerbut its also not one of the dreadfully boring horror flicks that really arent impactful and are so b grade you can barely remember them a week later as for the sequel even betterpossibly brilliant not to mention amusing well if you like black humour though its really only funny and of interest once youve seen the first not for tossers who cant see originality and find any film disturbingas far as i am concerned this film is drastically underrated and the sequel well veryvery underrated,cruel
im sorry i know it was a dumb movie but i still had to give it 5 stars i couldnt stop laughing all the way through it just the thought of who in their right mind would have thought this up certainly original you have to admit a doctor with a german accent is creepy like a clown after midnight if you take it too seriously you might be offended but look at it from an mst3k standpoint its so dumb its actually funny they should do a remake with a decent cast and special effects maybe call it 3 the walmart segment with all the workers lips surgically attached to their bosses backside o,cruel
now this is a guilty pleasure the movies theme is beyond disturbing you can catch wind of it by reading the plot summary here on imdb for itsome might even call me sick for watching this kind of film but i have two reasons for doing so 1 i had the time and 2 it sounded like it was going to be pretty vile so i ask myselfwhats not to love herewhile the beginning is slower paced it does build overall its an entertaining low budget horror flick once you get past the goofiness of it all you are stuck with the sick plotline of the moviehonestly they are in preproduction for the third one in this horror trilogy shocking i know one things for sure you dont make three of these if someone is not watching them looks like the film got some legsget it got some legs i crack myself upif youve got some spare time havent eaten anything want to be sickened and laugh at the same timethen this movie is definitely for you now i am off to watch 2,cruel
with about 15 seconds of actual goriness it doesnt even compare disgustwise to lets say the ear scene in braindead i dont know if the whole hype about it being the most horrific film ever etc was a marketing trick but the fact that some actual movie critics backed this claim up is ridiculous in reality has an admittedly gory idea but hardly any graphic content at all its a conventional horror film with its usual gigantic plot holes the characters never use the chance to escape or kill the villain but the loony basic idea and the betterthanusual acting put it a little above the average worth watching all in all and no need to fear about throwing up as long as youre over 10 years old,cruel
i have heard lots of things about lots of negative things and lots of positive things and i have to start off with what is easiestfor all of its premise honestly the film was not as gory or sick as i imagined honestly though i am glad with a film like this its hard to review properly because its almost as if a film like this will exist whether people hate it or not i mean its meant to disturb but one thing has to be said the film was surprisingly very wellmade i expected a shocking and nasty bgrade horror the only bgrade aspect of the film was the performances from ashley williams and ashlynn yennie when i first saw them on screen they come off very phony and unlikeable especially when they were chitchatting about usual chatter but even their performances as they became more and more scared actually worked and dare i say it pretty fantastic for a film like this i dont know if it was actually acting or what but one could really feel for their physical and emotional distress surprise after surprise the film has one central fantastic performance and that is from the twisted dieter laser like i said before the film didnt only concentrate on shocking us but it also showed us a lot of this mans twisted mind also the lack of music helped build real tension ultimately i actually have to recommend this film its very wellmade and has one terrific performance and the film itself for all its sick premise at least isnt a sequel or a horror remake it boasts originality although it doesnt do anything completely original regarding how the premise works out the ending is also brutal and i am sure it will linger in the mind still its hard to really love a film like this compared to saw it is actually a better film,cruel
depending on how much impact something new never before seen has on your voting you might rate this higher or enjoy it more as have some fellow watchers at the fright fest hence their voting and some of the comments here on imdb but no movie is complete without someone looking at the other side of the shieldcoin and point out some bad stuff about this moviefirst of all not everybody did enjoy this movie at fright fest enjoy is the wrong word to begin with apart from the really cool ideas and the fact that it is medically accurate according to the director who told us just that after the movie was over there are quite a few things wrong with the movieill start with the story that has quite some flaws there are the usual horror flaws scenes not making sense etc ill accept that but the movie should either have been shorter or have some meat no pun intended to flesh it out more thats story for youthe actors arent really up for the task either there is especially one scene where one of the actors has a breakdown which is unbearable to watch  and not in a good sense the german actors are the ones that might throw you off completely though especially if you do understand them you can see how ham their acting is which is pretty disturbing again not in a good sensehaving said all that the movie was successful enough to spawn a sequel although judging from the title and if i remember correctly that will be the real version the director wanted to make to begin with and now he has the money to do so  so maybe this new version announced for 2010 will actually be really good well see ,cruel
viewed at the festival de cannes 2010how can anyone take seriously please it is so far out there its calling long distance and sending postcards airmail a mad scientist captures tourists and joins them mouth to anus to make a why why not hes a mad scientist thats what mad scientists do mad science stuffimdb classifies as horror  drama  thriller it is also an intensely black and macabre comedy some of the dialogue is hilarious such as the threats made by the japanese segment of dieter lasers insane creationtechnically yes technically the film looks way more expensive than its budget would suggest and the craft on show direction lighting acting  camera is very professional given the constraints of the situation the actors especially turn in a fine job one day youre a couple of girlfriends looking for the local disco and getting lost the next youre a helluva lot closer than you or nature ever intendedi saw the film at a market screening laid on as an extra because the first one was full to burstingis a sick and guilty pleasure and i loved it,cruel
its hard to imagine that the german tourist bureau is not upset by this one two american girls stumble across the home of creepy surgeon dieter laser he used to split conjoined twins but is now obsessed with joining three people together after failing to keep his three rottweilers alive after experimenting on them he decides to go for it with an unlucky japanese man and the two american girls writerdirector tom six wastes little time with character development and moves this ghastly film along at a very fast clip its grim to the point of exhaustion laser is ridiculous conjuring up everyones idea of what josef mengele would have done for kicks had he lived in a more medically advanced time he looks like a very nasty combination of christopher walken  udo kier presumably the parenthetical first sequence after the title means theres more to come,cruel
is a mix between the good old mad scientist premise with a bit of hostel type torture porn thrown in while im not a fan of the torture porn genre i very much love mad scientists and so i sat down to watch knowing that it would probably be quite disappointingso now a good hour and a half later im sitting here confused and bewilderedi have seen a lot of film but never before have i seen a film completely missing a script it seems like the director came up with the idea and then told the actors to make it up as they went most of the dialog is made up by stop and please  first in english then in japanese  and im not sure switching languages is enough of a variation to qualify for a script has less of a plot than a music videothe acting is a mixed bowl of good decent and bad but as this is a horror flick great acting is not something youd expect anyway the locations are actually pretty great and the special effects are pretty good but in the end it doesnt matter what concept you have what actors you have or how great of a house youve found for your shoot if your film doesnt have a script its probably not a film worth making and if its not worth making its not worth watchingin conclusion if you want to watch a great horror film watch something else if you want to watch an awful horror film well watch something else,cruel
i was lucky enough to see this at frightfest and came away thinking id really seen something disturbing and original easily the most original and likely to be lasting film of the festival a true cult is born something of the tone of david lynch and the same effect of queasy laughs and impression of real obsessive imagery as th first time i saw eraserhead also a little of cronenburg although its not at all comparable as a film its the closest i can get to describing its impact on the surface its a horror film with one of the greatest mad scientist performances ever from dieter laser it also has a really disturbing central idea the less said the better as the novelty is part of the fun its filmed really cheaply but competently and i look forward to the sequel give the man the money so he can get on with part 2,cruel
there was a boy who lived in a permissive society prostitution is legal there a good thing pornographic magazines and videos are freely available why not as are gory exploitation films which can be watched legally by anybody over the age of 16 nobody likes germans very much the society is that of the netherlands the boy became the writerdirector of this movieunfortunately all the influences not even mentioning salo hostel saw etc didnt produce a top film rather the opposite  way oppositethe sad fact is that this laughable piece of utter garbage will make money because it was produced cheaply and seems to belong to a popular genre  horror actually the horror is confined to a few short scenes of gore the concept of the is laughable to begin with and the result is unconvincing and downright ridiculousthis does not even belong in the so bad its good category its so bad its really really badthis review is 100 accurate,cruel
im sorry but i do have to laugh at some of the remarks this film has generated ban it its sick so you must be sick to watch it etcdont make me laugh i was fortunate enough to catch this last night and i was gripped from start to finish the acting direction cinematography was all top notch i went in expecting a z grade movie but boy was i pleasantly surprised i have to commend the director on a very bold and macabre premise as has already been pointed out it is very light on actual gore but its all in the detail and imagination  im off recommending this to all of my horror buff friends because unlike some commentators on here i appreciate a rollocking inventive horror flickroll on full sequence,cruel
as a longtime horror buff not of blood and gore but of macabre concepts that make you question the essence of mankind and who we are as individuals i was anxiously awaiting this movie the preview was nothing short of chilling kicking back after a long day at work i found it to my delight on on demandthe best part of the movie is dieter laser although over the top at times i credit him with throwing himself into the role of the deranged surgeon without apology or hesitance while not as consistently brilliant as he was in the preview he manages to create a couple of viscerally unpleasant moments most notably discussing the details of the impending surgery with his three subjects he also communicates his personal angst and euphoria remarkably well nonverballythe cinematography is also quite good catching scenes at unexpected and somewhat unpleasant angles the camerawork as the attempts to climb a spiral staircase is pretty impressive and unnervingotherwise the movie falls flat i suppose that all the hype that has surrounded its release raised the expectation levels a bit but in retrospect its hard to communicate horror and agony verbally when twothirds of the victims screams are constantly muffles by rear ends the virtual absence of a musical score also creates a vacuum of emotion at timesultimately while starting off as a modern take on nazi human experimentation the abstract concept of which is universally disgusting and a great premise to be sure it quickly and disappointedly diverges into an almost satirical autobiography of one mans quest for adoration and respectsome good aspects but not what i was hoping for,cruel
so yeah read the movietitle now read it again now watch another movie cause thats all there is to this film thats the storythe acting is terrible although it gets better as soon the two female leads cant speak anymore because they cant speak anymore and are reduced to whimpering maybe the japanese guy is acting the hell out of this i dont know there are subtitles but hes still japanese they act differently and i rarely watch real japanese cinemacamera and overall presentation is shoddy as f mask is equally bad i could have brought this thing to film in my sleep diapers to hide everything pleasethe story again is about this german frankenstein guy exspecialist surgeon for siamese twin separation sewing three humans mouth to anus because i dont know he did it to his dogs before and they died so it should work with humans this obviously implies tasty things like only the front person getting to eat while the rest only gets the passed on leftovers and thats it theres a lot of crying and screaming happening in the first half and then a lot of whimpering in the latter and of course frankenstein spouts a lot of bullshit but i really didnt careyou know i like watching splatter once in a while or controversial movies or shocking movies but this one is none of the above theres no gore that deserves mentioning never manages to gross anyone out that hasnt seen two girls one cup never gets you thinking of anything other than your todolist and it just dripples from scene to scene you dont even care about the degrading of the three victimswow this turned into a rant i give this flick one star above worst crap ive ever seen because the idea in and of itself is original not good but original still avoid this piece of wasted diskspace like the zombiecancerplague,cruel
i think any civilized country shouldnt show this movie at all it is just showing a sicked person doing sicked thing no meaning at all but just make people feel disgusting i suggest countries to ban this movie for its people any civilized person shouldnt watch this movie too what is the point of seeing just how people are not treated as human basically it is just a sicked movie of how to make everyone in the cinema feels sick even just watching the trailer would feel sick too i am currently in asia and i think none of the asian cities would show this movie i honestly feel this movie is worse than any kind of porn at least porn is a nature human thing this movie is about how to make your brain feels sick when you walk out of the cinema,cruel
when i read the short synopsis for this i thought sounds like it might be a new horror film idea and not some redone crapwell while the storys concept was possible interesting this film was completely ruined by terrible acting the man cast as the doctor was just painful to watch and the whining new yorkers should have been killed off in the first 5 minutes to spare me their awful screen presencehad it been acted by some known stars it might have actually fared well the script was junkid like to end by saying this is the worst horror flick ive ever seen except for the four paranormal films but even theyre better than this tripe dont waste you money hiring it and dont was your precious lives watching it i regret having done so,cruel
well first things firsti am not sure why i give this movie 5i liked it and i didntguess that sounds confusingsorry but i am confusedi like this because it is way fd upthe plot is pretty original in my opinioni cant say ive ever seen anything quite like itthis is one twisted doctorthe writerdirector tom six is pretty twisted himselfi mean where do you come up with this kind of ideai know in all the horrors i have seen some can be way out thereand twisted but this puts twisted on the mapif you know what i meani feel the movie was a bit slowmy biggest and really only problem with it was i found the acting to be real poorsorry to the actors who had to endurewithout giving anything away i guess its hard to act in this type of predicamenti will have to wait for the next installment which i will watchmaybe there can be some better actingif you like twisted and i mean twisted give this a shotlets read your review,cruel
first sequence is probably the most awful film i can think of thats famed for its notoriety the whole concept of the film is some huge grossout thing about a mad scientist creating a out of some unwilling test subjects and thats all there is to itits not enough material to sustain a genuine running time so we get lots of dull scenes elsewhere there are random murders some scenes of overacting repetitive escapes and captures and some bad acting on the part of the participants the whole stuff is played for maximum revulsion with some truly gross moments that are designed to test the strength of ones stomachits not that this film is extremely gory because it isnt its just that the concept is so offputting that its hard to think about it without being repulsed i guess thats the hook in any case as a film its a complete failure the worst type of torture porn that i can think of and i hated every moment of it,cruel
i honesty cannot think of a worse acting performance than by the 2 females in this movie luckily all they had to do is moan and grunt for most of itthe idea of the movie although original is repulsive i recently watched a video on 15 torture devices throughout history and not one of them effected me like this one i thought the doctor did a great job and the makeup was very good i was impressed with the look of the stitching on the face the equipment in his basement operating room was actually rented from a hospital so that made it a little more credible and eerie those are about all the good points of the movienow i could go on and on about the negative things but the scene of them walking through the woods to get help is so ridiculous its hard to believe it was meant to be taken seriously maybe it wasnt maybe this was meant to be a comedyhorror or when the one girl has a very small window of opportunity to escape but instead of getting out and running for help she spends 12 hour trying to drag her unconscious friend up a flight of stairs and out of the house my goodness im not sorry i watched the move it was entertaining the sequel is a different story but its one of those movies that arent easily erased from your memory even though youd like it to be,cruel
id heard someone talk about the film and the concept sounded interesting in a twisted way within minutes the movie jumps the shark and it never comes back just how astonishingly vapid the movie is can be captured in a couple of examples two american women travelling in germany try to drive to a club but get lost and get a flat tire they dont know how to change it thats actually fairly credible given that they show no signs of any intelligence so they decide to walk to get help bad idea but as long as they walk along the road maybe theyll get lucky of course the next time we see them they are wandering through the woods the film doesnt even attempt to give any reason why they would have left the road because there is none possible no one with the ability to book a flight from the usa to germany and manage to make it there could be stupid enough to leave the roadso they wind up at the evil nazi doctors house in the woods and he drugs them and turns them into a with a japanese dude at the head of it there are tons of logical problems along the way but lets just skip over them the way the movie doesexcept really the girls dont think to undo the wrist restraints with their teeth until dr evil is standing there drugging the japanese guy ok had to get that one out of my systemthe police come and while they are keeping the dr busy japanese guy has an idea he grabs a scalpel this is the smartest thing any of the three has done all movie they lay in wait for the dr not easy to do when you are sewed mouth to ass but they pull it off as the dr walks into the room japanese guy stabs him in the foot good thinking then he stabs him in the leg thats a pretty good idea too then he just leaves the scalpel in the drs leg and bites a hole in his neck starting to lose his train of thought i guess thenand this is clearly the stupidest thing in a movie full of the stupidest things you can imaginethey decide to crawl up the stairs to escape leaving the dr laying there passed out admittedly theyre traumatized by their ordeal and theyre excited at the chance to escape but really wouldnt you maybe kill the dr i mean he sewed the three of you together by your mouths and anuses if youve thought of this plan at least think to take the scalpel with you instead of leaving it in his leg so he can come upstairs and use it on you if you read this and think well maybe itll be interesting enough to be worth watching stop dont do it youll wish you hadnt wasted the two hours spend the time doing something more enjoyable like snipping off your fingers with a cigar clipper,cruel
the movie was a bore and had a 20 minutes with jerks beginning with two ditsy american girls who dont think of anything lost in the german woods with a flat tire once their cell phones receive no reception they immediately abandon all hope of getting out without wandering the woods around themmedically accurate i doubt that for one the good doctor stops in the middle of stitching the trio up mouth to anus and scratches his forehead im no medical student but ive talked with those going into the medical profession nurses in this case and if they so much as let their belly touch the sink while theyre washing their hands they have to resterilize their handsnext theres the whole theyre compatible tested thing even though he just ran and grabbed some random japanese man from somewhere presumably wandering around the woods or something and he doesnt seem to have the tools or machinery to do much of whats needednext he only connects their gastric organs to make the whole creature live logically speaking any medical student could probably delve into it further youd have to connect the whole blood circuit and even possibly digestive systems as a person can not sustain themselves on feces as this movie suggestsoh and this guy lives out in the middle of nowhere but apparently his neighbors or something heard screamingafter the initial awkward sense of seeing the trio sewed together theres nothing more to the horror movie the man tries to train them to be a pet and thats essentially the plot afterward the cover of the movie itself is infinitely more interesting then actually seeing them on the screenessentially if you can get past the fact that nothing in this movie is logical than you might enjoy it i however watch horror movies to get a feel that its something that could happen and thus why it would be scary since this movie cant relay that realism im forced to dump this movie experience into the back of my head and never to watch it againi will leave you on this note however mr exsurgeon likes to use daterape drugs,cruel
well sounded like one of those old films when i first heard of it from some old chums and then i spent 1199 on it and while its a good horror and scary its sicker than saw 3 and that involves the scene when jigsaw drowns somebody in pig guts thge delivers lots of horror but the itself was a big no if it were three humans morphed together good film but the film itself was generally sick all i can say is that because the film was all about some siamese twin surgeon stitching two women and one japaneze mans backsides and mouths together to make one big digestive system seriously if this was made in the early days of horror we may be looking a a good film but the film was relatively disgusting and disgraceful,cruel
i decided to brave through first sequence  talk about foreshadowing and a spoiler for them to leave this open for sequels i honestly wanted to skip this movie based solely on its idea and you know what by the time the climax was near i simply wanted the whole painful experience to be overas lousy as the last 12 months has been i think there has been more gut wrenchingly disgusting movies released recently than any other time frame before we have this one piranha 3d cabin fever 2 spring fever and the collector in s defense it wasnt as gory but the idea the bonechilling revolting and absolutely irrelevant twist to torture porn was just as disturbingsowe have these two new york city bimbos who couldnt even follow jersey shores plot yet are making their way through europe and one fateful night they agree to meet a stranger for a party  how original but alas they get lost and get a flat tire  so not clichd  and then while wandering in the woods it rains they argue and find an isolated home that looks so inviting get used to the stale horrorstaples as theyll continue through to the finalethe only thing thats unique is what happens after the girls wander into this maddoctors home and if you thought you were safe the split second you saw him you get what you deserve sure enough  surprise  they get drugged and incredibly the mad doc reveals his eeeevil intentions of making no less than duh a using the two females and a nonenglishgerman speaking japanese angry fellowhis plan is to connect the mouths of each victim to the asshole  literally  in front of them oh and somehow disable their knees and make a one track digestive system through each one to the uh end he only needs to knock out some teeth graft some skin  im assuming was from the butt cheeks and then staple them togethergross and it is lets also say stupid and even for those who like to get high and watch bad bmovies id think theyd find it mildly amusing for roughly 3 secondsi think the funniest part is one of the taglines for the movie 100 medically accurate big freaking deal and i dont think the writerdirector with a name thats eerily close with sick tom six thought that even if it could happen that it would be more than 2 plausible that it wouldone of the movies strong points is that we dont have to sit through too much of the surgery  yeah the mad docs brainless scheme was successful  but not having to see the slicingdicing so much probably wasnt an indication we wouldnt see them attempt to move while their mouths and asses are surgically and forever rimmingthe rest of the movie plays out much like the first unoriginal beginning as a training course to teach the new dog er new tricks and the obligatory doofus detectives that are investigating reports of an american girl screamingim willing to forgive the obvious overdone and countless clichs for they might simply have had them as homage to horror fans longing to return to the real gorefest of decades past and my forgiveness even might extend to the horrible simply dreadful acting this is a bmovie after all mostly from the doctor laser who shouldve watched dr giggles for inspiration than plan 9 from outer spacebut beyond those blatantly bad aspects the movie literally has no redeemable qualities its an incredibly awful experience to get through and despite the original idea for torture porn and the fact that it spares us what couldve been a tremendously bloody movie though the coprophagia scene was fairly hard to ah hem stomach this movie literally should be seen by no one heck it wasnt even a fun bmovie it was just quite tastelessis it then also incredibly obvious that i will not be seeing the second sequence,cruel
i saw this film at frightfest 2009 london i was totally shocked by how good it is it was the best film at frightfest this year for me very original very scary and very very funny great performance from those international actors german japanese american thrown in one chaotic situation the audience was loving every moments of it i love the ending too it is called but it really is about us human and that is why it is such a scary film it deals with the human dignity and the monster living inside of us nowadays the horror films are pretty much the same everywhere but this one will be something you have never ever seen before crazy movie i love itmust watch,cruel
when i first heard about first sequence i was shocked and disgusted i was sure the film should never have been made and that it was godawful but i was of course listening to my friends views on the film and they werent exactly intuitive sp so after watching the film i took the disk out of the dvd player and thought to myself wow that was good i had listened to others reviews and since most of the reviews you guys will read will be negative and most of them are idiotic reviews that force the reviewers opinions unto you i intend to be most kind to this film taking into consideration about its current popularity among torture porn a positive review the plot is well at the top of the main page if you must know but the story revolves around two american girls on a road trip through europe the film takes place in germany where the girls are still on their vacation after the car breaks down in the woods the girls seek help from the nearest house  that being of doctor j heiters dieter laser house doctor heiter is and its safe to say this not a very nice person retired but very well known in separating siamese twins the surgeon takes his sick and twisted dream to a new level when he stitches his three victims together mouthtoarse generally not a joyful idea but thats what a horror film is ill give the first good point of the film it features beautiful acting the acting from the four major actors dieter laser ashley c williams ashlynn yennie and akihiro kitamurais amazingly lifelike when stitched together the sobbing and pain of the characters is so clear and well displayed that you could believe what you were watching were real of course the constant sobbing from the characters can be annoying at times but as the film progresses we loose the sobbing again a large point on how brilliant the acting is can be demonstrated in the scene when lindsay ashley c williams has to swallow akihiros the characters name escapes me at this moment in time waste the reactions to this scene has made me laugh as they are mostly exaggerated or just plain silly but the scene is very strong violent and gives a large depth of horror to the film now for the plot unlike other torture porn films like hostel full sequence has a good strong plot of course it is not answered why heiter has such a fascination with making a and torturing his victims but you can guess that living alone can have gotten to him or that the pressure from his medical career finally caught up with him in the end and caused mental affections one way or another there is a strong mystery to the film as to what caused heiter to loose sanity and thats very good in my book the plot also has a very frankensteinesque feel to it with the mad scientist and tormented creation only more realistic ideas and effects placed into the film while watching you will get this certain feel of a classic horror but there is more you see the great part is that the plot is so unpredicatble you are left unsure of what happens next but sadly a lot of people are told the negative side of the film and search the whole plot up online due to them hearing about it and thinking no i will never watch that two weeks later after looking the plot up they watch the film in conclusion this is a great film it is certain it is unique even among torture porn if i say my feelings without placing positive or negative ideas into the description however in the end i am not anything soecial i am not stating this as fact  whether the film is good or bad is up to you dont just jump to conclusions because of what your friends say  watch the film for yourself then judge and remember your flesh is his fantasy,cruel
utter perverted fetishistic debasement masquerading as avantgarde horror which im certain in and of itself has an all too common place in this ever depraved and decaying global society that being said it was also rather unwatchable from poor dramatic and cinematic quality weak dialog absurd story moronic plot development awkward and unconvincing acting and nonsensical charactersthe only thing i can say about this film which can give it some noteworthiness is that never before have i seen a film which does not possess one single ounce of worth its noteworthiness is that it is 100 completely worthless i want you to think carefully about that im describing a film which is not even a tenth of a percent worth making ive seen a lot of terrible movies but ive literally never seen that before and that is damnably impressive if you look at it from a mel brooks springtime for hitler anglethats probably why the south park creators felt it worth bringing to everyones attention those jerks lol,cruel
contains spoilerswhere to startprobably firstly that defies belonging to any real genre of film its hard to review and place this film as it is totally pointlessit tries to use an abstract concept thrown in with a lot of gore much left to the imagination but succeeds in doing nothing its not scary on any level and what gore there is certainly doesnt add to the film im not one to be phased by gore in films providing it compliments and enhances the plot for instance in films like saw but i think it is totally unnecessary in this film and if i could only use one word to describe this film it would be sickrather than being artistic and original like many have argued to me it comes across as a visual display of a directors very worryingly so mindonto the film itselfim not medically minded but the idea seemed totally implausible even to me just entertaining the idea for a minute i imagine for the concept to work an awful lot more surgery would be needed in connecting them together as one creature secondly the fact two friends and a random japanese guy are perfectly compatible seemed awfully convenient that they all happened to be lost in the same woods at roughly the same time and ended up at his house the detectives didnt quite fit the bill either i cant imagine the detective who found the trio would just run off leaving them without radioing for a medical and or more policeonce they were sown together nothing really happened i assume lindsay who was in the middle was eventually found and somehow detached but it doesnt tie up any ends not that it really matteredbeing honest this film is utter garbage that isnt worth anybodies time or patience and should be avoided at all costs i hear there is going to be a squeal that is going to show all the gore that was left to the imagination in this film which to be honest for me would make the film pretty much unwatchable unless there is actually a film behind the pointless and endless dribble that is in its a contender for the worst film ive seen and im a little concerned about those who have given it positive review its clearly a 010 but unfortunately im forced to give it a 110,cruel
this movie would be offensive and degrading if it werent so freaking stupid additionally any woman who would submit herself to the role of either female in this movie has no reason to expect any kind of respect as a human being from anyone ever seriously have some freaking self respect you stupid wannabe hollywood censoreds im sure you made your daddies proud with this one oh also  get used to it because youll most likely be eating bleep for the rest of your livesand by the way  if by some chance probably druginduced rape you happen to have kids im sure you will make a point of showing them this film as encouragement for them to follow their dreams like you did  assuming their dreams consist of spending their lives as useless pieces of trash like youcongrats on the academy awards this one is sure to get you you stupid freaking worthless selfhating rapebait bleeepscant wait for the sequel,cruel
is a truly misguided attempt at extending the boundaries of the horror genrethe plot is elementary and overused except for the whole sewing ases to mouths thing  two pretty yet silly american tourists lost and alone scared and in dire need of assistance as they roam aimlessly in the night away from the safety of their car blah blah blah bam taken hostage by a crazy german dude who likes to force people to eat other peoples sht the same old story add some asian guy to be the front carriage of this sht train and youve got yourself a credible as the plot is the movie gets even better when we discover dr freakschnitzel is really trying to recreate the glory days when he had his tripoodle trained like a show dogto be honest after the shock of realizing someone had made a movie about such a ridiculous concept it really becomes apparent how disappointing the film is i was expecting to be grossed out or sht scared pun intended the whole time neither emotions occurred things ran fairly predictably and we were spared most scenes of intense grossness we were also spared any effective suspense the scenes without the poop parade were mostly pretty boring not to mention the fact that not a great deal actually happens for the first 45 minutesnone of the characters have any depth to them there is no discernible reason for dr nutcases insanity the screenwriter attempts to dispense with the audiences questions about his motives in a single line the two damsels at the center of this sht storm pun definitely intended also lose any potential character value after their dialogue is abruptly halted when their mouths are attached to anuses the asian guy who doesnt speak english or german oddly enough adds no depth to the story other than to yell and scream foil his own pis weak attempts at escape and abruptly kill himself upon the brink of absconsion for some reason which makes little or no senseif you have gotten to this page it is likely you know what the film is about already which means you have already experienced all the movie has to offer  a new twist on the word disgusting it isnt very well acted or written but lets face it this movie is about the novelty shock value check any other credible film qualities im afraid not,cruel
is it just me or was i the only person who thought this was a dark humor to people who thought this was a shock movie i would have to disagree with you the movie was straight to the point it didnt end with what you expected from the title of the movie i thought the movie tried to portray a dark humor feel from it from how bizarre the acts were and how some the actors portrayed the characters at times i laughed and at times felt bad for the people when the nasty scenes occurred i also didnt find myself bored because of dragged out scenes or unnecessary talking but in my opinion i dont believe the movie was too gross and if you have a quite dark humor you will find this movie quite humorous,cruel
there is a hype around this movie that said that this is medically 100 accurate and after seeing the trailer i thought id give it a shotthe movie starts of in one big clichclich connect the dots  two young girls  roadtrip  lost in the woods  house of a mad surgeoni am not a medical students but i think that the odds that two random persons are compatible to each other are quite low thats one of the problems with organtransplant how lucky is he that the two girls match and since the third guy isnt he just go grab a random japanese guy out of his backyard who apparently hasnt a clue what hes doing in germanylet alone europe he doesnt speak neither english nor german nor any other language except for japanesethe whole movie goes a long in a really slow pace and the shock value is barely there i had a feeling half way trough the movie that they had to fill up 40 minutes with useless scenes then two detectives show up and start asking questions about the missing girls the mad surgeon was apparently not smart enough to find their car and move it away then he tries to drug the police officers to replace the sick third person i mean how stupid can you be trying to drug the police officers like that wouldnt ring any bells at the police station this attempt fails and they go back to the police station to get a search warrant in the mean time the mad surgeon gets stabbed by the japanese then they try to flee but this doesnt work and it ends up in that the japanese guy kills himself then the police come back and they force the entry unfortunately they both get killed by the surgeon who couldnt even stand up but he managed to kill the first detective by stabbing him in the neck and getting his weapon and shooting him as well how he did that wasnt shown so that was kind of strange then the other detective get shot as well but not before he shoots the mad surgeon in the head and they both die then the scene goes back to the japanese guy is death and the last girl in the line dies as well and the girl in the middle is left sitting there and then the movie endsthis movie was one of the worst horror movies i have ever saw,cruel
now this is more like it  over this years halloween i saw both kiwi goremeister david blyths weeping sore wound at the razor reel fantasy film festival in my hometown of bruges belgium and my eagerly awaited dvd copy of dutch shock jock tom sixs infinitely superior recipient of massive internet prerelease hype the selfexplanatory even though anyone who would care to watch it inevitably knows what

the time is right to create the human equivalententer a pair of typically clueless american girls whiny jenny ashlyn yennie and her comparatively more levelheaded bff lindsay ashley c williams whose

ill be there with you gets drafted as a last minute replacement to pull the train on the does my esteemed readership still bear with me  if so let me assure you that this film plays quite differently than any cold light of day description would lead one to believe those expecting a non stop barrage of grotesque gore will actually come away disappointed correctly assuming his far out premise born out of a running joke among the directors circle of friends of what would constitute proper punishment for pedophiles contains more than enough shock value in itself six takes the slow  meandering to some  approach to his as a result surprisingly thoughtful realization thereof although all three unwilling participants are deliberately sketched in crude cultural clichs in the first act they really come alive once theyre all too literally connected with nary a single opportunity for both very dark humor the feeding sequence which albeit largely suggested will separate the men from the boys and almost operatic tragedy left unexplored as a trivia note six selected the character of katsuro to take the lead rather than either of the girls because he wanted both creature and creator unable to verbally communicate with one another as in his own words that would have been weird  really tom bursting onto the cinematic scene with the politically incorrect gay six has steadfastly refused to be pigeonholed and continues to follow his highly personal career trajectory even though will be categorized by many as firmly belonging within the confines of the horror genre more specifically reviving the body horror cycle of early cronenberg it hits so many apparently discordant notes along the way for that to be a comfortable fit the initial revelation of the provides a perfect example an unexpected ejaculation of pure visual poetry as the filmmaker pulls out all the stops brazenly bathing his titular monstrosity in warm golden sunlight courtesy of sixs regular dop goof de koning like his mentor equally unconstricted by the still rarely wellemployed digital technology this immediately imbues the creature with both human dignity circumstances notwithstanding  and an unlikely gigeresquire beauty although the director has gone on record promising a sequel that will contain all the grue and gore which here he wisely withheld as the swells to a whopping twelve  participants its hard to believe that this will in any way improve upon his maiden voyage and offer anything quite as memorable as its sublimely understated haunting final image the full implication of which

first sequence zero stars out of five i really like and respect horror movies i think they often require the most imagination creativity and talent to produce out of any genre of film they also can be very enlightening and entertaining as well i love to be scared and i love to be disturbed to a certain extent horror movies which do these things can teach us something about facing our own fears and actually serve as a psychological examination of what makes us afraid and disturbed of these things to begin with i also love just good old fashioned b monster and slasher flicks which serve no real purpose other than to entertain and make light and fun of what fears us and creeps us out theres also those horror films that straddle the line of both serious terror and fun campy b horror which really serve both purposes i love these films as well there has to be some value or some purpose to a film though that makes it worthwhile even if it might seem as trivial to some as the ones ive mentionedsome movies like this feature written and directed by the notoriously bad filmmaker tom six have no purpose whatsoever other than torturing the viewer and making them sick it tells the story of a mad retired german surgeon played impressively by dieter laser who once specialized in separating siamese twins whos now drugged and captured three tourists who he plans to make live out his horrifying dream of becoming the first by joining them together through their gastric systemsthe film is split among fans and critics evenly with half of each loving the film and half hating it on imdb it has a user rating of 51 out of 10 and on rottentomatoescom it has an overall critic approval of 48 with an average rating of 5 out of 10 i generally dont believe in calling a film bad just because i didnt like it or get something of value to me from it as long as its generally well made it serves its intent and purposes and has some value of some kind to someone this film does seem to serve the filmmakers intent of totally disturbing and repulsing the viewer and some people obviously love it for that and in some ways it is arguably well made to a certain extent the lead actor is very good and the movie has a seriously creepy and shockingly morbid tone to it that it maintains for its entirety still the film has no real value of any kind to anyone that i can see its not a campy b horror film that wants the viewer to overlook its absurdity and just have fun with its frightfulness and outrageous shock value which some argue the filmmaker six has said that he was trying to make a generally horrifying film which is what i got from it and think he succeeded so this makes me truly question the logic and credibility of the filmthe surgeon is obviously supposed to be a very brilliant although insane man so why would he possibly expect his experiment to work the creation obviously would die very quickly yet he obviously wants it to live the film has been described as completely medically realistic and accurate by experts and its true that everything performed in the film is possible but still it wouldnt last long and an expert surgeon would have to know this theres also absolutely no character development at all we know nothing about the victims and we know that the surgeon is insane and hates human beings but we have no idea why the saw and hostel films which i love are full of rich insightful character development and also satisfying character redemption at times this film has one brief moment towards the end of a victim coming to terms with his wrong doings but we dont understand what they were or where they are suddenly coming from i dont believe in calling a movie morally deprived because of the actions of the characters within it but this movie is morally deprived in my opinion it has no point or purpose at all and its just hurtful this film ranks right up there with some of the worst ever in my book like date movie rent and caligula its just an awful awful moviewatch our review show movie talk at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvyhqatxul7sq,cruel
the concept of this movie shocked a lot of people and disgusted even more and even roger ebert wouldnt give it any stars claiming the star system to be unsuited to this film people left the theater during test screenings and all in all this movie got a lot and i mean a lot of bad hype needless to say i had to see ita lot of people slammed this movie for being a huge disgusting gore fest but it wasnt really nearly as gory as movies like saw in fact the gore was fairly minimal and necessary people getting shotstabbed and bleeding the surgery scene had a little blood and one part where one of the girls tried to escape she accidentally ripped an iv out of her arm and that bled quite a bit other than that i cant really think of any scenes with blatant bloodshed but really this movie didnt need to be swimming in blood it was plenty disgusting on its own and i say that with a big smile of approval of my face and two thumbs shoved high into the air or they would be if i wasnt using them to typethe film is made in a really simple way in a way that works i think unbelievably well i think one of the things that surprised me the most was the lack of soundtrack the movie had most movies use music as a way to build atmosphere but if there was any music in this movie at all i didnt even notice it even the end credits were just the surviving girls hysteric cries i think thats what really impressed me the movie didnt need music to help build atmosphere it did that quite well on its ownthe movie was scary in a very dark and cruel way and the idea was completely and utterly original one of the reviews i read about the movie compared the plot to something out of a junji ito comic and thats the exact kind of feel i got a bit slowpaced but so interesting and terrifying in such a new way that the pacing is hardly a dealbreaker the movie is an excellent display of the something so disgusting and original and will surely fill your evening with nightmares of eating someone elses feces for the rest of your life and if you have the stomach for it i couldnt recommend it enoughgo see it right now and do yourself a favor and pass on the popcorn this time dear reader you wont want anything in your system while watching thisthis review was edited for length and content to read the whole thing along with others check out my blog httpmoviessucktumblrcom,cruel
i thought this was going to be a low budget piece of garbage but i was pleasantly surprised the main doctor was great very freaky the idea of was not what i was expecting and i thought it was original it was well filmed and i could not predict what was going to happen next i did predict but i was far from it i take my hat off to the director or whoever came up with this grotesque idea i was actually slightly perturbed and horrified in parts call me old fashioned but thats what i want from a horror movie which is why i give it the thumbs up and this is supposed to be a warm up before the sequels,cruel
ok so well done to tom six for producing a great film but i have to say after all the hype of eew its gross and you dont want to eat while watching warnings i have got to say that if youve seen any of the saw films you can eat and drink all you want through this as it is so so so so so easy to watchone downfall for me was that i didnt have subtitles during the non english speaking moments and so i had no idea what was happening in like 3 of the scenes so big recommendation watch with subtitle options otherwise it was a good film and i must say it inspired me to watch the rest,cruel
i honestly dont know what to say about this movie its pretty obvious its gonna be a horror about a crazy scientist who creates a and that is pretty much the story its not horrifying its not scary theres lack of a decent plot its nowhere near as freaky or creepy as the title would have you believe although for someone with a sensitive stomach like mine i couldnt help but wretch at the disgusting scenesi was literally screaming at the two girls at the beginning they left the car in the middle of the night instead of staying by it and when they did decide to leave they wandered off into the woods there was plenty of opportunities where one or both girls couldve escaped but instead when jenny does escape she decides to go back downstairs and rescue her unconscious friend exerting all her energy into dragging her out of the house whilst losing lots of blood making loads of groaning noises as she tries to drag her friend away and then gets knocked out by a tranquilizing dart when shes only a dozen feet away from the house in the time it took her to go back and drag her friend to safety she couldve ran away through the woods gotten onto the main road flagged for help and have her friend and the other guy rescued by the authorities but then i guess that wouldnt have made a very interesting movie not like the original plot was any more interestingthis movie couldve been so much more instead of just being about 3 naked people on all fours being held together mouthtoanus crapping into each others mouths dieter laser plays his role as an estranged psychopathic scientist very well though,cruel
now im no horror fan i worked in the film industry for 10 years in art departments so somehow horror for me always ends up being a comedy but occasionally when something controversial circulates i need to see it at least so i can join in the conversation at the barso 2 is out which ive researched better watch 1 first and im also fairly well versed in where the bottom of the barrel is on the net so concepts like the one visited in this film seem positively mild by comparisonso the best way to watch a dangerous horror film is backwards which is what i did with this watch the end first then find out how the film got there and so on that way theres nothing sinister around the corner and i wont laugh to deaththe end truly is gruesome and is probably the best ending ive ever seen for a horror film the end really is horrific i dont think i could imagine anything worse if i wanted to find a definition of hell then it would have to be closei think certainly works both on the screen and at the bar as a film it has certainly got tongues wagging i can see a new dance coming on which might finally replace nutbush at partiesdefinitely not one to show the wife and kids thoughone annoying thing though which makes a mockery of the 100 medically accurate claim the human anus is between the legs not on the backside guys you had the mouths joined at the wrong place  you need to go further down by about 2 inches if you want it to be accurate good try though,cruel
this is basically what the film is about this is like the synopsis but what really happensit starts with this old german guy who is jacking off to a picture of his dogs and this trucker goes to take a wizz then the old guy takes out his tranquilizer rifle and takes the trucker guy out and puts him into his trunk thats just the opening scenethen it goes to these two american girls who are driving to this party by the way this takes place in germany and then they get a flat tire so they decide to go get help next scene it takes place in a forest they figured that if theyre going to get help they wont walk on the road theyll walk in the middle of the forest at night in the rain finally they see a house and they knock on the door and the old german guy from the beginning says to come in and asks if they want anything to drink they say yes so hes like drug drug and when they drink it he says side effect rape drug next scene they find themselves strapped down to beds in a basement and next to them is some asian guy and then the german guy explains that he is a retired doctor and his dream is to create siamese people and during this scene the camera keeps going to this grave that basically says here lies three dogs conjoined together you kind of get the feeling whats going to happen so hes explaining all the positions with a diagram that looks like it was drawn by a first grader hes going to perform surgery on them so that they are literally ass to mouth so the digestive tract goes all the way throughout them so the positions are a b and c and everyones like please a so one of the girls escapes but the doctor catches her and says ah i found my b which would be a good idea to other people especially at work like i found my b next scene you see a blanket over all three of them which actually three people ass to mouth and the doctor removes the blanket and shows a mirror to them and they freak out the asian is a and the two girls are b and c which is an a plus because they dont get to talk anymore and they werent that good so then they begin to walk or crawl or something and the asian says oh no oh no and he turns and says im so sorry i have to sht thats something that stays with youso then two cops come by and they ask if they seen any kind of unusual behavior because there was reporting of missing people so then the doctor drugs one of them and then he heads back to the basement and is gone he says i know i left it here one thing i couldnt understand is how does a crawl up a spiral staircase in about a minute my dog can barely walk up a spiral staircaseso anyway the cops find in the master bedroom now when a person sees something like this you can imagine it like jeff goldblum in the fly so someone might run away or vomit or scream but the cop said are you okay by the way the doctors house has an indoor in ground pool how can you have an in ground pool and a basement but anyway the doctor shoots the drugged cop and the asian dude says look ive had enough of this and he takes a knife and he slits his throat and then the other cop comes into the room where the doctor is and the cop shoots the doctor but the doctor shoots the cop and by now c girl is green because shes been eating double sht so she dies so now youve got a dead doctor two dead cops dead a dead c and b is still alive which you do not want and then the camera pans up into the sky and thats how the movie ends,cruel
this is by far the best movie i have ever seen in my life the plot is amazing like how did they think of such an amazing storyline the act of stringing together innocent human beings for fun is so creative and fun to watch the actors were awesome too solid 1010 i would watch this movie 300 more times in a heartbeat i watch this with my 2 and 3 year old every friday night i recommend this movie to all ages as its a very family friendly movie with great positive role models thanks for reading,cruel
okay tbh i didnt realise that this movie was gonna be like this i thought it was about a person with a long back and lots of legs that could crawl but no it was just disturbing i wish i never watched it ok so lets start at the beginning this old psycho dude had this dog but it died and hes like well i should make a so he does he kidnaps this dude but then he realises that he doesnt want this dude in his so he kills him he then kidnaps another dude who he does usethese two girls get lost so they go to his house and the dude lets them inside they pass out and wake up in some random medical room basement the dude tells them about procedure and says that he is going to use them three people to make it they try to get away but that doesnt happen they get used for the dude pulls out all their teeth but not the man he kidnaped because he is going to be the front part he stitches one of the girls mouths to the front parts butt and does it again with the other girl but she is the last part he takes them outside and makes the front one eat the front one has to poo so he poops into the girls mouth and the psycho dude it yelling out feed her feed her it was the most disturbing part and was really gross i think it was the cops that later came but the front dude kills himself because he doesnt want to live like this and the end girl dies because she is sick and has had no food or water the middle girl is still alive and is stuck and thats the end of the movie im not joking that literally was the end and thats how the movie goes as well i do not recommend this movie at all because it is so disturbing so yeah dont watch it,cruel
i went into this motion picture with low expectations and an open heart boy was i surprised with what i was rewarded this gentle and tender little number was all i could ask for in a film comedy check drama check romance double check it never leaves a spot dry youll walk out of this one dabbing your eyes and nursing your cock tom six  you have traversed all lines on which the famed directors of old would never dare to cross francis ford coppola a fucking bean counter compared to this cinematic master dieter laser where do i even begin hes a chameleon in this role completely slips into the skin of dr heiter and makes it his own obviously credit needs to be given to six for the opulence of the role yet here laser can be compared to the likes of de niro in the deer hunter or brando in on the waterfront what masterful work the words feed her will swim through my dreams just stunning of course therell always be the critics  the naysayers who want this gem to be hidden under the monopolistic pillars of hollywood what a crime this painting should be studied as the work of art it is truly worthy of cinema,cruel
honestly the title speaks for itself anyone looking for oscar worthy material is clearly delusional this film was rather comedic for me and quite entertaining at the very least the villainsurgeons performance was entirely believable i say if youre really that bored and are looking for some good laughs check this out,cruel
after watching this film tonight for the first time i know im late i felt i should leave a quick and too the point reviewmy summary does sum it up really years ago i had been warned by a few people to never watch because of dirty messed up ideas now im just sitting here wondering were these people being serious for the first 20 minutes i think this film would suit the comedy genre much better wont give any spoilers but ill say this ever felt like you were hoping the two stupid people in a film would just die already well expect that feeling to rise back up when watching this the acting was also not great did improve a little as the film got on its way to the end once the credits started rolling dont get me wrong though it wasnt the worst acting ive ever seen unfortunatelynow the reason why i didnt get as shocked as some of the other reviewers i assure you that im not one of these weirdos who get off on torture pornhorrors with a little blood im a normal 24 year old female but as i watched a serbian film only a few months ago for the first time im very unlikely to get shocked at this a serbian film really did shock me and i personally think the shock factor was more extreme but better so when i was watching naturally comparing i found the hype didnt live up to the name the stretched out scenes did not add anything for me i knew at the back of my mind i just had the thought is this it plus the script is nothing to really rave about either so now im just sat here debating with myself whether to give it a 4 or a 5 ratingill give it a 5 as im feeling generous to be honest think ive rated one of the bring it on films a 6 so that really does sum it upwould i recommend this film well watch it online for free or on netflix dont pay for it because its not worth the money watch it once and then watch the unedited version of a serbian film then make your own mind up 510,cruel
epic fail i watched this yesterday and its one of the most disappointed movie ever madea slow movie terribly boring and super badly acting a body horror movie without any gore no thrill nothing is scare although the plot seem like more disturbing a crazy german doctor like to stitch people together mouth to anus but the film is disappointed also i guess there wouldnt even be enough sadism or porn for sadism lovers just pure stupidity you shouldnt watch this movie its a waste of money and time so if you are seeking for a disturbing movie just go for another this movie was a bad idea for you,cruel
i will be 100 honest about this film i found it one of the most disturbing horrific movies i have ever seen it was fantastic the whole idea and originality of the movie was thrilling i cant wait for the second edition i hope it is as disturbing as the first as for the inaccurate parts of the film all i can say is although this is true about the medical side of the movie you really cant liken it to real surgeons as no real surgeon would ever perform such a surgery in the first place unless of course they were insane and didnt really give a damn about the patients health or life i really do give this movie a 10 out of 10 good work tom six,cruel
im not what youd call a delicate person it takes a lot to impress me having seen trailer i was intrigued by this weird and twisted story of a demented surgeon looking for satisfaction in the making of a triplet siamese i was in for a treat never before was i so sick and ill at ease it kind of reminded me of hanekes funny games only more powerful and crazy and disturbing controversial it is i really felt sick and found me breathing hard the actings not great the special effects are quite convincing overall i give it an 8 because it made me feel like never before but be warned it really is not for everyone to watch,cruel
during one night late last yeari was searching round the tv channels to find something that was even mildly interesting onwhen i got to channel 4i noticed that they were showing a terrible comedy panel show called you have been watchingjust before i changed the channelit was announced on the program that they were going to show a surprise teaser for an upcoming filmwhich the presenter said looks like one of the most insaneouttheir ideasthat had somehow been made into a film whilst the program showed that all of the panelist had been stunned into silence by the teaserthe opposite had actually occurred with mefrom the moment the last ten seconds of the teaser showed why the film is named the human centerpedei knew that this was a film that i defiantly had to track downafter i luckily found the film being sold on amazon uki went round to my friends house to watch it with himand just as the film started to begini made sure to warn my friend that he should get himself prepared for something that will be very hard to forgetthe plot on vacationtwo american girls jenny and lindsay decide to go and visit a local night clubon the way to the clubthey take a wrong turn onto a country roadand their car brakes down on themleaving them in the middle of no whereafter trying to get some help from a passer by who is extremely threatening towards them the girls decide to take a risk and leave their car behindso that they can search for any sign of life in this wilderness jenny and lindsay soon spot a house that seems to be occupiedwhen they arrive at the housethey are welcomed by the only resident of the building who introduces himself as drheiterafter having kindly invited the girls inso that they can have a drink and relax for a momentlindsay and jenny start to feel that something is wrong when they both suddenly become very tiedas they start to faintheiter tells the girls that he has spiked their drinksand that they have no chance of ever leaving this place when they awakethe girls find themselves tied down to a hospital bedwith a man tied up in the bed next to themwhen dr heiter enters the roomhe goes over to the mans bed to tell him that due to his body tissue not being a match with the two girlshe is now completely useless to himafter heiter has killed the manhe goes searching for another patientthis leads him to grabbing a japanese tourist called katsuroafter he has got all of them tied downheiter decides to make the huge annulment that all three of them have been given the honour of being his dream medical experimentwhilst all three of them start to screamheiter talks over them to let them know that his dream is to turn them all into a bymaking incisions on there faceknees and rectumsso that they can then be all sewed up to become one animalwith the risk of someone discovering linsay and jennys carheiter knows that he only has a short time to turn his dream into a reality view on the filmas the end credits started upi began to think that this hugely enjoyable horror filmwas surprisingly similar to the excellent comedy film the aristocratswith aristocrats the film makers looked at how far they could stretch one joke outand turn it into something that was as farout there as possiblealthough writerdirector tom six only has one jokeit packs one hell of a punchlinefor the first hour of this excellent film six creates moments that have become stuck in my headeven after having watched the film four days agoalthough most of the film is surprisingly not that bloodytom six instead builds up a strong feeling of dreadwith the meal time scene being one of the most disturbing scenes that i have seen this yearone of the main things that caught me offguardwas that i actually started to hope that the victims would be brutally murdereddue to the experiment that they were taking part inmaking them getting killed look like a nicest optionfor the last half an hour of the filmtom six drops the ball slightly by adding a last minute subplotwhich leads to one of the victims acting in a manner that they would defiantly not have done during the intense first hourthankfully whilst the last part of the screenplay lets the film down a bitthe cast are impressively able to keep the films intensity level very high for the whole running timealthough the victims faces are mostly not see abledue to two of them having their face sewed up onto each others rectumeach of the cast members are brilliant at making the strong feelings of pain and hopelessness hit you right off the screenfinal view on the filma very originaldaring horror filmwhich is filled with lots of disturbing moments that will stay in your head for days,cruel
i really do not know how to even rate this it was not great or bad but before i continue i want to say that this was possibly the most disturbing movie i have ever watched i heard it was a lot like the saw movies but not even saw could compare to this after hearing so much about this movie at school and being told ill be better off not watching it i was automatically tempted to watch it no matter how disgusting it was which it was very disturbing and disgusting i had to get up and walk away a few times to keep from vomiting whoever made this movie should honestly get some help this movie caused me to never want to germany in fear of my car breaking down and this entire movie happening to me,cruel
if there was a way to enter a 10 on imdb i would this film makes ed woods plan 9 from outer space look like citizen kane thankfully this movie was only 90 minutes long although it felt like an eternity the first 30 minutes felt like eating out of a dogfood bowl the second 30 minutes felt like eating someones dogfoodbasedfeces and the last 30 minutes felt like eating fecesbasedfeces and thankfully keeling over in the process i meanwhat would posses someone to make a film like thismaybe a snuff film director who just got bored with the industry this was without a doubt the worst movie ever made i challenge anyone with even questionable taste to challenge this if you can avoid this mindless escapade at all costs the imagery will be difficult to get out of your head for a whileyuchhhh ,cruel
is it something id ever want or need to watch again no however somehow being someone who never bothered to see saw etc the movie did give me a very keen insight into who we are as a society and what people want from entertainmenti do not recommend the movie however i must say that it may be poorly executed art that speaks to our times and human condition i dont like francis bacon as a painter either but i respect his work not that tom six has those kinds of skills guess im just new to this whole genre of filmmaking it bums me out but hey people like excrement sometimes and apparently they really like watching naked girls eat it thank the internet i did sometimes feel the need to laugh at the mistakes in filmmaking and somehow laughing at people who thought this was a good film frankly i want those 90 or so minutes of my life back i already know how fd popular entertainment is i dont need to sit around having some wannabe director proving it to me whatevs could totally see it being the new rocky horror though i fear the crowd propsall in all if you cant stop putting your tongue in a canker sore and that makes you happy youll love it,cruel
girls from new york cant possibly be this naive i think the director has a sick sense of humour and wasted that 15 million pound budget i bet hell never direct againthe actors were weak except the doctor he played the role in the horrible story perfectly he really was creepy besides the one creepy idea the movie had no plot value it was impossible to buy that they were connected so many mistakes where its clear they arentthe end is disappointing and doesnt leave the viewer with anything to chew on besides how many inconsistencies lead to this unsatisfying endplot issues going to a night club they end up driving around in a forest neither of the two girls could change a tirethey look up what the horny guy said but not how to say help change tire a guy like that probably gladly would have helped if he thought hed get something for themthe girl who wouldnt go out before because shes in heels and shorts ends up walking for helpto look for help the girls walk into the forest not along the road as they get to the house it suddenly starts to rain and they go crazy knocking on every door and window  the doctor guy asks if theyre alone then invites soaked people to sit on a fancy sofa girl tries to undue her bonds only when hes going to sedate them for the operation what about when he wasnt watching them when she escapes and shes in a room with a phone by the door she makes no attempt to contact the police the japanese guy drops the big metal lamp and picks up a small shard of glass to kill himself voller who was sick in the hallway as the doctor moves in the corner where hes found magically ends up dead in the middle of the pool and the doctor has his gun the other police detective after seeing doesnt call in for backup nor after hearing his partners gun go off why send only two detectives in for the search if they suspected hes responsive for 4 missing persons the police officer doesnt check the corner basic training for entering a room especially after a gun was dischargedgreat everyone but the middle girl dies in the end great wow that was genius,cruel
i was fortunate enough to experience first sequence at fantastic fest in austin and as the name suggests it is unlike anything you have ever seen now there are plenty of killer movies and plenty of monster movies but as a world weve really gotten away from the mad scientist movies of the forties and fifties cronenbergs early work comes to mind but its so much more cerebral than the visceral thrills mr six has in store for us not to say much about the plot but it involves the evil scientist the awesome dieter laser performing extremely weird and unprecedented surgeries on a group of patients and the bond formed between the patients as a result of the shared experience not for anyone but horror fans or maybe mad scientists this film gives you what other horror films wont it never pulls back or flinches and i challenge even the most seasoned gorehounds not to squirm or wince during the films most challenging sequences thank you tom six for this wonderful film i cant wait to see the full sequence,cruel
first sequance was quite a disturbing film and some scenes made me feel a bit sick especially the toilet scene which was stomach churning but tom six still yet again outdid himself this film is just one of the most disturbing yet darkly funny in a sick kind of way film ever made this should have friday the 13th shaking in its boots  i didnt understand why it was to be banned i have actually seen worse films then this i would say that halloween ii 2009 was slightly more gory and disturbingis quite a daring film some may hate it but some may love it i think this will be a classic in years to come and will be always remembered on,cruel
ive seen a lot of horror films so many that i think there are no more for me to watchwhich is very sad ive been looking for a good horror film for a long time and this might be one of them although i hate the use of nudity in horror films mainly because directors use it to draw in more audience i thought the use of it in here was good they used in appropriately like henenlotter films they didnt have a random orgy scene they didnt have a girl nude due to an unrealistic accidentthey had them nude because they were attached to each other i like the use of notsoobvious comic relief that contributes to the scientists madness the scientist is training his creation as a pet he treats them like pets beats them like pets etci like the creativity a horror movie now is usually a remake of a classic horror movie with more nudity ahemrob zombie you all bash this movie because its raunchy behavior but how many of you have thought about such a plot the director made sure to stick to the plot as opposed to keeping everything visualthe director did something that isnt that importantwhich is he made sure it was medically accurate to avoid plot holesyet half of the viewers could care less about the plot they are concentrated on how nasty it is i didnt like the endingspoiler the asian guy took a piece of glass to his throat he had it good though if someone came to find him all theyd have to do it cut his ass from the chicks mouthno biggie or he couldve ripped himself offi dunno just enjoy the film,cruel
film critic roger ebert refused to give the film any stars not out of any like or dislike of the film but as he put it this is a film in which the stars do not shine and this is not a negative statement about the film merely a description of the disgust depravity and depression in this filmthe plot as you well know involves a mad german doctors who kidnaps two young american girls and one japanese man for the purposes of fusing the three together mouth to anus creating the premise of the film alone is enough to make someone vomit but rather than being a exploitation film or some fetish porno and beyond the initial shock of its premise lies a lowbudget horror film with a clever hook and is effectively executed and surprisingly there is little gore or graphic imagery that one might expect from a film like thisi admire writerdirector tom six for what he accomplishes with a low budget small cast limited locations and one horrifying original idea when compared to what hollywood accomplishes with all their millions of dollars spent on remakes and ripoffsone of the purposes of a horror film is to ask the question of whats the worst thing that could happen answers that question in spades,cruel

personally this movie scared me greatly it was hard to sit through yet compelling once its on your inticed and have to see what happens nextover all for most people it wouldnt be considered that scary the real horror is in what hes going to do to the people but this is revealed almost right away its clear that the villain wants these people alive while he does degrade themand dehuminize them after the first 20 minutes of the movie its clear that the worst it overthe only reason this movie deserves a seven is because of originality never has this been done before despite a few flaws in the storyline theres no doubt that this movie is sick twisted and will impact you afterwards,cruel
for you to be reading this review you must either have a slight interest in this film or you enjoy the idea of humans in form both of which would raise serious questions in my head about your own personal mental health simultaneously for me to be writing this review proves that i must have watched it as well therefore having similar thoughts originallynow having glanced at a few of the other reviews on here i can see that a lot of them are saying so gross i wanted to be sick worst film ever the director must be insane and so on i disagree with these comments 100 firstly the director is not sick he is actually quite clever in a way he obviously realised that he was never going to be a great director he was never going to get the chance to direct a masterpiece but he yearned for the fame he longed for the notoriety and that is exactly what he achieved through this film when most people mention they always include a line similar to the directorwriter must be crazy or they would have researched his name and quote you it tom six in case you didnt know this is exactly what he set out to achieve now that the praise is over with let me deal with the actual filmthis film is one of the worst films i have ever seen and not because of the fact that there is a crawling around for most of it mainly it is due to the terrible terrible acting from all involved the opening sequence of the two girls getting ready to go out then travelling and getting stuck in the woods then leaving their car in the middle of nowhere so they can aimlessly walk around in the rain has to be one of the most pointless badly acted scenes ever obviously if actresses have agreed to star in a film where they are attached to someones anus via the mouth for the majority of the film then you arent expecting terrific performances but it is still a film nevertheless and therefore some kind of acting talent is expected which this film is completely lacking the two bumbling policemen are a particular lowlight of the film not only are they both horrifically bad at acting they also decide to go in for a quick drink with a murderer and then both get killed very very easily without much struggle at allsecondly if you are intending to watch this film to be grossed out you will be disappointed i have seen more gore in an episode of coronation street than in this film once you get past the premise of the film then there really isnt much at all you dont see any surgery they are connected together in a gross way but nothing is shown other than lots of tape and bandagesthe reason why this film has gained so much interest and therefore quite a bit of money for tom six is because of the ridiculous nature of the plot i ended up watching it because people challenged me too watch it and thats how it has spread across the country like a debilitating disease that has scarred the film industry i put forward a challenge to you readersdont watch this film instead do something useful with that extra time you will have gained tom six is quite clearly lacking in talent and imagination so lets not give him the credit of watching his pathetic excuse of a film once you have read this do not watch the film and do not tell anyone about it,cruel
what strikes me as repulsive about this film is not mainly its disturbing storyline and silly plot but that director tom six actually thinks he has made a horror movie he has not is complete and utter sexually exploitative torture porn trash deceptively packaged as a horror film nothing about this movie is remotely horrific in the true sense of what the genre and its many facets have attempted to portray on screen for 100 years it is not scary it is not intense it is not terrifying it is just plain disgusting and sick this film is nothing more then fetish porn born from the obviously sick and disturbed mind of its director of course if that was tom sixs intent by making this garbage then he has achieved greatness having said that i will admit that dieter lasers performance of dr heiter was truly inspired had he been the villain in a more worthy film his portrayal would have been legendary instead he will just be remembered as that crazy doctor in that perverted fetish porno who sewed three people together ass to mouth what a waste of a truly creepy villain played by an equally creepy actoras for the story it is so incredibly flawed that one has to wonder just how many minutes tom six spent writing the script of course when most of the dialogue is coming from two girls screaming into the buttholes their lips have been sewn to how much time do you need to write brilliant lines like mmmmmmmffffmmmm which brings me to one of the major problems with the film the ultimate reveal of the film could have actually been a real horror movie had it ended with the unveiling of dr heiters perverted creation but instead of building the suspense and developing the characters further we spend the better half of the movie trying to watch these three conjoined humans crawl around in adult diapers and crap down each others surgically affixed throats gee real suspenseful seriously watching these three stooges try to navigate up a basement staircase was almost laughable and the fact that the two girls never shut up or stopped crying even with their mouths sewn shut to an anus conjured up feelings of annoyance rather then horror or sympathy the only time in the film that i actually agreed with the mad doctor was when he came in and told them to shut up or he was going to cut their vocal cordsto sum it up tom sixs fetish porn is nothing more then a disturbing attempt at shocking the audience with vile and disgusting images generated from a sick mans mind it is not horror it has no redeeming value and no true moments of terror to qualify it as worthy of wearing the horror movie mantle six has vowed to one up himself for the sequel but from what i hear the film is already banned in the uk and i certainly hope it is banned in the us as well in fact they should just ban tom six from making any further films in the future or at least get him some psychiatric help he seriously needs it he could also do with a creative writing class as well maybe with a little schooling he will learn the true difference between what really defines the horror film genre and the fetish porn crap he makes,cruel
i dont know what i can say i dont make it wordy so i write down these1 there isnt a plot 2 there isnt an expression 3 there isnt a horrific element 4 there isnt any blood at least this could have been done 5 there isnt action 6 there isnt roleplay 7 there isnt anything that we can call there isexcept this of course there is a horrible movie not a horror moviea bit spoilerif a nut surgeon wants to do some cuttingpatching stuff to create an interesting organism does he try to make a triplebutt jointhuman or is he supposed to be more creative let i brush this idea off ok he has got a sapless brain hes not a genius but where does come this tripletization process from what does he want to do unless i mistake all he wants to do is creating a siamese triplets but when you join a mouth to an anus you dont make a siamese i think its a little different issue a bit spoilerin a nutshell dont ever watch this,cruel
i dont see how someone could not thoroughly enjoy this movieyes the acting could be much better and the beginning is a huge cheesy mess but dieter laser comes in and saves the day i cant imagine a better person to be casted as the sinister dr heiter the girls acting gets better as you can begin to feel their sense of despair and hopelessi really enjoyed the conflict the man in front seem to have being the only man involved in the terrible situation and also the head of i wish they explored this a little more all in all i want to see many more movies like this,cruel
i caught this film last week by flicking over  and was surprised that somehow it kept my attention it wasnt particularly well acted and up to when the girl was drugged after dragging her friend out of the house it had the usual clichs but despite that it still held my interest there were sooooo many times when the characters acted stupidly as happens in these sort of films but when they got to the part when the was made it was an strangeinteresting concept and thankfully most of the disgusting parts were in the mind rather than shown onscreen thoroughly depressing ending too although i suppose that with the two policemen getting killed would mean that more police would go to the house i give this a 8 although i know that i should be voting it lower but theres just that something about it that i liked,cruel
so nothing about the surgery is realistic and the movie was just plain gross i know some people like to see crazy and messed up stuff but this was just boring and wasnt even shocking or scary most of the sort of tense scenes are all in the beginning of the movie and after that its just stupid torture scenes and its very dull and boring to watch the crazy doctor is basically a douche and looks like one as well his face is freakishly gross looking as well and has zero charisma so basically none of the characters were interesting to watch most of them are retarded and the characters actions didnt make sense a lot of times and the movie has a lot of plot holes its like the director just came up with a idea that is gross but original and thought it would be great to just rely the whole movie around that one small idea a waste of time for the most part for this one310,cruel
im not a prude i swear im not i believe there is a place in film for violence eroticism language and gore but im also not afraid to call a spade a spade and point out filth where i see it there is so much garbage in the world today you dont have to watch a horror film to be horrified just turn on the news and then someone goes and makes a film like this a film with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever a film whose plot is entirely based on someones off color joke about a suitable punishment for sex offenders this is true read the wikipedia article a despicable piece of garbage which makes you wonder how someone who would want to make a film like this could ever be offered a camera with which to film it the concept of the film is neither interesting nor creative its just gross and gross should never be a reason to make a film good entertainment in my opinion should either enlighten or encourage even dark films or horror films have the ability to enlighten but does nothing worth mentioning in a positive manner its just trash pure absolute filth beyond the shock factor lies a lackluster film with crappy acting and ridiculous dialog you dont care about the characters because there is no background for which to care the filmmakers here failed at every aspect of their craft do yourself a favor and do not watch this film in fact if you ever meet me please punch me in the face i deserve it for having stupidly sat through this deplorable piece of rubbish,cruel
this movie was just awful and if you want to even watch this movie at all dont just forget this movie was even made this movie had some much shock value come with it i had to watch it and i was disgusted and mad by the end of it this is not what horror films are supposed to be like i mean hostel was a gross movie but it was good had a good ending and everything but this movie was gross and had a awful story please do not pay money to watch this movie dont rent it or anything just forget it even exists you will be thanking yourself if you dont this movie sucks really bad and also it has a foreign feel to it and that makes it way worse in the long run with how bad the movie is so if you see it just put it down i have never been this passionate about a movie ever,cruel
this movie has it all the crazy nazisurgeon stupid american girls freaky experiments and stupid policemen one of them apparently unable to speak or refusing to say something without seeing a paycheck this could be actually a good bmovie but it is so frustrating serious and therefor just laughable dump not everything is bad some of the acting is alright maybe it would have been even better but you probably need a lot of time to convince the actors they all that crap is happening and that this is actually working if you have to spend a lot of time on that there is not much time left for directing the probably best feature is the camerawork this person made really some descent shoots although not very inspiring or creative but all working very well it still doesnt cover that the script could fit on the manual of a scalpel some of the shoots are just they toooooo long to bring the movie to its 90 minutes altogher boring boring boring and very unnecessary badly written full of clichs and nonsense,cruel
but this was beyond bad i mean i really really like cheesy horror films but this was it wasnt horror just horriblethe only thing this movie had going for it was the grotesque idea of the and the disturbing visuals that went along with it beyond that it was just stupid after the initial surgery i found myself wondering how can this movie be 92 minutes long the answer drag it out padded with stupidity why didnt the drown itself in the swimming pool why didnt they kill themselves sooner why did voller not show any signs of being drugged after drinking the waterthen again maybe im just not cultured enough for a film like this,cruel
being a canadian sometimes it takes a while before some movies reach us and with new formats for watching films popping up in increasing numbers across the united states sometimes it takes even longer to see some films but when the toronto after dark film festival announced that first sequence would be their closing night gala film i knew this was an unmissable opportunity and even after seeing the film almost two months ago i cannot help but shake the feeling that i saw something truly specialif you read anything online about movies or you follow movie news in any capacity chances are you have heard about the film developed a certain notoriety for the very idea it is based around for those few who have not heard the film concerns a mad scientist and former surgeon named dr heiter dieter laser who kidnaps three victims two of them being female american travelers looking for fun across europe and stitches them together through their mouths and rears into one organism as an experimentnow i am not one to judge anothers twisted imagination but obviously the idea the film centres around is inherently disgusting and repulsive add to that the tagline of being 100 medically accurate and you have a film that will divide audiences right down the middle between people who have the morbid curiosity to see tom sixs heinous and wildly original vision or those who find the idea revolting and nauseating one watch of the trailer will likely divide audiences even further as it gives a taste of what you are in for should you venture into the film and rather sadly it ruins a bit of the surprise of what heiters creation looks likei only say it ruins some of the surprise because knowing what the creation looks like before seeing the film hinders its impact the sheer idea of what it looks like and the physics and accuracy behind it are significantly more disgusting than the film actually is sure the film is rather sick and twisted for the majority of time and there are a lot of scenes made explicitly to not be for the easily squeamish but once you get past the idea of itself there is really nothing that should irk repulse or keep you from watching for the remaining period of time you may even find yourself a little disappointed at the limits the film takes and does not take sadly the idea is more horrific than the final product and the hype around that idea has already made the film a genuine success right from the startlooking past the rather slapped together storyline there really is only so much story can go into a film that is more based on an idea than anything else the other reason anyone should seek the film out is lasers performance as dr heiter i cannot recall any recent performance that is nearly as demented as ridiculously overacted as involving as nearly insane or as deliciously evil as lasers this is a character that needs to be seen to be believed laser comes off as both unintentionally hilarious and downright psychotic in every scene he appears in never once does he waver or even consider not putting every ounce of strength he has an actor into this character this is the kind of legendary entire selfinvolving performance people raved about sacha baron cohen pulling off in borat and to a lesser degree brno a few years back but laser makes those performances come off as amateur in comparison he is the real deal and a menacing and truly horrifying actor if i ever saw one he is absolutely perfect in every sense and he sells the idea and the film even better than the title and the hype does no other actor in the film even comes close to how amazing a performance he givesbut there are problems as mentioned the story is a bit of a mess and does not serve any real point other than to get to the moments before and after the is created the haphazard survival story that comes about really does not even attempt to go anywhere and some of the more emotional sequences come off rather silly in the grand scheme of things but the film moves past these elements and does away with them almost like they are nothing the film knows it was made to be about a concept more than it is a cohesive whole and having lasers performance is merely an added benefit that likely was not initially envisioned when it was being scripted six relies too much on the creation of the and in turn laser to keep the film going from start to finish that he allows everything else to become secondary to it but really if anyone goes into this movie expecting anything more they should not be searching for a film like this in the first placeas a filmgoer with full knowledge of going in i came out wildly surprised by the film sure it was not an overly great film and i do think the envelope could have been pushed even further but six has created a wildly original film that manages to be wildly enjoyable but i doubt if i watched it again alone it would have nearly the same effect as it did watching with a crowd this is a movie that practically begs to be watched with more than one person just think of all the drinking games that could come out of it it is a movie that is destined for cult status and the rare movie that lived up to its hype in some degree lets just hope the sequel does not overdo it too much7510this review also appeared on httpwwwgeekspeakmagazinecom,cruel
i wont discuss too much about the plot as most people are aware of the premise a psycho surgeon kidnaps a group of people in his sick attempt to create a he succeedswhat can i say this film is bad but its also quite watchable and youre always wondering what will happen next the actor who plays the surgeon is one of the better villains of recent times he looks dresses and acts creepy as anything weve seen in a while and reminded me of a german hannibal lecter you may feel that his performance is over the top at times but hes clearly crazy so normal character rules dont applythe film is not without its share of tense moments the scene where the surgeon takes 2 girls into his home after their car breaks down is suitably eery you know these girls are in trouble and soon enough they know it too there are a few escape attemtps before we reach the halfway point and we see 3 people stitched together mouth to anus and yes there is a brief scene involving a number 2like many horrors there are a number of moments that should annoy you as a viewer such as the inept cops towards the end wheres the back up fellas and your police radios and the japanese mans failure to kill the surgeon when he has a clear and easy chance to do so instead opting to crawl away if it were me id have stabbed the surgeon repeatedly in the neck but nooooooo not this guy all in all is a mixed bag its not as sick or scary as you might be led to believe but it does have a tense atmosphere the acting by all is good and with the surgeon we have one of the better villains of recent years i recommend it for horror fans but dont expect it to blow you away its not texas chainsaw and its not the exorcist it has more in common with one of the saw sequels,cruel
my friend stayed over and watched directed by tom six with me last nightthe worst best part was dr heiter played by dieter laser he was truly creepy looking and his acting made you feel like perhaps he was this scary in reality too the film was about his being a surgeon he used to separate conjoined twins but then becomes fixated with joining living thingsnaturally this leads to his ideal of a connected by sewing their mouths to each others butts so that they share one digestive track implausible in the longterm and hilarious so i was glad when one of the three victims died from infection that was the most medically accurate partthe film was not scary but hilarious i just couldnt stop laughing at what idiots the characters are one of the two female leads had the chance to escape but hides instead of smashing the window to escape straight away and the japanese guy played by akihiro kitamura who is also a captive actually stabs dr heiter with a scalpel but only in the foot and leg he goes crazy and bites him but instead of using his chance to kill the crazy doctor or knock him unconscious at least he chooses to just attempt to run away difficult with two girls surgically attachedi had no real sympathy for the characters because their survival instincts were poor i like it when characters truly try their best and are beaten down but these three were mainly moronic and therefore deserved it the very few chances they had to escape they wasted completelyas ridiculous as this film was its worth watching because its one of the funniest films ive seen in a long time and wasnt too badly shot,cruel
i watched this movie without having ever heard of it and barely looked at the blister thinking  cool this could involve some ugly multilimbed creature chasing random american teenagersthe only thing i got right was about the american teensthe movie is really bad slow and lacks any credibility or realism both the script and the actors are very badexcept dieter who seems to be struggling with his boring role as a mad scientistas a german fellow i have to put something right  germany is not a thirdworld country we actually can use our cellphones anywhere and we do not recommend running into some scary wood to get better receptionwell i can barely hope the sequelprobably involving an even longer will be better which should not be very difficult  i also hope it will cut out the scat which the director probably expected to be shocking and turn out to be very lame and unrealisticim sorry for all the people who actually payed to see this crap,cruel
is nothing more than just flat trash the fact that this film was made and got 2 sequels is beyond methis film is about two chicks jenny and lindsay who are traveling through the woods to find help because their car broke down and its pouring rain they find a house in the middle of the woods and it is owned by a man named heiter heiter takes these two women in and drugs them they wake up downstairs and are becoming of his experiment to make a new digestive system by forming a with 3 people he also kidnaps a japanese man katsuro and thus he forms it the three must try their best to escape the clutches of this evil doctorthis film was made to creep people out but it failed it didnt creep me out or even disgusted me it simply made me laugh at how idiotic it was the acting was very lame it seemed like none of the actors tried at all and the story was very stupid it tried to have some decent horror elements to it but it just was a nut punch nonethelessis simply put a misfire that should be avoided,cruel
i think people only rate this in a wrong way because of its disgusting and horrific elements but i must say i couldnt look away the acting isnt very good and the shots composition is quite boring but you can clearly tell there was some form of passion behind the film and it was super entertaining and how a horror film should make me feel,cruel
i watched knowing i would hate it utterly obviously the absurd premise had to result in the most idiotic exploitation film ever created right well yes and no for a movie that seems to have been made only to make the squeamish run for their lives the most shocking thing is just how ridiculous it is the actual procedure is so astonishingly ludicrous that it causes the mind to reel between giggles fits of nausea and stunned incredulity so many insane yet practical questions arise that cannot even be expressed here in spite of this or perhaps because of it there is one shining saving grace and that is the character of dr heiter dieter laser basically hes a misanthropic psychopath w a licence to practice medicine and uses his skills to bring about his insane vision having been a worldrenowned surgeon specializing in the separation of conjoined twins heiter now dreams of putting bodies together in an abominable multiple subject reconjoining process that defies nature and just about everything else is the end product of heiters madness as unspeakable as it sounds not really its about what one would imagine it to be sort of a perverse conga line of actors who have certainly earned their wages the hard way overall this is a movie about mad science gone horribly awfully irredeemably wrong some have found deep social commentary  satire in it a grand subtext about conformity or being done to by the system or the man perhaps but on a more visceral gut level its less than the sum of its parts,cruel
its concept is truely original its quite a suprise no sadistic mind has come up with it before thats why its such a pity its execution is rather moderate mainly because of the characters too excessive acting making it feel staged the stage and the circumstances feeling too clean for a horror too much detail especially around the operation itself and the tormenting of the appears to have been left out the abduction of the truckdriver and the attemt to escape that couldve easily have been left out and instead showing the abduction of the asian guy and a better ending the surgeon being too nice to his experiment as a sadist and the start of a horror featuring two pretty girls getting lost is unoriginal to say the leastas mentioned before the end couldve been a lot better it screamed for a section where the last living section of the would cut the tissue of the other sections with the piece of glass for her to be able to get help with the bits of the others still attached to her face,cruel
watched it for the first time yesterday with my gf didnt know what to expect certainly didnt expect to laugh as much also we were both genuinely interested about how the experiment would work had a few tropes two teenagers and a cabin in the woods kind of thing but it worked fine remember this is a bargain basement movie it did a good job well done guys just get past the first 5 minutes of hammy acting and the rest is quite enjoyable indeed contrary to popular belief very little gore more the suggestion of torture and violence but that is often way more chilling,cruel
so anyway everybodys wondering how is it possible that i havent seen yet and so now came the time to finally see the thing by my girlfriend was sleeping because its too scary for her i can tell you that and because of this acid all by myself but it was very beautiful the camera lightning the lights the music the special effects it has a very greatest story was very original and very intriguing even though it was a its just until the soul knight what is this what is going to happen now and then i thought the unexpected ending very great im not going to tell you what it was going to be but its really left me a big appreciation for the sequels that im still going to see,cruel
if you often avoid this kind of movie because you dont like seeing gore then there is actually a surprising lack of violence in this theres some physical conflict of course and a few glimpses of medical gore but its not the bloodfest that one might be inclined to assume it isits rare that a movie has a premise that can vex you by itself rather than just intrigue you i admire that this movie broke away from the horrors that take themselves just a tad too seriouslyis this a perfect movie no it may be a bit hysterical but it definitely brings something fresh to the tablea typical slasher is about some silent unhinged killer hacking various youths aparthere we have someone relatively stable a professional not killing right away but joining people together in the intelligent calculated way we dont get to just briefly feel bad for a dead character and move on to the ones that are still alive but see the victims live long into the ordeal in a way that is at once kind of real yet unrealit has a sense of humour it has to i know the whole thing feels a bit like schoolboy scatology but it uses that to its strength at times daring you to laugh and you just dont quite know how to feel about what youre watching its not a horror comedy its just a horror that deftly applies dark humour you dont want to laugh at and is all the better for itdr heiter is a fascinating antagonist the guy who plays him radiates menace and evil from his first appearance to how delectably he savours playing with his creation you watch him hoping for an origin story but of course an actual prequel would ruin the mystique and be a bad ideafew movies have nauseated me in quite the special way this one does its more than the physicality of its story but that does play a part its getting to watch a man who has gained a prestigious place in society from is intelligence and skill revel in his degradation of the human form to an objectdare i sayan insect  yes i know s are not insects but let me have this oneit doesnt fetishize death and dismemberment the way a slasher might its more about an apathy to the sanctity of life toward very personal goals that is the crux of this movie refreshingly nihlisticadmittedly six did run out of idea toward the end and the final leg of this picture kind of annoys me but over all im glad i saw it it is fr superior to a lot of the derivative trash one is more likely to see,cruel
why not indeed its not well acted but concept is different i suppose,cruel
what a poopy sequencenobody does anything correctly so i guess everybody deserved to dieidk man not worth the hype and not as gross and disturbing as everybody kinda says it isthe second one is the disgusting though,cruel
a mad scientist kidnaps and mutilates a trio of tourists in order to reassemble them into a created by stitching their mouths to each others rectums this should be all you need to know does this even need a review i mean seriously people what do you think is going to happen director tom six takes horror to a new level by bringing it down a level and people who are down on that level are going to level with a film about virtually nothing and i mean nothing three people attached to each other by the mouth an asian is the head of the by who a semi retired mad scientist who the hell is this guy and why is he wanting a for a pet at one point in the movie he actually has it in its back yard where the asian has to use the rest room and uh really people what do you think happens theyre attached by the mouths the film is utterly pointless pure trash and if anybody needs to be turned into a its the entire crew who worked on this movie with six as the tail end 5 out of 10 stars for the great cinematography seriously people its the only thing good,cruel
but unfortunately this movie does not really offer much else to be proud ofthe performance of dieter laser is really impressive and fortunately he is strong enough to carry the movie on his shoulders which two german girls do what they can unfortunately they have their mouth full for a long time so the actresses take a long time to make it difficult also have to get around on the floor mr kamikaze is surprisingly the second best actor because he communicates all the time in his native language does not understand him and he manages to convince through gestures and facial expressions to communicate with all people and even to communicate with the audiencebut the whole movie is such a boring oneman show that i can not understand how one could even believe to be able to fill a whole movie with this dry concept much less a horror movieso in four words boring monotonous unruly but hardly disgusting,cruel
the title is not really that bad once you overlook the deranged scientist act as most of the gore is left to imagination it best well described as a scientist who is trying to find his meaning though vague he begins off trying to experiment on joining rather than separation which i believe was a result of lack of appreciation of his own work as a surgeon thereby leading to the path he followed,cruel
this is a movie that goes with my guilty pleasure when it comes to disturbing movies with shocking content i watched these types of movies to shock me and though it didnt shock me like i was expecting it to when i went into it initially it was still a good movie in my eyes the acting was decent the disturbingshocking content of the movie was there and enjoyable and overall i loved the portrayal of the villian done by dieter laserso overall good movie that i wouldnt recommend unless youre into the shocking side of cinema or your with friends and you want to watch them freak out,cruel
this rather gripping tale is one i stumbled upon recently via netflix i had read about it and out of boredom decided to search for it  check it out i will say straight out that if you are going into watching this hoping for any outrageous gore you will be severely disappointed this is neither hostel or saw its disturbing in its own way but not in a gore hound sort of way its way too surgical  precise in its execution to satisfy any of that sort of fetish what we have here is a dark psychological thriller thats ripe with tension one built within framework which is most decidedly shock and awe driven its power is in interestingly enough in the fact that it shows you so little you know what it is youre viewing and you feel wrong for looking but at the same time you cant exactly look away either it becomes in effect its own guilty pleasure it shows you only what it needs to very little gore as ive mentioned  just enough bare bones for you to get a glimpse into the fantasy of this maniac surgeon he has you he has your attention rather you want him to or not the power to look away is no longer yours youve become his captive audience  thats precisely how he planned it all along,cruel
so overall it was an okay film there were some suspenseful parts but the way the overall plot played out and the way it was made kind of took away from that if this would have been made with the same mindset as the saw movies this would have been one of the best of the decade i feel like the actors were kind of forced into different situations when there was an obviously better choice laid in front of them especially when the cops arrive at the very end when you have a search warrant usually more than two cops arrive at the scene also when the main cop opens the door and find the a real cop would have called for backup immediately and not left them there even if he did hear some sort of distress from his co worker that too was dumb because the other cop had a gun and the dr did not like hello,cruel
ok its a b movie but if you are looking for something creepy you are in the right place i found a small review in a facebook group and decided i could give it a try and i am quite happy i didive been looking for years for a movie that would leave me disgusted for real and i found it at lastspoiler alert at the beginning there are two beautiful girls in a hotel and its quite clear they are on holiday and looking for fun they decide to go out in a club but they get lost renting a car in a foreign country is something pretty dumb if you are a girl and using it at night for going at a club is even worse but the damage is done they walk a lot and find the beautiful isolated house of a surgeon who offers them help of course the surgeon is a psycho and puts the girls on drugs they wake up in a sort of hospital with a man who is soon killed by the surgeon after a while a japanese boy becomes hostage of the surgeon and finally we find out whats going on the surgeon wants to create a by bounding the heads of an hostage with the anus of an other hostageone of the girls tries to escape but she fails miserably the operation seems quite successful at first even though the japanese boy spends his time shouting and the surgeon starts to train like a dog two policemen come to ask about people disappearing in the neighborhood but the doctor send them away the guys bound together try to escape but the japanese guy ruins everything committing suicide the policemen came back but the doctor kills one of them while the other is killed few minutes later even though he kills the doctor at the same time quite confusing by words i know the two girls are left alone but one of them dies of infection and the other is left alone screaming and cryingeven though i liked this movie i didnt give it ten stars only because sometimes the dialogs are a little too predictable and the policemen are pretty dumb but its worthy a try,cruel
the biggest question when watching first sequenceis why what was the motive for the doctor to try this hideous experiment why was this movie even made if it wanted to be shocking why cut down on the gore and real terror this film about a mad german surgeon famous for separating conjoined twins who now wants to create triplets conjoined by their gastric systems is just revolting nonsense the tension in the last scenes involving the policemen and some believable ways it was shot earn the film whatever stars i have given it but from a script standpoint it is utter nonsense the acting is passable but this is not a film to be put into a class with any great horror film,cruel
sadly no although does try if you dont know its about a mad scientist in germany who decides to sew three people together ill spare you the gory details in order to create the titular insect if that idea appeals to you then give it a go if  like so many  you think that sounds like the worst idea imaginable then you should steer well clear of itso if you do choose to go ahead and spend an hour and a half watching this nightmare you may be expecting a fair amount of gore oddly enough it doesnt have that much theres not a lot of the red stuff even in the operation scenes this film is about concept the horror of it all comes from the sheer sick mind that youre taking a look into hereand the film is pretty disturbing thats its strong point however it falls down by adhering to pretty much all the general horror clichs and youll find yourself shouting at the characters on screen for their damn silly choicesbasically know what youre getting a disturbingly sick film which probably could have been better written but if youre into this sort of thing the lead performance from the mad scientist should be worth a watch on its own,cruel
after using the timehop app my facebook status after seeing a while ago came up and i thought it might be useful to capture the feelings one might be likely to have after seeing it i just saw for the first time and i  i just  yeahh  i dont know  dont know what to  it was hateful but i dont think i hated it i havent seen anything quite like it before and yet at times it reminded me of other things particularly the tone of spring breakers but where that was tongue in cheek this was tongue in arse it wasnt good but it wasnt the worst thing ive ever seen mel gibsons the beaver and yeah it just happened for an hour and a half and then it stopped  need to watch something nice now maybe some kittens frolicking and stand out in the rain for a bit and never go to the bathroom ever again enigma,cruel
the story is about the highly insane doctor who tries to make a with 3 tourist who happen to get in his hands the maker tom six succeeded in making the most awkward sadistic movie with the most insane doctor character but there is no where in the movie for justifying or reasoning the character from the character perspective well there is nothing conveyed in the movie other than plain crypainsorrow and anger and if there was anything that the creator was trying to say other than that then it was 0 conveyed and how the two cops come in the end its with no meaning to just end the story except for the performance of the artists there is nothing much to look for in the movie,cruel
so youve heard about the movie and are dying to see it expecting a true mind blowing experience well you should know that apart from the idea itself there is nothing really horrifying in this flick the level of blood and gore is unbelievably domesticated  any episode of the saw saga wins hands down and the acting skills are almost nonexistent this movie does not stand up to its fame and i do not understand at all the turmoil it generated any other torture porn movie will give more thrills than this one i would give the idea an 8 but the filming less than zero if you are up for something truly revolting just watch mariah careys glitter  oh this one you wont forget that easily,cruel
movies are or can be many many things nowadays they are just some things a drama with happy ending cgi and 3d the same comedy repeated over and over again when it is about horror the american taste is in charge creepy but still reassuringly in the end i make some exceptions one out of standards lately was drag me to hell this dutch movie does not match that kind of taste at all is disturbing brutal perverted humiliating and still it manage to be funny which is the creepiest part of it i read some people considered the acting poor i wonder if they were watching dieter laser or someone else because that one was astonishing performance i also read there is no plot i wonder what is the plot in the mainstream horror movies though a serial killer killing hot girls and letting clues to the policeheroman some monsters in the wood killing a group of friends except one the evil dead was great the copies are rubbish a devil child is not a master piece but it is far different from the others and genuinely disturbing there is no redemption no happy ending exactly as a horror movie is supposed to be worth to watch there are no doubts,cruel

gosh this movie is one of the most awkward film i have watch when i see the puss in the mouth of the girl i feel that my tummy gets sick and i wanna vomit all the food that i digested i rate this movie 4 because i see there was an effort and they try to scare people dont knock on strangers housethe movie is slightly funny because because of the japanese boy that poop in the mouth of the girl its kinda disgusting but the funny part is when he said kumenasai the movie is like anime because of there exaggerated acting and the police in the movie is kinda lame anyway this movie is not a horror for me its comedy because of the unrealistic scene,cruel
warning some moderate spoilersi am a huge horror film fan who loves a dark disturbing movie but unfortunately i thought this was not what it could have beentom six directed and wrote this movie and im thinking what is going on in his head to create such a disturbing movie and weirdly enough he came up for the idea of when he was drunkthe plot is two young attractive vulnerable female tourists in germany brake down in the middle of the woods and unfortunately for them they knock on the door of a psychopathic man who is a retired surgeon whos expertise was separating conjoined twins he also kidnaps a japanese tourist and creates something that is a disgrace to human nature the insane veteran doctor plans to attach his three victims via their gastric systems and finally create his sick fantasywith grisly special effects and details about how they was made this movie has made its self to be one of the most disturbing and visually disgusting movies of its time it was a bad and messed up idea because there are hardcore horror fans out there like me who like a real grisly horror but it just wasnt good at all there are aspects of this movie i thought was good like the build up to the creation and the character dr heiter was a very chilling man whos obsession with conjoined twins led him to something inhumanfor me the script wasnt that good with a lot of bad language and some strong sexual references which is okay but taken over the limit a bitthe most chilling moment in the movie is when dr heiter says in a very dark and chilling way i dislike humans and that for me is when the girls fate was sealed and gave out a very chilling atmosphere and made anyone watching have there hairs go up on the backs of their necksi have watched lots of disturbing gruesome horror movies but this is one of the most dark disturbing and awful movies ive ever seen and the most grisly and disturbing part of the movie is watching the surgery watch in horror has the doctor makes gut wrenching incisions in grisly detail and create something that is against nature in all its rightoverall it was a bad idea but should have been made better but if you have a weak stomach probably best you steer clear because i almost threw up should have been made better as the script wasnt brilliant and some of the build up was some what ridiculous but when it comes to the horror and gore its very detailed decent acting from unrecognisable actors and actresses but first sequence has made its self one of the most graphic and disturbing movies of our time and i highly recommend it to hardcore horror movie fans who have a strong stomach but dont recommend it to people looking for a good thriller that will win academy awards this will probably win a few razzies and if youre looking for a happy ending this movie isnt for you,cruel
the movie was just grose some times the acting was really poor and the idea of the movie a made out of humans is really sick to tell the truth im a dutch person the movie is nl and i didnt like the movie at all it was supposed to be a horror movie but it was a  i dont have words for it please dont make this kind of movies ever again the ending was poor and some parts were so gore i almost started throwing up im really sorry if you liked the movie but this is what i think of it if you liked the movie please tell me why you liked this sick movie that was my review this was just my first review and my english is not great so please accept my mistakes ssshaha im sure the movie makers didnt listen to wat i said because they made a part 2 and a third part is in made,cruel
shocked to see so many bad reviews i thought this was a solid flick for its genre something new not seen before unlike the whole torture porn thing started by saw hostel etc i enjoyed this movie for what it is disturbing idea and storyline a creepy main character and the start of a trilogy number 2 makes this one seem like a 15 certificate by the way but this was great to introduce the trilogy and really let you know what the whole theme of these movies arefor me personally someone who is a fan of this genre i would give it a solid 7 ps 2 is by far ten times worse and more graphic this first one left a lot to the imagination  its like an introduction for something a lot harder in number 2,cruel
i wont bother explaining the plot as if youre even looking this title up on here youve probably already been told this movie is considered to be the goriest and scariest film of all time many say its too bad for them to even watch it you are stupid if you say those things howeverthe film has little gore at all besides a few second surgery scene and some blood but beyond that its nonexistent im a fan of bodily horror it creeps me out and gives me a thrill because theres nothing scarier than the idea of your own body being completely messed up in horrible ways and thats the horror appeal of this movie the ideain fact the movie has little more to offer than the concept of mouth toanus attachment many of the actors cant be taken seriously and plenty of the plot devices used are unrealistic and laughable with that classic horror movie sense of why would you do thati give the movie a 610 since the idea is so freaky and the fact that the actor that played the villain is great if it would of had better actors better writing and perhaps showed a slight bit more gore it most definitively would of been better it just feels like it doesnt live up to the horrible descriptions you get from friends with netflix and yet it feels like it excels for how bad it should have been,cruel
upon hearing about for the first time i must admit that the concept was pretty revolting to me i tried to make it a point to never ever see it in my entire life however eventually i decided that i maybe should see it so that i can confront it head on and then that would be the end of it so i watched it eventually with a few of my friends it was a mixed bagbasically it is about two girls who wander upon a house that is in the middle of the woods the man who lives there drugs them and ties them down and kidnaps another man and then reveals his plans for them he is a retired surgeon and his plan is to connect the three of themmouth to anusthus making a for an independent filmi guess this film was what i expected the acting is pretty bad except the creepy surgeon guy i thought was good the story is pretty predictable in how it starts outas far as disturbing goesthis film might be one of the most disturbing ideas ever thought about the whole idea of being connected to another persons anus is pretty much as bad as it gets when the gets created and the people see what happened to them it is pretty sad for them i actually felt bad for themits a pretty cheap horror film with a disturbing concept i can not really recommend it but if you like disturbing things happening to people maybe check it out otherwise i would not bother with it,cruel
there are really surprising funny and amazing stuff in this movie its well shot the mad scientist actor is great sometimes youre more feared or deranged than in martyr but why so many 12 years old director mistakes why the first 15 minutes are so incredibly bad with irrational characters behaviors why all characters always during almost all the movie so behave randomly like in prometheus this movie could have become something huge something as crazy as talented as surprising as thrilling as terrifying but finally its just a waste thats so sad anyway its really better than i heard it was good points save it a bit and it could deserve a 5 or a 610 it only depends on your mood,cruel
since its release in 2009 has earned quite the reputation as a downright sickening horror film thats not easily forgotten after finally working up the nerve to watch tom sixs first major studio production i can confirm that it is in fact every bit as gross as rumors have indicated its also completely ridiculousif you havent heard anything about this movie heres the deal dr heiter a retired surgeon who became famous for his ability to successfully separate siamese twins has made it his mission to drug and kidnap those stupid enough to venture near his secluded german homestead he does this in an effort to create the first its pretty much exactly what the name implies heiter explains to his victims that he will remove their kneecaps and sew their mouths to another persons corresponding privatearea to create a chained organism why he wants to do this is never fully explained though were told he successfully completed the procedure on this three rottweilersin short hes bonkersas disturbing as the premise is in and of itself is proof positive that a movie cannot survive on concept alone from the getgo it suffers from the atrocious acting of its two female protagonists lindsay and jenny theyre obnoxious americans who decide to go clubbing while on a tour of europe when their rental car is crippled by a flat tire on a dark country road they venture through the wilderness to try and get help eventually they encounter the good doctor who invites them in for drinks and creepy banterthough its hard not to feel some sympathy for these young ladies because of the utterly horrendous situation we know theyll end up in their idiotic decisions create a servesyouright attitude thats hard to shake this is one of those horror flicks where youll find yourself yelling at the television in a vain attempt to prevent the girls from succumbing to every clich any person with a temporal lobe would know to avoid in the given situationthe movie does start to show some promise once the gutwrenching transformation has taken placei have to imagine part of this has to do with the fact that our two female leads are no longer able to speakbut just as things are looking up in terms of the film mustering a tangible fear factor a rushed resolutionand i use that term very looselyto the whole endeavor brings the proceedings to a screeching halt as was the case with the first third of the film what we see happen in the end is the result of shoddy writing and nonsensical decisions by all of the characters were otherwise supposed to be emotionally invested ini cant resist the irony implicit in the title which accurately reflects my assessment blunders from scene to scene as if fatally wounded and is never able to gain the momentum or complexity that could have made it one of the horror greatsbetter luck with the next sequence,cruel
in tom sixs greatest achievement is he has delved deep into the human psyche and managed to identify an inherent nightmare humans have of being surgically attached to one anothers anuses simultaneously he has produced a piece of horror which may appeal to a niche audience to whom rimming is quite simply a way of life ultimately though a big part of the movie relies on feeling repulsed by the perverted gratification taken by the quasinazi doctor as he tends to his experiment as well as the horror there is also a strong theme of sexual fetishism sadism and coprophagia running through this memorable but depraved tale bigbadmoviereviews,cruel
i dont get all the imbeciles and this fetish they have for putting a movie down based on how accurate it was such as mr doctor reviewer there the fact his review was voted most helpful says something more disturbing about our culture than the film everyone is in such a rush to proclaim himself smarter than a movie if you want realism go read a textbook you sad lost sacksisnt really frightening because it has a palpapable lighthearted streak running through it no pun intended for example when you see a shot of the evil doctor thin scrawny unfeeling and with a baton under his arm the comparison to an ss officer or the much maligned dr mengele the medical version of the boogeyman is apparentstill the mere idea of this film is so abominable and downright disgusting that you cant help but marvel that anyone even dared make it can you imagine the actresses who participated in this calling home hey ma i just landed a major role what was my part oh middle girl between what you sayanyway this movie was fun gross and entertaining anyone who even bothers to put it down cause of how realistic it was is probably the same kind of buffoon who would try to beat a twoyearold at chess,cruel

if you are like me then you have seen the south park episode about this movie with the apples centipad after seeing how that episode went i figured the original film must be better  boy was i wrongif you havent seen the episode or have no idea what this movie is about do not read furtherfirst off the entire point of the movie is to shock you by the very idea of however the idea itself is the shock not the crappy way it was done in this movie so once you know it theres nothing to itthe acting is terrible you hardly see anything the dialogue is stupid even though a foreign language sounds more believable it still doesnt and the plot is virtually non existentthe characters themselves are so unbelievably its borderline a comedy and not in the good wayseriously this is just one of those movies of you had an idea but had no idea what to do with it,cruel
a negative review here because the film is repulsive ghastly or strange is inappropriate most persons who saw this film knew its substance beforehand and what they were getting themselves into i feel for the rare person who did not yikes the film was specifically designed to shock and pervert just like other films in the gorehorror genre tom six should in fact be credited for creating a product as original and intriguing as it was overthetop and cheesy the novelty alone is exploration worthythe films undoing however is the lazy and paltry writing the inability to tell a coherent story around this experiment especially the what and why is beyond frustrating for example we never learn why the madman is actually engaging in this experiment why mouthtoanus we are simply forced to conclude that he is either insane or has a god complex  both lazy copouts,cruel
no its actually like being dared to drink someone elses vomit and doing it unfortunately this film made me realize some people shouldnt write or produce movies its a shocker hard to believe theres going to be a third installment i pity everyone involved ever been at a restaurant with the guy at the table who takes the conversation way too far the one who has to say whats on his mind no matter how sick it is humors one thing but this is just plain freaknow if steven spielberg had never made a movie it wouldve been a crime conversely that tom six made this film is almost a crime i read a review that said this started out as a joke and i could believe that but if thats the case it shouldve stayed that way its like a few people got together downed a stack of booze and drugs then decided to make a movie about the worst thing they could think of then didbeneath it all its like the dutch writer of this tom six holds an underlying disdain for germans the mengele type doctor well acted by the way he was freaky the perverted fat guy in the car the cops werent bad but their actions portrayed them more like they were on the first day of the job as opposed to seasoned professionals what policeman worth their salt would let a weirdo shout at them and take it but then six extended it to the japanese guy and the american chicks im not american german or japanese but its like he was taking pot shots at everyone and he definitely didnt keep his powder dryto add insult to injury the plot is so full of holes no matter how ditzy you might be theres some things youd never do especially when traveling and the girls made every mistake in the book the actions of the captives was really weird too opportunities missed to raise the alarm or nullify the doctor that made me cringei quite like off beat movies toxic avenger is a fave and i love horror but this was so bad youd have more chance of a cat playing a beethoven piano concerto on a tv station that aired it instead of the super bowl than enjoying this its just wrong on so many levels but i give 1 star to the maniacal doctor in several parts dieter laser looked as maniacal as you can get sure glad hes not my doctor i think id just kill myself rather than rock up to an appointment with himyes this film is the poster boy for the worst dressed at a bad dress up party or the saying well thats 90 minutes ill never get back dont waste your time with it if youve been dared to watch it and will then i feel for you this film makes attack of the killer tomatoes look like an academy award winning movie in every category truly the worst film i think ive ever seen definitely leaves an impression its just the wrong one that is unless you have sadomasochistic tendencies then youre in for a treat watch this again or drink vomit wheres a mug,cruel
a friend of mine convinced me to see this movie i didnt think it would be any good sadly i was right the acting done by the two girls is horrible in the beginningthough i felt like they really found the right guy for the mad scientist i dont even feel like its a horror movie since its not scary at all just disgusting some kind of background would have been nice more than what is given about the scientist i mean did he just wake up one day and was a complete loony or what and the story didnt make sense the cops were i dont know unreal what kind of cops behave that way i love bad horror movies but this take bad to a whole new level,cruel
zero is too good a rating for this pathetic nonsense let alone 1 to call this something which pushes boundaries is the most misguided and blind thing anyone could say to push boundaries is to do something nobody else was capable of or better than anyone else could this could have been done 100 years ago with great ease it is not groundbreaking in any way anyone with a camera could make it nobody in their right mind would want to thats all this does not spring from a persons imagination it springs from someones warped lack of moral or artistic decency it didnt even shock me it just saddens me it is truly pathetic to even call it a film is to credit it with artistic merit it doesnt deserve it is drivel there is no artistic merit acting direction writing production are all the lowest level the idea is majorly sick but the idiot making it couldnt even do it right for instance the girls moan and gasp in ways it is impossible to with you mouth covered by anything if you try to reenact their noises with your mouth open under your hand you will find you cannot do it the unrealistic nature of how it all happens is just one addition to how pathetic this putrid nonsense is this is not well made or intelligent enough to influence a normal adult but the only reason this should be banned is the shocking fact that many children i have taught in schools have sadly seen this an uneducated mind without sufficient guidance could be harmed by this this kind of grot can make a child or easily influenced person see the abnormal sick depravity as normal and lessen their perception of real human suffering i know this when i see children who watch this and similar grime laugh at documentaries of the holocaust that is how low this film is,cruel
the girl okay um i dont even know what i should say about it i think i need to rewatch it because it was so good i dont even know this movie was so something that i wouldnt normally watch it was a very interesting flick and i had to pee during the movie but i didnt want to go because it was so good i love how he just kidnapped random people and sewed them together im gonna watch the third one when it comes out 1010 the dude i thought it was an abomination i didnt like anything about it and it honestly made me sick to my stomach i never want to watch it again nor do i plan on watching the sequel i did like one part and that was the ending when he got shot in the forehead thats it oh and when he got stabbed in the leg by the foreign dude 510 now for my actual review this is the reviewer for whomever has read my reviews before this is me i do not want to watch this movie i think that the thought of a is the most disgusting and vile thing ever and i am ashamed of my friend the girl who loved and didnt go pee during the movie and she loved the second one which was just absolutely worse not that i would know for i never saw it or the first ill probably see it at some point but ill avoid it for as long as i possibly can,cruel
dutch writerdirector tom six has created a memorable horror film one ill never forget mr six may be seriously disturbed dr josef heiter captures two american tourists whose car breaks down near his house lindsay and jenny are drugged and when they wake up in a small operating room with a japanese man katsuro the good doctor informs them that he is used to separating siamese twins and now will attempt to sew his guests together mouth to anus and create a single digestive system the surgery is brutal starting with the severing of the knee ligaments to prevent his visitors from trying to escape after the three are attached heiter walks them around like a pet and watches them eat each others feces do not watch this after dinner two detectives visit to investigate the disappearance of the two girls and when one leaves for a search warrant the doctor manages to add the second cop to his pet making it a four person other police return to the house and a shootout occurs between the law and the medicine man if the description so far hasnt discouraged you sit back and watch mr sixs warped vision,cruel
i want to sew tom sixs mouth to my ass so he can eat my s it wont be as painful as this filmdont get me wrong although im not a fan of the sort of splattergore this film is associated with i thought it as actually kind of tame in terms of on screen violence after hearing so much i expected the kind of movie where one character spills more blood than could be contained in the bodies of 5 people instead it was just sort of sickno doubt the concept of being forced to s in someone elses mouth is sick even worse of your the one whose mouth is being sa in but even describing the film sounds less like a horror movie and more like bob saget telling the aristocrats and then the mother she takes her knitting needle and sews her husbands a to her mouth which he proceeds to s in and the talent agent asks what do you call that act and the father lets out one last spurt of diarrhea into his wifes mouth and says the aristocrats but the sickness of the film isnt what gets me its the fact that despite all this it never really goes anywhere its really kind of boring it picked up in a few places but it never really felt like it really got moving it just stopped the main portion was just them crawling around the floor it wasnt that impressive as either a good horror movie or a good gross out movie i feel like it was just tom six making a film of either some sick fantasy about shing in peoples mouths or some sick high school joke about shing in peoples mouths either way the most redeeming quality about this film is that it isnt iinow take how needlessly offensive that review was and you may as well have seen this moviefirst sentences from my review on rottontomatoes,cruel
after watching the first movie it was my expectation that this would be just as bad and it was although at times the acting was good it was missing something when i watch a movie and an actor is just nor believable it ruins everything that is good about that movie as i am so distracted i just want to walk outthe storyline was not very strong and the filming in my opinion was not what people look for when going to a cinema this movie is the perfect example of why people are turning to sharing movies with each other over the internet it is just a waste of money and time sitting in a cinema which you do not want to leave because you have paid good money to watch something that was just not ready to be releasedif producers are going to continue producing this type of entertainment they must not expect people to willingly pay to watch it i am sure with a rewrite and a good producer this movie could have created a great fan base as the ideas behind it are fantastic it could have encouraged a whole new genre of movies and been entertainment that people are prepared to pay to see this movie just disappoints on too many levels to even try to analyze it more than to say i gave it 3 stars for the idea and took seven away because of the conversion of the idea to the screen,cruel
amazingly its worseso we all know whats going to happen the film goes after that shock factor of people being instantly disgusted at the notion of the filmbut thats as bad as it gets here that one idea one premise of the film is dragged painfully out over the hour and a half of the filmnothing else happens in the film there is a of three people for no reason theres nothing for the gore fans either as you see very little throughout the filmi thought there would be something else going on in the film anything obviously my slight expectations were two highexactly what it says on the tin,cruel
i had always wondered about this film as i heard a lot of people talk about ithaving just watched it i was hoping for much more as a horror fan but with a weak cast of unusually bad german actorswhich i think is rare these daysit was for me the weakness in this film and i have to say the ending was rather strange and i expected much much morethis director could of done much better but instead made a very disturbing sick filmi was just watching and waiting for something to happen but nothing cameeven when the two german police officers were introduced i thought at last some action but in fact they brought about this really weak tv series feel to the film,cruel
well first of all and i intend this as a reply to most negative reviews you must judge this movie for what it is a horror movie of course its not medically accurate of course it portrays a bunch of young actors with bad acting skills getting tortured of course the plot is thin and revolves around a fairly simple yet very shocking idea what the hell did you guys expect from a horror movie now as far as horror movies are concerned this is pretty darn good actually and belongs up there with some classics like texas chainsaw massacre and hellraiser so yes if you intend to see a feature length movie of dr house youve come to the wrong address if mindless and gruesome violence is what you want then come join the party,cruel
with a limited release and a not so appealing name first sequence didnt fair well in the box office but due to the sickening content and an apparently facinating concept movie buffs all over buzz over iti watched this film last night on syfy channel a channel which plays series religiously i suppose torture porn lovers will adore this movie or even splatter fans but i a slasher fan didnt find this film awfully appealing i didnt dislike this film it just lacks character development and acting to be fair screams and moans make up 7580 of dialoguei do aim to make my reviews of films longer than this but i cant find the correct way to describe the film its one of them films that every one has to see even if they dont want toin summary its an alright film at a push but not for the faint hearted,cruel
when i heard all of the buzz about this movie and how scarycreepy it was i had to see it its about a doctor who sews three humans together to make a thats really all there is to it no sub plots or anything like that just a so when watching it as i said i was expecting a really gory horror movie watching it though it doesnt do horror or gore well at all it does however pull off black comedy extremely well i was laughing through out the whole movie maybe im jaded or just a freak but the premise didnt unsettle me at all it made me laugh at how ridiculous it was then you have the doctor who is just over the top creepy the fact that doesnt speak english and then the doctor training the like a dog it all just made me laugh even the horrible ending for the girl was just suppose to be so over the top horrible that it was just funny all in all it was enjoyable but for reasons that rather surprised me id definitely recommend seeing it,cruel
i heard about this movie and thought it was such a disgusting idea for a movie i just had to watch it i think if you are a horror fan you will enjoy it for what it is it is not a gore fest of a film but it is repulsive the main character of the movie the german surgeon is one very scary and deranged guy and i think the acting from this guy is great from the moment that you are introduced to him you know straight away that he is not going to be a nice chap and he certainly is not there is not really to much in the way of a great story or plot but these kind of films i dont think really need it to be honest the whole way through this movie i felt very uncomfortable watching but i suppose that is the whole idea of it its not really a movie that i would watch again but i think if you are a horror fan i think there is a lot to be enjoyed here sort of i am going to give it a five out of ten because although it did make me feel quite uncomfortable there was no way i wasnt going to see it through to the end,cruel
the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said what would you do if your lips were sown to your friends butt and you had to eat their poop we may have all questioned something odd like that but they took it to a whole new levelim not really sure how to rate this movie when i first heard of it my thoughts were along the lines of eeew gross why would anyone make a movie about that then ill admit my morbid curiosity got the best of me so tonight i braved up and sat down to watch iton one side the movie is gruesome shocking disgusting and creepy on the other hand the movie is gruesome shocking disgusting and creepy these characteristics you see are both good and bad by the end of the movie i felt horrified partially because i saw the movie and partially because part of me liked it while the subject matter is something i would never have thought of the movie was done fairly well as in standard modern horror film good which to be honest isnt that good except to a small niche of people but regardlessthe movie would not have worked however without the ultimate creepinessthe doctor himself his demeanor prowess and mysteriousness somehow makes it all completeso would i recommend this movie maybe if you are a fan of shocking visually graphic horror movies like the saw series or some of the foreign horror movies along the same lines this is probably a good bet for you but if you get sick just watching oldschool horror please skip this movie,cruel
this film is being branded  the sickest movie of all time and its  gut churning but please whatever you do dont believe the hype the films ideas is twisted if it was performed in real life to its credit but nothing in this movie will make you puke your guts out and their is a lot sicker out there however i would recommend this movie to the horror fan as its very different but its reasonably watchable but nothing scary in my eyes their is far more sicker out their but its got its fame as some people brand it the sickest movie ever made when its is not sick at all just over hyped by the non horror watchers who hasnt seen films like cannibal holocaust,cruel
i have seen with my boyfriend we watched it after watching the south park spoof on it we had no idea what we were in store for admittedly we had to turn our heads away from the screen for about half of the movie but the viewer unbelievably disgusted is saved a bit from the horror of the images the bandages around the procedure areas are never removed saving us the grace of seeing any detail of anustolips there is also only one bathroom scene throughout the movie and yes it is a very hard watch very hard i found the movie to be more visual and thought sparked of the visual than anything else theres a lot of gore but its more the imagination of actually having to experience this that gets to you yes it is visually striking and youll wonder for days when you can finally forget the images but the most striking part of the movie is the personal trauma and humiliation these people have to go through and share its a movie to watch yet avoid if you do watch it talking about it a lot will help you cope with the horror your eyes took in,cruel

what is there to say about not much other than the fact that its a great gimmick say what you will about tom six but this twisted idea practically markets its self the movies premise has tons of shock value when spoken when seen its not really all that shocking much of the horror of is largely implied it isnt all that graphic at all as the surgical wounds are largely coveredis this movie really all that scary no and i dont think fear is what is what is intended here tom six is essentially the ringmaster of a freak show and we are meant to buy a ticket and watch i suppose its amusing for a little bit but is a concept a gimmick that isnt interesting or scary enough to fill a feature length film i think the only people who will sit through to the end with gripping fear and interest are those whose greatest fear is surgically being forced to eat crap and i say all the power to them the rest of us will get over the idea fast if shock value is all six has going for him this should have been shot as a short film that being said i cant completely condemn a man no matter how sick he may be that can come up with a concept that immediately shocks to the point of revulsion and interestso what does six do with the rest of the time he has to fill this picture the truth is not much and for the large part the film feels very tedious when we get over the initial shock the doesnt appear until forty minutes in and the rest of the film is spent with two amazingly stupid horror heroines dieter laser is fun in a campy way as the mad scientist and six relies on him to keep our interest laser doesnt take this role very seriously and seems to be having a ball going over the top the performance is kind of fun in a bad movie kind of way but it cant be taken seriously laser is less than subtle in his mad scientist role to the point where any chance at believability of this scenario is gone this guy practically screams nutso i cant help but not feel sorry for our stupid heroines when they drink water from an open container from this guys house hell these heroines are practically asking to be a part of this that being said in a way i kind of admire laser for having fun with the role because i think anyone who took it seriously would need to be sent to the funny farm you cant play straight when your objective is to make a whats left to ask is is this meant to be taken seriously i cant really answer that its filmed pretty straight but it also acknowledges how ridiculous the scenario is is this a good or a bad film its about as good as a movie about being surgically forced to eat poop can be and ill be playing ebert here so take from it what you will,cruel
watched with my grand father but he would watch anything and loves those cheesy sci fi filmsits a good concept and worth a watch plain on that reason alone but as a whole film it does not grasp youit should be remade by a bigger and better movie company with a better script and maybe just maybe they might win an oscarfinal review worth a watch and cant help to think would not mind being in the middle of the if eva mendez was in front and someone i did not like say nicki minaj was at the backplus that would be a big booty on the end of the chainand i have to fill in one more sentence or it will not submit my review so that should do it,cruel
anybody shocked by this film should have known by the description of it not to watch it the only real shock in this film is the idea  this may be disgusting but after that the film is pretty restrained in its violence and gore thankfully so  i would much rather watch this than any of the saw films or other copycats this film had some good elements already stated in other reviews  the dr is fantastic  really over the top creepy his ineptness at putting the cops off the scent is hilarious as hes so devoid of emotion that he cant be bothered coming up with any decent excuses its not its shock value or boundary pushing ideas  but actually the main problem is that the film is for the most part a routine madman captures young girls who try to escape type story corny as some of this is  i did laugh out loud a few times  the idea is preposterous  why are people so offended but it definitely held the interest any serious horror fans need to see it but basically  take away the idea and the rest is pretty routine i dont think a sequel would be well advised as the idea is already out there and stretched to 90 mins another film would need something a lot different,cruel
shocking bold moving electrifying passionate breathtakingthese are just a few of the words that describe first sequence every so often in a generation a film comes along that can change you can break your heart and thrill you all at once if youre looking for that movie look no further thc is of the caliber that few achieve in the genre of thrillerhorror writerdirector tom six took steps and risks no other filmmaker dared to and came out on top victoriously right from the beginning you are emotionally connected and moved by the the protagonists plight you feel their terror as they experience it on the screen before you the antagonists motives are unclear at first but are revealed in a unique and groundbreaking way dr heiters plans to connect three human via their mouths and anuses is medically genius an area of science only six dared walk as the film progresses and linday jenny and katsuro begin their conjoined journey you begin to take the sides of the or the doctor good and evil a decision which in a sense perhaps reflects that of your own demeanor and lifestyle choicegrotesque of course life changing you decide my call a 1010 thoughtprovoking film from this generations kubrick tom six,cruel
ok after watching this movie i really had to write a review about it not really use to do it but after reading all these stupid negatives critics from people used to watch the scream series or other cheap hollywood horror flicks i had to do it cause it really made me mad this is what call a horror movie and a badass one i just love horror moviesseriously people what were you waiting for an other friday the 13th type scream  you fools you just entered an other level in the genre some are made to scare others to make you sht in your pants and finally some are made to disgust you and the last one is the most appropriate so if you disliked this one why dont you just go and rent the last pink panthers series lolthe beginning of the movie is really simple and been seen a gazillion of times the end was predictable which at my surprise got me totally wrong actors were really good really loved the hate portrayed in their characterswho cares some medical scenes are not accurate i am no doctor or even if their mobile phones dont get any signal in the middle of the woods just go and watch some national geographic channel if you want it to be so this is not the case hereso for its originality ill give it a 9 disgusting full 10 and overall 9i am telling you this is a real horror flick if you dont want to be disgusted dont rent it and remember kids this is just a movie,cruel
much like the hostel films this movie aims to shock terrify and repulse and much like a nightmare you beg for it to stop this movie raises the bar when it comes to grotesque stomach turning violence and is a crazy new turn in the horror genre yet it has similar elements from other films like martyrs hostel pig vacancy etc which doesnt make it feel that original as it should have been and it just ended up being a rehash of them than surpassing them but im happy to say that it didnt suck balls like martyrs and the horrendous pig which made you mad annoyed and frustrated than anything i thought that dieter laser plays an fantastic psychopath and chilled me to the bone and he is a villain that could give anybody nightmares great work the supporting cast was ok but over acted sometimes but i have to give it to them for making their horrible situation raw and not make it a laughing stock which it could have been the ending was a little bit of a let down and was anti climatic and i really didnt think it went to the lengths which it could of gone but it definitely backs up its title because while you like it or not you will see one in this movie bring a bucket just in case i really dont know how theyre going to do a sequel to this it just doesnt make sense right now other than following it from the ending but where will it go from there unless its a prequel which i can picture that happening than a straight up sequel im interested to see what theyre going to do with it overall i didnt love it or despise it i just thought it was a very descent well made shocker thats bolder than most hollywood theatrical released horror movies these days and i give kudos to the cast and crew for that and it had me glued to my seat in horror on what was going on and thats what a horror movie should do and i recommend it not for the squeamish,cruel

god what was i afraid to watch this hyped flick reviews in all kind of horror magazines and people fussing about it how good it could be or how bad it was but after a while my really good geeks on the net and in the flesh told me well its worth watching i did andi was stunned first of all its made by for many an unknown director coming out of all places netherland most movies coming from there are mostly about sex i wont give titles but i guess you know them then the actors the retired surgeon is played by german actor dieter laser i dont know the guy but he performed in a lot of german flicks and series but man his face his performance it all worked so well but the itself ashley c williams ashlynn yennie and akihiro kitamura they give the best they could they have just played in 4 flicks so are also really unknown but what a performance the way it has been filmed is also a trown back to old school horror no fast movements no tricky steady cam shots just slow pans and tilts and it worked so well the score did work also no bombastic orchestra or london philharmonic so easy but so effective like it did for the last house on the left remake i was locked in my seat from the first minute until the last one some reviewers stated that it was made just to shock well being a geek in the genre it wasnt for the shocking it was made its just a brutal flick if you want to be shocked go watch an serbian film the blood flows its disgusting sometimes even gory surely not for the squeamish and let me say there is nudity in it but you wont be attracted to the titties i can give you that great movie no happy end looking forward for part 2,cruel
guaranteed unlike anything youve likely ever seen except for the first 15 minutes of setup which play a bit like rocky horror without the singing and pitchperfectly scripted filmed cast and bravely bravely acted this film draws on the medical gorefests of japan from the mid to late80s such as guinea pig devils experiment where the whole raison detre for the film was to showcase a young nude women being surgically dismembered in ultrarealistic style and the overthetop campgore films of andy warhol specifically his frankenstein and dracula and is at once quite funny mostly early on and then rather sad or almost  dare i say  poignant if you ever think youre having a bad daydieter laser the villain is quite a find reminiscent of udo keir in the aforementioned warhols his massive teutonic forehead is like a character in its own right the women although both caucasian brunettes are both fine actresses and only make the mistake of drinking the glasses of water offered by their host  which of course contain roofies which do look a bit too much like alka seltzer tablets they pretty much behave the way one would think they would in such an absurdly grotesque situation the japanese actor is also called upon to show some acting chops and has some of the funnier lines which are subtitled as is the german dialog even the other relatively minor couple of characters are rendered interesting through accomplished casting this movie screened for two weekends at midnight at the detroit areas primary landmark art house went away for a weekend or two and now is back apparently by popular demand of the audience of approximately 20 last night only three people left and that was during the brief but realistic surgical sequences frankly i wasnt originally interested in it figuring it for just some more badly made cynical torture porn and while it certainly does share many of the constructs of that subgenre i must admit that of our group of four people who saw it together all seemed to relish its uniqueness and cinematic skill even as we were laughing and imagining what our subsequent dreams were going to be like,cruel
non spoilersjust exploitive rubbish stay away from it watch tusk if you want to see a movie with torture gore and story at least tusk makes sensethis is just an marketed garbage film that is not even gory i honestly fail to see what the director wanted to do with this except earn moneyspoilers belowthere really arent much to say about this movie you dont feel for the characters the detectives are just there give you a feeling of closure but oh no it doesnt stopoh and that open ending i thought it would tie in good with 2 but man even that the directorwriter managed to screw up i hope the final installment flops,cruel
i gave this film a higher review then i normally would have for a couple of reasons firstly i do not feel that it deserves some of the criticism and low ratings that it has received secondly the brilliant performance of dieter laser as the films villain dr heiter is alone worth a high rating this film has earned itself a cult status and deservedly so you either love or hate there is no in between the film starts out like many other horror filmsa brief segment where a man is abducted by a psycho using a tranquilizer gun followed by the suspenseful scene involving the abduction of 2 american girls who are tourists in germany these 2 broads couldnt be dumber and you find yourself almost hoping that they get knocked off on their way to a party at a club they get lost in the woods and inevitably get a flat tire they wind up seeking refuge at the home of dr heiter and are drugged and placed on medical gurneys with ivs stuck in their arms next to the man that was abducted in the beginning of the film he is told by the demented doctor that he does not match and is quietly murdered the doctor then brings in a very strong willed asian man who apparently does match whatever twisted concept the doctor has in mind dr heiter proceeds to thoroughly explain to his victims precisely what is about to happen to them using a diagram he explains that they will undergo an intense surgery that will attach them to one another by use of their gastric systems first surgery involves their knee caps being surgically altered so that they are forced to walk on their hands and knees then they will be surgically attached to one another mouth to anus thus forming a after an extended chase scene involving the doctor and one of the girls who rips her iv out and tries to make a run for it but does not make it the surgery is completed it is at this point that the films most infamous and shocking scenes take place as the good doctor tries to train his new pet to walk fetch a newspaper and yes feed the other segments of the using the only method possible although little gore is actually shown the scenes are powerful and shocking enough to make anyone wince in disgust eventually some detectives come to investigate the disappearances and the film really begins to take shape for pure shock value this film is worth at least a one time viewing as i said you will either love it or hate itwatch the film for yourself and decide this film is an original concept but is definitely not for the squeamish,cruel
is definitely a love it or loathe it film i can certainly see the controversy surrounding it as it has the demented german surgeon obviously inspired by the horrific things nazi surgeons did in the war germans are definitely not going to take to this i think theyd like to forget about the war but this is really exploiting what they did on a sickening level but thankfully im not germanyeah im english and so it didnt offend me disturbed me it disturbed me in such a way that it has left a scar in my brain and watching it was certainly an experience i will never forget i found myself watching the credits roll something i dont normally do i was confused and didnt really know what to think about what i just witnessed but something that has that effect on you is very rare in my case its only happened on such disturbing brilliance like martyrs and mum  dad and so surely that must mean somethingyou know when a film is good if it becomes more of an experience rather than watching a moving image and tom sixs certainly became an experience for me the premise is so disturbing and insanely original the film certainly had it flaws with the somewhat clichd first half but when the surgeon actually makes the it actually becomes not clichd at all and actually gripping stuffthe directing was beautiful tom six is really a talented man the lighting and slow camera movements really added to the coldness and isolation of the film dieter laser really did an incredible performance as the mad doctor his face is so menacing no offence dieter and his deep german accent actually becomes quite scary he really is a frightening villain i heard that this was meant to be a comedy but i didnt find much of it funny at all if this is a dark comedy than its too dark for me to see itin the end certainly wont win the critics over but im no critic im just a horror fanatic and this film really stuck with me you have to make up your own mind about this so id definitely say give it a go,cruel
its interesting to see other peoples reactions to the film and how much some people expected from the film its as simple as it looks  its a horror film about what happens when someone with the medical skills sets his mind to joining 3 people together atomouth thats it its not a thriller its not a comedy its not a drama to my knowledge it wasnt even marketed so it would be unfair to claim that it was hyped or has misleading marketing as with all horror its subjective if youre the sort of person that spots errors in paranormal activity or blair witch instead of allowing yourself to be engorged in emoting with the main characters well youre not going to like personally i found it horrifying to imagine for two hours how i would feel if i was part of a and in that situation im not particular to gore or a lack of it the gore amount was just right for me enough to make me turn away but quickly turn back in interest i dont know anyone that has watched the film and disliked it i just know people that refuse to watch it so give it a try,cruel
when i first heard of this movie and read the reviews i thought this was going to be another failed attempt of a horror movie with great potential and therefore had low expectationsfortunately i was very pleasantly surprised the movie starts of somewhat clich but to be honest i didnt think it was that unbelievable im not sure i wouldve done things differently if i were in their position actually i think the story as a whole was quite credible and the fact that a like this is biologically possible makes it even sicker it left me slightly nauseousdr heiter was an excellent freaky doctor and i thought the other actors did quite well even the german police officers although i found the ending a bit confusing from their partall in all i found the movie to be satisfactory it wasnt very scary and not even that gory but it was just that twisted that i cant say anything different than that i was impressedi would recommend people to watch it not only for the horror but also for its realism reviews are always a good way to check out if movies are worth seeing but i believe that this movie deserves a bit more appreciation than its getting see for yourself,cruel
i honestly thought that nothing else id see this year could even come close to a serbian film for sheer outrageousness but from writer directorwarped genius tom six has gone and proved me wrong they dont get much more disgusting or funny if your sense of humour is more than a tad twisted than this sick little puppydieter laser plays dr heiter an eminent german surgeon renowned for his work in separating conjoined twins now retired heiter has a new goal in lifeto create a by surgically joining several unwilling victims ass to mouth obviously such an experiment leads to some rather unsettling moments not least the stomachchurning moment when the head of the announces that he needs to do a dumpstraight into the mouth of the poor woman behind himits not all disgusting for disgustings sake however in addition to the totally revolting nature of his films central experiment mix also manages to create an incredible sense of tension both early on as his female victims wander unsuspectingly into the demented surgeons lair and later when the makes a desperate bid for freedom of course this being an utterly depraved piece of cinema all does not end wellthe final is an absolutely gobsmacking downer designed to leave viewers stunned,cruel
when an idea is thought up that is as messed up as the movie itself is almost secondary in nature is this a perfect movie nope but irregardless it is impossible to stop watching for the chance to see to understand to experience the idea of and wtf will happendo you have any idea how many people have heard about this movie it was becoming a cult movie before anyone had even seen it some people thought it was a fake trailer some people lovedhated it and others were incredibly intrigued by it as i was people are talking about this movie in some way good or badim losing my focus a bit but this movie by all means is nothing short of an experience an event it is very tame by horror standards yet still holds a sickening grip to your attention will it hold up with repeated views i dont know but to experience at least one is a must relax and enjoy the fd up story,cruel

few would have thought that a joke between tom six and friends would ultimately result in the film that has provoked worldwide debate over its release and certificationthe cinematography adds to the atmosphere of the film in every aspect though not always as flashy as it promised a delightful light flare during an early scene promised a visually stunning film these moments of great style are infrequent with six preferring to allow the cinematography like the narrative to play servant to the horrific set pieces that the film is punctuated with the look of the film alongside the leads performance is played straight and is clinical all precautions are taken to prevent the film from lapsing into a hammed up gore flick of little merit or moodthough the film has its faults mostly in the unimaginative set up for the main body of the narrative it also has a lot going for it is actually quite an old fashioned horror film that has sutured together the key elements in any film of its genre and then pushes it out a little further than most are comfortably used to dl,cruel
the premise is pretty shocking and after a certain point the speaking roles of the two actresses kinda end but this may become as much a classic as eraserhead its not nearly as graphic as it could be but that makes it better the doctors intense psychopathic behavior is incredible directing is top notch suspense keen and content  well its definitely a movie youve got to see to believe the ending is as horrific as the best of its genre the japanese dude gets deep  too bad no one else knows what the hell hes saying some may consider this a b movie but i feel its in a class by itself this movie is worth the price of a theater admission and to me thats a rarity in this day and age this would be a great movie to observe the audiences reaction to but only after youve watched it intently yourself,cruel
wow up until now eraserhead has been the freakiest film ive seen to mess with my head step aside david lynch and meet i heard about this film 3 days ago and was lucky enough to catch in on you tube literally as it was being pulled off there a complete 10 for originality all though the girls bugged initially when it became clear what they were in for they stepped up to the plate and delivered awesome performances i have to admit i wasnt sure that this was a film for me but i guess ive been a horror buff for too long  i really appreciated this film couldnt watch the surgery bits but the human story was utterly compelling talk about a film stepping outside the box  this is sure to become a cult classic,cruel
this movie is not for everyone if you like exploitations and horror movies with more naturalistic style then this one is for you is a really original movie with a dark sense of humor its something you wont forget soon and gets better every time you watch it but also needs a strong stomach of course i dont wanna spoil the story because the shock factor is higher with the less info about it the casting is perfect especially the great dieter laser and tom six really knows how to make a good thrill and how to shock his audience to death unfortunately 2full sequence is nowhere near to its predecessor but this one is still a good fun horror to watch it again and again and again my vote is 1010,cruel
i really enjoyed this film i speak about 3 words in german and am only fluent in english however i was still able to follow the plot of the film in enough detail to be able to sit back and watch even without subtitles the film starts off a bit cheesy and very american due to the american girls who are obviously the typical attractive female centre characters it does on the other hand get a lot better clearly the director had to get into this film as the making of it progressed it is shot well and the acting is superb the film got a lot of bad press and i heard from numerous people about its appalling content i do not think this is as bad as they all say it is defiantly no worse that some of the saw films and will definitely appeal to a similar audience such as myself the only problem i have with the film is the way the characters seem to have been written with a lack of common sense and seem to be unable to see that a large heavy lamp will make a better weapon than a shard of glass or scalpelover all very good film and i enjoyed it from start to finish gripping and well filmed,cruel
im unsure as to why im writing this review not only is this movie hard to review but no matter what anyone tells you your mind has already made the decision of viewing or skipping there is a huge dividing line between your decision first you must be a hardcore horror fanatic to sit through one of the grossest movies to ever grace the cinema secondly the plot of the movie needs to interest you a psychotic surgeon holds three humans hostage surgically attaches them together to form a if you are still reading my review youll probably end up watching now onto my personal opinion this movie is a huge meh there are many great aspects and many horrible aspects while i applaud the writers for somehow creating a realistic feeling to this films absurd plot there are several moments where the viewer is frustrated by the low level of intelligence of these characters the film is divided into english german and even japanese whether this is a positive aspect or not this is where a few laughs come into since the surgeon is german he is difficult to understand at times when speaking english but luckily the dialogue itself is unnecessary the main grossout factor comes not from the blood or gore but from how the humans are attached themselves i urge everyone to skip the trailer the trailer is a timeline of the movie and ruins 75 of the what gives this film some interest to the viewer i will recommend this film to certain people simply because in an age where most horror films are disappointing is a fresh unique fastpaced disgusting thrill ride,cruel
it like a choo choo train this is how my brother described it,cruel
this movie was funny as hell i like the concept and the way they experience the worst misery known to man who the hell came up with this idea its so sick it is a classic for sure what a weird guy they found to play the sick doctor so the real question is this you rather be the a b or c a is obviously the best most air  and everybody eat your poo c may seem like the worst cause you eat all the poo  but b is def the worst cause you stuck all over no thank you it a good way to make you think about philosophical stuff i will never forget this movie  it haunts my dreams  which is what i want in a damn horror,cruel
ive been reluctantly planning on watching this movie for years through many references jokes and memes on the internet i have always been aware of the concept of and was greatly repulsed very apprehensive but also a bit curious about this controversial movie however nothing about having your mouth sawn to somebodys anus and being forced to eat their shit really screamed must watch to me but recently i dared myself to watch a whole bunch of controversial and weird movies that i otherwise perhaps wouldnt be all that into so i finally gave a shotand to my astonishment i really really liked it the biggest part in it played the main villain doctor heiter who was just amazing there are many movies that are sorta ok but you just cant get into them because there is no character in them that you really like or find interesting enough to follow around not in this one doctor heiter is a character i fell in love with immediately he was just so delightfully creepy weird evil and completely batshit insane in a really entertaining way almost like a comic book or an anime villain its hard to explain to people who havent seen for themselves this guy and his great yet bizzare acting really makes this film worth seeing in my opinion to dispel your worries i have to say the movie wasnt nearly as explicit as the concept would suggest you can never actually see the anus being sawn to mouth you cant see much of the operation at all and the finished people are wearing sort of diapers that cover both the anus and the mouth so you cant see anything the shit eating actually only took place once on screen again with nothing being really visible and the scene ending rather abruptly which ive actually been very grateful for because ive been dreading it all alongall in all this reads more like a movie about an insane german psychopatic doctor who kidnapps three people and tortures them for no reason like a fucking maniac than a movie about eating shit which i was very pleasantly surprised to discover long story short i was throroughly entertained throughout the whole movie and was not bored for a moment people who give this movie low reviews are simply taking it too seriously and are not relishing the absurdity and ridiculousness of it all watch this movie as a dark absurd comedy and you are set to go now im not really sure if i wanna give the sequels a watch because without the dear doctor heiter who unfortunately perished at the end of this movie it just wont be the same im afraid,cruel
i dont know where all the bad reviews are coming from i like this movie its disgusting graphic weird but ive never seen another movie like it maybe there are copycat movies out now but when this came out it stood alone its not the greatest film ever made and i suppose a lot of people couldnt get over the gross factor but i liked it the sequel is even grosser if you can believe it,cruel
i went to my priest for some holy water after i had told him what i did he said no amount of holy water could cleanse me of what i had just seen and i was going to the deepest darkest bowels of hell the acting was absolute rubbish the acting in the twilight movies was better if i wanted to watch people crap in each others mouths like this i would have watched my roommate on a tuesday night i had to repeatedly leave the room because of the images being scarred into my mind nothing good comes from germany now many months later i am waiting for the sweet release of death this movie enraged my immune system causing my digestive tract to go berserk giving me ibs it has put my anus in critical condition this was the shittiest movie ive ever seen no pun intended it is unbelievable that someone was sick enough to come up with this movie in my eyes the only way for somebody to be sick enough to write this is for that person to have hands on experience with this subject this is some of the worst porn ive seen in my entire life in conclusion would recommend to a family member,cruel
this is one of those movies like fifty shades of grey and a serbian film where once the replay button appears it takes me some time to not only comprehend but react to what i just saw the movie was gross yes it was even an interesting idea sure but once dr heiter pieced together the final touches of his creation and there on it just started to get tedioushe starts to treat as his pet ie feeding water beep into the girl behind yous mouth while hearing feed her feeeeeed heeeer etc and its just redundanti was all like yes we get it the angry chinese is forced to go number two in her mouth its a 12legged beep made of three innocent people get on with it im sure it couldve been better however i did hear that six made this as a taste test for full sequence if thats the case i guess i could understand the sequel is way more brutal and gorier thats a guilty pleasure for meoverall first sequence 2009 is a tryhard for serbian film fame,cruel
is a dutch dont worry the language is mostly english 90minute film from over 5 years ago the director and writer is tom six and his films pretty much always get bad reviews this one is no exception however among horror fans this film was appreciated enough for six to make several sequels the title already gives you a very basic idea of what it is about an insane surgeon scientist plans to turn several humans into a now i read on several occasions that people criticize the acting in my opinion that is simply wrong nobody in here acted bad and i thought the japanese actors performance right before his suicide was pretty brilliant the girls and the police officers werent bad either the former are pretty much creeping around for over 50 of the film anyway and the policeman have very little screen time towards the end so its almost impossible for them to destroy the film even if they acted badly which they did not in my opinion the main antagonist is played by dieter laser and there is a reason why he has had a successful career for many decades he simply is pretty talented and the way he portrays this lunatic is absolutely spoton also there is some nice writing about him how he crawls up after being attacked at the end or how he shows up behind the curtain in one scene all of it fits and laser is simply outstanding here in every regard also the way he talks his characters name is heioter and there is quite some irony to that as heiter is the german adjective for cheerfulhorror films are usually measured about how creepy they are and this one is absolutely creepy many of these films stand and fall with the portrayal of the villain and this one is topnotch yes it is pretty absurd disgusting and repulsive but i cant see how that makes it a bad film it is a great drama movie thriller and most of all horror movie there are even some emotional moments in here like at the end when the girls hold each others hands before one of them is about to die and pay attention to the significance of the number three in this film of course there are 3 people in the but there are also 3 people near the swimming pool in the end and all of them die this is not a piece of bad writing there are several smart references in here and six direction was also well done for the most part especially with the way he directed laser oh yeah and ashlynn yennie is pretty hot i have to say this was the third time i think that i watched this film and it is still at least as scary as the first viewing which is always a good sign that it stays an exciting watch even if you know the ending of course this is not a film for easily offended people but those who can deal with some rough contents should enjoy this watch the most disgusting scene for me was probably when we see the pus coming out of one of the girls faces that was pretty heavy stuff so yeah if you watched tusk not too long ago this film here takes a similar path although a less comedic one for the most part still there are scenes when you have to smile i highly recommend 1 i have not seen six other films but this certainly made me curious even if i would be very surprised if they are as good as his work here thumbs up,cruel
i am writing this review simply to say this this film is what is wrong with the world currently dont get me wrong i love a bit of gore and terrorbut im more of a tarantino man and this movie and its sequels is simply wrong i watched it out of curiosity and skipped a couple of gory bits but after watching 97 of it i just felt wrong afterwards i agree some people like this and that is fine what i am saying is that this got released to the public and it was advertised and tom six purposely made it so controversial and disgusting to get more people to buy it that to me is not what a film should be about and if people want to watch torture porn there should be a portal for that it shouldnt be out there for any freaking person to watch i know its an 18 but the internet existson a positive note the german dude that plays the doctor is a fantastic actor and i give him credit for that,cruel
i remember seeing this at the nyc ifc theater during its brief theatrical run to a mostly drunken crowd and got more howls than most comedies dream of getting if it were not for the infectious spirit of the audience i probably would have shut it off from boredom with a home viewing for those hoping to watch a geek show that crosses the line theres not a single money shot in this cheaply thrown together trash and the execution is so poor that you cant help but have a condescending smirk for most of the running time the out of left field concept of running a digestive tract through a few people sewn ass to mouth is certainly um different but any marks for originality end at the concept though i would have loved if tom six recorded all of his investor pitches when shopping the script around the dialogue delivery of the two girls before their mouths are full of something entirely else are porn quality at best the super hammy performance by dieter laser is at least committed to this nonsense and hes absurd enough to hold your attention and get some laughs dont watch this alone not because its scary or gross because its sheer incompetence demands a patronizing rowdy group,cruel
imdb really needs to add a zero rating for trash like this this movie suffers from what i call blair witch syndrome that was another poor though better than this film that some reviewer who was paid off gave a great review to in this case i believe the reviewer was ahigh bpaid off or chad only seen uwe boll films for their entire life poor acting worthless story silly sfx all add up to what an entire waste of time time that will never be returned i would say whoever reads this please please please dont waste your time and whatever you do dont pay to see this crap youll feel better about yourself instead see the brilliant south park episode humanicentpad which is so much better so funny intentionally than this that youll thank me,cruel
while there are some truly godawful films out there i think im safe to say that this film takes the top prize in my book as a film worthy to forgetthe feature length film barely making it that far as it just barely crosses the 90minute line stars dieter laser  as the demented dr hieter ill talk about him a little later ashley williams and ashlynn yennie as insert horror movie clich alert here two hopelessly shallow lost blonde american tourists travelling through the german backwoods sigh and akhihiro kitamura another tourist but from japan who doesnt speak a word of english and guess where the good doctor decides to place him in his horrible schemeoh the film also stars andreas leupold and peter blankenstein real surname on imdb as two of the most ridiculous movie detectives ive ever seen bernard kostrau also puts in an appearance in the film as and im quoting his imdb character here  dirty man in car  a character who appears for little more than a minute and makes obscene sexual comments to our two plastic female starsbarely five minutes into the film our two female characters are lost in the german forest they spend the next few minutes bickering theyre supposed to be best friends but have less chemistry than a gsce science project before they come to the house of dr hieter  the only house around for milesif thats not bad enough the obviously creepy doctor invites them in and offers them drug spiked drinksafter explaining his ingenious plan to his horrified three captives  id just like to take a second and say that this scene carries the best acting in the entire film  but lets face it  who wouldnt be repulsed as someone tells you that he is intending to cut your cheeks off and stitch you permanently to the arse of another human being one of the female characters decides to make a run for it and gets caught in the pool by the doctor who then delivers the only line worth quoting in the film you are going to regret your little escape in fact im thankful for it because now i know definitely you are the middle piecewhile the film is said to be 100 medically accurate i would take this with a pinch of salt  the simple fact that a single doctor could not carry out this operation three sedated people would need constant monitoring as the operation is carried out to make sure that none of them dies is bad enough but to even pretend that a person could survive being attached to another persons arse is simply ridiculous  a little juvenile here but  a single fart would actually kill the person behind themso once youve gotten over the shock of these three people permanently stitched together you then remember that these characters are about as threedimensional as a pancake they came out of nowhere have no personality and dont seem to have any redeeming or sympathetic qualities you simply dont care in fact by the end of the film you simply wish theyd all shut up because youve spent the last 45 minutes listening to them moannow onto the main character dr hieter hieter is actually based upon a real person doctor eduard wirths  a nazi surprise surprise surgeon who was obsessed with the thoughts of attaching organs and limbs onto the body of another usually this was done with twins to see if they could make a better soldier hieter is  like the rest of the cast  two dimensional he has no personality no history no motivation for his crimes and no redeeming featuresi have no idea how this film was even funded though i will say this for the film  it does provide horror fans with a slightly horrible ending after a daring escape attempt by the japanese front piece randomly gives a monologue about how horrible a person he is and how he deserves to be in his agony before delving a piece of glass into his throat and dying dr hieter then returns to his pool and kills the two police officers and somehow taking a bullet to the forehead in the process and dying the two remaining members of the then clasp hands as the back piece sobs her last breath and the middle piece is then left to scream and moan and cry as the camera pans upwardshowever despite all of the characters deaths in the film  it has been announced that the director of this trainwreck is releasing a sequel  full sequence featuring a 25 person cue my suicide,cruel
oh my what can be said about this one it really does occupy a world all its own part of me doesnt even want to attempt reviewing this one but ill give it my best shot is not so much a viewing experience as an endurance test think saw or hostel and then multiply that kind of uhhum plot by a hundred its a curiosity for sure but its not enjoyable to watch or sit through okay heres the story in germany a mad surgeon kidnaps three people a japanese man and two girls from new york and performs a horrible experiment on them where each persons mouth is attached to the other persons behind creating a and from there the trio is continually humiliated and abused by the doctor naturally they make attempts to escape to no avail even when the police finally show up at the house they are so incompetent by the end i couldnt help but wonder if the director tom six gets some kind of a kick from this sort of thing if so he may seriously be in need of help please hear my plea gentle bloodthirsty viewer even i a seasoned gorehound found this too much to handle stay clear of this and any of the sequels which have followed,cruel
at first glance is an intriguing original premise disgusting and perverted but original however this film was so badly directed written and acted that it fails in almost every way possiblethe two main actresses were laughably bad of course most of it probably wasnt entirely their fault as they didnt have much of a script to work with the dialogue was so cringe inducing that this movie became comical at times but kudos to all the actors for doing the most they could with so littlefor those who are considering watching this movie i cant say that i would recommend it even for people who like slasher films does not make the cut very little scares brief nudity and only moderate gore makes this movie very disappointing perhaps if the director had made this movie more of a horror movie it could have been a bit betterdespite all of these criticisms i have to say that was a great way to kill time and it is short with only about a 90 minute running time so if your curiosity gets the better of you like it did me give a shot you wont be frightened or have nightmares but you will be grossed out and laughing all the way,cruel
several of my friends had suggested this movie to me a few years ago the way they talked about it i really thought it would be good i was excited to see it was on netflix when i got netflix but then i didnt watch is for a while because i was kinda anxious about it the only reason im mentioning all this is because perhaps my expectations of it were too high once it started i got the feeling it was going to be a long movie it was really slow and uninteresting in fact the whole movie was slow i didnt feel like i knew the characters enough to identify with them and really feel for them so where some movies you are on your edge of your seat worried about the character i was just sitting there wondering about what the actors were thinking or who drew that picture i also didnt like the mixed languages the girls didnt understand german and none of them understood the asian man so none of them were really communicating the surgeon put the one person who spoke a language he didnt seem to know at the front so really there was no verbal communication between the two it was also very tame regarding how much it showed you see a glimpse of the girls breasts every once in a while and you see the surgeons butt in the pool but nothing gory everything is really covered up the connecting points of the three people are covered by bandages there is nothing really graphic comparatively speaking i really expected it to be more graphic but it wasnt it wasnt convincing and it never got me emotionally involved it felt more like watching a science video than a horror movie granted the idea of the movie was rather sick and the idea of what was going on was rather sick its not really worth watching as for the second one i didnt even make it half way through before turning it off it started out better than the first one but that isnt saying much basically find something else to watch dont waste your time with this one,cruel
ok i had heard things about this movie and after starting a netflix streaming subscription i had to check it out i must say very original now days it seems the horror genre has become remakes or pg13 crap so i can appreciate some original stuff cast lets face it is horrible dieter laser as the doctor was pretty creepy ashley c williamsthe prettier of the 2 american girls imo who plays the horrible part of the middle of  got to give her propsi mean the 3 people in the had it rough but miss ashley had to shoot a big portion of the movie with her face attached to some dudes buttok not in real lifebut really really close to it and have some chicks face attached to her own and the oscar goes to i hope her career continues and one day she gets to play the front of the anyway weird and gross is original and besides the ending girl on end gets sick and dies guy up front kills himself the doc engages in a shootout with 2 detectives leaving all three men dead which has poor lindsayashley c williams attached to 2 dead people and really no way out of a prisonlike homemade hospital is a pretty good film which im pretty sure you havent seen anything like before,cruel
is not a horror movie for the faint of heart the haters should have realized the movie is not going to appeal to anyone who doesnt have a strong stomach and an extremely open mind i liked it because most themes in the horror movie genre have been done repeatedly and are no longer interesting this one seemed pretty unique also since the setting was in germany the characters are german and the location was overseas somewhere though the movie is in english horror movies are somewhat different i thought it carried tension throughout the movie the plot line was lacking since the synopsis of the video acts as a spoiler anatomically maybe it wasnt realistic but then again most horror movies or all movies for that matter arent realistic thats what makes them an escape which the victims dont that is the reason i only rated it a 7,cruel
ive seen so many bad movies and this honestly probably the worst at least movies like birdemic or any of the terrible shark movies you can laugh at this one doesnt even entertain in anyway its just overall terrible the acting was bad and the whole idea was bad i really just hate the idea too some people may like the idea but i really dont the only reason i watched this filth was because my girlfriend wanted me to see how bad it was and how right she was probably the most enjoyable moment in this movie is when the screen goes black at the end that is honestly the most enjoyable frame of the entire movie this movie seriously is just that bad i really would rather watch anything else than this for christs sake porn has better acting than this movie i just really cant stand it,cruel
crazed and merciless reclusive misanthrope german surgeon dr heiter a supremely creepy and unnerving performance by dieter laser plans to attach three people together mouth to anus so he can make his own ghastly approximation of a writerdirector tom six certainly doesnt punk out on the unflinching cruelty depravity and perversity of the central premise he expertly crafts a dark grim and nihilistic mood that really gets under the viewers skin while delivering plenty of squirminducing moments and sparing absolutely none of the abject pain terror misery and suffering felt by the hapless recipients of this deplorable endeavor indeed the queasy and uncomfortable atmosphere potently projects a jarring feeling of unblinking sadism and utter hopelessness right to the devastating downbeat end worst of all heiter carries out his abhorrent experiment simply because he can in fact heiter rates highly as one of the single most cold chilling and remorseless villains in modern horror history in addition his titular creation is truly grotesque and revolting watch out for the infamously disgusting feed her scene ashley c williams ashlynn yennie and akihiro kitamura are convincing as heiters unwilling and unfortunate patients goof de konings polished cinematography provides an appropriately stark look the spare shivery score by patrick savage and holeg spies does the spinetingling trick special kudos are also in order for the remarkably vile and persuasive makeup fx icky and unpleasant for sure but still undeniably effective and unsettling just the same,cruel
this is not a movie its filth i had to turn it off these are not movie makers they are freaks plot no plot acting skills no acting skills shocking no just disgusting with zero creativity i dont know why they wasted cash to make this probably for the sick perverts hiding in their mothers basement getting off to subhuman trash they need ten lines here is 6 7 8 9 10 here is another line and another i have nothing else to say about this movie still nothing to add can i submit yet can i shower now  quivers nope gotta keep saying how crappy this movie is yet i dont want to keep saying how crappy this movie is it is the worse movie i ever watched ever and man ive seen some bad movies but this takes the cake,cruel
this is probably the most unexplainable movie i have ever seen to make this simple and quick a very stupid movie people would of already knew that people would be sewing there mouths to the other persons anus but this makes absolutely no sense why are they in the bush with no regards of thinking about there safety how did the tyre coincidentally bust why can none of them speak europeanthe native language and why did no one kill him near the end when they had the chance i am the most confused person standing on earth thinking why am i watching this i hate dissing movie that the director tom six put so much effort into but the movie was a massive let down in my opinion,cruel
this script and production could have gone many waysgross out cheapo campy lowbudget action weird but i think i see what the director was trying to accomplish and he didvery well take a gross hideous idea but focus on the cruelty and insanity by highlighting the dr this film isnt for the fainthearted in that its gross but not in a starship troopers kinds way it hits pretty hard more like a rob zombie movie but with a motive hated devils rejects it was a great balance of science gone mad with cold calculation punched up with graphic images and constant feelings of desperation denial and acceptance on the part of the i like scifi movies with less dialog  alien sunshine 2001  and by muting the 2 girls the audience can understand more plus they werent the best actresses in the world there are a few logic glitches and the usual gripes about opportunities to escape but one has to get past it the drs line feed her pretty much sums up the whole movie ive read about the sequel and it sounds like its more of a typical slasherbasher script with little authentic depravity just lots of gore ill pass on hc2 but rec the first,cruel
sick saw type mindless onscreen nonsense everhostel 1 and 2 is worth watching but not who would even waste their time to try and pitch that garbage the director only produced it to make money off of mindless peeon fan who like only mindless carnage and they are the same type of mentally under developed minds if you can call them that that watch family guy instead of the simpsons because they dont pay attention enough to have the preconceived knowledge to understand culturalbased comedydo not even waste any amount of your precious life viewing this film your betteroff spending years training to become a fbi agent and reviewing sick crazy real xfiles then to waste your time indulging society in watching this garbage i already got sucked into it by a friend dont make that mistake hurry run run for your life,cruel
briefly stated the only petrifying aspect of this film is that a person was capable of developing the conceptwe all know of mankinds dark capabilities and while this film cannot be likened to mass genocide or gender repression for obvious reasons the logic behind it explains how such things came to pass is it coincidence that the three victims of dr heiters chilopoda frankenstein are all either nonwhite or nonmale i sincerely doubt it the stereotypes are rife in this picture and not it seems for cinematic purposeshas this film achieved its goals merely because i and others have taken to the web to voice our concerns in this writers view any assertion that this films purpose is to push boundaries and draw debate is a frail shield to its opposition who say too farthe problem isnt solely the content it is the manner in which it is portrayed the saw franchise successfully portrays the sadistic acts of a madman whereas in first sequence we feel that the madman is not the doctor but the man behind the camera,cruel
i love horror movies ghost psychos gore you name it this however is the most pointless boring god awful piece of crap ive ever seen i really expected to see the doctor chopping people up and picking the choice bits to sew onto another person that at least wouldnt have been as boring as this garbage i subjected myself too once the doctor sewed his victims together the movie just got stupider sure being kidnapped would be scary and given having someone subject you to bizarre medical torture would be horrifying but why the hell would the doctor even bother sewing a someones mouth to another persons butt amusement give me a break at that i couldnt fathom why they wouldnt just pull themselves apart sure it would hurt like hell but they wanted to get away right the ending had to be the worst part once the other two victims had died and everyone in the house but the middle girl had died why the hell didnt she try to get away the asian dude cut his throat and the redhead croaked why the hell couldnt she cut her friend off her ass and her face from the asian dude im pretty sure that no major arteries would have been compromised she wouldnt have bled to death maybe im nitpicking but if im pretty sure anyone in her position who wanted to escape and survive would do that right so to summarize this was a ridiculous compilation of garbage that doesnt deserve to be categorized as either horror or gory and whomever wrote this was either high drunk or just plain stupid for having written such a boring movie with its many many shortcomings,cruel
happened across this film by mistake and cannot believe i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this the one point goes towards the actor who plays the surgeon who fits the role of a crazed german guy quite well the idea of the film is awful no doubt made up to fill some kind of fantasy for the director i actually feel sorry for the people who are associated with this i would be embarrassed this film will no doubt be a black mark in their acting careers medically none of this could actually happen and its not worth looking past this stay clear do yourself a favour and go and watch a decent horror or comedy i dont quite know which it was trying to be but failed at both and i see there is to be another one coming out soon its a sad day when something as bad as this is allowed to be made never mind have a sequel ,cruel
why the heck would anyone give this film 2 stars when i first found out about this movie it was at a dance club on an off night they played the movie silent on the video monitors while the gothindustrial music lashed out just seeing images i wanted to throw up but could not being i was with all my guy friends  it was almost traumatic watching it that way i was so upset i forced myself to watch the whole this to get closureyeah seriouslyi needed closure from the imagesnow with the the films full intent i sat through some of the lamest sadist material since funny games yes its a torture film in the worst way  not in shock gore violence rape but in metal and spiritual abuse this film invested way to much time in showing the disgusting nature of dehumanizing the victims that you lose faith in humanity a single scene involving suicide that should stand for something tries to explain the intent of the film however should have been a cut to the director apologizing for the 91 min torture he inflicts on the viewerthis film missed the mark when he decides to not just scare the viewer but force them into a suicidal contemplation after reflecting on their life choices truly sadist  so if you love to watch people suffer and you loved 2 girls one cup this is the movie for yousick holewhy the 2 stars if i disliked it so much  because i have a heart unlike tom six  ,cruel
well where should i even begin to review this crap that is called a film well first the acting what little of it there was was horrible the only decent part was where whatever her name was asked if the dr lived there with his wife and he snapped saying he hates humans i think i liked the japanese actor the best but i like to imagine that he is really cussing out tom six for tricking him into being in his film okay and the cops wow what kind if cop sees his partner floating in a pool and just whimpers the dr had like 5 minutes to aim and shoot and then after 3 or 4 shots the cop without aiming hits him in the head wow next lets hit on the plot okay done what plot why was this dr so intent in making a who knowsi think a good sequel all though why would a sequel even be thought of woul be 2 blank screen thats right i think watching static or black would have been far more entertaining why why why of please this film makes uwe boll look like stanley kubrick or frances fors coppola i now know that boll is not the worst person in film tom six you should be ashamed of yourself and to quote billy madison we are all more stupid having listened to and may god have mercy on your soul,cruel
this films entire premise represents an unstable mind this films depiction of the force feeding of feces total and complete submission degradation of people and the unbridled evil of the doctor comes from a warped demented and sick mind this does not even qualify as bad writing this film isnt even a horror film a horror film provides drama though good writing complex characters excellent cameraset work all absent in the one singular drama in this film attaching a mouth to the anus of another is simply the writersdirectors childish attempt to vent his own hidden sadistic desiresfor an actor to associate themselves with such a project is an insult to their studies in the arts and theateri screened this film going in knowing about what the story was i have never gotten sick watching a film until now i am a film collector i have films of all types some are blockbusters some are b films this film will not be in my collectionthis film is beyond trash,cruel
this film has been receiving a lot of attention mainly due to the trailer if you take out element out of it you get a horrible acted film with terrible dialogue and a boring climax if you add the into the equation however you get the same film but with a glut of unintentional laughswith these types of films you have to train yourself into becoming more patience with the characters yes many will have asked why the two girls wondered off the road and into the woods yes you can still drive with a flat tire and yes it doesnt take a criminologist to release the surgeon was crazybut please be patience as those who wait are rewarded sadly that saying is chucked out of the window the acting is shocking the japanese chap was hilarious and the cops are the dumbest ive watched since the last house of the left originalhowever the actor who played the sickening surgeon actually fulfilled his role successfully he could of been so bad that he seemed suited or credit is actually duei would recommend to watch this film with your friends as there a barrel of laughs to be shared it not gory nothing you see is disturbing and the whole film is a laugh,cruel
i wish there was a 0 option to rate this film i was mildly intrigued at the title but i wish i had read other user reviews before subjecting myself to this visual and psychological torture i sat through all the saws hostel last house on the left and even the low budget carver which until was the grossest movie i had seennot only is the acting bad but the idea of watching that crazy surgeon describe in full detail what he is going to do to you is beyond tolerable to watch then to wake upby far the middle is the worst situation my nausea and utter disgust that this movie even exists didnt happen until the creation was moving around being trained anyone that enjoys this film thinks it funny or can sit through this without feeling sick at all i recommend therapy i feel like im going to need hypnosis to get the image of the middle girl attached between 2 dead bodies without anyone knowing shes there in a foreign country out of my head i would never tell anyone to see this movieunless youre unbearably hungry and need inspiration to kill your hunger bad movie horrible concept how could anyone do this to people even in a pretend movie setting,cruel
first off i would like to say that i generally have an open mind and actually enjoy films that are stupid especially horrors because there fun to watch this film however was not fun to watch and not even because of the gore it wasnt fun to watch because it was just plain awfulstory  we start off with two girls driving to a nightclub because public transport would never be the better optionwhere they take a wrong turn and get a flat tyre and no signal after sitting around for about 5 minuets and being harassed by a fat german they decide to find help this is the second moment that we see how stupid these women are instead of following the road in the hopes of maybe finding a car or a house they venture in the woods and apparently get lost for about an hour they then come across a house in the middle of nowhere knock on the door and then what follows in the next moment of stupidity for these women the stranger who opens the door greets them by saying are you alone while shifting his eyes everywhere what a lovely man he then drugs them and ties them to a bed he then decides to tell them his plans of turning these people into a at least the film got the name rightand thats pretty much it in terms of story nothing else really happens and i mean nothing a couple of police men turn up nothing happens and nothing is resolved in anyway the one thing i hate about this film is that it had so much potential but it seemed they got lazy not only that but it just doesnt make any sense they give the worst explanation of why the dr is doing this i hate humans and thats his motivation really he hates humans if he hated humans why would he spend 40 years of his life being a doctor separating twins why would he want to undo that with his work we dont get an explanation and why would he want to create a there is no reason i can think off why he would want to it has nothing to do with his life or his work a better premise would have been if the dr was a religious nut who decided that his work on separating conjoined twins goes against gd and decides to undo his work but no we get nothing of why he would want to connect someones mouth to there arse so because of this i felt like my time was wasted the other thing that i hated was that i just didnt care about the nameless characters the two women were as thick as pigs blood and all they did was moancue in no chance for a personality to develop and then we were given a chinese or japanese man for no reason who didnt speak german or english just his native language very hard to connect with that so the whole premise of these people being put in this situation was lost on me when i stopped caring for them the acting was terrible from everyone except the dr who was actually very good and he is the only reason i gave the film a starthe other reason for the star is that the film was so terrible i was happy that they had the brains to get the title rightoverall this film is a complete waste of time you cant help but ask why during the film and even then you dont really care the whole controversy that surrounded this film such as it being disgraceful and people vomiting in the cinema is complete poo see what i did there do not see this film it will only make you angry,cruel
this movie is very sick and i wouldnt even recommend it for the hardcore sick and psychotic blood and guts fans this movie had great potential but squandered it the story is very original in a sense it deals with some surgery to fuse three helpless victims into one being it must have taken a very sick mind and a very sick man to develop this the first part of the movie is pointless its also crude in the way it begins the whole intro is just meaningless filler you can hardly focus because nothing else is going on theres no build up whatsoever so your really just waiting for the people to get stitched together but the movie has ways of pissing you off take for example the japanese character he cant speak english so they give subtitles thats great and all but my complaint is why would you put words for the viewers to read if they are already bored it makes little sense the characters are all bad actors they just scream and thats it the two actresss are very annoying because all they do is scream and it annoys you after a while the mad scientist is decent you cant understand him half the time and his motives are never really explained the movie just throws everything at once at you expecting you to grasp every single concept of the characters the part where the doctor performs surgery is just sick and nasty its incredibly pointless since it was never really explained why this man decided to stitch three people together it really bothers you and makes you wonder why your still watching i rated this movie a 50 im being very generous here i think this film could have been disgusting but a good blood and guts kinda movie but thats simply not the case here the only reason i can think of for watching this movie start to finish is for the sake of saying  i watched this movie and i wont even go into the ending its just that bad just stay far away from this movie and avoid it at all costs,cruel
10162010like it or not writerdirector tom six is getting recognition and a sort of pseudo fame for his gross out horror flick this movie plays like a b movie side show act six looks only to use simplistic story telling techniques and minimal character development to bring his creation to life this movie was made only to shock and disgust and rarely does either effectivelythe story line is quite generic and could be lifted from numerous other horror films two american college girls traveling in europe are on their way to a party when their car breaks down in the countryside both girls are extremely annoying and shallow new yorkers who brave the rain to find a house occupied by a mad german doctorscientist played by dieter laser i love that name perhaps the best part of the movie is lasers performance as the insane doctor who will stop at nothing to create this monster along with a japanese guy it is explained that the surgery will connect the three young people ass to mouth to create a medically accurate new animal and why does he want to this probably either for shits and giggles or to launch a new german fetish porn site the movie promises a and you eventually get a while there are some sick and twisted images it really does little to create a sense of empathy for the characters that are in the unfortunate positions then comes the question of once youve created a what do you do with it he takes it out in the back yard for a bit then at night he locks it up in a cagetom six is currently in post production for next years sequel which promises a longer and hopefully a better plot he set the bar pretty low for the first one so hopefully the sequel will cash in on the problems of the first one,cruel
this isnt another example of castrated horror like most bigbudget horror filmscontains disturbing themes being transformed into something else the whole surgery thing and um what happened to the last survivor shudderssurprisingly not very gory the people behind it put emphasis on the aforementioned themesadditionally the aspect that certain characters lost pretty much every aspect of their lives even had they survived just because some guy felt like doing his twisted experiment is horrible,cruel
i had heard much talk about and decided to watch it one day unfortunately everybody had failed to mention what a sick disturbing and overall awful movie it was if i could i would give you the pros and cons of the movie but there is almost nothing good worth mentioning about the movie here are some of the negatives1 terrible actingthe two main girls were almost painful to watch2 no depththe characters are onedimensional and we know almost nothing about them there is little depth in the storyline also i still dont know what was wrong with that doctor3 why are there no phones when whatshername escapes she runs through the entire house but never stops to pick up a cordless phone this is the 21st century right 4 just plain disturbingafter watching this movie i was about to puke just sitting here typing about it makes me feel nauseousoverall this is one of the worst movies i have seen anyone who can sit through this movie and enjoy it must have a sick mind let alone the guy who actually came up with the idea if it wasnt for a couple funny parts in the beginning mostly do to the terribly poor acting then this movie would have been an easy 1 star,cruel
ok first offwhoever made this movie is just sicki dont know what kind of fantasies you have but dont make a movie and give other sickos the ideas that you haveyou need therapy2nd offthe part that really upset me was that the girl had 2 chances to escape that she didnt take because she was dumbwhen the sick scientist guy broke open the window she couldve ran like heck to go get helpinsteadshe wants to go drag her friend and stay in the house making all of this noisealsowhen the girls trying to escape and shes locked in the roominstead of taking the lamp or finding a dangerous object in the room and opening the door to attack the guyshe just sits in the room like a wussthe poop part i didnt even have the stomach or the soul to watchbut what kinda idea is it that you can create one gastric system when people are obviously gonna die if they eat poopit has e colii wish this movie was never madetom six needs to go to a intensive counseling and leave his ideas to himself because this movie not only suckedbut it was completely unrealistic and a waste of time im soooo not seeing the second one i think ill write tom six a letter telling him to go fk himself because hes a perverted  and he should go tape his own butt to his mouththank youmy friend states this movie is just for sick bastards tom six needs a life thank you,cruel
being a gorehound and adrenalinekicksinducedbyhorrormovies addict i was looking forward to seeing this movie in the forums of ign and listverse many had commented on being one of the most disturbing movies ever so of course i had to see it expecting to get disturbedunfortunately this movie does not live up to its expectations im giving it a 3 for actually having an interesting concept i mean  a scientist wanting to create siamese triplets thats a disturbing thought but the movie contains so many common and annoying movie clichs the kind that make you shout at the screen and losing interest in the movie itself and thats very bad storytelling the acting wasnt very convincing eitheri would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a disturbing movie experience if youre desensitized to gore and easily annoyed by bad scripting its just not for you,cruel
ridiculous that is what i have to say about this movie if you want to watch a silly movie about an asian man attached to a female attached to another female to create a weird and strange go right aheadi knew that this movie was going to be pretty silly but i still decided to watch it with a friend and it was pretty funny it was cheesy the actors were on and off with their bad acting and the asian man was pretty hilarious i really enjoyed him as a character this is a mad scientist film where he turns humans into s its essentially three people with two people stuck together with their mouth to a rear its simply sillyyou should know what youre getting into when watching this movie hardly scary in fact not even scary,cruel
first sequence is a film with a ridiculous b movie style premise that takes itself so seriously no winks and nods to the camera its almost engaging almostdutch filmmaker tom six tells the age old tale of two american tourists in europe who get lost and end up on the wrong doorstep on a rainy night enter dr heiter heiter is a mad german scientist seriously who dreams of creating by linking three humans into one like creature you can use your imagination or google to guess how this looks once he successfully reaches his goal and he does reach his goal the three victims the two americans and a third captive try to escape their screams bring the attention of the police blah blah blah murder gunshots and tragedy ensuedoes it have a larger message or a theme to be explored is it commentary on gruesome nazi experiments hard to say but no not even slightly this truly seems like an idea that two guys kicked around while they were high and then actually followed through on itbe warned that there are some truly gross scenes here that said its not a very graphic movie very little gore or nudity involved and yet still very disturbing which incidentally is a pretty neat thing to pull off so why should you see it see it because its ridiculous see it because the acting is so very very bad see it because its a gross out movie see it because its stupid and marvel at the fact that someone actually financed a movie like this to be madeand because theres a sequel due out next year it really is fascinating to think about the development process with a movie like this what did it look like to pitch this idea to investors what was the casting process like hmmmhave a drink and watch it with friends itll be funnier,cruel
entered the public consciousness in a barnstorming manner that rendered the notion of spoilers a moot point indeed while no cinema within my general geographical plane played the film during its theatrical run the internet buzz and festival reviews i gleaned on several trusted websites piqued my interest considerably having gone out of my way to experience willfully uncomfortable films sometimes for no other reason than to say i survived them writerdirector tom sixs quickly shot to the top of my mustsee list the subsequent viewing experience was a wild overthetop mixture of morbid absurd humor queasy unease and unrelieved batsh1tcrazy horror to call sixs narrative structure tonally inconsistent would be an understatement the film progresses through three distinct acts the first consists of two rockstupid american girls vacationing in germany whose car trouble echoes the the texas chainsaw massacre the second consists of the girls and a japanese businessman falling prey to the deranged machinations of dr heiter the wonderfully unhinged dieter laser and the third is a descent into desperation madness and violence that few horror films successfully pull off throughout six is keenly aware of the madscientist improbability of his scenario but creates a paradox in presenting a world where a man could harbor notions of three people sharing the same digestive tract as such there is also a thread of deliberate pitchdark humor that permeates the proceedings while the tonal inconsistency of suggests that six should try harder to streamline his concepts into a more synthesized less episodic whole the film overall is a refreshing example of the originality of which the horror genre is capable,cruel
i kept hearing how this movie was so intense and so crazy that no one would be able to finish watching it it was none of the sort there is one scene that made me feel a little uneasy but that was it i have seen many other films that push the limits and this just does not work the cast was pretty much horrible the only good actor was dieter laser he was one creepy guy but for example lets take ashley williams and ashlynn yennie these two girls were horrible at acting the fake crying was the worst it really got to the point of annoying i see what they were trying to do with this film sewing three people together to make a yeah i get it but how it was done i dont get it they could of made this movie a lot more intense i am not sure if they were afraid of pushing the limit farther i mean not pushing the limit farther already gave them horrible reviews maybe they can fix all the mistakes for the second one since this is called the first sequence the will say the way the movie was filmed was not too bad they did have that going for them but ti doesnt help when you make such a bad movie i was really expecting more from this film i wanted it to drill my mind and make me shut it off but in the end i only wanted to shut it off because it was that boring,cruel
i must say i was impressed by this film in the beginning i wasnt so sure due to two younger girls trying to slut it up with their outfits oh so suddenly get lost and get a flat tire of course the best idea would have to get out of your car and walk rolls eyes into the woods and oh whats that finds a of course a decent sized and beautiful home in the middle of no where oh my safe at last this totally seems like the best ideaever especially after sitting there seeing that picture on the wall of the babiesno not creepy at all in fact heylets just drink this total strangers water because that too just screams fantastic idea so ok no liei was losing a bit of interest when it first started after a little it caught my interest again when it stroke me that this is no ordinary horror film actually you can cross off the quotation marks all together because in my honest opinion oh i can see the angry mob with their torches already i thought this was the perfect example of a horror film i mean come on your not taking some dude in a mask and a knife with big ol boots on doesnt speak a wordslowly stomping its way to you you also dont have that monster horror and whatever else kind of horror i can think of no this to me brought that sense of fear that sense of fear that i search for in movies the same kind of fear that the nightmare on elm st films brought me that knowing that there is no escape from this sense doomed i think another thing that caught my interest is life in general how messed up people are in this world watching this film i was really able to visualize someone in this day in age trying to pull this off this movie was disturbing messed up but i think thats what made it shine again it gave that fear that fear thats very rare to find in a movie and forgive me i can smell the smoke from the angry mob burning my house down if you can give that sense of fear not only have you won me over but you have also won the name of being a true horror film,cruel
first heard about this movie from friends who went to the theater to go see it i didnt come along as i had an exam the next day in retrospect im glad i didnt spend the 1099 and watched it for free on netflix before i even begin reviewing let me just say that i do understand the point of these kinds of movies theyre not created with oscar winning cinematography acting or plot or anything else some of the more pretentious reviewers here panned the film for its merely meant to entertain on a lower level and be a kind of stupid fun this movie was neither it wasnt over the top shocking or even cringe worthy in regards to content or gore and it took itself far too seriously to be considered a satirical horror film like shaun of the dead i can forgive the director for abusing every single horror movie trope stupid american girls take the woods not the roads killer stalking prey in empty house mad scientist creature feature incompetent cops no cell phone service broken down car etc these tropes and more are the bread and butter of almost all horror movies and many entertaining titles have made good use of themsix seems to believe just using them without putting any thought into context or execution will build suspense and make a good horror moviehe is sadly mistaken the entire surgery scene could have been exploited much more and the whole derp lets fuze the mouth to the ass and call it a really completely lazy and unimaginative it seriously looked like the actors were just playing a pornographic version of follow the leader which leads me to my next point why are all the good bits covered in bandages the entire looked completely sterile and not disturbing in anyway at all i walked in expecting torsoes sewn together with limbs cut off and re attached into different positions with the end product being something that could have come out of john carpenters thing six had a game winning pass thrown at him with the whole mad scientist  fused human bodies thing but fumbled the ball completely if he at least managed to elicit some sort of emotional response out of me whether it be by making me actually care about the victims lol feel a general sense of dread or suspense or just thrown tons and tons of gore at the screen so i could at least be grossed out i would have considered this film at least half of a successful attempt at a b movie all my other beefs with this film have been more than adequately addressed in the other negative reviewstldr if you seen this movie on starz hbo showtime or some other movie channel go ahead and give it a watch if you feel like wasting time literally otherwise give it a pass and pray the next guy to tackle a premise like this does it better,cruel
im just not even going to vote because this movie was trash anywaysso did anyone else notice that these people are stuck in that same bent knee position and yet that crazy doctor can easily bring them upstairs and downstairs without them ripping the hell out of their faces i mean come on this guy cant have an elevator hes nuts nuts i tell you also when that chick escapes she decides to go back to her friend and drag her upstairs no she should have got out of there as fast as she could and found some kind of authority figure thats how you deal with a bully the doctor probably would have killed her friend and that other guy to cover up his tracks and then escaped or something stupid like that but i think thats better than being stuck in a threesome forever with your mouth sewn around a guys butt and your friends mouth sewn around yoursthis movie really sets itself apart from all the other horror flicks by being the most damaging thing to human life on this planet since sauron wielded the ring of power  yeah i know i made a reference to the lord of the rings a totally irrelevant one at that anyways back to the to be honest there isnt any real way to connect to the characters seeing as the only thing you know about the girls is that they are idiots the guy at the front of the is angry and the doctor is the most insane bug lover in the world the only connection made in this movie is itself yeah take that how clever of me not really im sorry about that joke this is what the movie has done to meso go see it if you want to see the most disturbing pile of trashnuff said,cruel
awful dire sick disturbing poorly acted are the main words i could use to describe this film the only thing interesting is waiting to see and seeing how it ends all the bits in between are neither here nor there the girls acting is just shocking so shocking they could easily star in a porno the police at the end are just as bad the scientist is the only one whose acting is believable either that or he really is a nutty scientist how on earth he manages to get the to last more than a day or two as he does in the film is beyond me as its completely medically impossible to keep people alive sewn together like that even i know that and am no medical student there is nothing good about this film at all and if you want to see what the looks like and your going to watch this for the curiosity factor just fast forward to that chapter honest,cruel
has generated a lot of hype and controversy due to its grotesque subject matter many people i know refuse to watch it and some to even talk about it as they believe it to be messed up and the writersdirectors to be sickminded but i believe that if normal things that werent thought provoking were put into film then the film industry would go nowhere and no matter how many times i tell my friends it is actually a good film they still wont listenthis film isnt over the top with its gore and violence unlike some films eg the saw franchise however the subtlety doesnt matter as it still managed to hit a nerve somewhere in my body with the pulling off teeth with pliers or the slow slitting of a throat and for me the most disgusting part of the film you dont even get to see what happens really the feeding and extraction of means the food has to pass through 3 people and their gastric systems and the first time they feed the front piece has to extract into the second piece you only see the reaction of the girl in the middle and nothing else however in your mind you can see what is happening underneath all the bandages and it made me feel quite sick it made my mind go mad to make someone like me who can watch any amount of gore and not really be too fazed feel that bad at something i cant even see means the director has talent to gain such reactions from an audience without doing too much takes real talentthe thing i do not like about this film are the two female protagonists they simply cannot act at the beginning when their tyre clearly goes flat from a pothole or whatever they act like they had no idea what had happened trying to hard to make this horror film unexpected and scary their best scenes in the film are when they have their mouths attached to anothers bumhole however the man who plays dr kramer has done incredibly well and has created another classic evil villain he is creepy scary and just plain mad he is different to other villains as he doesnt wish to kill people for his own joy he keeps them alive and creates this monster so he can be famous for making siamese triplets he actually cares about the health of his subjects etcoverall this film is highly entertaining and should definitely be considered by people who have a strong stomach as i believe it is a genuinely good film despite the two female protagonists and above all it has a horrific ending one of those situations you can imagine how horrible it would be to be in that situation,cruel
when i think of a horror film i imagine blood and other grotesque things that is what i was expecting with it starts out with two american girls touring europe who get broken down they are stuck in the middle of the woods in germany for some crazy and stupid reason the girls go walking around to find help notice how in horror films they always do something stupid that no one in their right mind would do the girls find a house where this german surgeon lives he is known for separating siamese twins and has decided to go in reverse the sick doctor drugs the girls and ties them in a hospital bed there is already a guy there and apparently he didnt meet the expectation bar that poor guy dies for no reason at all the surgeon goes and kidnaps this asian guy the psychotic surgeon has this plan of creating a he will be sewing the patients mouth to anus he has already attempted this with his three dogs who are dead after explaining the procedure to his now patients he sedates everyone and performs his miracle when they wake up he gets a mirror and shows them what they look like the crazy doc is so overjoyed by his masterpiece he cries how touching as expected when you sew someones mouth to someone elses anus there will be poop somewhere in this equation no worries you dont see the actual fecal matter enter the mouth you get a warning when it happens though the cops who this entire time apparently have been investigating the missing people show up without a search warrant the crazy surgeon offers them drinks and tries to drugs them a little fight breaks out and cops leave to get a search warrant as in any horror movie the victims try to escape after his little pet attacks him they move up to the bedroom where he eventually catches up to them the asian guy slits his throat and the cops return this time with a warrant they begin searching the house and one cop gets shot as the other cop finds the without calling for backup or anything the cop goes to check his partner both cops end up dead and so does the surgeon the movie ends with the girl on the end dieing and the one in the middle left alive all in all this movie was a waste of time it is stomach turning dont get me wrong but there is little to no horror the only thing it leaves you wondering is where would i be placed if your interested then watch it just to satisfy your curiosity but if you arent dont waste your time,cruel
the kids and i watch this movie every sunday morning instead of going to church as the wife and i believe that it has more value the lessons my children have learned from this film are apparent in their actions and have helped them learn how to flourish within the world i would recommend that all parents show this to their young children so that they can have the same positive reaction that mine have this movie is a classic and its influence will forever positively affect society,cruel
is too much to watch even for a horror buff like me i thought i had seen all the possible gore man ever invented to scare the daylights out of people but easily surpasses all this by means of the powerful horrendous psychological impact smacking you flat in the face im still having nightmares from this one a week after seeing itspoilers aheadspoilersaheadspoilersaheadspoilersahead its not the horror of the surgical procedure done by the brilliant yet seriously deranged drheiter sewing three innocent victims together mouth to rectum and fixing their knees so they cant get up and escape no the gruesome terror is in the ending the japanese guy slits his throat and heiter the only possible solution to the s problem is shot in the head jenny dies a horrible death because of infection now hopelessly stuck between the two dead bodies with no possible way to escape her fate we see lindsay the sole surviver of this experiment crying her left days away as the two dead bodies begin to discolor and decomposenot for the psychologically weak and certainly not suitable for younger viewers,cruel
o my god what are you people talking about this movie is one of the best ok maybe its not mainstream like every other movie now a days but this is an actual legit movie original  call me a freak but if you have an open mind you will like it  no love it i dont know what else i can possibly say but what ive already said but yes it does involve human feces but you dont see it people over react on this movie by a lot because yes it is different but its creative in a weird way its not a modern horror movie its original as i said beforespoiler alert my favorite part hmm its hard to say because i love the whole thing but there are parts that will make you laugh and nothing wrong with laughing its a movie it does not make you a freak like everyone says on here in tradition feeeeed herrrr,cruel
saw this last night it caused a sensation what a ride and hype the audience loved it this is probably one of the best horror films since hellraiser highly original mouthtoass sickness pitch black humor and unforgettable jaw dropping imagerybut above all very scary and intelligent i wouldnt recommend eating before viewing this movie dieter laser baltic storm performance as drheiter is brilliant so are the beautiful middle and tail girl writer director tom six is a genius compared with the early work of david cronenberg and takashi miike thc will become a cult classic mark my words a masterpiece 910,cruel
whats wrong with you folks how come you all here review this flick as a horror movie this one is nothing but a joke a sophisticated joke that only european perverted mind could produce  nothing personal mrsix seriously i can hardly recall such hysterically sadistically funny impeccably gross shtick without any signs of taste since john waters was around i better not to spoil anything but be forewarned  this isnt just another teen exploitation horror film for sure so if youre not into some kind of veeeeeery black and sick comedy youll be ugh disappointed great great great great great great thank you european perverted director tom six for a halfhour tasteless masterpiece 10 out of 10,cruel
this movie is not for everyone those people who are expecting a teen slasher movie will be disappointedat times this movie reminded me of motel hell i was sitting in the theater thinking to myself that i could not believe that this sequence of events is actually happening on the screen it is definitely unique it was disturbing it has the same impact as the texas chainsaw massacre the movie will stay with you for some time after you leave the theateri was expecting the movie to be really gross but that was not the dominant theme the theme was horror,cruel
i love good horror movies and they are as rare as rain in the sahara desert i thought last years paranormal activity was the most overhyped and boring horror movie in ages i want innovation mindbending horror and something to make me sleep with the lights on for a week is all that it takes frankenstein and hannibal lecter to a new level part of its truth lies in the fact that people are kidnapped and held captive in homes to be torturedthese stories have been in the news in various countries including the us germany and england several times a year a news story breaks about a person being rescued from house of horror the original premise is a possibility i had a stomach ache from tension through most of the movie it is very unnerving graphic and induces fear and revulsion the feeling of being trapped helpless and doomed is pervasive dieter laser is bizarre eerie and wickedly insane not for children under 16,cruel
there have been few time in my life when i actually read the preview for a horror and actually felt i had to watch the movie these days its nearly all the same stupid slashers with no point at allbut then comes an idea that quite frankly is the most twisted i have seen in a while i was hoping it would deliver and it almost did i say that because of the casting my god those girls were bad i was so surprised of how bad they were it scared me how they got cast but the saving grace of this was the doctor who seemed to get off on what he was doing the end was a huge let down if you watch it youll find out why there are no spoilers here it just seemed that all the effort went into the idea of the and the rest suffered from neglect the visual effects were not oscar winning but they served there purpose very well you actually start to think that with the right motivation that you could actual do this yourselfso before viewing this film just consider the following1 if your hoping that this will make you laugh as most of those unintentional comedy horrors do then your right it will but this will be uncomfortable laughter 2 do not let the 2 girls put you off they get shut up fairly quick the only real thing here that is unique is but that is the great thing about the film 3 its a over all good just depends on what your willing to sacrifice to stick it to the end,cruel
horrible movie the people that create these movies should be hung from the neck as an example to others,cruel
if you are wondering why our society is going down the crapper oh look a pun then one look at movies like this will tell you whyi remember it was only twenty years ago that people were saying that censorship is wrong because nobody is so sick to make a movie like this and if they did it would be universally rejectedwell guess what a movie like this was made and a lot of people actually enjoyed iti want you to think about that for a moment there are people who enjoy watching women be forced to eat feces they get off on it they think its awesome tell me how would you like it if it was your daughter was dating a guy who liked this movie the fact that there is a market for sick movies like this says a lot about what kind of people our society is made up ofthis movie should get zero stars this movie is terrible from top to bottom bad acting and bad directing using psychopath gore as a crutch and an excuse to call itself art oooh look at this this movie is soooo edgy and stuff not really not even close its as intellectually bankrupt as you can get thumbs down im an atheist and the existence of this movie made me want to start believing in hell again so i can wish the director be sent there for all eternity and somehow even thats not enough to punish him for crapping out such a hideous disgusting movie,cruel
normally i wait a little while before writing comments about a film but in this instance theres no needthe concept is frightening but the film is not the scariest part of the film was when the girls had a blow out on the road at the beginningthe acting by both of the girls was absolutely abysmala really boring film which would be better renamed bandage appendage or something like that i could have hooked up better effects than this in my living room with me the wife and the dogwhat a yawn if you want to see decent torture horror go and see martyrs or a serbian film but avoid this,cruel
many people rate this film low due to its somewhat disgusting content i really dont disagree that the plot is a little twisted its pretty messed up however the story line is extremely original which nobody seems to give it credit for in addition the film has surprisingly good cinematography that helps create the desired dramatic effect throughout finally the acting isnt horrible it is even surprisingly good in certain scenes overall doesnt deserve most of the negative reviews it gets because i guarantee at least half of the people that rated it had their hands over their eyes the whole movie or havent even watched it if you enjoyed saw then youll probably feel slightly intrigued by this movie i know i was if your even a little on the queasy side then for gods sake dont watch this and please dont write a review on it its called do you expect it to be wholesome so if you think your up for the challenge then watch this movie and decide for yourself but you probably shouldnt eat anything while your watching it,cruel
this is a funny little movie about two american girls who meet a japanese man in europe and they go to a home of a lonely german gentleman whose dog died recentlywell these 4 put their strength together and form a which has been the longtime dream of the german gentleman by this they hope to make the german man happier and get over the death of his dogunfortunately is not as good as hoped since the japanese male doesnt speak good english and the other two girls have their mouths full of excrements thus they cannot really communicate welli still liked the movie since it made me think how important being able to speak is if you want to make friends abroad and understand the culture of a different country,cruel
first let me say that i think most people who would give this a negative review were probably left extremely uncomfortable by the subject matter i mean you have three humans two linked mouth to anus that in itself should be enough to make anyone uncomfortable but i think what really stands out here for me is finally we have an original idea for a horror film lets face it the horror genre has been stagnant for years and the only time an original idea comes along is with these indie film festival type moviesas far as the acting goes i have to say i was left feeling there was no stone left unturned the doctor was the most impressive his tall skinny frame and oversized head really added to his menacing demeanor i hate human beings he grumbles so why not link three humans together mouth to anus and keep them as a pet after all a can have a lot of fun interacting with its master for example it can deliver the newspaper just be careful because s have been known to bite their masters and what would you expect happen when the front person has to take a dump there is only one place for it to go yes this movie goes there sure you feel sorry for the victims how could you not the two girls who make up the thorax and abdomen are less annoying than what you would expect from such character types and the head being played in such a way i would have never expected even the most hardened horror fan will find him or herself feeling a little bit squeamish during this one to reiterate this is originality here folks stay away from the herd mentality,cruel
being a big fan of independent horror films i thought i would check out what become the most disturbing freakish dont watch if you are squeamish sane or human film that i have ever seen makes saw and hostel look like darby ogill and the little people while i will give it an 8 based on all the technical points of the film such as setting sound and even effects i must give it a 10 on achieving its intended goal which was to freak the hell out of me that being said overall i give it a 1 because i never want to watch it again this movie had no redeeming factors involved in it it was just a walk through a maniacs nightmare i feel like i need to go wash my brain now,cruel
after the movie finished there was one thought i just couldnt get out of my head i can not believe how someone could come up with this idea and not only spend time to actually write a script but how he could find producers actors and all the necessary staffit was not disgusting it was tragic and ridiculous the director tried to pass it as an alternative form of culure but the fail was hugestill many people paid their money to watch this and many more will out of curiosity for the 2nd movie and this is where it aims atall in all it was an awful movie complete waste of time but the mad doctor was an amazing actor,cruel
i couldnt believe that so many people had so many negative things to say about this movie so of course i had to watch it myself what surprised me the most was how tame it actually was you really dont see much on screen and yet it was extremely well made dr heiter is phenomenal in clinical approach to madness the director does such a good job describing the procedure you dont actually have to see anything to be disturbed and it was simply beautifully shot in a disturbingly sterile houseenvironment and very creepy dont believe the weak ratings on this site these are simply from people who were bothered by this film and yes it is disturbing but that doesnt change the fact that the film wonderfully executed and a very good horror film,cruel
first this film is a failure in every way possible except that its awfully bad taste has elevated it to a legendarily bad status  not that it even deserves that really dont bother really fails as a horror movie check fails as avant garde check fails as torture porn check fails as an original work check see robert m prices disturbing lovecraftian story saucers from yaddith written in 1984 well told and much much more creepy fails as a moral story check fails as a film adaptation of two girls and a cup check hats off to the original reviewer who made that comparison fails as a meme check fails as a cult good bad movie check fails as a script check fails for being medically accurate check fails even as a failure check fails even to get howard stern to watch it the directorwriter who i refuse to name needs at least 20 years of counseling with a morning cup of doody weak runny doody finally dont waste your time its not even good for being bad its just plain awful it is film feces youll have more entertainment value watching baby spiders eat their mother this film makes david lynchs work logical dont encourage this guy to make more movies he is one step away from being a child molester,cruel

just read the title and that should give you a good idea of if youre gonna like this movie or not i would strongly recommend not taking this movie seriously if you plan on watching it ive read a bunch of reviews on this site where people are complaining about different aspects of this movie some valid some i found a little off right off the bat lets take a look at the tag line 100 medically accurate ive seen a lot of people basically saying nuhuh well bravo dr obviously you called that one just one thing what made you believe that it would be in the first place i mean the movie is called the human fn i really got a kick outta how many people were flexing their brains to point out that you cant live off human waste the set up is kinda weak 2 american girls get lost in the woods in some area of germany after their car gets a flat i guess changing the tire was out of the question but did they have to go traipsing off into the woods guess sticking to the road seemed too obvious anyway the house that they eventually come to for help just happens to belong to a mad doctor with a hardon for s add 1 hijacked japanese dude to complete the party train and its time to get stitchin again i really cant believe how seriously people are taking this movie i even read someones review where they worried that this was gonna give someone the idea to try something like this really and i still cant get over all the folks spoutin the omg this is sooo not medically accurate complaint i really gotta believe that whoever came up with that tag line was in on the joke and it seems to have gone over a few heads the best i can offer is to say that this is the kind of movie that your inner 14 year old will umm enjoy no how about be able to sit through if youve shut off that part of your brain youll probably really hate this movie cause youll be pointing out flaws like a real pro i mean straight up a lot of this movie just doesnt make sense but again i must draw your attention to the title its not at all scary but its definitely messed up i feel that this is the kind of movie youd be best off watching with friends all with a healthy sense of humor and just try to enjoy on a oh gross and holy sht thats messed up kinda level and as soon as one of them says well its not exactly 100 medically accurate point at them and laugh,cruel
holy mother of godi love reviewing these types of films why because regardless of how experienced well credentialed or wellversed you are in cinema you can throw all notions of expertise out the window in an effort to tell the 100 truth there doesnt need to be talk of plot cinematography score or script rather just a simple statement that sums up the entire viewing experience well folks here it is is one of if not the worst film ever made and it will not only make you uncomfortable and upset it will make you extremely uncertain of the human condition and how unethical someone could be then again i didnt have to tell you that considering the title of the film pretty much says it allharsh content ahead for those who havent figured it out by now this film is about a literal three humans stitched together ass to mouth kneecaps cut out treated like an animal by a scientist with no motives other than an obsession with genetic and surgical mutation and mutilation its sick its twisted its horrible in every way shape and form but at the same time its not that violent we know whats going on we see it but its told in a less violent less grisly way than many would imagine the story had me spinning but i never once had to turn my head awaymany that ive talked to about this film have asked me on simple question why would you rent this film quite frankly for me it was an absolute interest from the moment id seen the trailer whats next was the critical acclaim that the film received from those around the world wide web some critics praised it for what it was unique gruesome the next stage in scaretactics and others refused to rate it roger ebert refused to use the starrating system in fear that it was too unethical of a film to critique for someone interested in film i decided it was in my best interest to step up to the plate to my dismay i didnt like it at all maybe its the ebert in me but much like him i dont think this film deserves to see light in the day in any circle other than those with an extreme interest in seeing the bizarre overhyped and extremely unusualwould i recommend this movie not one bit its a horrible piece of trash that wont appeal to anyone other than those looking to get a look at the object of pure insanity if it was well executed it couldve pushed boundaries moved mountains etc instead it puts humanity back a few notcheshas already been given the nod for a sequel hopefully production moves slow theres not enough space in the world for one not much less twofor more reviews visit httpwwwpopcornjurycom,cruel
the concept and execution was pretty sick but i have to say that i couldnt stop watching it  mostly in the hopes that justice would prevail and this sick doctor would get what he deserves in the endone other reviewer commented that it wasnt medically accurate and he was mostly correct especially when he said their vascular systems needed to be connected any first year med student would know such a procedure if anyone was sick enough to do it would first require resecting the bowel throughout the organism 1 has all digestive organs except for a colon 1s small intestine is resected into the small intestine of 2 which spans from her anus up to her mouth other than a long small intestinal tube 2 has no digestive organs whatsoever the same is done with 3 but she keeps her colon as the final stage of digestion once the vascular system is hooked together urinary tracks can stay independent as all three can remain with active kidneys to filter the liquid from the blood the only thing the early reviewer missed was by saying that checking compatibility could not be done in a basement he is incorrect there checking compatibility is nothing more than doing a blood type and a histology match all of which can be done with a simple latex agglutination kit purchased though any lab supply catalog heck if given a vacutainer a centrifuge a can of white latex paint and a live lamb or a mouse i could home brew the test myself my final thoughts  this movie is worth a watch but is not for the squeamish,cruel
so when i got the chance to see at the toronto after dark film festival i jumped at the chance it was the closing gala night film what else would close i think the theatre helped make the experience of this film better than watching it alonethe title and trailer made this film the hype sensation it was and the most talked about horror film of the year can a film live up to such a bizarre and disgusting premise the answer is yes and no the film does deliver on what it promises a and it has some good laughs in it i found the film to be a comedy more than a horror although with every positive there is a negative and the film doesnt go far enough what is he serious yes i am with a film like this one that has generated such a considerable amount of buzz about how grotesque the subject matter is you would expect the film to be pretty disgusting is not disgusting first of all its all imagination the film has one scene that might get people gagging a bit but i expected more than half of the film to be like that its not the director tom six seems to have let the concept get the best of him and thought to himself that this concept alone will make a entertaining film the answer is unfortunately no a concept does not make a film i dont applaud tom six i applaud the two actresses who had to act 34 of the film in the position the film tries to build some suspense but its pretty hard when you have three people moving at a snails pace around a house the film has its funny moments which are all primarily given by the mad doctor the brilliant dieter laser he knows hes in a crappy film and he plays up the role beyond hilarity and over the top cheese is a horror film that is weak on the horror and would rather rely on a concept that try to say something about modern horror or anything for that matter characters do stupid things the horror is hidden and makes you think about the disgustingness rather than show it follows with a few words the first sequence so expect a sequel especially since the film was such a huge thing the film got so much buzz over the concept alone there was hardly any chance that the film would be able to match it so a lot of people will be setting themselves up for disappointment it is a great concept otherwise people wouldnt be talking about it but the film on the other hand falls a little short well at the screening they asked for some people to demonstrate once a guy saw that two females were on stage he ran up there he was also asian coincidence before the movie started they also told us that the tagline they used was correct is this really 100 medically accurate who knows i hope not,cruel
i have to admit i had heard a lot about this movie which led me to seeing it but by the end of it i was extremely confusedthe movie itself was pretty damn good especially given most of the stuff coming out these daysif its not a remake its a horrible story line and even worse movie in itselfbut this was quite the surprise the idea of an insane surgeon trying to make the siamese triplet is fantastic definitely original and the way it was executed was fantastic but all the reviews i read talked about disturbing and repulsive contentwhich in my case hyped it up even morethat was the bummer for me the movie itself isnt gory at all really yeah a couple scenes here and there but nothing repulsive or really disturbingi will admit it could have been because with a storylineidea like this its kind of obvious how extensive the visuals could have gottenbut i have to give the director credit because where the visuals could have been completely over the top he kept it tame and in some points unseen thus leaving it to the watchers imagination which depending how vivid the individuals imagination can be is the determining factor to the level of disgust that can be had by this movie overall i really enjoyed this movie and must say it was a breath of fresh air given most of the horror movies that come out these daysand ill admit i am looking forward to the sequel gives a whole new meaning to the phrase eat st and dieits definitely worth the watch,cruel
what made me hear about this film is that my fellow class mates were talking about the film around april time and in my luck i was visiting relatives in usa and they had on video on demand so were able to show it me i was lucky to watch it because it does not come out in cinemas in the uk until 20th august 2010the thing that made it a good film was director tom six gave a film that would shock his audience but it almost makes you feel bad for the actors if it was real tom six also mentioned that he visited a doctor who actually said that the movie is 100 medically accurate and that can be done this is mainly what made a lot of people want to watch it if that wasnt told then the movie would not have had as much of an impact tom six also mentioned the first movie is going to be my little pony compared to the sequel which makes people who have watched the movie feel like they want to see the sequel more they are the only good pointsunfortunately there a quite a few bad points about the movie considering its a horror its not that scary its not the kind of film that will make you jump and seems to only make you feel shocked the film does not contain much gore accept for a bit of sick coming out of the victims mouth and a bit of blood on the doctors lab coat you do not see the actual operation of being made not many people who i know who have watched it enjoyed the film and most of them are saw fans i think personally the thing that made the movie bad was the ending the cops investigate the house due to people being missing in that area they split up and one of the cops literally just looks at and hears guns shots so goes to the scene and it ends with the doctor and the cop shooting each other at the same time and dieing at the same time the front man in the before this killed himself and supposedly the back women in the dies from blood poisoning leaving the middle girl left for dead crying it is then left at a cliff hanger as you dont know whether the girl dies because the front guy has died so isnt given her food or whether she does get rescued and removed from the when the sequel comes out  full sequence i will ask anyone who has watched it to compare it to the original and whether tom sixes quote that the first film is going to be my little pony compared to the sequel then i may consider watching the sequel,cruel
well when i 1st saw the trailer i said to myself that i have to see this movie now that i already watched it i feel like its an ok onethe doctor was seriously sickmad i never thought that human can be connected that way if in real life what is the point in doing that i hope that no one would ever want to do thatthis movie left me in thrilledhorrified all the time i never expected what will come next but the storyline is kinda slow i seriously expected that will be produce at the end of the movie i was expecting the victim to struggle more before being turn to you know like all the other movies which they had to struggle to survive before being killed or tortured thats the more concept i likeand the most disappointing part is the ending it doesnt seem right to have an ending like that the polices really dont help much they are like dumbass police who never been trained to be a police so easily killedbut however the movie is good to watched for the thrillhorrorrated r lover,cruel
and i dont say that in a good wayi dont say it in a bad way eitherits like in the middlewhy well ill tell you why after these messagesquick overview just in caseits about two girls on vacation in germany they get lost and find a house this is where we meet the weirdo doctor where after some little white lies p he gets them asleep and straps them to hospital beds where the movie finally kicks in with his ummmvisionthe acting to me its average it does the job though at first i would care less about themsince they are youre typical pretty girls that dont know how to do anything the situation they are in and the constant suffering just makes you feel really freaking sorry for them and the doctor is just so serious an into his job its like the actor was born to play this characterhe just looks like a psycho doctor i wouldnt be surprised if he was the doctor yelling its alive in frankensteinexcept seriousmaybei dont know i liked himthis movie is not the most original thing out there though once you take the whole thing into context everything else about the film its like your average thriller suspense filmthis movie is not scary its not even trying to scare you in this movie you are through the whole film just wanting to know how is it all going to end will they live will they die will the house explode in slow motion while racist transformers come save the day well i wont tell you cause i dont like spoilers but i will tell you thisthis is one of those few movies that once the suspense kicked in i was in freaking suspense i was freaking trembling out of the stress of what was going on and its been some time for a movie to give me that emotion the movie is average but it did the freaking job i recommend it for the strong willed cause i seriously got sick a few timeshorror fans should check it out its cool,cruel
when i review a movie i do so and rate it for what the movie is intended to be regardless of my own bias towards a genre or style this movie plain and simple was extremely well executed the characters acting script was top notch the good doctor will forever be a horror movie iconwhat was missing medically accurate is just plain false advertisement ill skip out all the medical details but they could have done into a little more detail to make things more believable and fill in some plot holes  how did they get onto and off the lawn without ripping every suture they didnt do so well just going up the stairs at the end and something that just kept bothering me kept making the film look fake was the wrong angle  position for the actors mouth to anus attachment looked more like mouth to above tailbone a little more time could have been spent explaining things and making it more plausible how exactly does the girl swallow the mans feces without vomiting out her nose and into her lungs drowning herself the lets wound but not kill the villain scene was a bad bad oh so bad clich that did ruin thingsthe ending was however excellent,cruel
when i sat down to watch this i was hesitant bc i thought i was going to be seeing another cheesy bmovie with gratuitous gore  silly dialogue but to my surprise this was really well done for a movie whose plot is about a this is good as it can get the ambiance was greatcreepy and eerily sterile the acting was surprisingly good as well they couldnt have picked a better dr whoever that actor deiter lasor is he is the scariest weirdest german i have ever seen i really enjoyed this feelgood movie i hope there is a part two coming soon i hope this will be the new the blind side at the oscars next year,cruel
i dont understand the poor ratings this movie has received body horror at its best to rival the master cronenberg the title itself gives the impression of an awful b movie but dont let that put you off one of the most inventive and bold horror movies i have seen for some time i have been a horror fan for over 25 years and have enjoyed most of the classics of the past 60 years if you fancy something a little different check this out brilliant filming and acting albeit from a small cast make a ridiculous plot idea seem absolutely sublime is a must watch for fans of the twisted sick in the best sense of the word tom six is a director with vision,cruel
that this horrific film has a rating above zero is outrageous the absolute sickness of this motion picture is beyond description and the disgust one feels in having it assault the senses is beyond any possible expression a repugnant ugly repulsive and overwhelming terrible movie few films have nothing at all redeeming in them but this is one of them magnified 100 times the supremely untalented director tom six is almost criminal in his abuse of the audience his imagery is unholy in its intense perversion and crushing in its utter depravity six should never be allowed near a camera or any other medium of expression the people of holland must be ashamed to have such a corrupt film director associated with them and vandalizing their cinematic legacy,cruel
first of all ignore all the 1 outta 10 reviews any real horror fan would not refuse to watch a film on the grounds that its sick or disgusting what we have here is a very clever remake of frankenstein which seems to have gone over most peoples heads mad scientist creates a new life form from the body parts of reluctant donors said life form turns against the scientist bringing about his death its grim dark and utterly without hope right until the final frame its not as some have claimed badly acted dieter laser is an excellent villain and the decision to film it in multiple languages is genius as it adds to the confusion and chaos it has a chilling scene where the mad scientist explains to his would be donors what hes going to do to them and its followed by a nerve wracking attempted escape scene and it all ends in a nihilistic nightmare of despairwhats not to like if youre a horror fan,cruel
a mad scientist dieter laser kidnaps and mutilates a trio of tourists in order to reassemble them into a new pet a created by stitching their mouths to each others rectumswell the hype for this film made it sound absolutely repulsive and frankly it just is not that bad for a film that features defecating into another persons mouth it is as tame as could possibly be expectedi found it to be an above average horror flick with a nice nod to nazi experiments subtle but not too subtle obvious but not too obvious and the use of isolation when the two main characters do not speak german and another character does not speak german or english i would gladly watch this film again,cruel
how to describe first sequence if nothing else its an original idea there have been a few horror flicks whose sole purpose was to see how much the audience would watch  think saw  but this goes one further with a maniacal surgeon dieter laser stitching three people together to create what he calls a the shock factor is simply in the concept since theres not much in the way of goreas can be expected with these flicks the victims ashley williams and ashlynn yennie are given totally unrealistic lines but no one watches these movies to see great acting overall id say that the movie is worth seeing only if youre willing to watch some gruesome stuff also starring akihiro kitamuraps although you might have never heard of dieter laser it sounds as though hes been well known in germany for a while having won a german film award for best actor for john glckstadt im going to have to see that one,cruel
i was absolutely disgusted in this filmcome on late and i was distraught i actually fast forwarded this film pretty much the whole way through i felt sick to the stomach but intrigued was weird and had nightmaresi supposed the whole idea was good but generally means 100 legs whereby this had 6 and 6 arms totally rough film totally weird no wonder it was on tv in 2011 after being released in 2010 this film is crazy and who on earth would want to alter the stomaches etc to crap through 3 people so freakyi have to write 10 sentences now to write this review what can i say total messy film i dont know if i would want to see the next although would be weird to watchnot sure what would happen what if this guy was caught they girls and guy are scarred and ruined for life this guy has killed and ruined lives totally freaky why would anyone want a human pet like a dog thing hopefully no sequels come outawful,cruel
does this even qualify as a film who finances such sickminded productions better yet who has the even sickerstateofmind to sit through this i rented the dvd and was not astonished by the acting the cinematography the music or it simplistic and predictable storyline how did i learn of this films existence merely by watching an rerun of tosho where our humble host actually recommends the movie basically in the same way youd cruelly recommend a friend to watch the infamous two girls one cup video and in the same sense of that viral video the only real production value of this film is its shockvalueit lives up to many classic clichslike the idiotic yet attractive women whose car breaks down and seek help where they shouldntand the undeniable mad scientist or in this case surgeon the film adds the horrendously laughable tag line to the dvd  100 medically accurate which it is not even close too im sure any idiot can discern that i mean i laughed incredibly hard when the credits rolled just imagining how much any persons career must be in the toilet to actually be a part of something so pathetic whether they be director extra actor or the screenplay writerkudos to the tragic collapse of truly great horror to this garbage,cruel
tells the disturbing story of a mad german doctor whose previous whereabouts were in the medical field in which he performed operations to separate siamese twins he has now gone into seclusion and has invested all of his time and energy into doing the opposite crafting living organisms together to create a new species meanwhile two american female tourists have been unfortunate enough to stumble upon his home and now are forced to take part in his latest experiment along with a japanese man this experiment is to create a with the man in the front and the two girls in the back to do this he must split the kneecaps of these three people pull out the teeth of the two women one by one and then proceed to connect them via their gastric system and sew their mouths to each others anuses two films were released in 2010 a serbian film and that were reputed to be two of the sickest and most depraved horror films of all time after viewing both of them one thing i can say in absolute certainty is that they are both grossly overhyped neither this nor a serbian film which was infamous for depicting the anal rape of a newborn baby even come close to being as disgusting and repulsive as most have led you to believe if i were to choose what films i find most disgusting pink flamingos would still be the reigning champion sweet movie meet the feebles the wormeaters society and especially caligula would certainly be high up as wellwhat makes so gross is really the idea that has been presented and the endless atrocities that it could call for we can picture in our heads the idea of the person in the front of the defecating into the second persons throat and we can picture the idea of the person in the back vomiting into the second persons anus and we can picture the thought of that waste traveling through the bodies of these innocent people who did nothing to deserve this great torture until it is expelled however this is simply a throwback to exploitation horror films of the 70s and the 80s such as ilsa she woman of the ss and bloodsucking freaks this is not a film that can be taken on the same level as films such as martyrs or in a glass cage because it is not that graphic nor graphic this is a campy mildly gory and funny horror film that is intended to replicate the sensation of watching a midnight movie yes the images seem repulsive in our minds but on screen these images are very humorous theres an already infamous scene in which the man in the front of the defecates into the second womans mouth im sorry but i couldnt take that scene seriously i laughed i felt bad for laughing yes but the expression on the girls face is just too overthetop the opening scene details the doctor going after a truck driver who stopped to take a dump in the grass with a dart gun the girls stumble upon a gravestone for a threedog the acting is so bad that even the actors have a tough time keeping a straight face all the way through the scene in which the doctor explains his plans via wall projection is made ludicrous by the childish drawing of i mean this is some darkly depraved comedy if you laughed while watching the ebola syndrome or the untold story you will laugh while watching thishowever dont go into this thinking this is a laugh riot in truth there is a lot of horror here what makes it all hold together and work is the performance of dieter laser who i think plays one of the most overthetop and stereotypical villains since jon voights character in anaconda he is a monstrous insane decadent human being who shows no mercy to these girls he basks in the pain and misery of these characters to the point where they beg for death laser goes all the way with his portrayal of this monster and i loved every second of his scene chewing madness i loved the scene where he licks the blood off the stairs i loved the expression he made upon greeting these girls at the door i loved this mans performance it is just as sick and as atrocious as you are expecting the girls ashley c williams and ashlynn yennie were very funny and i had fun watching them in their portrayals of airheaded tourists who cant even bother to learn the german language before going to germany theres even a scene in which one of them has the most incredible luck i think i have ever seen in a horror film and gets the perfect time to escape and then blows it im glad she did too because i really wanted to see japanese actor akihiro kitamura also gives it his all in his performance of the only person in the who can speak i thought he was pretty funny overall not a good film but very enjoyable scary and funny please dont go into this expecting a depraved shock film about bodily horror go into this expecting a twisted bmovie this is an enjoyable film if you are willing to give it a chance,cruel
this usually isnt my first nor my last type of film choice when a film as a ridiculous title and the case looks pap i wont go near it i know youre not suppose to a judge a film by the cover and all that jazz but if you do sometimes you save yourself from being 2 hours nearer to deathhowever gain massive buzz around the net for its bizarre plot which intrigued me to watchfirst the dvd case it as a quote from the sun newspaper the first bad sign if the best quote you have is from the sun you need to rethink your marketing plan also the front cover as the front of pushed up against a frosted window screaming but im pretty sure that shot is never in the film usually the front cover as some connection to something that happens in the film maybe it was in the film but cant have been that memorable to place it on the cover we have a sub title first sequence which made me believe that there is going to be a sequel and i was correct called full sequence now to me full sequence sounds a bit like the end its not second sequence or new sequence but full sequence the only reason i can think of making a sequel to a film like is to make a franchise like saw freddy jason etc but full sequence where do you go from there more full sequence double full just doesnt work unless they go for the friday 13th route goes to hell goes to hollywood vs freddy hopefully not anyway after youve watched the film youll probably be thinking how can there be a sequelenough of babble on with the film i honestly thought this was going to be schlock horror blood and guts but surprisingly it wasnt that graphic compared to what i was expecting the first 1020 minutes were poor typical cheap horror flimsy predictable plot basically two american girls are visiting germany on their way to a night on the town their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere they find a house to get help the house is surrounded by woods with nobody else around the setup as been madethe house is owned by dr heiter who looks like charlie brookers long lost evil twin evil charlie is a surgeon who specialises in the separation of siamesetwins we first see evil charlie at the beginning of the film sat in his car looking at a picture of his beloved dogs which he has stitched together asstomouth to create a doggipede yes it really is a bizarre filmif you think ive given too much away then youre wrong because you can read all this on the back of the dvd case bar the doggipede but that happens within the first few minutes nothing is ruinedthere is a great scene where evil charlie as his prisoners strapped up in beds where he gives them a presentation of what hes going to do his illustrations are hilarious but you have to admit doing a presentation is polite giving them a headsupreminded me of the first saw film in the way that it used suspense rather than loads of grossout scenes which both films still have but in moderation it is probably more of a thriller than a horror im guessing like saw there will be a ton of crappy sequels that get more and more ridiculous it wasnt a great film wasnt even a good film but it is definitely a filmits average a fresh but odd plot in an oversaturated genre horror could have a new cult film in ,cruel
first i must state that this film is graphic and vile in almost every way possible but a creepy dead on performance from german actor dieter laser makes the film good enough to rent even with its sickly plot director tom six makes his best shot of doing a project he himself had dreamed of that took a lot to create and for investors to come on board took balls to do even though this film is nasty and sickly a great lead performance from dieter laser as dr heiter makes it good enough for me to say that if not see it in a theater rent it to give yourself a terrifying evening in watch it just for the lead performance of dieter laser he just captures this role and runs with it to the furthest extent to go with the material some may vomit during it some may never see the world the same again but see it for its lead,cruel
definitely a twisted concept not much gore and somewhat slow at points picks up here and there through out the movie enough in the right places to keep you interested in watching not a lose sleep over movie but definitely warped enough to be entertaining if you are tired of slashergore flicks and like a disturbing mind bender this is definitely worth the hour and a half of your time beginning is a bit typical horror filmish females are typical airhead type characters one is slightly more believable than the other the whole concept of what is going on beginning to end is unsettling starts fairly slow picks up a little then stays a bit steady for a while once the surgery takes place it becomes a little slower then in the end picks up enough to not be a disappointment,cruel
just what the hellwhat did i just watchedand im only at min50please guysdo yourself a favor and dont watch this thing i say thing because you cant name this a movie,cruel
once in a while there is a horror film acclaimed as the the most extreme one or the bloodiest one in the history of cinema something which will violate our senses and melt our brain something genuinely lawbreaker and unpredictable unfortunately what most of those movies achieve are just a shrug and an apathetic meh on the opposite first sequence justifies the hyperbole which acclaims it and even though i would not consider it as a masterpiece of the horror genre i cannot deny the fact that i found it shocking and repulsively original in short this is a fascinating horror filmthe force from first sequence does not reside on its images because it is not even very bloody its considerable impact is more conceptual than visceral and even though the physical viability of its premise is very questionable i cannot deny the fact that the film generates various moments of a delicious repulsion accompanied by the primeval fear of finding something which is totally antinatural and perverse in summary a horror film like fewsomething which does not mean that it will be admired by every single fan of the genre it is very probable that it will disappoint to those who expect a parade of amateur excesses at the style of slaughtered vomit dolls or to the disciples of troma films because there is not even a pinch of that characteristically irreverent and vulgar humor in here for better or for worse first sequence is a mature and cerebral film which was made with few money but which is brilliantly directed and conducted by excellent performancesactresses ashley c williams and ashlynn yennie bring perfect works specially when their characters do not speak and they only act with their expressive eyes akihiro kitamura credibly reacts to the things that happen to his character and there is a particular moment in which his performance is touchingfirst sequence is definitely a very strong film however i unhealthily enjoyed its concepts its grotesque imagination and its icy exhibition of cruelty and human suffering some might say that this films visual style lacks of identity but i think that the prosaic way in which the camera captures the horrors shown in here is much more effective than the edition tricks we can find in less ambitious films in conclusion i enthusiastically recommend first sequence with the warning that it is definitely not a film for everyone the subtitle first sequence suggests future sequels and even though i am interested in watching them i doubt that they will be able to duplicate the impact from the first encounter i had with this excellent film,cruel
first sequence is set in germany  starts as two friends  american tourists lindsay ashley g williams  jenny ashlynn yennie are making their way to a nightclub the car they are driving gets a flat tyre in the middle of some woods  while searching for help the pair become hopelessly lost the friends think they have found safely when they come across a house owned by sinister german surgeon dr heiter dieter laser who invites them both into his house with the promise of calling for help but drugs the two girls when lindsay  jenny regain consciousness dr heiter explains that he plans to use them in a sickening experiment to create a heiter plans to surgically graft three people together with the mouth  anus being the connecting points the third person in the is the japanese tourist katsuro akihiro kitamura in his basement surgery dr heiter completes the experiment  the worlds first is createdthis dutch production was written produced  directed by tom six this is a film that has gained a fair amount of notoriety  even my casual friends who arent interested in anything other than big budget hollywood blockbusters have heard of it hell first sequence was even reviewed in the national press over here with surprisingly balanced views which is an achievement on its own considering how they usually look down on such films one cannot discuss first sequence without mentioning just how twisted  sick it is while what you actually see on screen isnt that graphic the ideas  story in the film is just perverse  i could see many people having a hard time watching this apparently the film came about from a joke made by six about sewing the mouths of child molesters to a fat truck drivers bum as punishment  to be honest the entire film revolves around this one single idea the gross idea of someones mouth being sewn to someone elses anus  the rather messy  disgusting implications that scenario entails at a little under 90 minutes the characters are minimal hell neither lindsay or jenny can say anything once they are attached  the film takes place almost entirely in deiters house he is given no real motivation other than he is carry out some sort of sick personal experiment that has no obvious benefit deiter has no deep motivation or silly plan he is doing this simply because he wants to nothing more  nothing less if nothing else first sequence is a unique film its a memorable film  its a film that isnt ashamed of what it is in fact it revels in its twisted plot like when katsuro cant stop himself from defecating after lindsay has been sewn onto his anus  dr heiter encourages him by shouting feed her in another scene many may find unpleasant to say the least the ending is a bit loose things feel a bit rushed  unfinished but apparently this was always meant to be the first of two partsfirst sequence is extremely well made it has great crisp clean photography  none of the horribly dark shaky handheld camcorder headache inducing crap seen in a lot or recent horror films  theres none of that machine gun editing either everything is clear  totally understandable its never explained quite how dr heiter manages to transport from his basement to the upstairs which is an apparent plot hole when at the end tries to escape  it becomes obvious just how difficult it would be to move the thing about theres not that much actual gore here theres a slit throat some gunshot wounds a few brief surgery scenes  a bit of blood splatter the film has a deliberately clean  sterile look dr heiters house is minimalist chic with clean lines  light colours the plainness  cleanliness of the visuals is nicely at odds with some of the grotesque images shownwith a supposed budget of about 1500000 this has really good production values  is well made it definitely looks like a proper film anyway although set in germany this was filmed in the netherlands a dutch production set in germany with english german  japanese dialogue the acting is pretty good dieter laser is just a bizarre mix of creepy weird  mad while having a sort of nazi attitude goingfirst sequence is a memorable film its a gross  disgusting films that loves the idea of peoples mouths being sewn to someone elses anus so they can eat their excrement which will revolt many but in that sense i think the film is a total success i quite liked its twisted  rather disgusting central premise its certainly well made enough  has enough going on to warrant a watch the sequel ii full sequence 2011 is currently in post production to be released shortly,cruel
and not that terribly amusing a comedy i did like the girls in their hotel room and in the car just for their being so insipid were gonna meet this cute waiter who invited us to a party well at least lindsay thinks hes cute anyway they were laughablebut as soon as that first fat ass german drives up and starts being dirty with them its all passed its crestclimax as far as entertainment value goes and from there its straight downhill all the way low comedy at its lowest i guess sorry but theres nothing really remarkable mein lieber 3hund if you havent gotten the point by the time hes wielding his riding crop and saying eat it bitch that its a comedy then i guess youre clutching your dates thigh throughouti somehow feel like the cute directors snappy suit and stylish tile hat got him the big push for this movie more than anything else maybe that along with the fact that its so rare for anyone from the netherlands to achieve anything in any of the arts     he belongs on camera though really a cute guy but intelligent talented i love in this interview i found when he says oh this one director i always forget his name but hes really great ill give it a 2 just because somehow hes hoodwinked a lot of critics letting them show how forgive me much their heads are up their asses and for landing a deal with ifc when he should have counted himself lucky for troma to take this and for it to end up in as much obscurity as a typical release of theirs  ,cruel
i had heard many people tell me that this was the possibly the sickest film ever made so i was very interested to see if that would be my opinion as well from director tom six who apparently worked on the dutch version of big brother where it first began basically two pretty and ditsy american girls lindsay ashley c williams and jenny ashlynn yennie start a road trip across europe and they get a flat tyre in the middle of the night they start walking into the woods looking for help they find the isolated villa house of german surgeon dr heiter dieter laser he fakes calling assistance for the girls and drugs their drinks of water when they wake up lindsay and jenny have been tied down in a makeshift hospital ward in the doctors basement there is a japanese tourist katsuro akihiro kitamura as well dr heiter explains that he used to be a successful surgeon that separated siamese twins but he has a plan to do almost the opposite to stitch the three victims together in a medically possible experiment to become katsuro is the front lindsays mouth with teeth pulled out is stitched to katsuros anus jenny also with teeth pulled out has her mouth stitched to lindsays anus and all have their knees whittled a bit to make crawling easier the three patients wake up as the completed doctors sick fantasy creation their gastric systems have been connected and for a little while katsuro as the front refuses the doctors few demands obviously katsuro does eat some food fed to him like a dog in a bowl and of course when it comes to the need to defecate the excrement has to pass through the next body forcing lindsay to swallow it the doctor watches stuff like this with great delight but he is irritated by the three victims constant screaming of misery and pain and jenny is dying of blood poisoning soon enough two policemen detective kranz andreas leupold and detective voller peter blankenstein have found the villa and question the doctor about the two tourists disappearance they suspect that the doctor has issues and secrets so they leave for a little while the three victims attempt to make their escape stabbing dr heiter and biting his neck but katsuro decides to cut his own neck with a piece of broken glass at this point the police have returned for dr heiter kranz is shocked to see both the three victims and voller dead in the swimming pool and after being fatally wounded he does manage to shoot the doctor right between the eyes the end is simply lindsay and jenny still alive in their hideous state and they hold each others hands but jenny dies from the blood poisoning and lindsay is left crying with two dead bodies connected to her laser has a real christopher walken look about him with his jaw line and similar eyes he is a little like a cartoon villain but certainly very chilling it is certainly sick to see people stitched together in the way they are even if you dont see the bloody operation and a girl forced to swallow excrement is sick but ive seen sicker films than this it is a not bad horror thriller good,cruel
this film although seemingly a one trick pony was an enjoyable film for someone who enjoys gore and horror i have seen a lot of gore when it comes to horror and i must say this was enjoyable but i would never classify it as being a gore filmthe movie starts out like most films in the horror genre two girls in a different countryclich problems cause them to seek assistance from that point on it still carries the formula of horrorgore but the goal of the film definitely goes in a different direction than most obviously since it is called not going into too much detail i can assure you this film is very tame no gore a tad annoying and a few moments of shock value i can count on one hand how many times there is blood on the screen trust me most slasher films are more violent than this the only warning i can give to anyone who watches thisit just falls flat in the oh my god momentsalso the noises of the lovely train of people can get kind of annoyingall in all it was enjoyable different and not as disturbingshockinghorrifying as everyone said is was i suggest any horror enthusiast to watch just to see something different,cruel
worst movie everbest 3 word to describe my sister showed this movie to me i cant help but vomit all over my carpetto imagine such thing is impossible i dont know where tom six got the idea of putting someone mouth in the anus but that is just sick for the first time in my life im going to hire a therapistthis movie really mess up with your heads and wont get awayi fail my last test because i vomit all over my paper when the thought came into my mind damn you tom six but the actress who played lindsay is very pretty though she got great body and beautiful face i would really love to see her in some other movie,cruel
as i said the only reason im giving this movie such a high score is because this director marks the ed wood of our time the countless plot holes awful moments of scriptwritingunnecessary lines and absurd acting make this movie incredibly fun to watch the fact that anyone would actually try to take this seriously is what surprises methe trailer should be enough to make you realize you should be getting ready to laugh not to scream the asian character just tops off this movie with incredible hilarity the foil between his character and the others around him and his truly poetic lines make it so that even though he becomes part of a he makes it an artistic and very serious experience for himself so in conclusion any moviegoer out there waiting to see this movie should be prepared to laugh vigorously and fully enjoy this absurd film,cruel
its always difficult for a film maker to entice a potential audience in to the cinema  you can imagine the producers of this euro chiller scratching their chins pulling out all the traditional horror elements and ticking the checklist two female protagonists  check their car breaks down on a remote road at night  check theres a nearby house  check the home dweller is a friendly man  check too friendly  check hes a raving sadist  check so the producers then try and do something a little bit different  not quite torture porn in the way hostel was this film was no less controversial but slightly better simply because it does try and do something different with the horror formula combining clichd convention with body horror  since its also set in germany with a mad doctor who has the forename josef you can see its making a political statement that sometimes if human amorality is given too much free rein it can end in obscene sadism  that said its a film that is somewhat restrained  of course the premise is rather distressing  especially when the result of the experiment is revealed to the audience  but equally theres little in the way of explicit gore and the director tom six concentrates far more on the psychological horrors of the narrative,cruel
thank you tom six for being such a visionary series is astonishing brilliant gore mutilating fun shock anything that is gross and beyond weird in a troubling way is in this series the actors and actresses are all wonderful thank you for this sick world you added your two cents too from the get the story builds quickly and doesnt let up not even in the final credits i was amazed how well the story carried even though i knew the premise even half way through the film the twists and turns were still coming the whole edition of the medically terminology involved is such an added plus there are sick people out there who would watch this and be cleansed this truly puts other horror films to shame no other film can compete with the gore the plot the premise the acting the graphic scenes like i said it does not get any better than this series when it comes to horror,cruel
what can i saythis was a masterpiece and the rectum to mouth stuff turned me on great jerky film  yes  i watched it last night and the chicks were hot  heck yeah fun for the familyim a real doctorunlike the fool that wrote the first review and couldnt spell his own name to save his life from the receiving end of the middle position of the medically possible indeed  well i suppose everyone on earth should watch the second onei mean after they blow their load on the first one haha,cruel
the idea was great interesting somewhat weird and stomachchurning but the movie doesnt live up to it there are some good things aside from this idea i liked the stylistic nods to hitchcock and kubrick the camera work and lighting are good and while he occasionally resorts to cartoon villainy dieter laser has many moments where he is genuinely chilling against all this the story is very predictable and lacking in suspense despite the premise it is actually fairly light on gore and gruesome scenes and this diminished the suspense levels for me the direction has a lot of style but not a lot of substance technically the film is assured but the characters are stock and the remainder of the other acting is uninspired is a very poorly written movie in my opinion with dully written and delivered dialogue and big obvious and unforgivable medical errors overall has a good idea but bad dialogue a lack of suspense and a dull story stop it from being any more effective 310 bethany cox,cruel
im surprised at how relatively few of the reviews mention that this is a comedy perhaps its the difference between watching it alone at home or watching it with a large festival audience i saw this with roughly 1000 people at the fantasia film festival and everyone was roaring with laughter the tone is set right off the bat when a truck driver pulls over to take a crap in the woods and is shot with a dart while his pants are around his ankles in another scene a japanese guy is captured and hollers something to the effect of watch out we japanese are known to have superhuman strength when cornered theres also the my sweet 3hound tombstone and the framed picture of the 3hound creation on the droll nazis tv set both of which serve quite well as guideposts toward the comic tone of the film,cruel
this line from eurotrip is all i could think of during the first half hour of this film i mean the premise couldnt get more bizarre and i was expecting just another torture porn fiasco but by the end it turned out to be a rather fascinating study of madness and doomed obsession with playing godwhat really holds this all together is the performances of dieter laser and akihiro kitamura as the japanese man used as the head of the the two girls never really get a chance to act beyond the first 20 minutes but with a premise like this its understandable their mouths are basically sewn shut for the majority of the film insert misogynist joke here they can only communicate by holding each others hands and mumbling kitamura however is literally like a mad dog on screen bristling with anger and the will to escape and exact his revenge he represents the determination of all creatures to be free of the will of others which makes him the most relatable characterthen we get to dr heiter dieter laser is effortlessly creepy as the frankensteinish surgeon he lives in an outoftheway house in the woods and his obsession seems to center around the passing of three dog his siamese triplet dog who he appears intent on resurrecting this is never explored fully but it seems like a logical explanation heiters house is one of my favourite things about this film its mazelike hallways are only ever lit by natural light giving the film a claustrophobic feel and ratcheting up the tension in certain scenesdont see this movie expecting another hostel very little of the actual surgery is shown which is kind of refreshing the movie never goes for shock value opting for a more humanistic approach theres a few squeamish scenes but you wont be vomiting in your popcorn or anything i also loved the ending which is as thematically fascinating as it is satisfyingly bloody despite having one of the strangest premises in recent memory this film is easy to recommend if you can get past the rather silly opening setup and the doomedfromthestart evil plot theres a lot to enjoy here it was also scary enough to give me nightmares which not many films can accomplish,cruel
i actually thoroughly enjoyed this film it was quite an original horror movie concept and all throughout it had me wondering what was going to happen nextdieter laser did a good job playing the villain he was sufficiently creepy i think the reason a lot of people didnt like the film is because they didnt have too much of an explanation about his character particularly his motivation so he might have seemed creepy for the sake of it to some people personally i liked that as it leaves you thinking more and allows your mind to create more effective horrors than if you have everything explained to youashley c williams was enjoyable as the female lead although there were some typical horror movie clichs where her character does something blatantly stupid where you just want to slap her in the face and say dont do that this is one of the main reasons i didnt rate this higher than an 8 as i think the writing could have been a bit more creative with her character so she could have seemed more intelligent and stronger still though it didnt stop me enjoying it i just think the boundaries of creativity could have been pushed a bit further to turn this into a classic,cruel
so im sitting there after having watched the first games of the 2010 world cup and finishing off a 2nd bottle of wine when i decide to dig through some movies i had recently grabbed low and behold theres just beckoning me to sit for a spell so i load up the bong to camp out in front of the computer for a bit and hit playour two main characters at the beginning are cute girls who are lost and stranded far away from home excuse the gamma ray lyric steal which sets the mood for your typical horror flick the acting is questionable but not the worst ive seen by far anyone who has seen komodo vs cobra knows what im talking about besides that they are cute and delicious so who really cares how solid the acting is some of the dialogue is actually viable so theres thati was really considering whether or not to ditch the movie at the onset as it was a bit slow gathering momentum but then along came a spider in the form of our good doctor the girls needed help his house was nearby and fasten your seatbelts kids cause this movie is about to take you for a ridei honestly had absolutely no clue as to what was about to take shape in the basement  operating room i saw images from the cover and heard some scuttlebutt online but i just figured maybe he was mutilating some folks to make a funky type thing via thorax etc holy crapanoli batman was i in for a shock ive seen some sick stuff in my time and didnt think thered be much left that could come close to cannibal holocaust as far as revolting film but i stood correctedthis movie definitely pushes some limits friends and neighbors even the most hardcore fans of the genre will take pause to absorb what the good doctor pulls off nevermind all the verbal internet diarrhea related to the medical experiment in this movie its a movie ffs its supposed to be fantastical and absurd and shocking and thats exactly what our director accomplishes sure there are holes pun intended galore with the actors and languages and plausibility between this fact and that but none of these things take away from whats happening on screen theres sheer terror and revolting turns thatll keep the fan of the weird bizarre and disgusting quite contentedim surprised they actually found people to play these parts id have been laughing my ass off the entire time being hooked up to another persons back door while filming i guess thats why they didnt hire me  for all the questionable acting there are plenty of solid scenes which compensate there are worse actors there are worse scripts and much worse films if you like this genre is worth a serious look dont go by one bad review i still cant believe the director pulled this off  this was a fun ride in the land of the totally messed up,cruel
i must admit i have seen so many horror films in my time and i adore these odd b movies however i have never seen one quite so original as this it is so outrageous the mere concept of such a thing is terrifying given the actresses especially were of a low standard and the production wasnt incredible there was no underscore and tension lacked in placed but the sheer obscurity makes up for every technical fault the use of foreign language to heighten a sense of disorientation and detachment from comfort was effective i also loved how the doctor was portrayed i cannot remember the name of the actor but he was brilliantly horrible i was texting a friend through the film and much of my vocabulary amounted to sick revolting screwed up and so on this film is not for the faint hearted,cruel
i remember when i first read about first sequence being made and thought the plot synopsis sounded rather silly looking into the story in more depth and its not quite as far fetched as you might first think its about a scientist called dr heiter who is well known for separating siamese twins and now likes to experiment joining people together instead he has a plan to create what he calls a the movie is very silly and certainly not based on a true story but is possibly based on or inspired by a true scientist josef mengele who under nazi rule was allowed to carry out sickening experiments on twins hed attempt to attach twins and transplant their organs and alter eye pigmentation of the 1000 pairs of twins used only about 200 pairs survivedso in the movie we have a similar warped german scientist two very beautiful american girls car tyre bursts in the middle of nowhere and as theyre both apparently incapable of even attempting to change it they go to look for help guess whose house they come to yeah bad luck girlsyouve probably heard this movie is sick and it is but its not as graphic as you might expect in a way i was disappointed that they didnt show the joins between the people properly and had them wearing these bandages throughout this was partly to cover up genitalia i expect but it seemed like a cop out in an otherwise uncompromising movie still its the idea that is the disturbing thing another problem is that you already know what is going to happen pretty much due to the title and plot synopsis so all the time one of the three was trying to escape i knew they wouldnt i felt there wasnt enough plot to fill an hour and a half so it was quite drawn outi have to give this movie credit for at least trying something original its not that scary but is rather gross disturbing and works well as a horror because in most horror movies the threat is death in this the threat is a fate worst than death especially if not the head of the it ends with a situation that i really hope im never inits a truly horrible movie so horrible that you just have to laugh and i think the humour is intentional,cruel
whether it could be or there ever has been a situation like this is part of what makes the film remain oddly entertaining and believable that along with the suspense of how it will turn outbut it is also annoyingly stupid at times replace the beyond believably stupid girls and situation with better characters and plot and it would be great horror the actresses arent to blame they performed as told and probably better than their paychecks would requireanother recent along with the very different lo good late night theater horror film where theres both a combination of stupid screaming girls to laugh at and a story that crawls into you,cruel
bad decisionsbad decisions and more bad decisionsthe idea is discusting but original other than that the movie has stupid decision making and plot twists at his worse the police departament is just crap even crappier than the third members mouth,cruel
there are much more shocking horror movies out there that are made with real talent this is just made to create a hype and they succeeded in that it did cost them more than a million dollars in losses thoughthis movie is certainly not classic horror at all its camp only a few seconds are really disgusting or horrifying whats all the hype about the acting is mediocre at best which deflates any kind of horror thrill for me personally real classic horror cant be found in this picture which is more a cunningly marketed hypenot as bad as it is made out to be because bruce willis movies are giving me more headaches at least they tried to make something special with unfortunately they failed at it because of lack of talent and money,cruel
some movies are so much talked about you have to see it this movie was made popular through the animation series southpark in the episode called humancentipad season 15 episode 1 stan was connected to an ipad the same wayafter this episode aired everyone was wondering where southpark got their inspiration well the movie called and the movie went viral and became a cult hit overnightyes the acting is bad but on the other hand the effects are nice yes the story is thin but on the other hand its easy to follow yes its more gross then scary but on the other hand it do got its scary momentsif you really want to see the most gross intense well made movie ever you have to see martyrs 2008 see the dutch movies always are recognizable because they have something different and that makes them always enjoyable,cruel
utter waste of time illogical film whats the film trying to convey  idk how the producers decided to invest in this script useless one and it seems this is a part of a trilogy sounds more like a tragedy,cruel
first sequence 2009a mad scientist kidnaps three people and turns them into by sewing the mouths of the third and second person in a row to the anuses of the second and the first i think that this description alone is enough for you to see how this thing is not worth your time i honestly have no idea what made me watch it and even worse what madness came into me to make me watch both sequels after i already saw how disastrous this is this is in every aspect essential and technical complete crap on my scale the 110 is a movie that i did not manage to see through the 210 is a movie i finished with superhuman effort so i will rate this crap310ii full sequence 2011the fan of the first film decides to surpass a crazy doctor and connect twelve people this film is slightly less crap than the original410iii final sequence 2015inspired by the previous films the warden of a notorious prison decides to bring his unbearable prisoners in line  literally grows to 500 members to be honest this one is also complete crap but i must admit that it is somewhat amusing410,cruel
yes sick film from some very disturbing filmakers love it,cruel
movies are supposed to entertain andor inform people not throw people further into the abyss of despair perhaps its the end of the world as we know it as to why theyre making this kind of shfyi this is a movie that cannot be unwatchedid rather commit harakiri than dupe anyone into watching this film especially even as a joke because its anything but that i may have have the fortitude to endure watching the entirety of the film and live to tell at least in this website btw about the experience in my case i was metaphorically strapped into the chair a more apt description ludovico method seeing it once and having surviving that experience deserves some commendation but watching this pile of rotting poo regurgitating it once more however i think id just die limits of the human psyche and gi tract pleasebut then after i have contemplated in having watched this cinematic anomaly i think that this movie is still worth that onestar imdb rating all for its conceit of testing the audiences tolerance for anything that is stomachchurning in this world it is a movie the pushed the boundaries as to what st they can think they can get away with to feed those who still depend on cinematic output for nourishment and i wont apologize for the tasteless pun and analogy fkthat people talked about this one still giving it a dignity of being worth mentioning otherwise they would have just simply opted to flush this one down the proverbial toilet a place that it definitely deserves we should now draw the line starting with this movie anybody trying surpass the depravity depicted in this one in the future should be shot in a firing squad please instantaneous death no need to torture them because were still humans arent we and they could sell tickets just for people to witness and delight in the spectacle and stuffing themselves with all the junk food the world while theyre at itthe movies worst assault to the intelligence that warrants it a humongous flunking mark giving the ending of the already horrific movie a tragic tone at least for one of the victims fk no i dare say egregious might it have been throughout and also considering the dreadful body count that this uberflimsy horror flick delivered for me it should have had actually a comedic one and already end the story there and not draw it out creating further sequels but perhaps for those people who will stick for too long wondering where the narrative will bring the viewer thats whole point ,cruel
the most shocking film to ever exist entirely deplorable and revolting sort of brilliant cronenbergian care and precision did we watch the same film no seriously did we i wanted a fun exaggerative body horror that doesnt hold back in conjoining the human anatomy what i got was a tame badly acted and boring film to which its only existence is to be controversial except it wasnt it was just terrible two tourists are stranded and ask for help from a crazed surgeon who wants to create a so firstly someone tell tom six that a has typically around thirty legs at the bare minimum its more of a human isopod secondly and most importantly this film is pointless absolutely inherently stupid six states that the narrative was a reflection of fascism and that it is a commentary on the horrific actions of nazis what a load of excrement you cant transform rubbish into pretentious nonsense theres no substance to the german shenanigans six is as subtle as throwing a flaming brick through a window and shouting i did it the two american tourists were on a different level of stupid sure you break down and wander the german woods at night only to come across the most sinister surgeon in the lands but you drink his water you dont physically call the car rental service yourselves you escape and go back for your friend stranger danger girls come on the good thing is that their mouths are silenced once they are surgically attached to the other persons other hole no not their nostrils they physically could not act groaning and moaning their way through this pointless ordeal lasers menacing performance is the only redeemable quality there is probably one scene which involves defecation that may be squeamish for some but you dont connect pardon the pun with the characters so all the defecating and swallowing means nothing making for a tame and dull experience quite simply atrocious,cruel
not only do i not want to see this movie i dont even like thinking about it ive got a strong stomach and rarely get offended by anything but the idea just gives me the creeps,cruel
as a horror and thriller buff i check this film out low budget with little gore this movie struck a nerve with me given that i was impressed someone would even make a movie like this i enjoyed the simplicity of the movie,cruel
this is the worst concept for a movie ever seen just sadistic inhuman  horrible writers thoughts stinks more than anything never watch this or make such thoughts,cruel
tom six2009is a fun film and you will find it so if you like madscientist serialkiller slasher films dieter laser was the perfect choice for playing dr heiter who is a mad eccentric vile nutjob with the leer of a mantis in no way does the surgeon display any humanity so in that respect the viewing experience isnt convoluted by misplaced sympathy ashley c williams ashlynn yennie and akihiro kitamura make a great and i found myself yearning for them to escape the mantisembrace of heiter although there are weak points in the films plot they do not bring the film down maybe if we had been shown heiter hunting for segments more the film would have generated more hopelessness and terror you will squirm you will cringe you will laugh you will cover your mouth with your hand you will long for a good outcome and you will see a horror icon in deiter laser alike to christopher lee and anthony hopkins and i dub him the human mantis im not a gorehound but i am a horror fan and i have to be honest this film doesnt deserve the reputation it has all the sickness in it is concentrated in its antagonist and the rest is very human,cruel
i dont recommend because its a peace of st heres the deal the director was going to make a peace of st and he made a peace of st and now you can see that peace of st and thats it i dont recommend to watch this unless youre a psycho 010,cruel
first off the whole movie was just stupid in my opinion and second there was no point in the movie i cant believe they made this movie into a series why the hell would a guy capture two girls and a japanese guy just to cut open certain body parts and connect them into a this is the worst movie i ever saw in my entire life,cruel
this is absolutely disgusting and satanic honestly i dont understand how people are allowed to make such filth really shows how messed up the world is im sure some sick individual is going to try this based off the movie how about this stop giving psychopaths ideas the world is bad enough without these kinds of movies in them i cant believe anyone would even agree to partaking in such a film i hope all of them get some help they need it,cruel
these films have been out there for awhile daring people to check them out written and directed and produced by tom six this is a lackluster attempt at a horrordisturbing film i actually felt ashamed at myself for even viewing this disaster there was absolutely no real true dialogue no suspense no real horror just simple disgust the plot is very lame very simple a renowned dr of separation of siamese twins is deranged and hellbent on reversal making people conjoined to form a so he kidnaps people holds them prisoner and mutilates them conjoins them for his sick pleasure tremendously laughable acting horrid editing painful to watch with any real enthusiasm i give it a 3,cruel
not as disgusting as i thought it would be yes the central plot is probably the grossest one youll ever encounter but the movie itself is not as graphic as a thriller it is not too bad direction is good and performances are ok,cruel
lets just say the person who made up the ideas of this movie is mental and stupid who thinks of this the movie is just plain awful,cruel
i was wary of watching this film at first but im glad i exposed myself to it this movie is more creepy than scary this is the kind of movie that will sit on your mind for days after youve watched it overall a decent movie to watch if youre looking for a slow burn suspense film,cruel
one of the worst movie i ever watched not only because sick story but even execution is very badbase of film is very sick  im 100 sure most of people will not be able to tolerate this filmwatch this movie only if you have nothing to do in this world,cruel
dont watch this movie unless you have a weird fetish for seeing people pooping in each others mouths this movie is disgusting and disturbing yes it is original but not in a sane way all i want is just to forget about this movie,cruel
worst shit ever dont waste your timealthough im here just to wash away that write a reviewthing id like to warn you on the process you can waste your time on something better,cruel
im still wondering why this movie was made there is nothing good here the movie is gore horror and is based on this two girls end up getting lost and knock on the door of an old man who is actually a totally crazy old doctor who will arrest the girls with another boy and try to create a by sewing their mouth to the rectum of the person in front of them sounds crazy enoughthe script simply runs over medical or anatomy issues without any consideration for our intelligence clearly in desperation the movie simply wants to shock its sick its repulsive but the truth is that it also brings few truly novelties that do not have equivalent in other horror films then you have the awful dialogues the actors worthy of a lowbudget b movie and a flood of clichs loaded with predictability is it worth watching it i dont think so,cruel
if someone making porn decided to make a sick and twisted movie it would be like this the dialogues were so bad that i couldnt take anything serious at all it was just sick for the sake of it films like a serbian film shouldnt be named in the same breath with this one that film had a purpose and was technically sound unlike this garbage,cruel
i never expect to see something to be shown on horror channel so disturbing on tv but when it came to the dr talking about the human centipeade surgery i was get really distressed and see it all form ed up i was shocked and it was horrible i mean who would want to do this acting good but i wouldnt want to recommend this film to faint of heart only to the very extreme horror fans,cruel
i am absolutely appalled with this movie and embarrassed that i watched about half of it before coming to my senses and acting like a decent human being again by turning it off what on earth has happened to the human race that a movie this disgusting can be conjured up in some perverts mind produced even rated and released as entertainment for the public the world has some serious issues if this garbage is deemed appropriate for release i am so ashamed to share a planet with a film maker that is no better than a murderer rapist or paedophile the film industry really needs a severe overhaul and its about time the world woke up to itself and simply stopped creating such disgraceful exhibitions of human degradation no wonder some of the human race are in such a mess what is it that people get out of rubbish like this do they get off on human suffering or do they relate to the mentality of the deranged psychopaths furthermore what type of person creates a story like this not someone i would like to be associated with at all,cruel
i would have rated this movie below 0 if i could this piece of s shouldnt have even been a movie plot is disturbing and stupid the acting of the 2 girls was terrible beyond anything dieter laser acted surprisingly well as a twisted surgeon but it still doesnt change the fact that this movie was dog s it just makes me angry that this movie has 2 sequels tom six should be the one sewn to someones ass this movie is a waste of money time and can disturb your mind in a gory manner if anyone likes this movie he is twisted as f,cruel
watched home alone no lights on worse mistake than somehow messing up a box cake mixwell this film totally scared my mindnot even holy water blessed by the reptilian space pope can cleanse what i saw goodbut messed up filmoriginal non hollywood style ending of the hero saving the princesses and prince i wonder how much it cost the german tourist industry,cruel
of course the bad guys nowhere around when the main girl manages to evade him early on and earn a chance to run away because she stops and makes the evertypical decision i cant leave my friend and then suddenly is there to stop them both once she has her around her shoulder and unlike the newest the texas chainsaw massacre does she end up regretting that idiotic decision in the worst way the japanese guy goes through the trouble of coming up with the plan of grabbing the scalpel and hiding while the bad guys talking to the cops upstairs only to set the group up for failure by biting the guys neck next to the jugular so that it merely takes a chunk flesh away but clearly isnt spurting any blood and leaving the scalpel in the guys shin harmless as he leads the group up the stairs he didnt have to end up cutting his throat to avoid a standoff with the bad guy had he rationally assumed he wasnt dead by having a scalpel in his shin and a chunk of flesh from the side of his neck gone or at least taken the scalpel with him,cruel
this film is horrible dont know who decided to make this but its horrible this is the worst film i have seen and will not be watching the othersi think that this film is not very realistic i also think that the plot isnt really set out properly the surgeon would lose his certificate to be a surgeonnot a very nice film to watch,cruel
bad acting in my opinion and the movie had a very slow climax also the actors werent convincing enough for a movie like this nor was there enough time that was spent for plot development also if youre looking to diet please go ahead and watch you wont wanna eat after this one thats a joke dont get triggered please but anyway its justnot as good as people made it out to be but if you wanna surprise someone or make sure they never come over to your house again here you go,cruel
spoiler alert this the absolute most dumbest movie ive had the displeasure to watch the story line was garbage the plot was garbage and it had unnecessary suspense and build up i hated it i wish i could give this junk a 0 out of a 10 what a way to waste my friday night smh,cruel
this movie had the worst of everything horrible acting constant crying every impossibly bad decision a character can ever make every victim i even saw a boon on the right side of the doorway in one of the laboratory shots i seriously cant stop thinking about the bad things about this movie the only reason to ever watch it is to say youve watched the worst production ever to hit the screen,cruel
i have to say is an interesting film the idea may be ingeniously disgusting but other than that this film is a generic horror flick two american girls are vacationing in germany and after getting a popped tire havent seen 3 million other times stumble upon a retired surgeons house he drugs the two girls and kidnaps another japanese guy he then tells him of his diabolical scheme to sew three people together mouthtoass and thats pretty much it pros the idea of the film is a unique one to say its at least trying to be different dr heiters look is definitely good for a horror villain not too boring the execution of the is very convincing and welldone cons generic horror formula tires popped meet a bad guy blah blah blah characters are bland and 1dimensional you really dont give a rats ass about the two girls because theyre so god damn irritating takes way too long to get to the 50 minutes to be exact after initially kind of disturbed by the idea youll generally get bored of the film after some moments are kind of laughable dr heiter trying to imitate a chickenoverall is interesting but really isnt a very good film or enjoyable for that matter if you like this type of film then ok youll probably like it a lot for the rest of us its kind of a pointless grossout flick rating 310 out of 100 39,cruel
awful sickness i just accidentally watched this movie in a small cinema but i think there are two groups of mentally sick people the first is who make films like this the second is who enjoy them and feel some exceptional artistic deepness it is not worth to lose time in seeing it,cruel
its the worst movie i have ever seeni think the person who had the idea is a psychocan t explain this stupid and sick ideadisgusting and sick movie  can t imagine that would like to someone and if there is someone  he is dangerous believe me it s about an experiment of a sick doctor who wanted to make a can you imagine it i can t even eat without thinking of thisi can t even believe that i spent 128hour of my life to see this movie  i think the director should go to jail  even if he has not made a crime  he will make people crazy like him i dont want to give more details cause i want to forget about it,cruel
this movie was terrible the only reason i had nightmares that night was because of how satanic the movie was it is disgusting and there was no point to it except to show a satanic surgeon stitching peoples mouthes to their anuses therefore making thee person behind get nutrition by eating the next persons feces guess i could also say it was a crappy movieand it was not scary at all but extremely satanic i advise you not to watch this movie if you have a weak stomach or you dont like demented things if you are a sadist youll enjoy it but otherwise you will want to throw up all day long do not watch the movie i repeat do not watch the movie,cruel
years of being a massive horror film freak i have never seen such a pile of garbage in all my life  if youre gonna think about renting it trust me youre whole evening will be wastedit was so bad i forced myself to watch the whole film just to see a ridiculous ending with no story no plot and no outcome just a total waste of timewhen it comes to the actors i honestly believe they literally picked them up of the street the day beforeif you wanna watch trashy b movie horror which i love  for gods sake go and rent the blob or similaror if you really have a fetish about somebody taking a dump in youre mouth then the human crapapede is the film for youi almost want you to watch it just to see how bad a movie can be total crap,cruel
is a truly horrifying and vile movie crafted from the mind of a director named tom six i am including spoilers in this review to help explain my opinion for those unfamiliar with the plot a sadistic doctorscientist lives in a wooded area in europe the scientist is somehow enamored by the idea of attaching mammals together in an implausible mouth to anus sequence one night two silly young women go the the doctors house because they have been having car trouble he drugs the women and decides to use them to make the premise of this film is that three people an asian man and two european women are attached mouth to anus the idea of doing this is so vulgar and wretched this bizarrely evil films plot climaxes when the front of is fed laxatives this film really has nothing good about it i think it is wrong to make a movie about people trapped and being forced to eat human feces i would have given this movie a score of zero if zero stars could be given,cruel
dr heiter an older man who is thin as a rail drugs and abducts a truck driver two young women lindsay and jenny on a road trip through germany get a flat near his house unfortunately they accept his offer to get out of the rain he drugs them as wellthey awaken to find themselves secured tiedup in the surgeons basement with the poor truck driver dr heiter furthers his explanation of his plans for them his renown more or less explains his artwork he became famous by successfully separating conjoined twins after his retirement he attempted an inverse experiment joining three dogs together end to end so that they would have one digestive tract this failed but heiter wishes to try again this time with humans sadly heiter did not investigate why the first experiment failedheiters plans go forward with some bumps in the road for instance he is rather cavalier about leaving sit the vehicles of the people he has kidnapped all near his homeso will heiter succeed or will the victims find a way to escapefraught with logical problems and holes in the plot to the point where little if any of it made any sense also the subject matter was disgusting without being horrifying suspense none could one identify or empathise with any of the characters not really the whole mess was just too unbelievable,cruel
the whole concept of is just repulsive i am even sure who had the idea to turn such a thing into a movie i started watching it by pure curiosity and almost halfway through i could not keep watching  this seems more oriented for some sort of pseudoderanged group of people but im not quite sure how you can appreciate this movie if you have a straight mindthe acting is atrocious and especially both actresses who besides scream stupidly are kind of useless in the moviethe main doctors personality is frantically boring hes cold i know this was the purpose but such distance just really does not help the case of the movie theres no much of a story around him and why he was brought to doing thatthe plot sucks considerably theres just no story or anyways if there is one its essentially flat and boring theres really not much to say on this movie from a positive standpoint and to believe they actually made a sequel yikes,cruel
hey everybody today im reviewing first sequence this movie is about two women named lindsay and jenny who are in germany and they get a flat tire and they meet a mad scientist named dr hieter who gives them some water puts a pill in the water and cause them to be knocked out and in hospital beds and he wants to make with an asian men and the two women one of the girls tries to escape but dr hieter is one step ahead of her this movie has a awful ending and is just bad stay away from this horrible movie im giving this movie a 110 stars anyway im gravityfalls2 and have a nice day bye,cruel
the only reason i watched this movie is because it had a part 2 and 3 i figured the movie cant be too bad if they made two sequels how wrong i wasthis movie was dreadful the very concept makes no sensemaking a out of people a wack job surgeon in germany literally makes a out of three strangersmouth to anus yes so digest that for a second this movie had no point no substance no nothing but a disgusting mutation created by a german michael shannon look alike my stomach is still turning after seeing two women and a man stitched together in one of the most abominable creations ever conceived they may have been terrible actors but they didnt deserve that and you can imagine just how few lines the two ladies had considering they were the tail end of the this movie is for you if 1 you have a strong stomach 2 you like horror 3 you like seeing people being horrifically morphed into different creatures 4 acting and plot dont matterdont look for scares dont look for a story line heckdont even look to make sense of it all just look to cringe and turn pale andor green i really think the writer and director tom six had a gross nightmare and decided to turn it into a movie not every idea deserves to be a movie tom,cruel
big spoilers ahead its okay no connection with the characters coz no character development lacks some elements that other horror thriller movies have the part when the japanese guy cut his throat was unexpected but then i thought there was no back story behind that or at least some clue but then i also thought that maybe it was done like that for the sake of unpredictability i didnt find it that clever the crazy doctor was giving off too many obvious clues that hes the murderer to the policemen which i wasnt a fan of and also why would the police not bring their search warrant when they went there to search for missing people i know its a movie but cmon maybe they went to get their guns thats why they left i dont get it xd it kinda defeated some elements of the movie for me this is already gross and i didnt want it to be grosser but it shouldve put more gross elements on it plot build up was okay some parts like when they were climbing up the stairs was thrilling and when the protagonist was trying to escape its lacking to me i felt like the japanese guy had more connection to me than any of the other characters but just a slight connection i didnt feel the utter dread from the doctor that i feel from other villains its kind of predictable coz the policemen died i kinda liked the part when the girl protagonist was the only one who survived in the but we all know shes gonna end up dead anywaywatched on thurs 1203,cruel
as a fan of horror films i discovered this title on netflix one day and sat down to watch it was a decision i regretted in very short orderbefore long i was tempted to turn off the movie but forced myself to finish so that i might warn people off this horrible project no one should be subjected to this it is repugnant repulsive disgusting vile gratuitously cruel and obscene there is not plot no problemsolution no character development it is nothing more than a showcase of the depravity of a main character who if he actually existed i would not hesitate to dispatch slowly with the first jagged rusty implement i could findi watched all the way to the end of this movie with the intent of helping others avoid it do not watch this movie i mean it,cruel
is a horrid despicable movie that really had no business being put to celluloid ive watched my share of atrocities but this is on a whole new level and i had heard that many potential actors simply walked off the set once they realised what they had to do and what the movie was about and on watching this i wouldnt be at all surprised if that were trueset in germany the plot centres around 2 american female tourists on a holiday through europe they decide to go out to a nightclub and on their way there the hire car gets a flat tyre and with no mobile phone reception of course they are for all intents and purposes stranded a car does come along but the driver is not interested in helping them and makes a number of sexual comments instead but with the 2 tourists not being able to understand a word of german they dont really get it eventually they cotton on to what hes on about and ignore him the girls then decide to take a walk through unknown woods in an unknown country in the middle of the night to try and find help why they didnt just follow the road they were on in anyones guess although given the title of the movie were not discussing shakespeare here after a heated childish argument and soaking rain the 2 girls come across a rather nice well kept home owned by a renowned and retired german doctor made famous by performing separations of conjoined twins at some point however hes turned quite mad and is now more interested in joining people together in the worst way possible no explanation is ever really given as to why he went in this direction after a healthy dose of rohypnol the girls pass out when they awake they are bound to hospital beds in the basement along with another victim a truck driver captured earlier the truckie is then killed as hes now considered incompatible with the 2 girls a third tourist a japanese man is captured and brought to the house all three victims are then shown a makeshift slide show outlining their fate as unwilling participants for a where they will be surgically joined together sharing the same digestive tract apparently the doctor had moderate success when he performed the same operation on his 3 rottweiler dogs and even though they all died from the operation if at first you dont succeed yadda yadda yaddait sounds repulsive and abhorrent and it is after the success of the operation the japanese tourist being at the front of the spends most of his time screaming abuse at the doctor or trying to raise the alarm the 2 girls being the middle and end of the are for all intents and purposes effectively silenced for the rest of the movie however spend the entire time sobbing the doctor then goes about trying to train his new pet what for is also never revealed but it is what it is the scene where victim one has to defecate right into the mouth of victim two is particularly repellent but that action is the crux of the movie in reality the 2nd and 3rd victims will never get the nutrients they need from the waste of victim one and subsequently victim 2 so the absurdity of the experiment should be obviousin the end the experiment fails as it was doomed to after an attempted escape the japanese tourist kills himself by slicing open his own throat the girl at the end of the line dies as she develops a blood infection leaving the girl in the middle surgically stuck between 2 dead people two detectives investigating the missing persons are also killed who in turn manage to also kill the doctor with a lucky shot to the head the movie ends with the fate of the middle victim left unknownthis movie has no redeeming quality whatsoever its complete drivel from start to finish and i had read that the premise of this movie stems from a joke about criminals and quite frankly thats where this shouldve stayed the fact that this godawful mess has spawned 2 sequels is a sad testament to the state of what the human race considers entertainment if you decide to watch this well youve been warned if you decide to steer clear youve missed nothing,cruel
did i really just watch that is the reaction felt after watching the first sequence of a twisted concept exists in the mind of director tom six but its one that doesnt take shape due to a number of factors first off the acting is undeniably questionable chiefly the trio that make up and the doctor whose mental state engulfs rational thinking grief is not felt for the blithering three as the girls ashley c williams and ashlynn yennie common sense doesnt kick in until miles after its too late theyre strapped to hospital gurneys ready for their procedure just as a young japanese man is the questions that will be filling your mind do come no spoilers here as dr heiter dieter laser runs through the conventional duties an owner would do with his pet loopholes are aplenty the most obvious being the s attachments and whether its possible others exists but thats for you to find and decide for yourselves has quickly become a cult film but for the wrong reasons,cruel
warning definite spoilers if you havent seen this already i got around to watching this infamous horror film over the weekend right up there with the original saw and others for its overall shock value set in germany two idiot american girls what other kind of girl would you expect to have in a horror flick like this lol find themselves stranded in the forest then manage to make it to this crazy doctor bent on creating the titular experiment in medicinescience other than the obvious disgust i had two basic reactions to this movie the first half i reacted similarly to how i heard spanish audiences react with laughter i am like no effin way lol laughing at the doctors crazy antics the dumb things those two american girls would do now jump ahead to the second act and the three people are conjoined from mouth to anus with the excrement from the one person feeding the person behind them now at first i thought in the docs little showcase of what he was about to do i heard this was for the directors own horror that the digestion systems of the three would be altered so food would go through them in stages this is not the case however yes just as disgusting as you can imagine lol well for me im thinking now this is simply murder since the two in back are just ingesting the toxins coming from the person in front of them and this doc didnt think things through well enough stupid i knowlolwell ill have to say im on the fence on this one i like the movie for its shock value but tbh other than that its really just your standard tortureescape flick i do look forward to seeing the second installment in the series full sequence coming up soon though which ive heard is even more brutal,cruel
is pretty much exactly what is sounds like a made of people the movies plot really does not have to much to talk about so lets just say its a mad doctor movie while pretty much all the characters in the movie were horrible the acting was actually really good especially the main antagonist dr heiter while this movie may be classifies under the horror genre it does not feel like as much of a horror movie as it does just a torture porn but the idea of the dehumanization of innocent people is a very sinister concept while some people may be disgusted by this movie i recommend it to anyone who finds this at all remotely interesting 710,cruel
i watched this movie because of the insane curiosity of a friend of mine that introduced the film as one of the most splatter ever this created a big expectation in my group of friends  in both positive and negative way  as big as necessary to make a big boy faint at the 40th minute when nothing was already happened in addition to create a funny story to pass on posterity didnt shake me or my friends fainted one apart so much i wouldnt call this movie a splatter because the bloody scenes are not many i think that what upset of this film is the general idea a horrible inhuman insane mutilation with no reason and this can be its strongest and the worst point at the same time a part from this i found nothing of noteworthy in this movie i saw better and worse horror movies,cruel
i first heard of this film on a radio show while i was driving in 2009id always wondered a little about it even though im not into horror so when i saw it on i watched itall i can say is wow im amazed that it got any attention at all enough for me a person completely bored by horror films to actually hear about it enough to take the time to watch iti have taken one single anatomy class in my life but i think even if i hadnt i could still have made the concept more believablei was way too distracted by how illogical the idea is of creating a digestive tract through three human beings at least in the way he is supposed to have done iti couldnt even feel disgusted by the idea of eating feces i was so distracted by the biological inconsistencies of the whole ideaplus most horror films are eager to display the repulsive gore of how exactly their atrocities are accomplished but in this they showed only meager clips here and therelike seriously this is a unique idea i assumed theyd give me some hint of how they did it and what it meant in a literal sense come onthe bandages around their hips and heads were obviously only to conceal the actors genitals there was no actual purpose to have bandages there it annoyed methe acting of the girls was pretty horrible the dialog was meaningless and the logistics were unrealisticif anyone ever mentions to me that they want to see this film i can sum it up for them in probably 3 sentences,cruel
ive seen much more disturbing films than though at the time it can prove to be an arduous if engrossing watch the idea apparently originated from a dirty joke i went into this film really not knowing much about it the script is mediocre but the whole film is something different which hopefully wont send a trend in faecies as i had watched salo not long after this a psychopathic doctor a recluse kidnaps two chicks and an asian guy who overacts like you wouldnt believe we in awe of his new experiment to conjoin the three arse to face etc which when successfully completed isnt much to look at of course we have authorities making the mistake of walking into the house which they dont take up much of the movies time watching the operation is a bit hard as its terrible for the girls who act okay when the asian has to relieve himself surprisingly its not that that violent too but some of it is affecting like watching flesh being peeled back what have you affecting cause its more visually real sick disgusting foul horrible but bad no the story is actually very well structured and has a nice flow we learn a bit too about science as our psychopath a wonderful dieter laser who has an enlarged jeremy irons face teaches us of course the film doesnt end on a happy note but its lasers freaky chilling and evil performance that encapsulates us if also unfair was at the mtv horror awards rourke robbed laser of an acting award,cruel
first sequence is a really disgusting movie that has to do with a crazy scientist who wants to make a and he kidnaps three people to do so to make this he stitched their mouths to each others rectums and one feed the other he did all of that because he needed a new pet for himwhen i saw the title of this movie i thought that it will be really disgusting but i saw it because i have not ever seen such a movie like thatfinally i have to tell you that in this movie do not expect good interpretations and nothing from these staff the only thing that you will see is an insane thriller and you have to be prepared for it,cruel
honestly if i could rate this franchise with a 10  that is what i would have given it but a 1 will have to do so i knew there wasnt going to be a follow on from the first sequence to the second sequence of this movie fortunately for me i did not watch the first movie this one unfortunately i am burdened with my curiosity for things with hype i had wanted to know what everyone was talking about so i decided to watch the second film and let me tell you some of the reviews that i have read for this first movie i have come to realise that the second movie is much much worse i am the biggest horror genre fanatic you will ever come across its all i ever watch to even consider this as horror is a disgrace to the name after watching the second movie i can honestly say that i have never ever been more disgusted the fact that this was even thought of like who in their right mind thinks this is ok who even sits down and thinks hey why dont we make a movie about sewing mouths to assholes i have much more to say about this but then id be ranting all i am saying is that if you are burdened with the same feeling of curiosity  then watch with caution and maybe seek counselling after this movie seriously fs you up lol,cruel
i get the whole bad movies are just misunderstood thing i think i know that the folks who like this sort of thing are the highly intellectual types and see more in these films than i do as i am lacking in vision that sounds condescending no doubt but i really didnt mean it to be its what ive spent most of my life thinking was the case then i saw this film afterward i read these reviews now i dont know weather or not im condescending i watched this after having seen an episode of south park some time ago i thought it was just a more twisted story line of the writers and let it go at that then i happened upon a compilation of worst endings of whatever the year was and saw i couldnt believe it then i saw there had already been a sequel so finally i watched it earlier tonight i had to come to imdb immediately just to see what others have said my faith in trey stone and matt parker is fully restored im so grateful that they didnt think of this first i couldnt get through the whole thing i must admit my lack of imagination doesnt allow me to do whatever it is that its not doing is it grasp is it overlook things like the characters not using a phone when it sits before them or running when the opportunity presents itself i cant bring myself to get past those things long enough to get all the way through to the end which ive already been told is a bad one by one of the intellectual folks who like this sort of movie ahem i meant film sorry anyhow i thought it was awful i know that may steer some into seeing it just because they understand that bad films are just misunderstood by people with a lack of vision such as myself but see the south park instead its almost the same thing and it has a good ending,cruel
well as a film buff i try to check out all the films that get that infamous rep or people try toget banned to be honest they are normally an epic failure on many levels mostly as you dont really enjoy watching them i love scary movies i will purposely watch them on my own in the dark late at night with headphones maxed if it makes me jump all the way through and i end up sleeping with the light on lol its mission accomplished others in this class i suppose are things like cannibal holocaust which is a failure i was glad of what happened to them the crew were aggressive murdering b another is clockwork orange again even kubrick epic failed in this genre as you dont feel sorry for the lead as hes a nasty rapist piece of scum it was great seeing what was happening to him and this follows on the same lines really as far as shock value it scores high but at the same time its so badly done especially the plot its so stupid i think the director was literally just going for shock value and everything else he chucked in to make up the film what i will say is iam so glad my mind cant and doesnt come up with sick stuff like this i think he needs help really i def wouldnt want him anywhere near my kids or anything he obviously cant make a decent film which is why the end result is a shocking but piece of crap filmmaking,cruel
synopsis this movie is about a crazy german doctor dieter laser that seeks to experiment a project on humans he want to pin them together and make a pet out of them i think mainly because his dogs died and i got the impression he tried the same thing on them the doctor surgeon starts off by getting two female tourists lindsay and jenny ashley williams and ashlynn yennie he also gets an asian boy katsuro akihiro kitamura to get his creation started will he make this project completecinematography the setting is in germany and mostly at the house of the crazy doctor the setting looks ok nothing very bad to point out they have thought of how a doctor would have it in his home and done the set like it in my opinion should look like very clean and sterile place and many sick paintings on the walls if you have read any of my other horror reviews you may know that i am not a big fan of cgi effects in modern horror movies because they never seem to look good in this movie it is nothing of cgi and for me this is a big plusacting the acting in this movie is actually very good especially from the german doctor let me give some info about the main actors dr heiter dieter laser have done a good load of german movies i have not seen any of them he may be more famous by others maybe for his appearance in the tv series lexx if you are german movie fan maybe his best performance there is in a movie called kaspar hauser from 1993 lindsay ashley williams have not done too many movies nothing to mention anyway she did an ok job in this movie jenny ashlynn yennie have not done many movies before but has some upcoming in 2014 she is in an episode of true blood called in the evening nothing much to say about katsuro akihiro kitamura either but he did an episode of heroes called acceptancemusicsound this is not the kind of horror movie you would think or care much about the sound and music but it is ok nothing to point out there it was nothing that was out of place or anything if i should point out a favorite soundwise in this movie it may be the sound mixing of the more gory scenes costumemakeup this is not the kind of movie where you would look much into the costumes but everything looks good nothing out of place for its time of place or anything when i talk about makeup it is not always like how they look with makeup in a horror movie it is more like how the blood looks if it is that and how the mask or things like that looks in this it is mostly the blood that is the center and that looks great also how they look in the scenes where they are the and that looks ok i guess not my cup of tea to watch but summary this is a good horror movie for those liking it a bit sick if i should call it that because this is a very sick movie i got a bit disgusted at times so this is not a movie for everybody would not recommend it for a first date movie i always like to recommend other movies that comes to mind for those who like the movies i review if they want something more likewise the first movie series that comes to mind is the hostel movies if you want more of this movie it is a sequel 2 2011 and it is a third movie coming up later in 2013 but it is delayed as far as i know at the moment for the director of this movie tom six i have not seen anything more of him he has not made many movies but he is the director of all movies all in all this is not a bad horror movie but really not for everybody it was a bit too much for me but if you like it sick and disgusting in a way go for it,cruel
an absolutely underrated horror movie that deserves a much higher rating herethis movie delivers a fresh and original idea about a sick surgeon obsessed with performing an interesting operation yet it is labeled as sick and disgusting by so many people please dont bother watching this if you are easily disgusted by any form of sadism reading the synopsis you are aware of what kind of film this will be this movie actually doesnt showcase much gore as it is not the primary focus of this moviedieter laser is an absolutely phenomenal actor playing the creepy sadistic surgeon dr heiter i mean his face just cries out villain the two girls acting is mediocre at best however it doesnt take away from the filmof course there are moments where you will find the girls stupidity purely vexatious but of course without that this movie wouldnt existoverall this is an excellent horror film with in my honest opinion the best villainantagonist portrayed by dieter laser a must watch for any horror fan,cruel
other than intrigue from word of mouth on how bad this film is there is no reason to see this film it is not only insulting to the film industry and creative arts but a passionless uncreative style of filming and story tellingit is easy to see that the main goal of this film was to take a subject that would create a controversy and make the film quickly with the intentions of making money on the buzz the only positive comment i can make is the acting is not the worst i have seen with lower budget films it may be medically correct but the subjects would not survive more than a few days,cruel
there is not much to say about this movie the acting is terrible the doctor made me laugh so many times the way he takes his gun out of his car and put it under his jacket in the first 3 minutes made me laugh so hard and i should have known right there this wasnt going to get any better the first scene with the girls they sound like dutch girls trying to speak inglis im from the netherlands where this movie was shot and i know how dutch people sound trying to speak english the movie as a whole was just utter crap even uwe boll cant make movies this bad there is not much to see bad acting no story characters are 2d its just a comedy seriously im glad i didnt waste any money on this the whole idea of a was disturbing but there should have beenmore gore closeup of tearing seams when the walks shit spraying out of the middlegirls nose the operation should be more visible now you see one tooth pulled and one piece of assskin less then 1 minute other cast other director other scriptand then it might be interesting as a horror now its a comedy,cruel
i love to watch horror films i mainly enjoy watching cult classics i read about this film and its sequel and got the impression it was trash well thats what i got acting was bad okay a lot of movies have bad acting this film was so boring i ended up fast forwarding through it thinking something was going to happen nothing did i found the just to be ridiculous the film lacked any suspense and failed to become disturbing like the title lead me to believe excuse the quality of me review its my first oneoverall the film seemed more like a joke i didnt plan to like it i just thought it would get a reaction out of me which it didnt dont waste your time with this one,cruel
before seeing this i read comments of how disgusting it is and saw trailers that were very deceiving i then finally watched and what a waste of my time it wasthe story is very clichd with the teenagers going on holiday and something goes wrong weve seen that many times its predictable and when you see the girls connected as the the story just doesnt go anywhere yes it was gross to look at at first but then as the film went on my brain was thinking is this it is this all thats going to happen the pace was just too slow and when the action happened i was being past caring at the end i was just waiting till the film was finishedthe acting was laughable and atrocious where these people came from who knows i felt no connection with the characters and just didnt care what happened with them another clich is that the mad scientist is german wow havent seen that before ok it is well filmed i have to say but i would be more enthusiastic about it if it was actually a good film the director tom six just thought of shock value and thats it i even gave the dvd away to someone else which i wouldnt usually doi have things about the second film and it sounds just as bad and im not even going to bother seeing it i did hear it was banned and tom six was outraged and had a huge rant saying its only a fing film well im sorry but hes lost my support if hes going to act like that i didnt even support him through the first film anyway if he wants to be a good filmmaker he better improve on it and get his act togetheri would recommend you not to see this you will be wasting your time please dont give into the hype if you want a film to mess with your head id recommend you watch the texas chainsaw massacre the original or the shining  my all time favourite film seriously its an awful film,cruel
this movie doesnt even deserve a 110 rating in my opinion it was completely and utterly sickening to watch and no storyline to be exact what a waste of time i dont know how it even made it past production stages and now its being shown on tv is beyond me and the worst part is they made a sequel i dont understand how the actors in the movie could sit down at the script reading and listen to the director say hey ive got a great idea for a movie lets have mad scientist with no real character to him and no story to tell kidnap 3 victims turn them into a and watch them suffer until they all eventually die in which the actors reply oh yes sounds spectacular its the movie role i have been waiting for my whole life i mean come on are people really that twisted do people actually enjoy watching this movie dont get me wrong i am a horror movie lover and i love a good thriller but movies like this should be band from existence or at least shown on mars or somethingwhere maybe the aliens might make sense of this garbage,cruel
before you read this review i need to tell you that i was not able to watch this movie after the fortyfifth minute after that i was just skipping the scenes and taking a single peek in every about 510 minutes i watched many horrors with really ugly things but this was too much for me man compared to this the saw films look like a disney classic not mentioning the bad plot good old europe going wild again no signal in germany etc etc and that two extremely stupid chicks who are unable to find out how to change a tire who are going for help into the woods when theres a road and who dont call the police while staying long minutes in a locked up room near a phone this story is just simply the sickest most disgusting thing ive ever seen how could this thing win awards and how it is possible to make sequels to this lunatic nightmare there is or should be a limit that shouldnt be crossed even if it seems to be original writer and director mr six states he wish to make original movies and pushing the boundaries he should rather seek for professional help there are stories that never should be told this is one of them i highly recommend to stay away from this,cruel
well if so it doesnt quite reach that goal either horror no that would require inspiring some feeling of unease at the very least suspense not a whole lot of that either the purpose of this film is stated pretty clearly in the title and the film itself is nothing but a dull plodding journey to reach that end i love horror films i always have im not snobbish about itthere are plenty of horror films that are as stephen king once put it just going for the grossout that i still manage to enjoy i even kind of like the saw films which are nothing but silly splatter films im not squeamish in the least is quite simply the worst things a horror film can be boring and empty it holds no surprises and doesnt really offer anything new it isnt even really that disgusting this film turned me into a clockwatcher sheesh watch an actual autopsy and at least itll hold your attention i really shouldve known better than to watch this because the synopsis is all you need the visuals add nothing the script is genuinely laughable as are several of the performances go watch a serbian film if youre looking for a truly disturbing film that will not make you giggle or yawn that film is a torture test and you wont forget those visuals quicklyif ever if youre not quite up to that level of perversion because if youre disturbed at all by say the hostel films you are a neophyte try funny games the original or the remaketheyre pretty much shotforshot you might not get the gore you want for me buckets of blood does not equal horror but it is a creepy little film martyrs will give you all the torture you want but it probably wont really stick with you however any of the films i mentioned including hostel is preferable to hey maybe the sequel is better ill sure never know,cruel
the horror looks mild but is quite disturbing  is not realistic when looking as it plays in the 21 century asians are being stereotyped as afraid victim  dumb  people are being characterised of a country the movie builds op a creepy tension but at the end 3 people are fusioned together and it looks quite dull the movie idea have been copied straight from silent hill horror game homecoming from 2008the make up artist rob hillenbrink worked  operated in this movie although he lives a private life in the netherlands special make up was teached  given but even working with all types of people of ethnicity in these movie loft rob hillenbrink  his son discriminated in the past asians indians  jewish peoplebecause of the weak dutch law system this information was never send out public in usa or england in contrast of the diverse cast  crew an indian jewish women charged them about the violence  gore of r hillenbrink  e hillenbrink towards youngsters  violence level outside their operating hoursthe movie ideas are basic but the story line could be more stronger although make up  special effects dont always make the movies stronger in this case the storyline looks clich from another movie or horror game,cruel
oh my goddess let me tell you right now that i only marked this as a nine instead of a 10 because my laptop didnt have sound when i watched this film and my laptop was malfunctioning i cannot believe that someone was this inspirational and amazing tom six did a magnificent job on this film and as soon as i possibly can im going to buy this movie and just watch it with sound the character lindsay was my favorite the way she acted cool collected the way she escaped from the trap but was brave enough to go back and rescue her friend jenny even though there was a high risk she would be caught again she was beautiful and courageous putting her friend over herself and often having to comfort her friend jenny though not as high in my ranks as lindsay was also amazing her emotion her acting her constant fear and dejection was enticing and breathtaking katsuro with his constant insults toward mad scientist josef heiter made my skin tingle in anticipation of what would happen nexti only have few criticisms about the film many around me point out that though he connected the digestive tract how were the characters to urinate with those diaperlike things on them and if the women were to have their menstrual cycle what would he do nevertheless tom six delivers this production in a wicked fashion of horror and intrigue i merely call it horror because by my own rights when i saw it i was horrified that someone could even think of doing that to three innocent people and not feel even the slightest bit guilty i loved this film and im sure that once i hear it as well as see it i will change my rating to a ten many thanks to the six siblings for bringing forth a creation unmatched by others not even friday the 13th or the childs playchuckie series could compare bravo brava and bravo again,cruel
this beautiful film tells the story of a lonely misunderstood surgeon who  in a relentless effort to help humankind  labors intensely to develop and perfect novel surgical methods the doctor is an extremely sympathetic dare i say lovable character whose humanitarian impulses reveal themselves in unexpected ways he kindly provides thirst quenching water and safe haven for two souls whose car has broken down we see that he gently and mercifully euthanizes a truckdriver who was clearly very ill subsequently he caringly digs the grave himself and thoughtfully buries the gentleman next to his own beloved pet just like family i thought finally the selfless dr heiter  a renowned surgeon with many demands on his schedule  provides at his own cost and little chance of remuneration cutting edge medical services to three strangers whose insurance benefits are unclear it is highly likely that the extensive medical interventions documented would have been covered without a referral from the primary care physician after surgery he provides love food education  this last a valiant attempt to teach his creation a useful skill carrying a newspaper  is stubbornly refused by the unappreciative and provides ongoing medical care the man is a saint this is a lush tale welltold kudos for a very memorable movie,cruel
i have no idea why so many people have rated this movie so low there must have been a group protesting the disturbing and twisted story idea interesting side note  many reviewers have only reviewed 1 movie  this onelets get one thing straight  this is a horror movie and i was truly horrified mission accomplished and credit due to the producerwriterhorror movies are supposed to invoke fear and suspense i thought the actors were excellent and i felt their terror and painwas visceral and engaging at no point did i think that there was gratuitous gore or violence if i am correct i do not believe that one bare boob was shown if there was one then that goes doubly to prove this movie was engrossing because i dont remember it third there are over 300 reviews of this movie with many expressing disgust and revulsion it has gotten people fired up enough to comment so i believe it is successful in its purpose definition of horror 1 an intense painful feeling of repugnance and fear 2 intense dislike abhorrence 4 informal something unpleasant ugly or disagreeable please take a moment to read some of the reviews so that you too can enjoy the irony of people describing the aforementioned qualities to the horror movie they just watched sublimecomic relief  there was just enough of it with the rantings of the japanese guy to offset the tension he cracked me upwere there plot holes yes a couple but nothing worth notingregarding the concerns of believability and technicality please check out imdbs top 250 movie and laugh at the number which stretch in the areas of believable and technical i do like these movies and in no way want a debate on details just a generalization on being overly critical of a horror genre examples  star wars batman lord of the rings inception matrix terminator toy story raiders etcto each his own  and if you want to watch something horrible and disturbing i recommend this,cruel
i is one of those movies where what your mind imagines is far worse than what is deliveredthe movie begins by with dr heiter parked on some deserted road looking at a picture of three united dogs which he then proceeds to kiss a truck driver stops to use the restroom and heiter kidnaps himlater two american tourists on their way to some remote club end up lost and with a flat tire they walk for help and end upin dr heiters house we learn that he was a renowned surgeon specializing in separating conjoined twins his current projects isnt to separate but to unite to createhe has to reject the truck driver who isnt compatible once he grabs a japanese tourist he has all he needs for his creation at some point one of the girls escapes and is recapturedhis plan succeeds and the creature lives walks around and feeds but dr heiter wants something else he wants to be his dog and tries to train it so that itll bring him the newspaper the isnt quite willing to go along moreover the police show up at his door looking for the girls the drs bizarre behavior doesnt exactly seem innocent so the police promise to come back with a warrant in less than 30 minutes i isnt nearly as repulsive or aberrant a movie as you would think or some would hope like many extreme horror movies with the exception of french ones it is fairly sanitized and even slightly stylish it has its creepy moments as when the dr explains his patients the procedure he will perform the dr himself has too much of a cartoonish personality to be taken seriously the actor does look creepy though and the director could have done so much more with the creature its not even filmed in a horrific way in some way the cinematographer failed our first sight of the should have much more impact and the weirdness of it wasnt exploited even the digestive process could have been so much more grossthis movie is fairly basic in its story it feels short has a small budget although it looks good its more watchable than imagined but by the same token less striking than it should be,cruel
this movie had so much potential to be mentally scarring cinema thats a good thing for horror the only scars that my brain suffered from watching this was the ridiculous dialogue a story with more holes than plot lack of character developmentoh did this have potential to be scary and disturbing and all hell the notion of a nazi surgeon that specializes in human anatomyphysiology as it relates to siamese twins  conjoined twins and then decides to physically splice unwilling humans together is mentally terrorizing  especially if the surgery is remotely plausible the planned surgery here is simply asinine i couldnt resist using that word in this case if ts only decided to make the doctor a little more professional with regards to the planning of an actual procedure that could be plausibly used to link three humans gastrointestinal systems together i get way more mental frights from this movie thinking what it could have been as opposed to the relatively silly outcome that actually happened i think dr hannibal lectar would have performed a more satisfactory operation although kudos to the actor playing the doctor pretty good job convincing me he was a wackoi still give it a 7 because of the potential and that it deserves a bit more than 4 on the imdb it is supposed to be a horror movie people,cruel
a film about a whackjob doctor who lives somewhere expensive and secluded has a basement he has tricked up to be a surgical lab and a bizarre need to carry out an experiment more than just the once that his basic medical training would have proved to be a failure before he even began unless of course the experiment wasnt to make a functioning but merely to find out if it was possible to sew someones mouth to someone elses arsehole in which case the doc doesnt possess the level of intellect we are lead to believe and instead he is a moronic dickhead in possession of a few too many complimentary sewing kitsam i being too harsh possibly but if so it is only a littlei may be alone in this view but i have been spoilt with the creme de la creme of psychopaths in cinema and seen so many horror films that have left me speechless and with something real and deeply disturbing to contemplate think of all the horror villains out there all the well known fictional psychopaths and their stories and how chilling the events that surrounded them were have you got that image firmly set in your mind excellent now go watch one of those movies insteaddespite having all the potential to live up to the requirements of a damn good horror flick thc just couldnt do it no matter how much it desperately scrambled about amongst taboos designed to shock and sicken with no real meaning or purpose the film isnt just contrived everything about it reeks of a desperation to be the sickest film in town using only the easiest routei deeply saddened that we werent presented with anything more challenging you can almost hear its silly little voice begging you to be shocked or scared or in some way disgusted by it all but sadly the only thing you are moved enough to do is laughthe plot is not just weak but has more holes through it than swiss cheese making the entire experience laboured from around 15 minutes in not to mention that our heroine is not even the slightest bit likable and every other character seems to have the logic section of their brain entirely removed leading to constant frustration for the viewer throughout the acting is passable but not a single cast member understands that subtlety especially in a movie that is otherwise so ott is often more moving captivating and even more terrifying than beating the audience over the head with such obvious and overplayed performances the film becomes offensive as it progresses with every step underestimating the audiences intelligence and overestimating its own cleverness i am all for some mindless violence gore and taboo subject matter if it is fun or entertaining but this film was neither and it wasnt supposed to be mindless either it may not win the 1 spot for sick films but yesit is a sick film then again so was martyrs the difference is thc was more of a sick waste of time than anything else,cruel
i read a lot of reviews on here and tend to wonder if any film truly deserves a rating of 1 in this case i think it does the movie just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth  no pun intended from start to finish you feel like youre a voyeur on a scene of misery and humiliation you dont get the sense that the film is posing any real questions to ponder or that its doing anything other than trying to shock the audiencei personally didnt find it shocking once you get over the gross subject matter the overwhelming sensation is how depressing its got far less shock factor for example than something like a serbian film these films are cut from the same cloth though theyre falling over each other to outgross the nextive never been an advocate of censorship but these days im starting to wonder with such nasty little freak shows hitting the mainstream,cruel
shocking is not even a word close to describing the effect this movie had on me what a waste of time and money that i managed to hear virtually nothing about before i watched it is amazing im sure there is a fanbase for this kind of thing but im not itevidently the writers of this crap got the idea from a statement one of them made about sewing the lips of a pedophile to someones ass you know if they had actually used a pedophilelike character in the string i might have been more receptive as it was the victims were just people gathered in by the maddoctor it was senseless torture with absolutely no point i had no character to sympathize with nobody was developed enough to give me a feeling of anything but grossness whether or not the procedure was even medically possible doesnt even matter to me once i saw where it was going i realized that the chain was going to die from the back to the front and that was all what a stupid idea and then they made a second one,cruel
first of all there is no intelligent plot built around the sick premise and no meaningful message included that alone makes a movie not worth watching unless its clearly a horror comedy which this is not supposed to be the main victim characters are bleeding imbeciles who do not fit into the movie theyre so moronic that theyre not even funny as in this wouldnt work even as a parodysecond of all this premise is so weird that at least i cant wrap my mind around its sickness and thus with me this film fails even as the pointless thing its trying to bethird of all the trailer makes the beginning look scary but is it really no because the two girls are the dumbest bimbos in the long sad history of dumb horror movie bimbos the list of reasons is lengthy so im just gonna reveal the two biggest onesthey accept a drink from a creepylooking stranger although he made the drink out of their sight and they drink it even after the guy had said that he doesnt like human beings his exact words he did not say i dont like people he said i dont like human beings and they dont even try to get out immediately after he left the room after saying that and behaving menacingly finally the other girl states that they have to get out of there right now and this is the point when the other girl drinks the water all up regardless of all the screaming warnings theyd just had anda minute later theyre still sitting on the spot without a single attempt to even get up even though the drugged water hadnt yet made them completely disabledat the point i had to watch the girl empty the water glass into her mouth i seriously wanted to bang my head on the wall over a fictional movie those characters would not have worked me up like this if this was supposed to be a serial killer movie like friday the 13th which aim at as huge body count as possible as in a movie in which brainless bimbos are almost justified seeing to its aim but this is not trying to be one of thoseseriously i hope six has learned since this film that in order to make a scary movie or in any way enjoyable movie one should not create characters whom the viewer actually wants to be killed off in as painful way as possible because the characters are such bleeding imbeciles that its unbearable i should make clear at this point that i do not feel this way about anyone real like those girls i would not wish them dead nor tortured i would just be extremely annoyed but its easy to hate on fictional characters whose fates dont hurt anyonethese characters dont come off as victims we should feel sorry for and they dont come off as suicidal either i mean other than the series of irritatingly moronic choices that they make the movie does not make them come off suicidal at all nor even retarded which leads to the conclusion that theyre just simply imbeciles and crappily written characters and so make the movie that much worse hence those girls made a series of moronic choices before that water glass thing and kept on doing many more afterwards youd think the sick premise would be at least a little enjoyable then as it attacks those crappy characters well its not at least i was so annoyed with them that i wanted to see them offed not have to bear with their moronic mistakes in efforts to escape from utterly weird scientific experiment which wasnt in any way interesting even in itself this of course leads to that the script sucks overallthe actor of the villain was certainly well picked but does not save the movie that has nothing good to offer and has the most moronic victim characters everpainfully crappy writing too weird premise dont waste your time on this film there are much more entertaining movies waiting for you,cruel
i like many horror movies but this is worst horror movie ive seen in my life its not scarry at all just disgusting and super weirdi think the movie was very odd i have seen very many horror movies and this was absolutely the strangest ones ive seen i thought the movie would be a good horror movie because it had some good reviews the movie were slow and i got bored the director must be very weird in real life cant understand how someone can come up with a movie like this the things that happened in the movie were very disgusting the actors were badeither u like this movie or you hate it i didnt like it i give it 2 stars because the german in the start,cruel
this is a movie you would see out of curiosity it is not for learning or entertainment purposes it is out of pure curiosity that got me to watch this film i did not find it scary nor disgusting the only acting that was good was from the doctor bad guy and the asian male victim the actresses in this film were bad i did not find myself having sympathy for them i actually didnt find this film that bad at all just kind of weird of course never seen anything like it lol to think that someone came up with the idea is just kind of funny nobody likes sht i think the scene where the dr is showing the victims what he is planning on doing to them showing drawings in his surgical room was a good scene its kind of funny when the is connected and they are in the yard and its feeding time if you are interested in watching this filmyou wont be scaredyou will just be wtf the whole time watching it,cruel
and thats all this film really is  a one trick pony extended to 92 minutes something that was no doubt conceived in a very drunken night at a pub and finally brought tortuously to life as a real project for that i must commend six  living up to the henry rollins maxim dont talk about it do it and damn what anyone thinksthe film itself for the bulk is a compendium of dumb zgrade slasherhorror clichs that while annoying at first does become interesting in that i think six deliberately sought to pack as many as possible into the one place as an exercise that did keep my attentionthe surgeon dr heiter played by dieter laser is perfectly cast and is really just a bargain basement lance henriksen clone  i think he has now assured himself work for life in similarly deranged roles for gutter cinema a la jeffrey coombs a dream job imho good luck to him love to buy him a beeroverall though this did fall well short of my expectations as others have noted but the ending is quite sadistically exquisite leaving the sole surviving protagonist in a situation that should get posted to all the wwjd forums out there but as for the rest there are no real surprises beyond the title premiserating this only 410  sorry watching part 2 tonight and expecting improvement but that said this film is a must for the collection of any gutter cinema aficionado no doubt about that it is not a keeper for repeat viewing but it is a nice thing to pull out for the visitors who boast theyve seen it all,cruel
psychotic german doctor laser kidnaps two american tourists williams and yennie and one japanese tourist kitamura subjecting them to a sinister experiment entailing sewing ones mouth to anothers anus resulting in a decently actedat least for its classlessnessand filmed stylishly in the netherlands the concept of is completely childish and unoriginal and the controversy surrounding it is thrived by people why are offended by fart jokes and have never anticipated the possibility of coprophagia there are better and worse things in this world to raise controversy over and this film isnt one of them the film ends way too easily but very few will complain that it ended too quickly the structure and pacing are also terrible the opening scene actually filmed during the final day of shooting is virtually useless save minor and insignificant character development and the film doesnt really have a third act those who made the film and those who complain about how disgusting it is should both be subjects to criticism for contributing to the creation and notoriety of such a terrible film out of four,cruel
i have to say this about it i am all for freedom of speech and the arts and such but i myself dont have any real respect for whomever decided to create such art in film i just think it was very unnecessary and insensitive to be illustrating human experimentation inspired by one of the most sadistic of the auschwitz nazi war criminals josef mengele i think it is quite tasteless and i also dont think it is such a good thing to be stereotyping the german people today with and considering the mounting tensions between ethnic groups in europe today i dont think its such a great idea to make a movie like this at this time we have too much chaos in this world now i think filmmakers arent always considering the feelings of people especially holocaust survivors and their descendants it seems that it has become so politically correct to be antisemitic here recently and in the past few years much to my shock and dismay i think film makers should consider what kind of movie they are making if they think this film will to add the fuel to the fire of any angry feelings between ethnic groups harboring grudges or digging up bones thats the only use i can make of a film like this it seems just the kind of movie to be labeled propaganda by some defended as art by others i myself feel that the film is quite racist and highly misogynist i seriously could have done without this i have never been able to peacefully visit the toilet ever since without thinking about this awful movie and that is seriously not cool i regret ever watching this film and it is likely that you may also i feel as if i need a mental douche and a psychological enema i do however defend its right to be made and distributed the choice of whether or not to watch it i never will again watch this garbage the only reason i didnt give it one star was because of dieter lasers excellently convincing performance as the sadistic surgeon,cruel
welllllll if you watch this expecting to be any more enlightened to why this film was thought up and subsequently made you wont be i watched it the film itself was shot pretty well in large however i got to the end of the film and feel nothing but indifference for the whole film if im honest on a lot of levels it is a good horror film it has moments which generally send a chill down your spine it has a lot of psychological undertones in places which i really thought added to how creepy this film is but the notion of sewing mouths to bums is a tad farcical and even with the premise the film is built upon its hard to take it seriously which then leaves you watching it like scary movie or dr giggles with more of a tongueincheek slant on the film which is a shame really because a lot of the film is really well presented and does get under your skin on lots of levelsi purely think the fairest review i could make on this film was to sincerely express my confusion and how i watched it and it just left me as i started it no better off but no worse off either if you like horror films and have 90 minutes on your hands and have seen every other horror film you can think of at that point in time then watch it just dont expect to walk away with anything,cruel
well i could say that this movie is a shame among movies and its whole idea is a fail just the mad doctor was the best part about this movie but all else were a fail lets review them nowidea of the movie  just poor quality made from being poor in ideas and almost out of them the idea of making a pet out from human being is really stupid nothing terrific about it and not a single horror fact is about itplot  nothing special about it just a mad doc who wants to make something that is disgusting and silly a pet acting  the acting was below average just the mad doctor dr heiter  dieter laser  who made a good performance for that bad moviedirecting  it was average just when he takes the photos with his camera  that was the best scene in the movie  final rating  a total fail with no passion or a spirit of a horror movie i didnt even think of this as a horror movie its disgusting to see naked people connected like thati hate this movie along with every sequel of itsee my review for  2 the second sequence  note  if there was a vote below 1 i would have chosen it,cruel
regardless of my many drunken friends incessantly urging me to see this movie the name alone always compelled me to stay away however when amongst the same mindset as my friends and in an environment where there were several other first time watchers i was suckered into it suffice to say it was a terrible movie as the name implied absolutely grotesque and awful in the worst imaginable ways disgusting and revolting are understatements for this travesty of a film why i stayed for the entire thing your guess is as good as mine i do not recommend this movie unless you want to fully disturb your girlfriend to the point where she questions your taste in cinema so much that she doubts the relationship you have or something equally terrible this is an atrocity just like the name implies dont watch it i did and it was a mistake,cruel
this is not really a horror movie the action of the movie itself isnt scary at most it is thriller yeah the itself idea of the movie is horrible and so is the seeing of the creation of but the hole action isnt scary at all the idea of an horror movie is to get to you through a scary feeling it should give you something to be afraid to watch more and not to give you a mere feeling of disgust visavis creature the storyline could have been more interesting if the creation of was complete meaning that this was indeed a new creature strong which had one identity and not three different people stuck together who act as one only because they are stuck this new creature should had to be able to do something after its creation and not be just a poor creature made of three individuals stuck together who can barely move and eat and shoot you feel pity for the three people individually but i didnt see any true as a hole only three individuals with three different brains and three intact digestive system etc,cruel
that should be the tag line i took the time to write this review just out of pure disgust  this movie has no real plot no characters you can relate toevery single character that appears in this movie is a bag of meat to introduce more gore  no personality no background story if you think this is bad enough there is more comingthis movie does not explore the human psyche doesnt focus on the question how far will you go in order to survive doesnt even focus on fear itself  its far from any actually interesting topic that might be an inspiration for a real scriptonly things youll find here are disgusting deeply disturbing scenes serving no other purpose than to shock the viewers tom six really gave no thought writing this film you can feel this every minute youre wasting watching it one gruesome idea and thats itdont throw away 92 minutes of your life watching this,cruel
inspired by the nazi medical practices first sequence contributed the same atrocity as the holocaust although the use of gas chambers was absent in the film the experimental ideas of dr heiters character played by deiter laser evoked similar dehumanizing aspects as a worldclass surgeon dr heiters region of focus is separating siamese twins however he turns to a glaringly different interest as the film opens with him sobbing over the death of his masterpiece three dogs with one digestive tract a director tom six applies this same concept to humans by drawing the viewers attention to the sickening procedure that dr heiter takes to construct in doing so dr heiter goes beyond extraordinary means to find his subjects a male foreigner and two american tourists were his captives instead of evoking fastpacing heart beats and excitement that is common in most horror films just puts the viewers gag reflexes to test while myriads of horror movies depict inhumane story plots topped it off by being potentially realistic adding to the shock that has already been inflicted from the scenes above too often did i find myself comparing real life occurrences to the chaotic plot of the film with the many psychotic incidents of murder and abuse in todays world might even become an inspiration to the lunatics but it wasnt those aspects that would distance the viewer from the film rather the poor choice in character representation dragged the appeal a couple notches down the highlight of my annoyance occurred as american tourists lindsay and jenny faced a vehicle malfunction the scene united amateur acting techniques with unsupportive lines lessening the appeal and credibility of suspense moreover the random insertions of curse words in alternating sequence from jenny to lindsay took away from conveying frustration for the vehicle situation these flaws hindered the viewer from immersing himself into the character of the tourists creating a distant atmosphere what is more disappointing is the scene was used as a segue to the next which forced the viewer to watch another minute and a half of pointless rolls of filmwith nuances aside effectively created a cold atmosphere by the use of lighting particularly evident in the cellar scenes the vibe felt by the blue tinted lighting naturally heightened the suspense of the film from the golden yellow living room to the contrastingly grayblue cellar six gives the viewer just enough time to adjust to the color difference while also placing the viewer in a position hungry for tension combined with the slow deliverance of dr heiters lines and the maniacal explanation of the surgical procedure this exact instance evokes the greatest amount of chills as the lighting from the overhead projector shines from the chin on upward of dr heiters face the cellar and the somber lighting becomes the cue for all horror as the lighting of the film added to the horror effect of the plot the sound throughout the film provided setbacks to the finer artistry of the film the tug of war between the diegetic sound and lighting lured the viewer in at some moments while pushing him away at others this inconsistency was present again in the cellar this time it occurred during the death of the first victim the sobbing of the two american tourists was overemphasized devaluing the death of the first potential the excessive stress placed on the cry of the ladies distracts the viewer from absorbing the greater picture the first display of unemotional behavior from the madsurgeon dr heiter i find that the diegetic sound focuses too strongly on the noises that lindsay and jenny make more so than the actual plot of the scene for instance i discovered that i was more drawn to the panting of rather than the itself while the film might not have been classified the best of its century the cinematography certainly made up for it the tracking shot of the siamese twin artwork at the inception of the film stresses the importance of it giving one the ability to draw conclusions along with the lowpoint shot six draws the viewers awareness by emphasizing the artwork this approach gives away an idea of the plot while simultaneously keeping the viewer in the dark the tracking shot once again is used as ashley williams tries to escape the dr heiters mastermind plan up the stairs and to the bedroom the shot vividly displays the fear of ashley and gives an adrenaline rush to the viewer the transition also aids in the development of anticipation the lengthy gradual transitions down the long corridor of dr heiters home create the perfect setting personified by horror movies particularly in the time of lindsays escape the slow transitions contributed to the labyrinth effect forcing lindsay to be trapped in time and space it was interesting to witness that the use of music was minimal it is safe to conclude that horror films usually rely on the nondiegetic sound to design the ambiance of the environment however six shifts the weight of the music to lighting generating a unique method to surprise the viewer with fear incorporates both ingredients of success and failure while the plot was catchy for its unforeseen gruesomeness it alone is not enough to satisfy the viewers the awkward characters and obnoxiously loud sounds at some points took off a few stars for the rating contrastingly the evident efforts that director six put in carefully manipulating the position of the camera shots were noteworthy,cruel
first sequence has three abject victims one a stereotypical japanese character who keeps yelling hoarse and two bimbos one of whom talks like a dimwitted child the perpetrator is a nazisympathizing surgeon who has those typical zgrade horror looks and deep voice the director is an rather grisly ed wood in the making by the name of tom six or rather tom sicko who cant direct to save his life the writing mainly consists of moaning screaming whimpering and screeching and a few dialogues that are so atrocious they are just kept to bring the characters to the surgeons housethe first few scenes look as if the girls are being chased already by the madman since they are so frightened right from the start the japanese actor has nothing to do but yell incoherently and writhe in pain even the girls have unappealing bodies so there was no eyecandy to salvage the hopeless film in short this movie sucks my rating 110,cruel
while i am no doctor i wont be commenting on the flaws of the medical procedures but there are some major flaws in the script that are worth noting1st two american girls who got lost stuck in germany with a flat tire and no cellphone signal decide do go deep in to the forest instead of even trying to change the flat tire found a house with a creepy guy and decide to stay2nd a girl attempts to escape only when she has the madsurgeon ready to inject her with anesthesia while free she either stays still or poorly tries to escape no broken windows no knife grabbing or looking for help she will even try to save her deep asleep friend carrying her around3rd so they are stitched together 3 pairs of arms and 3 brains are unable to attempt an escape right from the beginning even though they bit him they could have tripped the surgeon grabbed his dick for him not to move and i dont know killed him then grabbed a phone or tried to escape4th the police goes into the house and one of them gets poisoned while the girls were poisoned the same way and took them like 5 minutes to be extremely sick the policeman only felt it at least half an hour later when hes chasing the bad guy5th only three days later im assuming right into the end of the movie the remembers to grab a scalpel and to attack the surgeon even though when going to the carotid the japanese in the lead decided to use his teeth instead of the scalpel stuck in the immobilized surgeons leg not killing him6th the three stitched have to climb the stair to leave the basement which proves to be extremely hard the author seems to have forgotten that they have been outside already as a the transportation being up or down obviously left out7th the policemen came in and split while searching the house even though one of them passes through the door where the is in he doesnt remember to open the door and search for the surgeon when one of them is killed and the other rushes to him he does open the door and instead of trying to help those people he just rushes looking petrified to save his buddy finding him dead floating in the pool he doesnt try to kill the killer but to save the colleague getting shotthis are some of the situations that prove that this movie was not even thought of thoroughly to avoid basic script mistakes not worth watching im not even sure if it is valuable as a whatnottodo,cruel
is a movie notorious for its bizarre premise a mad scientist kidnaps three people and connects them to each other by stitching ones mouth to the others rectum thus creating a apart from this mildly disturbing concept the movie is really nothing but a waste of 15 hoursafter nearly 15 minutes of filler that wont be important for the rest of the movie two girls jenny and lindsay are drugged and kidnapped by the ultimate personyoushouldnttruststereotype dr heiter he then kidnaps a japanese tourist named katsuro offscreen his role in the movie is basically just to scream in japanese which i cant understand so yeah im not really taking this character too seriously and neither does the movie apparently because it sounds like theyre recycling his scream sound effects dr heiter then explains the movies ridiculous premise to his three victims one of the girls escapes resulting in a poorly edited and unexciting chase scene she then gets caught again thus confirming that the entire 10minute scene was entirely pointlessif youre big fan of gore movies you are going to be very disappointed at this point because you dont actually see dr heiter constructing all you see is him pulling out a girls teeth which is more boring than shocking after that we get a couple of shots of heiter doing nothing until suddenly is standing in front of him the rest of the movie mostly consists of heiter trying to train the like a dog and his odd arousal when katsuro who is in front is forced to feed the person behind him with his excretion again you dont actually see this but i count this as a plusthis goes on for 20 minutes until 2 police officers arrive looking for the missing people despite the fact that katsuro is screaming as hard as he can the police cant hear him even though several characters before this scene could clearly hear someone in the basement it doesnt really matter though because the escapes from the basement and manages to injure dr heiter with the power of bad editing this results in another scene of the trying to get away from heiter veeeerrrry sloooowwwwly and heiter tries to catch up with the veeeerrrry sloooowwwwly at least the movie has a consistent pacingin the end katsuro slits his own throat for no reason dr heiter and the police shoot each other to death jenny dies of an infection and lindsay is left alone end of moviewhat can i say perhaps the premise might have worked if it was used for a short movie but it clearly doesnt work when the director tries desperately to stretch the movie to 92 minutes by adding pointless scenes and conversations the editing isnt good most of the dialogue is predictable and the characters are just not interesting if you are not a fan of gore this movie will gross you out if you are a fan of gore this movie will bore you to death either way you probably wont like this movie,cruel
this is by far the stupidest movie i have ever seen if i have to give one credit it is an original  and very disturbing  idea but the writer and director did absolutely nothing with it to be honest i only watched the movie because of the buzz around the second one but what a waste of my time i thought hostel was a bridge too far but this one begins where hostel ends if you really want to explore the limits of cinemaif you are really curious of what the low point can bewatch it otherwise leave it where it should be on the shelf collecting dust i just wish that in the future it is possible to give zero stars,cruel
i watched this film with a view that it would be rather scary and that it would take horror to a new level how wrong was i this film is a waste of time effort and money i was so bored and suggest that if you were thinking of watching this with the same original interest that i had forget it i sat and watched with interest as the two girls are fooled into the mad scientists house and then it all went pear shaped from there the scenes were so unreal it was untrue and the storyline although far stretched i imagine that some prune would actually think that you could do this surgery and create the so called the way the story ends all i can say is that i think the police involved would have had more sense than to do what they did in the actual film i really cannot stress enough do not bother watching this,cruel
basically i watched this movie out of pure curiosity im pretty easily grossed out but this didnt stop me from watching it anyway i put on the movie and ended up skipping through a few minutes of it at various times simply because it was boring and pointlessthe one really good scene that actually seemed to intrigue me and was actually very successful was the scene where dr heiter was explaining exactly what he was going to do to his victims the emotions and acting were very good in this scene opposed to the rest of the moviethe acting otherwise was terrible and the fact that its supposedly 100 medically accurate is a bunch of crap im no doctor but i know for 100 fact that a human cannot live off of feces this is a ridiculous concept as if they think were all idiots also the chances that they have to escape are huge and do they ever take them no they decide to waste time and fill the movie with bullshit overall i really think that the only reason that this movie would be worth watching is for the curiosity factor and because i think that it is one of those movies that everyone should see once,cruel
owing a little something to envelope pusher extraordinaire takashi miike not to mention pier paolo pasolini plus a dash of lars von trier tom six has created a mad professor movie whose title tells you everything you need to know now you just need to sit down and endure it like salo a serbian film et al this is too absurd to be taken seriously too ugly to be satirical and displays a paranoid need on the part of the filmmaker to produce physical revulsion in its audience rather than say skilfully disarm disturb or unsettle usi started wondering halfway through  long after the stitching was done  whether the shooting script contained lengthy sections where the only directions were jenny mumbles desperately its not a movie to admire the nuanced dialogue but rather to marvel at the elaborate mode of torture  or more likely given waning attention levels the pristine upholstery and dr heiters dieter laser geometrically perfect feng shuiperhaps six should have considered holding back the flagpole operation a little longer because this is a film carried on its high concept and one which hardly eschews clich from the shallow lateteen victims who are presumably being taught a lesson to the bumbling cops who want a peek in the cellar six embraces the subgenre and leaves no expectation unsatisfied which paradoxically is hugely unsatisfyingebert famously stated that belongs to a world where the stars dont shine but i think they do  they just shine dimly and depressingly over an artform where even independents lack ideas perhaps the oralanal chain is a symbol for endlessly regurgitated homogeneity perhaps the lack of invention atmosphere or genuine tension is a joke on us the audience as we somehow struggle through to the 90th minute consuming without thought without choicethankfully we do have a choice  we can watch dogtooth instead,cruel
must watch for phds as a child most children make s and other animals using different objects doctor in this movie made by joining 3 people whats wrong with that explaining how and what happens afterwards is sickening but it might just represent some complex ideai think the idea of this movie was this that people try to connect with each other with weaker connected to the stronger in a sequence there are people how make these connectionsurgeon in this movie who have their own personal interests the weakest suffers the most as you can understand from the sequence how food moves from first one to 2nd and then third this is the reason she is the most unhealthy and expected to die quickly and needs replacementjust like in real world with poorest having highest mortality rateif i place this structure to our society i guess every one is connected just like this with only difference being that of our free will for small advantages such as jobs security or ease of acceptability and conformity very few people are the surgeons which are not connected in this way but unfortunately they are the sick surgeons of society i have given a philosophical comment as i saw very little nudeness so i think this movie was not made to be considered erotic ,cruel
once you get past the idea of the and the fact this crazed demented doctor is laughing at these peoples torture the film becomes a onenote joke this reminds me of rubber a film to this day i am still mixed on i love the fact that that film chose to pursue its own direction but once again it was ruined by having a love affair with itself for some reason im a fan of a film with a killer tire over a film with an inane creation its like if someone asked you would you rather drink clr or mr clean i must applaud for the same reason as rubber tom six couldve done another formulaic slasher or worse a remake but he pursued his own idea a creative one but a disturbing one i give him credit he was probably drinking with buddies around a bonfire when he said some idiot should make a film about three people bound together to make something like a the next day he got to workthe idea behind is that you take a minimum of three people give them anesthesia make an incision in their kneecaps that prevents them from standing up cut off their lips and a small hole around their anus and stitch both togetherthe only person who will be able to obtain food is the first person when he has to go number two he will go and it will go thru each of the other in this case two humans mouths before coming out for good its sick twisted and disgusting but original yesthe story is two women williams and yennie are on their way to a nightclub when they get a flat tire they exchange in some nonsense dialog taken straight from other horror films until they stumble upon a house in the middle of the woods the house is owned by an unsettling man named dr heiter laser they are drugged after he calls a rentacar company are tied up on a hospital bed with an asian man as the final piece of the puzzle and are taught the science behind this creature heiter gives them anesthesia and he creates his beast it works but now the three are left to cope with the unfair advantage of being treated like a pet dogpersonally none of was very hard to watch ive read cult films with sicker plots than this one the idea of the is disgusting but not seriously disgusting still its not like it isnt creative it for damn sure is but watch august underground and tell me which one is sickercant get over the fact it came up with this beast its not a horror movie its a boastful torture film its grotesque and inhumane making a shock film is easy if you have a disgusting idea its hard to make one that has a good storyline and a premise to keep you interested lacks in both fields and just relies on the invention to carry the filmtom sixs directing is fine but dieter lasers acting shines through everything everyone else is dull i do applaud the three victims of the for agreeing to this they really had no dialog since most of the script is made up of screams and shrieks just the fact they wanted to participate in this makes me want to shake each one of them by the handbut the constant screams and shrieks get annoying i realize that if i was part of this creation i would scream cry and shriek and horror but literally 60 of the film is made up of screams and the remaining forty is made up of clunky dialog and the german languageas a horror film fails as a shock film rockets thru the roof as a film in general it simply isnt strong in any other fields except for creativity the idea of humans bound together against their will is an interesting topic so consider this a morethancheerful one star review but just an idea cant carry a film execution is what its all about and doesnt have anything else to boast except its ideaapparently this is just the first sequence we are also in for a full sequence and a final sequence if you could stomach the first you will most likely watch the full one after much contemplating to hold out for the final would take patience and a sadistic cravingstarring dieter laser ashley c williamsm ashlynn yennie and akihiro kitamura directed by tom six,cruel
if you ask me one word to describe this movie i would say disgusting there is nothing much the movie has to offer a one line story is stretched for 90 odd minutes i have no clue why i ended up seeing this crapa psycho doctor has the idea of making a by joining one persons mouth to the others rectum and he goes to do it this is all the story is we dont know how true the idea is but the makers claim the idea to be true but who cares the movie doesnt entertain for sure forget entertainment for a moment at least it should be disturbing like saw hostel or wrong turn it is not even thatthere is no reason to watch it even if you have too much time at your disposal,cruel
i saw this movie on virgin tv movies 24 last night i was intrigued by the title and the write up and was prepared for what i thought would be typical straight to dvd trashhow wrong i was  im not a squeamish person but this really did scare me only in the way the surgeon was so cold in his experiment in a dr mengele sort of way however i kept watching as although horrified that such films like can be made they are allowed to be shown on television i was in complete shock for the three victims in a way that i felt ashamed to be a human and for watching the doctor  i agree with all the other reviewers is lance henricksons double is superbly cast as the villain the three actors of the very very brave in doing this the intimate contact it involved showed courage and the actor and actresses deserve awards for their roles the end of the movie left me dumbstruck and thinking what the hell was that all about and why  the very point the director and writer of a movie like this wanted to make  for being 100 medically accurate  its is total rubbish  its core value is to shock the viewer to extrememy problem with this film is its material and it giving mad men an idea  indeed i have just seen on imdb that the sequel deals with this very issuei am ashamed to have watched this movie and hope it is never allowed to be shown on any british television channel again ,cruel

i can only imagine the pitch young eager director tom six walks in anxious to impress potential producers so whats it about asks one of the financers six looks awkward shuffling his feet er its about this mad scientist who specialises in siamese twin separation who abducts these girls he kinda has this obsession and dream about stitching people together he wants to join three people together connected by their mouth and aehole and treat them like a dog the producers look at each confused and the one drops a bag on the table full of money heres two million dollars he says go make a fg movieand yes that is what the film is about this is probably the maddest idea ive ever heard which got me extremely intrigued that along with the minor media storm that was caused upon its uk release meant it was a film i had to see not since the glory days of grindhouse has such a crazy idea been released to mainstream audiences yet for all its potential it falls rather flat on its facefirst of all there are things to enjoy about the film the crazy surgeon at the centre of it all dr heiter dieter laser has one of the most unusual faces ive ever seen and therefore makes a great horror villain his stoic and nazilike behaviour is hilarious sometimes unnerving and often very camp theres definitely a little udo kier about him the surgery scenes and the inevitable oh no i need to st moment are delightfully cringeinducing and watching heiter gaze longingly at a picture of his dead threedog work it out is just plain weirdyet at the heart of it all its nothing more than a runofthemill horror with draggedout set pieces an overlong stalkaroundthehouse scene and a rather poor climax the eventual unveiling of his creation is also rather tame with the key gruesome areas covered up the fact that i would want to see a mouth stitched to an aehole worries me id like to say its a missed opportunity but i dont if an opportunity was ever there i mean how good can a film be where the victims are joined through the gastric system and are forced to st in each others mouths saying all that i will be watching the sequelwwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,cruel
i stumbled into a small screening room a year or two ago looking for the place where i had a job interview instead what i found was one of the first screenings of this film prerelease before i could explained who i was and what i was doing there security attempted to chuck me out of the cinema for being a protester against the screening of the film i never watched the film that day but from then on i looked forward to its releaseplot two american girls on a road trip through europe break down on a stormy night on a german back road and when looking for help and a phone they end up finding a house alone and in the middle of know where their host is the very creepy dr heither dieter laserhot or not is the film scary a little is the film disturbing in its content yes until i watched a serbian film in which this film cant compare in terms of sickening subject matter the film has its creepy moments but it is the violence and the themes that over shadow anything else within the film although i love horror i am not the greatest fan of torture films i would rather see a film with atmosphere that goes out to frighten its audience rather than shock them saying that i did enjoy hostel but maybe that was because it had strong character development where this film does not the same can be said about a serbian film which also had strong character development in this film the characters seem just to be props for torture the setting could have been used to better advantage however the film did remind me very much of martyrs 2008 which is a far superior filmthe ending of the film is extremely daft and clearly shows the director had know where to go with the story once the concept of the was createdbirds and the beesyes but nothing of a nice natureacting the acting in this film is good and the dr is very creepy and plays his part very well the leads lindsay ashley c williams and jenny ashlynn yennie are also good considering these couldnt be very pleasant roles to act in however katsuro akihiro kitamura is annoying and the ending is just ridiculously annoying involving his characteroverallthe film is ok it craves cult status but only the hype surrounding it has made it a bit more than just a straight to dvd torture film it is shocking in places and this may appeal to some however it was a one view only film to me i would stick with hostel or a serbian film if i was to go down the torture porn route,cruel
okis exactly what you think it is three people are sewn together to create a thats itif you are looking for gore you wont find it if you are looking for an interesting story you wont find itmuch like hostel the premise is much more intriguing than the execution i just dont understand the hype on this one people constantly tell me they were so disgusted by this movie that they had to look away why have they seen saw iii saw iv ichi the killer nothing about is all that grotesque i would really only recommend this to those interested in camera work it was surprisingly well done,cruel

this movie was the worse i have seen in a long time the acting the storyline everything things happened in the movie that made no sense the movie made no sensei watched this last night on netflix and after 45 mins into it i fast forwarded to the end just to see what was going to happen the ending was terriblethis is how ridiculous this movie was that i couldnt even watch the whole thingmy son 16 and i were watching and we were both complaining how bad the movie was this film coulda been a lot better,cruel
couldnt watch till the end nothing happens nothing to see someone connected to the movie industry got a dumb idea about ass to mouth connecting people and wow heres this is amongst the worst movies ive ever seen and most of them are due to bad acting and low budget  however this one is simply because of the senselessness so many illogicalities and simply no suspense creativity or good plot the story is out of the blue completely just some people being surgically connected into a dumbest creature ever thought of in a mad scientists house please do not watch this movie better read some classic novel or be spiritual for an hourandahalf instead of watching this crap thank you,cruel
i watched this movie because a few friends suggested it and said it would be awesome well in my line of work military awesome means so craptastic that it doesnt qualify as a decent d movie this is a title i would easily file under the purchase for the only reason of destroying the dvd to prevent others from suffering through this horrible excuse for a motion picture granted there are worse movies out there but this is so bad i cant believe i wasted my time if i hadnt already gotten my moneys worth out of netflix this month i would demand my money back for this title alone dont do it save yourself from losing two hours of your life you cant get back trust me,cruel
i love films that depict horror gore mayhem and any other adjective that instills fear and shock in the audience but i draw the line with this film shockingly repulsive and depraved cant describe it well enough it was nauseating to the max im no prude nor am i easily ruffled but this flick is sick i actually avoided watching the last ten minutes because i felt it would be sinful to do so the neonazi doctor was the sickest pervert ever to wear a lab coat this guy gave me the heebiejeebies the very first moment he graced the screen he could frighten satan himself with his sinister grin and terrifying laugh what a wacko he makes jeffrey dahmer seem normal mary poppins anyone,cruel
okthis movie should only have been controversial for how bad it was the scenes while graphic and distrurbing were truly terrible aside from the acting which i thought was ok the plot was nonexistentit was painful to watch the continual lapses in reality and continuity in this film did no one see how bad this movie was when they screened itthe only truly disturbing thing about this movie is that somewhere some critic gave this a good review because they thought it was edgy and pushed the envelopefor me this was a poorly made version of hostel,cruel
i cant believe any one even made this movie it was not scary  it was stupid there was no plot not reason for anything happening in the movie and no one even served not that it wouldnt have been a great movie any way  but this was way worse then what i could have imagined as my husband would say i just wasted an hour and a half of my life for what nothing was good about this movie it was horrible and time conjuring it was really a horrible movie all things considered it was a huge disappointmenti wouldnt watch this movie again it was that bad aim not sure why it was allowed to be produced and put in to the public domain of movies it again was such a bad movie i would never watch it again,cruel
zero stars out of out of all the most godawful atrocities to hit the silver screen of the past decade making people cringe with the thought of losing their hardearned dough takes the cake for the worst film no film thus far has been this repugnant and juvenile in a while at the same just dull no words can express how much i loathe this film from the opening shot to the last i sat there dry heaving while waiting for a single interesting moment to happen if your titillation is grossout gags then so be it but when your product is so tedious and uninviting i could care less about chucking up my last mealoh where to start the acting is absolutely the worst ive seen honestly these actors shouldve walked away with razzies in their hand i could not stand those four knuckleheads ive seen better acting in recent m night shyamalan films and yes thats saying a lot furthermore the script is unbelievably unrealistic and nonsensical the decisions these characters make are just unwatchable because of their sheer stupidity literally a woman is running from a man while theres a working telephone right next to her so what does she do she doesnt bother to look and ends up running to a room not only that but she drags out an unconscious character taking her dandy sweet time but no the killer cant possibly be there and the stupidity doesnt just end there save your excuses even the dumbest situation i can be in wont even compare to match the mindnumbingly idiotic situation these goofballs have gotten themselves into not to mention the direction is just so awful every scene is dragged out poorly acted and poorly staged for being a gross film i did almost dryheave but not once did i even puke or think wow this is really interesting if your purpose is to make a 2 girls 1 cupesque plot and not entertain your audience in any way possible that is just a waste of celluloid all in all save your time save your money this might be the worst movie ive seen of all time thats a strong statement but honestly i cant remember being this uninterested or repulsed by a film in a long time im just glad this film is slowly fading away from my memory with all the movies to see why choose this one,cruel
this film gained a lot of notoriety when it came out not least due to a rather effective marketing campaign although its not the kind of thing id usually choose to watch ill admit to being slightly intrigued by it and so decided to give it a viewing when it arrived on tv recently its certainly not the best film ive ever seen but it does do what it says on the tin and i cant knock it for that more of my thoughts later heres a brief summary first summary haters and those that dont wish to know anything about the plot please kidnap more victims while i write the next paragraphdr heiter used to be a famous surgeon he specialised is separating siamese twins and was very good at it now retired and living alone he turns his mind to putting things together rather than separating them to this end he has already tried an experiment on his three rottweilers and is now ready to move on to the next step having chosen and kidnapped his first victim a truck driver he cant believe his luck when two young american tourists lindsay and jenny arrive at his door having had car trouble they are quickly dealt with and sedated in his cellar unfortunately for the truck driver he doesnt match and so another subject has to be found this time its a young japanese man called katsuro who the doctor brings back to his cellar and now its time to begin the experiment but not before one of the makes a break for it i will leave my short summary here so as not to upset the spoiler police too muchto be honest i found this film was quite badly made i dont know if it was because it was cut for a tv audience but there seemed to be gaping plot holes and continuity errors all over the place the best performance came from dieter laser who was everything youd expect from a mad german scientist ashley c williams as lindsay ashlynn yennie as jenny and akihiro kitamura as katsuro were all adequate without being anything specialover all i found this film quite disappointing with some debatable production values and a pretty bad script ultimately its not very pleasant and i didnt find it particularly entertaining definitely not one for the squeamish and one i dont think ill be giving a second viewing to not recommendedmy score 4710,cruel
a warped mad dr heiter experiments on humans and animals to create the perfect pet this involves stitching mouths to rectumsif you are shocked by the previous sentence dont even consider watching director tom sixs its horrific but not hofficially bad the film given its subject matter is very well made with a clinical stylised look lead dieter laser without a doubt is a fine actor and gives an excellent performance as he kidnaps drugs experiments and kills his way through the film he is truly creepy the supporting cast are a diverse mix and are more than adequate in the supporting roles nevertheless the film goes beyond recent torture films alasaw hostel and oozes more grossness than 80s flick society that said theres problem with sixs horror and that is it isnt horror it appears to be made for shocks sake and bad taste it may not have been sixs intention but oddly as good as the settings music and acting is you cant get lost in the film at times you may feel like an unwilling voyeur dragged into one mans mind however in this case its the writerdirectors sordid fantasy and youre watching him play out a desire and not the character of dr heiteroverall its one film a selective few will get off on and give others something to talk about down the pubif the aim was to get the writersdirectors name out it works but for most viewers wanting a satisfying horror flick it fails for all the right reasons,cruel
is a film directed by tom six and tells the story of a crazy surgeon dr heiter who has this bizarre fascination with creating s two american girls who are on a trip to see europe end up staying in germany and they decide to go to a night club sadly these silly girls get lost in the forest god know why it wasnt explained the scene was cut short to just them being in the woods their front left car wheel pops they whine like idiots to each other and end up at the loony old mans house and thus begins their days of sheer terrorthis movie isnt as scary as most horror films ive watchthe exorcism of emily rose was a lot scarier than this movie that made no sense the surgical procedures for dr heiters plan to make a makes no sense reallyi dont have a whole lot of knowledge about surgical procedures but anyone who watches this film will know what im talking about another thought that comes to mind that makes this film pretty bad is the sudden scene scenarios one minute the three struggling humans are struggling to move the next thing you know theyre outside the next thing you know theyre in a cage and they dont explain how these three poor saps can move without their knee caps yes and i forgot to mention that there is a japanese tourist who gets mixed up in all this messhes not a bad little fighter just a senseless quitterim giving this movie a 410 because it is different from most horror films that ive watched and its a pretty good film to make fun of my whole family who watched this with me have made fun of mr heiter because of his bad acting and his accenti wouldnt recommend this film to anyone who is sensitive because although there is no gore the thoughts and the pains of what the people in this film have to go through is rather horrendous but seriously if youre out to just watch something different just watch for the love of god as well tom six please dont make another sequel and alsoyoure really sick and you need help oh i would also like to add that ashley c williamss performance was pretty good i think she has the potential to be a great actress,cruel
i didnt find anything to be redeeming about this movie its not that the production value was bad because most of it was quite good minus the script and some of the acting which makes it all that more disturbing i even thought the surgeon was well cast and quite creepy thats about all the compliments i can give it though ive sat through a lot of movies where i prayed for the credits to roll but none like this my buddies and i made a pact to watch it so we sat through it no matter how gruesome it got i halfway expected the police to show up at my door to arrest me for watching it i cant believe that this streams on netflix i guess in some far out way you could make the argument that this is art but whatever kind of art it is i hope i never see it again as tyler durden would say sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken i tend to agree when people try and make arguments about what is art i could make a video where i drowned cats and dogs and hide under the its art defense sadly a movie about drowning animals would be a thousand times more pleasant then this movie i wont go into the plot because it is your clich horror story this is the only movie that i would say you are a better person for not watching dont let anyone fool you and tell you this is funny because there is nothing funny about it i have a demented sense of humor and in no way did i find a single thing even slightly humorous about this film to sum it up i feel like a lesser person for having watched and i highly recommend you steer clear,cruel
this movie was horrible the characters are stereotyped there isnt the slightest attempt to making any of it realistic and it is terribly predictable truly awful movie i havent seen one this bad in years honestly it was one of those laughably horrible movies where youre just in awe of how much more ridiculous it gets with each passing moment you reach a point where youre like wow thats really really stupid seriously nothing could be more stupid than this ever in the history of movies and then you find out that there is something more stupid the next scene and its an endless loop until you get to the end and breathe a sigh of relief that its over,cruel
saw it on netflix streaming i didnt think it would be good and i was right but just wanted to see it anywaydemented german doctor dieter laser as dr heiter is a strange individual in his home way off the beaten path are art depicting conjoined twins when he gets stranded visitors who casually ask do you live here with your wife he scowled and said i dont like humans that was a big clue but having already consumed their drugged water could not muster up the energy to escape the doctor had a vision of surgically creating a by attaching the mouth area of one to the anal area of the person in front his diagram explaining this showed one continuous intestinal tract the one in front would eat and drink for all of them well none of this is very pleasant to consider and how the movie depicted the result this train of three crawling about unhealed surgical regions bleeding is very disturbing the three people were ashley c williams as lindsay and ashlynn yennie as her friend jenny two americans traveling eurpoe by car and getting stranded with a flat tire and at the head of the akihiro kitamura as katsuro who had stopped to take a bowel movement and was shot with a tranquilizer gun then captured major spoilers cops come looking for the missing they suspect the doctor who ends up killing both of them but the doctor is mortally wounded also the three in the are trying to escape the house but the man in front is cut and dies while the girl in the back has infected surgical wounds and she dies only the girl in the middle still living and with no way to detach herself as the movie ends we know her fate too,cruel
hmmmmmmerrrrrrahemsome movies are so bad theyre good some movies are so bad theyre just plain bad andwell this movie is just flat out wrongi love horror movies and have seen em all this has to be the sickest movies ive ever seen  and to be honest i didnt even finish watching the last 15 minutes or so because i just couldnt deal with the actual thought of this sick twisted demented doctor actually getting off on such a thingmind ya i am not a prude far from it  i have some fetishes up my sleeve too  but this movie is just wrong on so many levelsand to think there are actually people out there getting off on this and since it was supposed to be medically accurate i wouldnt be surprised if others are going to try it outsick sick sick,cruel
doctor dieter made a big mistake by worrying too much about their legs and neglected to cut the tendons of their fingers they never would have escaped but then i guess there would have been no point to the film if he had been able to keep his pets indefinitely is a singular or plural also perhaps dieter should have also acquired a mentally challenged girl what was once called mentally retarded to be the head of the that would also have prevented any hope of escape of the others retarded girl doctor dieter i dont think the people behind me are happy dieter are you happy retarded girl yes dieter then theyre happy too retarded girl oh goody  retarded girl oh doctor dieter i have to do poops dieter so do poopsretarded girl but i dont think the man behind me will like itdieter if you dont do poops all the people behind you will be hungry do you like being hungry retarded girl no dieter they dont like being hungry either so you should do poops retarded girl okay  retarded girl doctor dieter why does the man behind me tap me on the butt and point to the door all the time dieter it means hes hungry and wants you to do poops retarded girl oh goody i have to do poops right now,cruel
posted on 3 november 2010i saw this movie with absolutely no expectations at all  other than that i knew it was a lowbudget horror exploiter that my daughter insisted i watch well i must first commend the director tom six who was creatively responsible for this hilarious conceit  a paradoxical twist on marie antoinettes poetic riposte to the revolutionaries that were about to overthrow her regime in 1789 her resigned complacency that the starving peasants who were howling at the barricades for food should in the immortal line  let them eat cake has its droll echo in this movie offerings challenge to the viewers desperate hunger to be entertained with an equally hilarious literal unfolding of the cinematic statement  let them eat excrement i laughed out loud  more than i remember laughing out loud at john waters display of divines coprophagous dog excrementin pink flamingos and the repulsive shenanigans of fellinis satyricon  the dead had to be eaten more from this movie team  i for one would certainly go see anything else they subject the unsuspecting public to  vivaposted on 6 january 2011 i have watched this movie a second time with a friend and have seen another dimension which i was not conscious of on first viewing the movie is a blend of grand guignol and science fiction and not horror in its pure form i came to this conclusion because of the mad scientist creating a monster which is pure mary shelley  an update on her frankenstein motif i feel that this recategorization of the movie out of horror and into science fiction will go a long way in resolving the controversial tensions over the contextualization of this creationposted on 8 january 2011 i would also like to add a few comments on the acting although there seems to be a consensus as to the acting ability of the doctor  i did find him mannered in the style of the late great klaus kinski especially the outrageously alien persona of nosferatu and as a mannered performance it was well portrayed but lacked the inventive originality of the maestro kinski the acting that i did find stimulating and emotionally affective admirably so was the japanese victim who made me feel as if a life of great value was at stake  all this dignity and integrity he managed to convey while he himself was mirrored on the screen in a grotesque and preposterously mutilated character  all accolades to him for pulling off a great acting tour de force  without him as a foil to the predictable plot and the movie might have failed to challenge the viewer you think you are god with the human experimentation which had such an immense impact on 20th century historyposted 12 january 2011 thirteen users have rated this movie with the maximum 1010 excellent i have perused the reviews and find dries vermeulen posted 6 november belgiumto be the most informativeamongst his many revelations he tells the reader that he now entertains himself by outlining the plot to his acquaintances they turn pale perhaps a new genre of movie spinoffs dries also advises us that the acronym atm stands for ass to mouth i didnt know that although i am not sure what the acronym bff stands for he quotes tom six as saying that it was important that the jap victim and the german scientist should be unable to communicate one wonders what they might have had to say to each other if they could have communicated dries also tells us that the sequel it is rumored will have a biologically correct 12 segmented instead of the daisychain three i dont see that pumping the volume will be amazingly creative but i suspend judgement on the matter hungry guy from earth posted 23 november 2010 adored the movie for i gather its pottytraining resonance but felt he could have improved on the script with further mutilations which would have sorted the dominance control aspect of the fictional contrivances the movie presented we await hungry guys first movie and by the way where is earth i liked ceva1 posted on 19 june 2010 from russia who tells us that the movie is sadistically funny incredibly gross shtick without any signs of taste and describes tom six as a european perverted director here is a man with strong opinions and the courage to express them craig z dudez posted 24 june 2010 from the usacalls the jap victims dialogue truly poetic  and says he makes his role  an artistic and very serious experience crab s q posted 25 may 2010 from the usa declares the director tom six to be the stanley kubrick of the now generation hyperbolic in a ludicrous manner crab t birchead posted 28 september 2009 from britain describes the experience as marvelously intense and uncomfortablea truly barking beast and tom six has crafted a nasty thrill ride in which the disturbingly freakish blends with nailbiting sequences he further states that as a lover of twisted cinema i must say i loved it and the demented scientist he found to be in oxymoron style a repellent joy to watch finally glyptoteque posted 16 october 2010 from norway declares as a film that refuses to pander to a moronic audience he philosophizes about the genre of horror labeling it as pure misanthropy and the horror films pure and visceral nature glyp seems to revel in his elitist position only his interpretation is valid i wonder if his outcry against intellectuality is not a form of intellectuality itself there you have it folks a selection from some of the full ten reviews now go see the movie,cruel
the title pretty much sums it up while being original was more disturbing than scarymany of the scenes were so frustrating because of how stupid the characters were i found myself screaming at the tv asking what are you doing can you be that stupid the acting is soso dieter laser dr heiter was the best by far he took his character to a whole new level and his acting is superb im looking forward to seeing him in other films ashley c williams lindsay was pretty good give her a few more years and a couple of other roles and i bet shell do very well she has the potential to be a great actress ashlynn yennie jenny was awful she overacted way too much and i dont see her as a a list actor anytime soon akihiro kitamura katsuro was excellent even if there were no subtitles to what he was saying in the movie youd be able to see what he was feeling great actorthis movie was original never in my life would i think to write a movie about making a but it could have been pieced together a lot better the plot didnt move smoothly enough for me to be hooked i was intrigued at the beginning but i lost interest when the plot wasnt moving at a considerable rateif you want to be disturbed or make fun of a movie with a group of friends by all means rent but if youre looking to be scared find something thats worth your while,cruel
the internet meme buttsecks and the back and forth scene in me and you and everyone we know are indicative of a new cultural development in our world anal sex has somehow gained sufficient public awareness to become the butt of jokes people who make these jokes have presented themselves as crudely adventurous if not possibly homophobic comedians or appealing to the presumed immaturity of their audiences these jokes can be funny and not disparage anyones sexual preference as we have learned from miranda july since this has been going on for a few years out in the open it was time for a new phenomenon to emerge the insertion of anal sex  into the larger western cultural frameworkenter by director tom six here is a movie about a mad german this is important scientist who kidnaps three people and surgically joins them anus to mouth the head of the new creature is a japanese person and the bodies are from the united states dr heiter had only the interest of an inebriated or midnight audience in mind when he decided to begin this project i feel confident in this assertion as we are left to watch him maintain the most rigid of evil german stereotypes imaginable dieter laser plays him so perfectly i cannot imagine a more iconic bad movie character of 2010six came up with the idea for this movie by suggesting an anilingual punishment for pedophiles to a group of friends his lack of appreciation for the concept he would later present as a serious horror film translates into his having no idea of what to do with the movie there are several ways to not enjoy it assuming youre a humanist the idea will disgust you six pushes his audience that direction the movie is surprisingly restrained with only one grossout instance there is a basic drawing provided by dr heiter to set up the idea how do you think relieves itself even if you are a humanist or not and are not turned off by the situation you wont enjoy the lack of plot after the surgery is complete almost nothing happens the people scream and some stupid police officers arrive and disappear the creature frees itself and attacks heiter before its head and rear die why is there no commentary beyond having the doctor be german the head japanese and the rest from the united states are we really supposed to accept such an outdated clich without questioning it maybe we are i would have been willing to dislike the movie slightly less if i had reason to assume that six didnt see himself as being above the material but no the movie is nothing more than a 90 minute blabbering on buttseckshas been marketed as the one mustsee foreign mostly englishlanguage horror movie of the year it is supposed to be this years antichrist it isnt lars von trier put himself in equality with his unusual material and produced a movie that managed to make talking foxes terrifying perhaps someone else will make anal sex interesting or hopefully eroticnot recommended,cruel
what to say about this film its original ill give it that the acting was dull not very convincing it was really not as gory as i expected it to be the plot itself creeping you out more than anything i feel as if some parts were just there to fill in voids it didnt flow very well with the rest of the film simply there to move it along the shock and disgust you feel at first quickly decompresses leaving you sitting through the movie feeling bored and disappointed the good thing about this movie is it is something you havent seen before a unique idea that didnt have enough thought and time spent to keep it from faltering,cruel

after missing this in cinemas which seemed to have a 2 week stint at some dusty art house that you have never heard ofi picked up a copy of the film on dvdi thought it would be a lot more intelligent than saw and better than hostel 2so the film starts two women in germany in the woodsflat tyrea wonder threw the woods and then stumble on a mad doctors houseit has clich written all over it but without the clich there would be no filmi didnt know if the story was serious i found that the 3 dogs being stuck together was a joke and i could imagine the dogs pure confusion at this so now we are 40 minutes in to the film and oh yea dont take water from strangers ever everthe mad doctor performs surgery on the the 2 girls and an oriental guythey are now stitched together from rear end to facethe film fills much better than hostel or saw but a few silly moments like escaping is possible but they just dont bother to go threw open doors to escapei know i certainly wouldthe acting is dry at times by the 2 american girls but is saved by the oriental guy and the mad doctor this is not a classic but i can see this as the film that spawns a lot more films like itthere is a sequel already which seems doubtfall after the outcome of the filmit had its good momentsi can honestly say i have never seen a film like this but this is not as good as passolins salodont watch this film with young children or elderly relativesi give this film a pass and i will probably watch it againb,cruel
is this the sickest film ever made demands the sun the british murdoch tabloid in a thrillingly prurient tone and gloatingly quoted on the dvd sleevewell probably not no and thats part of the problem its neither as bad nor as brilliant a film as the 1star or 10star reviews would have you believe its as though having had such a disgusting idea so pleased was writerdirector six and his team with his own transgressive naughtiness that he couldnt be bothered to think any further to develop anything approaching a plot or a character studyif youve read anything at all about this film you cant help but know what to expect and thats what you get no more and no less we get a standard car breaks down in the dark woods  increasingly frantic search for help  finally finding an isolated home  horror film clich introduction a mad scientist who announces what he wants to do he then does it and er  thats more or less it theres an attempt at a sort of bleak ending though it doesnt really work i mean if two detectives go to the trouble of getting a search warrant and then fail to return to the office how long do you think it will be before a somebody notices and b works out exactly where to start looking incidentally that house in the woods i recently wrote a very disobliging review here of the awful house of the devil and sneered at amongst other things the addams family architecture the set here in this film by contrast is one of the best things about it impeccable modern germanscandinavian minimalist styling and seldom lit with anything less than brilliant clarity all those budget horror film cinematographers with their interminable sequences in blurred gloom should study this and think very hard about what they see the residual power of this film is due not to the work of the director or the same mans script but rather to a bravura piece of pantomime villainy by the anorexiclooking dieter laser this is not a name i recognise though looking at his track record he clearly will be known to german viewers and some englishspeaking cable viewers i understand that laser himself contributed to the development of the character if so we cant be sure who wrote what but in any case it is a fantastic performance asked if he is married his two female guests are undoubtedly nervously trying to check out how risky he may be he replies simply and shockingly that he doesnt like people the bleak and cynical delivery of this nihilistic misanthropy is brilliant but the script just doesnt give him enough to work withwe needed more of this we get a hint that this man really is or was a brilliant surgeon so what happened what brought him to this madness this doesnt need to be a convincing psychological study pantomime will do but the story needs deserves even better than this mechanical and perfunctory plotting100 medically accurate chortles the publicity for this film a claim about as credible as the based on true events nonsense that contaminates so many cheap shockers i notice that mr six is now tagging his sequel as 100 medically inaccurate so hes probably realised how risible this is but im afraid the damage is doneshocked or sickened yes a bit but only a bit and not as much as you were hoping mr six to tell the truth after seeing the film im no more shocked than i was when i first read about it youre going to have to try a bit harder next time perhaps some new ideas too and not just a rerun of the ones youve already had,cruel
contrary to others opinions the acting is not bad ive seen much worse in fact if anything thats what saves this movie from being a total wastepoints also for music screen direction and lighting the only things missing are the plot which is full of holes and some kind of meaning to the whole thing  i dont think i ever really understood the doctors motivations even in his madnessdespite all its flaws theres something in this movie that made it compelling to watch its good to have a twisted mind in order to see this,cruel
without a doubt this horror movie is less about the content and more about your reaction to it forced to accept excrement open mouthed this is the audience im talking about the revulsion is what will carry this movie it is the youtube filmed reaction to horrible content that has inspired the thinking behind the premise of this storya shrewd move on the part of the writerdirectordieter laser provides a memorable performance as a nazi surgeon out of time and placeyou dont really care about the other characters that much even if they are stitched mouth to arsei just wanted to say that this is two girls one cup writ large but the imdb rules prevented such a short review sorry if it now sounds laboured but hey  try describing the premise of this story to anyone that hasnt seen it yet and film their reaction for youtube,cruel
two pretty but ditsy american girls are on a road trip through europe in germany they end up alone at night with a broken car in the woods they search for help and find an isolated villa the next day they awaken to find themselves trapped in a terrifying makeshift basement hospital along with a japanese man an older german man identifies himself as a retired surgeon specialised in separating siamese twins however his three patients are not about to be separated but joined together in a horrific operationthis film has such an amazing cult following already i had to see it to see what all the fuss was about and after seeing it i was sorely disappointedthe premise is excellent such a bizarre character in the doctor one of the most sick characters i have seen on screen and his explanation of the procedure is maniacal bordering on genius but than it just becomes very boring and very slowreading that people walked out because of the content i couldnt see why they would do that its not gory or sadistic at all the ideas are and a lot of it is left to the imagination but on screen its pretty tolerable stuff consideringthis is probably why its called the first sequence the first sequence being him explaining his work the full sequence could be the whole procedure maybethe house is nice and unsettling the acting is average but not awful but after the are joined together it becomes lost as if the director is thinking what to dotheres a short monologue from one of the victims near the end but it doesnt make up for the very disappointing final third,cruel
so i had to see this because im into disgusting dark films i was both disappointed and impressed with one film is not as disgusting as you might think two the acting is almost outstanding at times these actors really embraced their roles when one of the victims screams i want my mom it was soooo genuine the hair on my arms stood up and the asian man has some lines that are downright funny and lets not get me started on the mad scientist sooo awesome i noticed the girls are newcomers i hope they dont get pigeon holed in torture porn because theyre better than that my final thought on the film is that tom six is playing a joke on all of us this isnt a horror film but more of a parody of a horror film while some scenes are genuinely creepy the film itself is so formulaic and clich ridden that it almost sounds like six is saying lets see how far i can go and what poor suckers are actually going to pay to see this film im one of em i say watch it its better than you think,cruel
im sorry but anyone who thinks this is a horror film has completely lost the plot  its quite obviously a parody of all these things that have been called torture porn recently  from the ridiculous over the top campy acting to the ridiculous premise of this little film it is sooo obvious that it can only be a comedy  or a real failure that is   and please  when was a psycho ever going to leave them in their underwear to cover their naughty bits  a la flesh for frankenstein  rather than leave it all on display to be able to appreciate his creation properly  silly silly silly  and obviously done cos they couldnt afford the prosthetics or cgi both of which would have been difficult and expensive unfortunately the film does suffer from the same problems as all these films  too long  just cant fill a 90 minute film with this sort of stuff it gets dull  however this isnt as bad  in either way  as a lot of people make out  and really is ideal for a drunken film evening with your mates,cruel
i had a heard a lot about this movie which has such a cult following and was intrigued with a morbid curiosity after reading countless posts on message boards etcfrom the trailer and opening sequences of the movie this looked very much like a black comedy  particularly when seeing the mad german doctor weeping over a picture of his deceased triple dog creationhowever once the movie is upandrunning and the operation is described and gets under way it becomes very unsettling to watch and leaves the viewer anxious about what gore and shocking imagery are going to unfold the fact of the matter is that this movie is not that gory there are certainly many more graphic and extreme movies out there antichrist being an examplethe power of the movie is the shocking subject matter and the continued tortuous ordeal that the 3 protagonists go through but i think thats the idea of this kind of movie the viewer gets dragged through the ordeal and then can breath a sigh of relief when its all over and appreciate it for what is is  a bit of shocking fun with a tongueincheek no pun intended sense of humoura lot of criticism has been made about the poor level of acting in this film and although its not great ive certainly seen a lot worse particularly in horror moviesfor those who can detach themselves and enjoy an inventive yet disturbing horror movie i recommend this for others its probably best to avoid as the subject matter may leave some a little shocked for quite a while,cruel

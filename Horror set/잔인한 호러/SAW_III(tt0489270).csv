i would like to start by saying that i am a huge saw fan and came into this movie with more hype and enthusiasm than any other movie in my life possibly i set the bar too high leaving it hard for this third installment to complete a legendary trilogy in the horror genre first of all i loved the scenario very similar to had multiple games being carried on at once amanda kidnapping dr lynn in order to keep alive so that he could put jeff through a series of vicious and gut wrenching events events that jeff alone chooses the outcomes ofsequel to sequel these movies have progressed dramatically two ways would be the creativity and the gore we dont pull any punches this year we start it with a kick in the balls and end it with a kick in the balls darren bousman traps weapons and devices now include chains bombs acid skin rippers ice pig guts guns and a very creative and sickly disturbing trap called the rack it is similar to the previous sequel but has even more scenes that will make you cringe or moan in disgustunlike the subpar acting of saw this time around it was phenomenal when more characters were explained you got a good feel for the decisions they made and why the story ended up the way it did tobin bell did yet another extraordinary job with his role as possibly making one of the most deranged and creative villains ever to step foot in a horror movie not only were there many fresh faces in but some characters made a return i wouldnt want to spoil it for you but like darren said it kicks you in the balls i would say pretty hardoverall this movie was great but for some reason it didnt completely blow me away like saw and did many stones were left unturned which always means that there could be yet another sequel and the ending happened too suddenly will there be a v maybe maybe not but for now go see possibly the final chapter to one of the greatest horror trilogies ever made,cruel
in the first two saw films there was something there that made the movie not just about the gore or the brutality that put it head and shoulders above all the other slasher films there was intelligence and hope the victims of were almost always given a modicum of hope that they could survive what they were given and come out breathing if they acted intelligently enough furthermore the ending of each film was always brutal and yet hopeful at the same time in the first saw unanswered questions concerning dr gordon and adam gave us hope in the second saw the outcomes of the lives of daniel detective matthews amanda and kerry may have been brutalized emotionally or physically but there was still hopewas not a depiction of a lack of hope but rather a thorough extraction of it none of the victims in had hope or the ability to get themselves out of the traps they were in except through the actions of others it became more about the traps than it became about the lessons these individuals had to learn and in the end all thats left is gore misery and an innocent life taken needlesslythe plot of was machiavellian in its design to be sure but ultimately it proceeded through the movie like a sledgehammer instead of a ,cruel
just came back from seeing this film and i really need to stress at how crap a film it was i had read the reviews of it being better than and more like which was good but they were talking rubbish this film relies purely on gore and the ability to make you cringe the plot was stupid and too far fetched which only idiots who enjoy this brain numbing turdness would accept i didnt even know who the lead character wasthere was none im sure the narrative was poor and the acting was naffi felt really uncomfortable watching this film and when i came out i was terribly uneasy there is no resolution it has possibly got one of the worst endings to a film ever which really ped me off most i felt totally unsatisfied dont see this film its pathetic,cruel
is a classic case of an ambitious sequel that has a few really nice ideas and some scenes that will make fans of the franchise very happy but in the end it doesnt it cant hold a candle to the original its a rule of the series by now that a saw movie must include a lot of gory deaths as well as an unexpected twist at the end while the first thing isnt so hard to come up with  and the makers definitely do a fine job thinking of the sickest bloodiest deaths possible  its the twist that seems more forced with each entry in the franchise its a disadvantage that we know for a fact a surprise is coming whats worse is that in the final twist doesnt resolve a question weve been asking ourselves during the whole movie no its question and answer in one and that doesnt make it particularly interesting its just a lot of explaining over some annoyingly edited flashbacksspeaking of flashbacks there are way too many in this movie we see things that we really never needed to see loose ends are tied up that arent actually loose ends its like the writers read too many threads on the imdb message boards for the previous movies and decided to spell out everything that has been ambiguous until now to put an end to all discussions once and for all it only goes to show that those things were a lot more intriguing when they were left in the darkhimself wont ever keep his mouth shut in this movie the guy has thought of many cruel traps but his constant blabbering is his most sadistic device hes already been overexposed in part 2 and this entry in the series continues to make that mistake after the revelation about his identity at the end of the original there really werent too many mysteries surrounding him anymore but part 3 still tries to come up with some mainly about his relationship to his accomplice again this is unnecessary and not very interesting informationconsidering how quickly the saw movies have been made its a little miracle that they still turned out to be quite entertaining however one wonders if the franchise couldnt be better if a bit more time was spent on developing the sequels the production values in particular could use some improvement the make up looks fine but the stage design makes both sequels look like an episode of star trekso yes is as fast paced as its predecessors and the gruesome torture scenes dont disappoint see it if youre looking for mindless fun but dont expect it to knock you off your feet the way the original did apparently part 4 is already in the works now thats just going to be a waste of time as already ends the series guess hollywood never learns halloween anyone,cruel
surprise there is a horror series that holds up well even on the second sequelits difficult to explain the plot in any detail without ruining the storyline so instead i give you small chunks a doctor must keep alive if he dies so does she a grieving father must decided what he will do when confronted with the people that changed his life for the worse saying anything else about the story line is just criminallike the 2 movies before it difficult decisions and some nasty secrets become a part of a much larger plan it manages to explain events in and 2 that may have been considered plot holes it spins the whole concept of the character and what he represents and the message he is trying to say by carefully placing events from the past in a certain order and by introducing important sequences of the characters lives manages to become a pivotal point to the series its not perfect though constant flashbacks to memories becomes a bit tiresome some of the dialog could be a combination of dry repetitive or dumb or all of the above and oh yes there will be the improbable  illogical big critics will focus on this and consider the movie a waste of timeof course you can toss out the psychologicalbabble tell the critics to go back to their coke snorting and just have fun watching the movie as pure horror of the three this is ultimately the most bloodiest those of low tolerance of gore medical procedures and general dismemberment beware the movie theater i went to here in winter springs had one moviegoer faint and fall to the floor they had to temporarily stop the movie and take her outside an ambulance came and took her away even with this interruption the movie kept everyone awake wanting to see more by the end of the movie the audience clapped we liked what we had seen what has the world come to you say geez you are in the wrong place im sure there will be some disney movie to your likingthe traps were clever original and far far deadlier this time around to me it beats out any psycho with a knifeaxchainsaw crap movie that has been pumped out too many times its a shame that saw producer gregg hoffman passed away before this movie was produced,cruel
come on people im not sure what to think about all of the rave reviews on this site for this complete waste of time  money there were so many flaws in this movie that were not only fatal but also the minor ones kept adding up to create a general sense of disbelief about everything this movie was a direct assault to viewers almost like a slap in the face as if to say we know our movie doesnt make any sense but could you open your mouth a little wider so we can cram this turd of a movie further down your throatgranted people going to see a horror movie arent expecting high art but we at least expect some semblance of professionalism on the people making the film to make us think they actually thought about what was going to show up on the screen is so sloppy  ridiculous that i felt i had to vindicate the other posts on this site that reamed this movie to wit i have made a somewhat comprehensive list of all of the things that went into this movie that made me wish i could personally rip the writers computer off their desk  smash it to tiny bits1if jigs so sick how the heck was he ever able to accomplish the things he does youd think ups would be suspicious of all of the items he procuressir i have your delivery of 50 mannequins  200 voice recorders i couldnt fit the 300 rotten pig carcasses into the van though 2the whole understudy thing with the junkie girl was particularly lame  wholly unbelievable 3the last line from the dr  i want a divorce how can the writer expect us not to feel cheated 4never would have let the end happen the way it didhe wasnt in control at all 5sure has all kinds of torture devices but no progesterone on hand youd think that would be pretty high on his list of things to do 6the whole brain operationit was actually the only part of the movie i laughed at 7pointless flashbacks that didnt lend anything to the film was this just filler to distract us from what a bad movie this was 8tieing up loose ends hey if the audience wanted closure from a horror movie series then they would make cliff notes for them thats not why we watch horror horror movies are best when they are mysterious  were left in the dark 9there are no what would you do situations the viewer can reflect on in this movie which is what made the other 2 good 10is it just me or does anyone else feel insulted to think knows all  sees all except when it helps the plot  ie the junkie murdering the victims anyways 11three words liquefied pig juice and just how did the judge not puke his lungs out until after they left that roomtoo many more to mentionplease do yourself a favor and save your hardearned money  avoid this film maybe itll send a message to the producers that their audience isnt so simpleminded and theyll stop making this caliber of a movie then again maybe not can you say open wide there just may be another turd to shove down your throats come halloween next year,cruel
i was a fan of the first saw  i found the very tightly knitted mix of horror suspense and twists and the unpredictability of a relatively new concept really intriguinghaving missed i watched hoping that the initial formula had somehow been extended and maintained i was most certainly disappointedthe first few challenges were nothing more than a gorefest the thrill and suspense of the challenges faced in the original saw replaced with ideas designed to do nothing more than test how well you could hold onto your last meal there was no rhyme no reason and paperthin plots although i do admit that the plots may have been thicker if i had seen but any episode in a good series should be able to stand on its own without needing the prior episodes to workafter enduring the first 20 minutes of blood and guts the storyline of the movie started to develop but it was hard to actually connect with it as there was the constant fear that the next second another disembowelment or similar would jar you out of the storyline againi think that the only real review and punishment for this film would probably be to lock the directorproducerwriter into a chair and give them a choice of watching the film continuously or hacking their own legs off i think theyd lose their legs if they have any taste,cruel
this movie as always with the previous nstallments has once again proved to be worthwhile the setups were great the torture devices and scenes were unimaginable with no limits whatsoever and the ingenious traps puts on all of his victims were unbelievable will keep you wondering what will be the outcome of the end no doubt did this movie impress me and hopefully saw fans as well now as a warning this movie did have some extremely sickening scenes with constant groans from audience in theater but will nonetheless please its viewers i highly recommend fans and anyone who loves a good grossout horror movie buff to see this latest nstallment,cruel
i dont expect this review to change anyones mind about seeing the film  if you like the saw franchise youre going to see this movie as well  no review will stop you but as one who has seen every installment i found this incredibly disappointingfirst and foremost the very premise of the franchise damn thin to begin with is made even more thin while at the same time nothing new is introduced nothing there is no new creative twist just once again through his protg getting all preachy to a new host of victims about how they had every advantage and didnt live up to his expectations so now hes going to teach them somethingorotherin this film in particular rings rather preachy and even more so absolutely hypocritical for instance saw puts the main victim through the paces to teach said victim how to forgive  great lesson coming from a guy who blames the world for his terminal illness doctor heal thyself of course not that this was different in or ii gore replaces horror and there is absolutely no suspense given the storyline id even call this one dull  even by comparisons to i and ii i was actually leaning my head on my hand much of the way through  it is indeed a maddingly dull plotthe filmmakers definitely believe their audience is a rather stupid lot the whole background is retold more than once with a liberal amount of repeat footage your average filmgoer can make the connections in but apparently the directors thought we needed a cliffnotes encapsulationso again not like anyone looking forward to this movie is going to change their minds but dont expect anything new dont expect creativity dont expect suspense or horror expect a few clever apparently holds an engineering degree from carnegie mellon or something torture devices and the same rehashed storyline driven into the ground as well as into the audiences heads the dullards we are,cruel
saw was a smash hit at the box office for a few reasons first james wan is a fantastic visionary director he manages to tell the story build suspense scare the crap out of the audience when necessary but best of all like any good horror film the viewer is strung out waiting for the next twist the ending is so awesome we finally get to see who really is and its the last person anyone expects we even see john earlier in the film in a hospital bed but no one could ever have suspected the film wasnt even wellacted but the story and the way the story unfurled was genius danny glover and his search for clue by clue is what really sells everything home by the end we want to know who jigs worse then the men chained in the basement when we find out the truth it is so satisfying that is a what a good movie doesbrought aboard a novice director and it becomes obvious that plot was taking a backseat to gore not particularly surprising for a sequel but disappointing nonetheless darren lynn bousman tried as hard as he could to bring back the feel of saw but with having been caught so early in the film lacks the sense of mystery and suspense that saw brilliantly maintains from start to finish bousman uses the same seizureinducing editing but it is not as welldone nor is the movie really scary at any point at least the game that goes on throughout the movie is interesting and the twist at the end is enough to satisfy the vieweris a rush job the script was written in a week that should tell you everything you need to know the traps are gory as hell but the brilliant moral lessons behind the traps are completely gone the game that jeff plays really only has 3 or 4 parts and nothing comes out of any part of it jeff himself is never in any immediate danger so there is no sense of urgency to the film the brain surgery scene is totally pointless it serves no purpose other than to gross people out and it isnt even done well at no point during this film was i even remotely afraid darren lynn bousman tries soooo hard to direct as crisply as james wan did but he ends up reusing footage over and over and he totally fails to reproduce the feel of saw the editing tries to duplicate what made saw so good but it falls flat and feels completely forced there is no suspense no climax almost no notable parts and there are very few surprises the best part of the whole franchise tobin bell is stuck in a bed and his awesome performance definitely does not make up for this films lack ofeverything the ending is just as anemic as the film itself i was completely and utterly disappointed with how this film turned out you simply cannot make a good movie if you completely disregard the need for plot and characters darren lynn bousman close but no ciguh wait it wasnt even close if this series continues they need to bring wan back and they need to do a prequel so that we can see the only saving grace of the saw movies at his finest and not in a damn bed,cruel
well after watching i was really looking forward to which as far as i am concerned wasnt as good as and my hopes for went down but last night i got a free pass from my friend for an advance private screening of i can promise you one thing this movie is just like and has everything and loads more of gore than  2the acting particularly is good but its the story and the plot that is extremely well written and of course the twists again like the first 2 are huge and much much much much more enthralling and shocking this movie is a reminder of and really sets the tone for more saw movies to come i would be heartbroken if this saw series ends here because its getting interesting with each partthumbs up to a must see go and watch it and experience the shocks 810,cruel
a few things about this whole saw series that i hate 1 the repulsive attempt to support the belief that jigs not a murderer  in all these movies unfortunately some people believe in this nonsense which is enough to convince me that in these days many peoples minds are simply warped and rotten beyond understanding2 the claim of these movies that jigs just trying to help people and all the folks simply cannot make use of the great chance they were given yeah it is a piece of cake to cut through your eye and look for whatever is hidden in your flesh if you have as much time as one minute i must also admit that it is a good way to teach somebody not to sham illness and skip work by covering him in flammable substance poisoning him giving him a candle to look for something not really possible to find mark rodriguez in saw3 i also hate the whole attempt to present the plot of this disastrous trilogy as something really realistic and possible from what i have read i can conclude that there are dozens of things in all the three movies that clearly show that it is all based on the audiences lack of specialist knowledge eg technical or medical knowledge and uncritical reception of what is shown do not understand me wrong i do not want to slate eg a fantasy novel just because i do not believe in magic but because eg no character should be too exempt from the rules that apply to others i can tolerate that in some movies characters do pretty impossible things but that is the convention of some genres however saw tries to present as some genius whose work is perfect however if there is to be no flaw every detail of the story should be preceded by research by the 8222saw crew4 especially low primitive and disgusting is this showing every possible detail  severed limbs and the trapped people agony particularly shocking was the last scene of  the disfigured corpse of lynn why is it shown certainly for gruesome entertainment of numerous freaks because a moment before we can see jeff turning his head from the shotgun collar blast which clearly tells us that the trap worked choosing somebodys corpse without head for the last thing we see in a film is utterly devoid of any sense or aesthetic value moreover it is obvious that something unshown unknown and unexplained unexplained but not illogical  is much more scary and fascinating than something fully visible and plain eg the thing killing people in stephen kings short story 8222raft it proves what the purpose of and the two other movies of the cycle is to get as many people to the cinema as possible i would not be so critical of these movies if they were just slashers but they pretend to be something moreto conclude this trilogy is a cheap way for some people to get a lot of cash and media attention,cruel
the plot is weak the gore is weak the characters are weak and nothing really has a purpose in the movie other than to make people with queasy stomachs want to throw up as a horror fan knowing what i know about the genre this movie is just meant to shock people the situations the people are put in are not clever and they are elaborate and ridiculous they explain why the murders seem to be pointless in the movie later but it still doesnt make it any more entertaining the most gruesome part is when one character performs surgery on horror fans dont go see this movie unless youre in a bad mood and want to have something to complain about for everyone else it may provide some gross stuff to make you a little squirmy but thats about it it hasnt got a clever twist at the end like the first two the second movie was bad but at least it had a fun twist at the end,cruel
this movie stunk i loved the first two but this one was terrible it gave away some of the secrets from and 2 this one actually diminished the first two pictures this movie is too predictable theres a little twist at the end but nothing like the surprises at the end of the first two the whole plot deals with amanda but jigs the real star of the series the fact that he is an ancillary character just ruins it for me the final sequence is terrible and predictable you should probably see it just for the sake of completeness but its easily the worst of the 3 movies and is a shameful end to the trilogy,cruel
in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series for many reasons one reason being that it keeps it simple instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in saws ii iv and v like the original has much fewer characters leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone and while it does have subplots they dont feel out of place theyre not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences they feel organic they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to whyif youve seen a saw film you know the story is going to have twists turns and violencegore to accompany them but at least does it very well it expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do we also get a deeper look at the relationship between and amanda knowing more about how the two really look at each other jigs the calm cancerstricken antihero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint amanda on the other hand doesnt seem to grasp this  instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse with these two extremes we see how much jigs trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons and when gets ill we see that amanda really isnt a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes outis also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply maybe not as much as our two antiheros but we understand where theyre coming from from lynns dour nature to devastated jeffs situation the subplot with jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film these messages shows us that hate vengeance revenge and complacency brings more pain than anything else and does not solve anything it ruins families destroys relationships clouds judgment and at the end selfdestruction leigh whannell who wrote the first two films with james waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on and amanda he makes more of a character study than any of the other installments and thats one of the essential reasons why this installment scores highdarren lynn bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with and v the quick edits are kept to a bare minimum thank god and the film has a lot of dread going for it very moody and darkly atmospheric he focuses on the drama and emotion at hand which was a vast improvement on and especially v he lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extrafancy with the camera work lastly the cinematography is a plus darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good nonqueasy camera movements i love the lighting most of all though he uses a wide arrange in the color palette from lime green to icy blue he definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it his direction of iii ranks alongside james waans mindblowing direction of the originalthe acting is hardly an issue its usually good or better tobin bell can play john kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake he shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides shawnee smith is superb as amanda who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series this is without a single doubt her shining moment her most dramatic portion in the series you really want to hate her but you just cant because you pity her smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality angus macfadyen as jeff is superb in his role as well he makes jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series as far as im concerned mcfayden nailed the mourning father act bahar soomekh was decent but always outshone by bell smith and mcfayden her acting was a bit flimsy at times but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likablethe suspense and tension while not as impressive as the original is still great hardly any other saw film or horror film in general for that matter with the exception of eden lake from last year and inside from 2007 has been so edgeofyourseat gripping so exciting the slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in and this makes it all the more betterthere is a lot of extreme gore in this film but unlike some other installments like saws iv and v its done very well and serves a purpose jeffs bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic youre enduring these horrific scenes along with jeff and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness moreover the revelation that the horror isnt over and what you feel as a result drives home the shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring itis clever solidly written has the best characters succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for and ties up loose ends perfectly for a third installment in a horror series its incredibly strong,cruel
ok so here is my problem with first off we are supposed to see this guy as some kind of spiritual healer for people whose lives are in disarray he takes people who have some sort of problem note the word problem is very loosely adapted in these films  according to a woman who is having marital problems needs to go through a deathtrap and tries to help them heal themselvesmakes sense not really but i will go with it anyways in the final trap involves 4 people including but is really that crazy girls game even though she is sidekick ok so says that he despises murderers really well you just included two innocent people in one of your games to teach some crazy drugaddict a lesson about anger managementthe one guys problem he was upset that his son was killed in an accidenthis wifes problem her marriage went sour after the accident occurred and she was having an affair both seem pretty innocent to me but wait they need to learn a lesson i know it is just a movie but the series has really lost its way from the original script was not a good movie it had horrible acting but it had a decent script and a pretty good story linenow the saw series is about the producers or screenwriters whoever thinks up this crap thinking up 4 or 5 deathtraps and then later filling in some lame story line what we are left with is still horrible acting except now an equally bad storylinethink its time to put this puppy to bed saw creators,cruel
well i didnt walk into this theater expecting the greatest horror movie of all time and i wasnt shocked i was happy though with the experience and found myself shielding my eyes trying to keep up with what is at first a very disjointed plot and eventually trying not to see the predictable outcomes of this film loved the gore loved the traps although they were a bit much in this version and unfortunately there werent many actual traps just some excess eye candy lying about the workshops and scenes of instruments of terror honestly i saw more gruesome items of destruction in the trailer for hostel 2 but whatever the movie was well worth my eight bucks and i will likely rent it when it comes out to watch it again loved the whole trilogy and as for this movie i think it cant stand alone if you liked the first two youll love this one just dont expect too much the plot was just right once it got going and the gore was intense too much even for this hardcore horror lover but hey you get what you pay for,cruel
after seeing i have to say that i was surprised few films do good in their third installments but saw does quite well its got more gore than the other 2 not tons more but definitely enough to please a horrorgore movie fan above the gore though is some of the sounds of the film that make you go that was insane there is some crazy traps in that are very good but theres always room for more sicktwisted trap ideas its got better acting than but how important is the acting anyways most people just want to see some nasty traps and nasty they are does have some noticeable actors who are good though they arent really that famous its a well made horror film pretty good series for 3 years in a row hopefully if there is a 4 it wont ruin the series but who cares its like throwing out halloween 3 and loving the rest this one also has good twists and like the other ones i was waiting to hear that saw theme song music and sure enough at the end there it was good film well done,cruel
i decided just as it was getting dark that i was going to watch and with much anticipation after the first two i did just that the movie opens up alike the first  reintroducing the bathroom so i wasnt feeling too badthe movies a tad confusing and i spent more or less the whole time trying to keep the vomit down in my stomach so that didnt leave me with too much mentality to make sense of the whole reminiscent nostalgic dejavu way the storyline was writtenthe whole disgusting gory blood thing just isnt my style of horror thumbs up for the excellent twists though definitely not for those with a faint heart or a weak stomach maybe my anticipation of the first two brought my hopes up a bit too high but it really wasnt as fantastic as i expectedgo and watch it though only if youve seen the first two,cruel
we went to the cinema yesterday to see this flick i cant really say i had any expectations i mean its a third part in a series and such are rarely keeping the same quality as their predecessors after seeing it i have to admit that this flick is definitely keeping the same touch of quality work as the first two parts id say its better than the second piece and if its not better than the first piece then theyre at least eveni found the third part to have a bit more gore in it compared to the other pieces in the series some scenes are really disturbing and even i who claim myself to be quite difficult to disturb through film as a medium at times felt really well it was almost a bit too much its far from snuff please dont get me wrong here since the utter disturbance is very beautiful in a way and very artistic id sayfor the plot i cant pull off any complaints anyone familiar with the first two pieces and the plot of theirs will recognize the atmosphere and the touch of the flick here the acting is neat no complaints there either allinall this is a wellmade flick and among the best deliveries from hollywood ive been confronted with in quite a while i recommend it 710,cruel
i can give saw credit for its originality and interesting twist though it wasnt as well done as it easily could have been though was extremely silly i can understand releasing a sequel to a movie as popular as the original however was unnecessary and unforgivableif people believed that gratuitous gore without context made for a good scare they would watch surgery on tv when in the mood for a horror film this was an unfrightening and hackneyed piece of garbage the only semblance of depth i saw was that watching this movie was in itself a gruesome form of torture i believe the scriptscreenplay was concocted in about 10 minutes according to the following formula 1 think of a very simple twist to be revealed 15 minutes before the end 2 end the film by simultaneously playing familiar music and explaining exactly why one could have started the movie during the last half hour both of which will cause the viewer to wish for a rudimentary rusty medieval device to remove their ears and gouge out their eyes and 3 insert 15 hours of torture footage in front of it alli may only take solace in the idea that a v would be unlikely,cruel
this s what ive been waiting for i just got back from the movies having seen this and i am satisfied with spending 850 on the movie the movie was very unpredictable and kept me cringed throughout the entire filmcompared to this one you wont even remember that ever existed i was glued to the screen from start to finish some scenes had me turn away because it was just too much to handlevery entertaining the ending is great the acting is greatit has all the shocks and twist that the first one made us all love it for if you want old school saw go see ityou wont be disappointed,cruel
first of all i loved and thought it was an instant classic then when came out before seeing the movie i thought heres a case of where they should have left the first movie alone but again was pleasantly surprised so then i knew there had to be a final installment and man i must say they brought it from beginning to end this movie shapes up in true saw fashion for a finish thats completely unexpected i know its hard to give a movie a 10 but the simple fact is this is the first horror thrillogy thats worked for all 3 movies congrats to the creators and cast you guys have a made a classic thrillogy thats gonna be hard to beat for a long time to come,cruel
i thought the first one was great the second one was not so good as it moved away from the idea behind one and reminded me more than a little of cube however  well its rubbish  about as scary as an angry kittenthe acting is really atrocious and the plot a totally pathetic joke all of the gory scenes were very fast there was no build up at all and they were as gory as possible without any point leaving you to just cringe but not care at allthe ending painfully long with educational flashbacks for anyone not remembering 1  2 or that were senile enough to not remember what happened 10min ago it was filled with boring predicable twist after twist leaving a message  it went on and on and on and on my husband said it was one of the worst films hed ever seen  that the people that allegedly fainted whilst watching it must have done so out of boredom,cruel
hollywood has been walking a very fine line recently to try to scare the crap out of us the problem some directors feel is that we are so desensitized to what we have seen in recent horror films that we must up the violence gore and grotesque to limits never before seen in cinemawith the exception of a wonderful scene in the beginning with donnie wahlberg there is no artistic value to anything shown in the movie and i feel like a worse person after seeing it there is no reason to see it unless you are a sadist or feel the need to impress yourself for how much you can take this movie is an excersise in physical tolerance not mental instead of covering your eyes in fear you will turn away in disgust it is nothing but a snuff movie with a budget filmed by people who used to get arrested for charging people to see iti have nothing against horror movies or gore or violence or the grotesque i do however when it is done without any artistic reason whatsoever the gore in this movie is not done to scare what tobe hooper knew when he directed the original texas chainsaw massacre is that no matter what you show no matter how violent you can make a film nothing is scarier than the imaginationthere is a very scary scene in with a naked woman hanging from a hook by a rope tied around her hands she is in a giant freezer and water eventually sprays at her freezing her body it is a brilliant creative and horrifying method of death but the problem is the way it is shot the movie has absolutely no problem showing this womans naked body in the full hanging screaming and being sprayed with ice water as she pleads for helpwhat have we come to why must we see her privates there is nothing artistic or erotic in this scene and it made me more afraid of what the director does behind private doors than of the main villain ,cruel
okay if youre a saw fan you will be very disappointed with this one it was nice to see all the missing pieces pardon the pun from all of schemes but the whole amanda thing really bothered me i found that the saw makers really screwed up with bringing amanda into the story i loved when donnie eric matthews commented on how she is nothing which i completely agree with she is just some whiny little girl who should have finished off he gave her a chance he tested her again huge spoiler and i just find her character to be weak i am not sure if it was the character or the actress but i found it to be a really bad part of the story okay it was a mind boggler to find out in part 2 that she was his accomplice i found it ironic that she was cutting herself and doing drugs chose her she got out of the trap gets a second chance and screws it up big time by cutting herself and not listening to her mentor way to screw up big time amanda i found the end was really weak and predictable with no second guesses people were actually booing it in the theater myself included if you can piece together how performedset up all of his traps from the first 2 movie thats all that pieces together and also seems like it has cheap clips from er hahaha if you want to see how it ends go ahead but wait until it comes out on video i hate to betray the franchise i am a huge fan of 1 and 2 but i am just really let down by this movie sorry to those who are fans oh one more thing some of the flashbacks take place maybe 2 minutes after something just happened which seems retarded,cruel
hellooooooo gore addicts somehow is not gruesome or terrifying enough for me personally it is evident that there is a lack of the macabre and nailbiting tension that is so apparent in the opening scenes of the previous two installments of the saw franchise especially with regards to the first saw where the budget was smaller and the gore effects were less animated in the gore is definitely top notch and that is where it seems this franchise has gone astray relying too much on the blood and not enough on the true frightening of the audience this saw never truly frightens but always disgustsbeginning where the last saw left off jigs still on his deathbed since he has been dying throughout the entire franchise he must stay alive long enough to see his very last test subject through a series of tests and torture machines before he can say goodbye unfortunately i was never actually frightened truly scared like i was in the first two i never thought to myself what would i do in this situation how would i deal with this the only thing to really think about during is when are you going to turn away from the screen out of sheer disgust and not fright dealing with underling and her uncontrolled anger issues towards herself and her newly acquired victims indulges in pure torture for the sake of it bringing a reasonable story not as tight as the first but still entertaining to say the least does not leave much to be desired one really does need to see the first two parts of the franchise to really enjoy this one and to enjoy the first two even more hopefully the saw franchise will not go out with this as their last film and will redeem themselves in a fourth installment,cruel
i thought saw and were great you dont usually get gore and good plot twists in the same movie however was sad and very very boring i just sat there through the whole movie waiting for it to get better nay waiting for it to get good at all the gore was there the twists were there there was something of a plot there but it all seemed so weak and it failed to click after the first two i have to admit that my expectations were high but was i really so out of line what happened with iii i just dont understand how saw could have come to this though im a fan of m afraid iii gets a 1 see it if you must but consider yourselves warned,cruel
at 60 years of age i am not the target audience for this film that said this is nothing less than the sickest most disgusting film i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few it has no artistic or technical merit it has no appreciable story it just has gore and torture and lots of it just the kinds of things that put antisocial ideas into peoples minds of course we all know this is just a movie and no one would ever actually do the things shown herein unfortunately i do not believe that and expect to see a rash of copycat crimes suggested by various scenes in there could hardly be a better example of why movie selfcensorship needs to be replaced with something with more teeth i hate asking our government to do anything since it does nothing well but there must be some way of keeping filth like this off our screens the mere fact that this is considered entertainment leads me to believe we are nearing the end of civilization as we know it very similar to the last days of the roman empire i worry about the mental health of those who would enjoy this sort of gore and consider it entertainment very simply has no redeeming value whatsoever,cruel
the producers of the saw franchise should have left the first film alone this sequel is atrocious was an extremely disappointing sequel with an utterly idiotic and unbelievable plot twist at the end however this sequel somehow managed to be even worse than that previous film making the story even more predictable clichd and dull than the other two saw filmseven the visual style seems repetitive in comparison with the original movie the forced plot twist at the end which sadly seems to be a trademark of this franchise being also its most annoying quality is just pathetic all this saw sequels are just redundant and boring none of them add anything new only try to repeat the same formula of the original movie over and over again always ending with some dumb and predictable plot twist that is not surprising nor clever at allthis sequel just like others feels completely unnecessary redundant and dumb is so bad that i decided to stop seeing another film from this franchise after i watched this one,cruel
while not being a huge horror fan i immensely enjoyed and 2 basically for their intelligent writing and great plot twiststhere is a fine line however from creating an intelligent horror flick and just writing a gore fest this was quickly crossing that boundary and losing what was great about the previous 2 films it used the age old solution to creating todays movies either shock the audience or wow them with special effectsif you took out all the gore from the film there would be very little of a movie left and it certainly would not warrant a release as the story and acting alone are not enough to carry it whereas with the previous movies could hold itself up with the brilliant storiesconsidering this i sincerely hope they dont create a saw 4,cruel
the night it came out a few of my friends came back telling me how much they liked it some of them mentioned that the acting had gotten better and that it was indeed better than the second onenow seeing as how i didnt really like either of the first two i should have suspected the same with the third installment of this trilogy i figured id give it a chance however the only added benefit was that a few of my friends were getting dressed up and went out on halloween night to see it that turned out to be the only good part of the nighttries to be an eye covering gore fest and fails miserably i thought it made a better comedy than anything at no point during the movie did i ever feel tension i sat watching the movie in complete disappointment waiting for a moment of tension to build it never camei was suspecting the movie to rely on pure shock and surprise scares which it did the only problem with it is that none of them worked every time something happened that was meant to scare people i either was filled with a is that the best you can do feeling or i laughedthe acting has not gotten any better and by the end of the movie i was really getting tired of hearing say he wanted to play a game i suppose after three movies its bound to get annoyingsuper fast cuts fashioned into strobing type of shots and constant change from very dark scenes to highly contrasted scenes filled with white light only supported a headache through the filmdont believe the hype of this movie if you want to see gore or be truly frightened look elsewhere because definitely does not deliver on either pointi should have went to see the prestige instead,cruel
now that the halloween ritual is over so is the only good reason to see at a theatre so here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie first off look at the situation objectively by its third installment the saw franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a presold product this means that during the preproduction phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title will do substantial business for those including myself who enjoyed the first two it would be a muchanticipated halloween ritual we would purposely not read comments or reviews or even view trailers to insure a completely pure viewing experience our tickets were essentially sold before had closed at our local megaplex although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment and apparently a fourth one they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two the original entry had to be good or suffer a direct to video fate and the second benefited from but was not overwhelmed by a more professional production process because of its higher budget in addition for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke further red flags go up when you see that is using a worldwide saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters this technique involves a lot of pre release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres 3167 in the us and thousands more worldwide this is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance if a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive buzz to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs finally the critics have overwhelmingly trashed even those who were extremely positive about the first two so as a potential not a presold viewer you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers and you find an extremely divergent set of comments my advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments click to see the comment history of each author it is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writersespecially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions in the case of the extremely positive and least detailed comments on the imdb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment if this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the films marketing campaign as for myself i cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third although there were times during the viewing process where i wished i was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out imho to be an extremely boring feature nor would i expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience the saw films are in the horror subgenre made famous by dario argneto and mario bava this is called the gialli yellow style these two italian makers of horror thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder inherent in this style is almost constant self parody necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall the parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in deliberately inserted into only one scenethe pig rendering trapchecking my watch every ten minutes i kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what i had already seen as had happened in the first two but by the midway point i had abandoned this not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat then again what do i know im only a child,cruel
this movie was terrible so bad that i actually have a duty to comment on this if you like movies that do not build tension have no sense of suspense like to whip the camera around and then throw a loud noise at you with out focusing on what actually happens maybe this is a movie for you this movie is as bad as house of dead i saw parts of saw and i believe that is a really good movie and i heard was decent and pretty good for a follow up then i waited and checked imdb and seemed like had done really good considering it was a third horror installment so i went to see it big mistake i would have walked out and left had i not gotten a ride with a friend the one good thing i can say about this movie is that it was pretty damn gory and pretty damn funny only not intentionally so if your a gore meister check it out i came home after and had to wash out my brain so i watched feast now that is a damn good movie see that because that is entertainment,cruel
while i found lacking in the acting department i thought the story line was goodin i thought the acting was much better while the story line also improvednaturally i had fairly high expectations for the third installment but found that while the acting was decent the story line was terrible it lost all sense of suspense and horror for that matter while the gore was good i felt it unnecessary and gratuitous at bestone of the many reasons i loved the first two was not just the gore but the plot twists and suspense along the way sadly one of the only plot twists in the entire movie came at the very endsave your money and wait until its on hbo,cruel
this is one of many horror movies made by the producers similar to james bond movie production loaded with gadgets and full with goof that makes the movie funny rather than horror filled most of the film is shot in complete darkness to provide the sensation of horror producer forget that he wrongly use the line it is amazing to know how much pain a human body can take he doesnt understand the true meaning and limit of pain eg there is one shot with black guy nailed to the cross having his body parts twisted till it is broken one by one before twisting his neck human body can only take a certain level of pain and the brain would shut the systems off to prevent damage to brain cell if this tormenting machine would work the black guy should have fainted when his arm is twisted to the extend of his bone braking actually twisting can only remove bone from its ligament there is too much inconsistency guess this movie has no intention to reflect what will really happen scientifically,cruel
as i saw the first 2 really liked the first found the 3rd ok and heard that this is pretty gory i thought i give it a shotstraight to the reason of my vote those 3 stars are only for the grossout value of this movie congratulations you succeeded hereif you watched the first 2 which you most likely have and have half a brain you already suspect a twist ending so this one is not all that hard to predict even if you dont this movie has way too many stupid scenes and is sometimes so unrealistic to be considered even remotely goodi dont feel writing down everything that pd me off so ill just elaborate the worst of them alli guess that brain tumor gives the ability to look into the future or to mind control others for a normal human being that he is its just impossible to predict certain actions of amanda because well they were not only stupid which would be human at least but downright unfitting to make things worse exactly those actions lead to the twist a very honorable mention goes to the fact that the you are there for a reason and have a chance to escape factor just doesnt exist for some of those poor suckers killedmy conclusionfilm feels closer to the 1st than 2nd but ultimately its just an empty ugly and blood spilled shell with none of the original filling leftdont believe the 10s also looked up the vote history and the people who gave this the highest votes overall arewomen under 18 well you make off that what you want,cruel
wowthere really isnt a whole lot you can say about this movie first of all it is by far the worst of the three saw movies had some originality and good twists but lacked acting and directing skills lacked in the plot department with way too many flaws and far fetched ideasand finally is overthetop unnecessary predictable clich and most of all pointless the gore scenes are far to bizarre for any human to possibly construct without being caught where do and amanda find all of these mechanisms and who supplies them with it without giving too much away jigs bedridden with heart monitors hospital bed and other supplies where does he get all of this stuff its almost ridiculous at least the first two were somewhat realistic in just making him sick or in a wheelchair but this has transformed his home into a hospital this is just one of many flaws i can point out the killing scenes go above and beyond what is necessary for anything to be rated r ive seen things far more gory than this but all of them have bared the nc17 rating i found myself cringing and looking away at several points i could never enjoy this movie because i was so worried about shielding my eyes from the ridiculous gore the ending just doesnt do itit makes sense but it does not fit it seems as if the directors ran out of ideas and threw this in there its a sloppy movie with far too many holesthey tried too hard,cruel
this film is the worst of the three and it was obviously written in a week because the twist ending and the storyline was weak they decided to fill the movie with backstory granted some of it was interesting but it hardly answered the fans questions those who will see it will realize that theyve written the story into a corner and a 4th film will be extremely contrivedas if these films arent already the film gets a 3 because the imagery is pretty good although shooting the whole film in muted tones takes away from changes in mood then again this is a onetrick pony notice the similarity in a number of the traps i will say that shawnee smith is easily the best part of the film,cruel
although i hate this type of movies gore and blood scenes filled into a movie without any artistic purpose just to attract the audience i tried to be subjective and notagainst this was my second time to watch a saw movie and my last after even so i couldnt stop myself from noting poor acting poor directing and poor storyline even for a movie of this type the movie borrows many aspects that were used recently and were good by other movies just take a look at how the movie ends with surprise that was me playing with your mind all the time scenes thrown all over the last minutes which is very expected and overused expect another saw movie when a new trend of movie clichs comes againnothing really special about even the gore scenes are tedious i think and are just pure commercial attempts to build on the success of the first part which was due to its new level of excessive use of violence the movie story is so overused and stretcheda movie that must be avoided,cruel
i had seen saw  the first episode and i found it different because it brings forth a new storyline told in a different setting style and suspense i missed and when i heard of  i thought of seeing it i read the reviews on imdb and all but one appreciated the movie so i went to see it knowing that there would be blood and gore but also expecting that there would be an interesting story linefor the first time i saw that in amsterdam there was an usher who was checking the age of audiences through their identity cards also a vomit bag was provided with instructions on it about the gut wrenching scenes in the moviewith this background let me go straight into the story line i found the movie totally absurd its only focus seemed to be showing different technique of how to kill people in the most disgusting ways one after another it kept on showing it the actors and actresses were amateurs and did not act well the photography was as expected it would be  with more hand held camera  as if someone  or something is following the character which is being shown the lighting throughout the movie was poor  as if fear can only be projected through dark images there was irritating sound track added throughout the movie  that did not fit the scene there were references and cuts to several shots  that seem difficult to understand for those who are seeing saw series for the first time i suppose they were from the previous movies the directors managed to gather enough audiences to see the movie through their franchise and marketing skillsthe movie was bad in all aspects of movie making more disgusting than what was shown in the movie was when a few diehard fans of saw series stood up at the end of the movie and clapped appreciating the movie what the world has come to be to appreciate a total waste of time,cruel
first off i want to state i am a fan of the first thought the uniqueness of the story and suspense was noteworthy while there was gore the great story was the focus and the gore wasnt overdone and used for mere shock value the movie kept you drawn in and on the edge of your seat all the way to the very end wondering what was really going on in it was all downhill from there the audience knew who the killer was or the mastermind of the crimes and the ending was not a smart twist which leads to the very messy i mean messy in more ways than one the first major problem is a lot more gore instead of great story the new characters presented in this installment are not ones you particularly root for like you do in the first and even second film the second major problem is the amanda character the motivation behind her helping jigs completely illogical in this movie her character is now revealed to have a murderous streak which makes absolutely no sense then of course there is the very unsatisfying ending which i wont reveal other than stating is full of additional plot holes,cruel
ah yes halloween and for the past 3 years running we have been as some would say blessed with the saw franchisethe first one was compelling simple and smart making it what could be said to be one of the best horror films out thereso in 2005 rolls along and im expecting another saw perhaps even better i admit i did enjoy 2 rather than other cheesy horror films out there such as the grudge but i expected saw one maybe it was the change in direction actors different storyso in 2006 the third installment to the series comes along and im already hearing rumors about how it was the best one in the series and terrific it was good but still not the original saw that i cherish in my heartthe traps oh they were good maybe even the best ones out of the whole series if you dont like blood gore and breaking of bones i suggest you skip this onethe storysimilar to the 2nds level of intensity it could be said that wanted to go out with a bang like they said in the 2nd one so he decides as his final test before his death to test humans and their ability to forgive one another which is what he did in parts of the first 2 but he really takes it to a new level herethe whole series represented a test on human nature mainly the ability or inability in saws case to forgive the writer leigh created a fantastic series and i look forward to more from him but they just need the acting tobin bell was amazing yet all the other characters seemed too corny or whiny in an annoying sensethere was a nice twist at the end better than the one that was in 2 itll have you thinking about it for a while like i have been for the past 10 minutesfinal opinion better than saw  no better than  yes go see for your movie pick of this weekend and prepare to be disappointed or amazed its your choice,cruel
the only reason this movie gets one star is because thats the smallest value imdb allows to give the reality is that this movie is about a negative 2 or 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 and isnt close to as good as the first one the plot outline of the movie is simple on halloween day in 2004 saw was released to the world it made so much damn money that the producers directors and writers at lionsgate just had to make a came out on the surprising day of halloween 2005 and guess what they made a shtload of money again so that leaves us with halloween 2006 and the release of will rake in another 100 million and undoubtedly pave the way for v this is definitely the new generation of horror movies and just like the old generation jason halloween nightmare on elm street saw will sadly have 50 million sequels and gladly make 50 billion the first saw was great and definitely is considered one of the best horror movies to recently be released with that being said the sequels will get no better than the original but will continue to be released every halloween for the next five to ten years its a good movie to see on halloween and i guess some people may be be awed by the gore but the mpaa will only allow so much so dont get your hopes up the number one goal of this movie is making money nothing less nothing more saw had a moral at the end of the story dont take life for granted the morals of the and iii are with the right marketing and advertising you can make millions of dollars off of garbage material if one positive thing is to be said about this movie its that the marketing and advertising team involved are fuing geniuses,cruel
well please god let that be the end of it i have not been that exhausted by gore since the passion of the christit was a ridiculous twist ending that seemed to have been thought up on the spot by the director with utmost contempt for the intelligence of his audiencethe saw movies seemed to be the exception to the sequel law of diminishing returns however part iii ensures that this trilogy will be confined to horror aficionados and teenage gorehounds rather than fans of clever story lines and the fiendish trapsshame really,cruel
i saw this the third entry in the now annual saw franchise last night at a midnight showing with a rowdy crowd no less and despite the fun atmosphere the entire experience was rather blah thats the only word i could come up with to describe this film admittingly i was never really a fan of the saw films i found the first ones climactic pseudoclever twist to be irritating and the second film simply looked awful nothing is new the third time around the story line is more convoluted than usual and by the end were waiting for the twist so when it finally comes it has virtually no impact visually the film is repellent to look at its damp dark purposefully ugly and oppressive and while some may laud the films ability to sicken i find little to applaud in filmmakers who choose to color their palette with various shades of vomit green murky browns and cold rusty steel the films soundtrack is also rather offputting making this the most audibly irritating film since nekromantiks offkey violin scrapingsviolencewise i suppose the film delivers as we are treated to various mutilations torture methods and powertool brain surgeries all to the giddy delight of the audience who cheer gag and dryheave in unison i cant really explain the satisfaction of witnessing violent and disgusting acts with a large crowd and i myself let out a few audible groans and yes a few cheers but in the end im left wondering whats the point the film is a really depressing experience perhaps moreso than the second one and the highlights are its sadistic torture setpieces which the filmmakers ludicrously attempt to justify with lame attempts at poetic justiceits ultimately this ridiculous sense of selfimportance that make the saw films fail yes troma films also attempt to shock and grossout their audiences but they dont take themselves nearly as seriously as these films do,cruel
i was able to see this movie at a midnight showing at the movie theater i work at and having been a big fan of the other movies especially the first i had high expectations for this filmthe movie is loaded with gore as i had expected with a strong background in survival horror thrillers and slasher movies i was even shocked at the amount of gore in this film so any other horrorhead will appreciate this too like any trilogy in the pastthis movie did an excellent job of returning back to its roots in true saw fashion there is a twist one which will be somewhat similar to the other two but will have a distinct difference in the end it seems that james van and leigh whannell have made their mark on the horror industry great movie,cruel
watching is like a recap of the first 2  2 were good but unfortunately the third isnt there are far too many scenes of the first 2 which are not very useful i dont like the saw trilogy because of the blood gore or violence its because of the twist in the end the twist was terrific in part 1  2 but not in the only two scenes i liked arewhere detective kerry had this rib cage trap  brain operationwhile i was watching it in the scene where detective eric pounded his foot and snapped it off made the whole audience jump from their seats in the cinema my girlfriend was holding my denim jacket so tight in the scene where troy was pulling out the chains in his body that the buttons broke the scene where the guy was getting drowned in the pig carcass was so stupid basically ordered about a 1000 dead pigs to kill one man so he can die happy the film came up no 1 in the top 10 uk box office in its second week and i read in the news that a 22yearold man  a 36yearold woman fainted in the cinemas and they were taken to hospital definitely not for the faint hearted the forth instalment is due to the end of october 2007 we will see how that goes the second is the best out of all 3 of them then the first  third in last place was made with a budget of 12 million  grossed 30 million in its first week and almost 151 million worldwide,cruel
i liked the original t was suspenseful and it was inventive and the ending was done in good taste is not a good movie mainly because of and his accomplice visually it is disgusting and it made me cringe several times because of the gore and i suppose the makeup artists did a good job but the plot and the lines that says ruin the film his character is extremely flawed nothing actually explains his insanity something about a car crash or something boo hoo the actor did not do a good job and the actress who portrays his accomplice is equally obnoxious the original saw portrayed as a silent killer which worked from until this one they have him as an actual character which i believe was a mistake hes boring and fails miserably at attempting to play a psychopath doesnt even come close to anthony hopkins in silence of the lambs or even kevin spacey in seven please dont make anymore of these movies and if more are made please do not give any lines because no matter what he says there is no explanation through words for his insanity,cruel
i would like to mention that i love both and 2 but was the typical clich horror movie way to much gore little plot too much noise over the dialogue and a predictable twist the main focus was on the gore and not on the plot throughout the entire movie it grossed you out more then it made you think about the philosophy that was presented in the other saw movies in the plot was complex and they didnt need unnecessary nudity or gore to make it a good horror movie much unlike the plot in only focused on the vengeance of one man and amanda screwing up again thats all the ending was the most disappointing part for me it was no where near as good as the twist in the 1st and 2nd movies and the whole thing was predictable only see this movie if all you care about is graphic gore scenes and a movie that doesnt make you think in the least sorry to all the saw fans but dont waste time and money seeing i,cruel

outstanding movie i recommend that the saw fans do go see this the traps are brilliant the death of three certain people do create a pleasant surprise the one thing that the average fan of saw will enjoy is jign the scenes where he plans the bathroom and bear trap games for the gore fans oh yes there is blood there is pain and torture the twists are very interesting as i said at the beginning of this comment three certain people do die two of them does signify there wont be a fourth saw however two things in this film is not explained that signify there might be a fourth saw so i guess we will wait and see the return of a certain character is also interesting and is in the opening scene the story line is interesting and the consequences of not following the rules is very interesting so i expect that all saw fans see this film when they get a chance and enjoy the twists,cruel
a whimpering middleaged man pulls against the chain around his leg that keeps him tied to the wall using his shoe he desperately struggles to reach a torch inches out of his reach to shed some light on his situation he reels it in and we find ourselves looking at the remains of previous instalments of this horror trilogy the hacksaw a dead body and of course a severed ankle our whimpering middleaged man looks at the ankle at his chains at his own ankle and then his eyes rest upon the saw and i remember thinking no not again not again not again indeed he spies a concrete slab on the ground after a period of consideration which is clearly not long enough he proceeds to crush his ankle before twisting it out of the manacle with his bare hands and to think i was relievedthrows you in the deep end after a few more woefully graphic setpieces including a rather nasty ribcage removing machine it calms down a bit to reveal a plot amanda shawnee smith kidnaps a nurse bahar soomekh in an attempt to prolong tobin bell life while simultaneously putting vengeful father jeff angus macfayden through a series of grim trials and while these plot lines are fairly detailed youre given the impression that the plot and the actors only exist as an excuse for the writers to show the grotesque scenes that characterise the saw trilogythese moments crop up very often and are done very effectively the quick cuts and closeups reduce the audience to hiding behind their hands or wincing in a state of perpetual nervous discomfort but they are thankfully well spaced out allowing you some recovery time in between the films more painful momentshowever theyre more shocking than scary and thats where this film falls flat while the first film had the ability to shock and surprise you the third appears to have given up on scares and just focuses on the repulsive while is certainly good at what it does in light of its predecessors what it does doesnt seem to be enough,cruel
the twist at the ending didnt justify the amount of senseless gore throughout the film this film was much more predictable than all of the others and by the time you got to the end you didnt even care because you just wanted the shards of agony to stop piercing your eyes the first film was done just right and the second film wasnt too bad either after leaving this movie i had the feeling that was just trying to compete with hostel for gorefactor i have a friend that was obsessed with the saw series and i warned her about but she was determined to see it anyways she left me a note on facebook later confessing that i was right and she wishes she wouldve gone to the matine so that it didnt cost her 800 dont waste your time or money on this movie youll regret it if you do,cruel
i came to on opening day expecting to get another not quite as good as the original boy was i in for a shocker i sat through both of the first two movies without flinching in i jumped in the first five minutes its no wonder this movie got six straight nc17 ratings this movie exceeded all of my expectations and in my opinion is better than saw and put together the ending is a real cliffhanger making v more than a possibility this movie is excellent with more twists and turns than the small intestine the games and terror are all perfectly timed and ready to make you jump out of your seat at any given second go see right now,cruel
the original saw movie was better than i expected expected it to be mostly gratuitous sadistic pointless violence had that but also has a fair amount of intrigue and suspensethe movie built well from the initial confusing noexplanations given scene information was fed in in fragments even once the full picture is revealed there are still a few good twists and blindsidesthe second saw movie was more like what i was expecting  gratuitous gore and violence plot is more basic almost token and really just a vehicle to get to the next pointless gory sceneis more of the same just worse and even more gratuitous the plot is just an excuse for one gratuitous gory scene after another it seems like the director thinks its a competition to see if he can come up with a more gross scene than any done beforeavoid,cruel
this installment to the original saw once again written and directed by james wann and leigh whannell i find to be one of the scariest and yet one of the most creative and most intelligent horror films ever madein this two test subjects are taken by and his new companion amanda the duo puts these two subjects through the uttermost difficult tests both physically and emotionally while also slowly revealing the longhidden reason behind the two subjects capturei wouldve given this film a full 1010 had it not been for an unclear ending this could very easily wrap up one of the best trilogies ever made however it could also in my opinion be completely ruined by adding yet another sequel the legendary story of would be completely corrupted if another was made if you see it you may very well agreethese three films are wonderful together but is this the end is this going to be the concluding chapter of what could be one of the most successful trilogies of all time itd probably be best that way but of course its very rare well i guess well all just have to sit back wait and see,cruel
well after watching and 2 i was really looking forward to which as far as i am concerned was gonna live up to my hopei can promise you one thing this movie is just like and has everything and loads more of gore than  2 and is an extremely smart movie that is underratedthey put a closing chapter to this first trilogy perfectlythe acting particularly is good but its the story and the plot that is extremely well written and of course the twists again are just as good as the first 2 are huge and much more enthralling and shocking this movie is a reminder of and 2 and really sets the tone for more saw movies to come i would be heartbroken if this saw series ends here because its getting interesting with each parti give this movie a 9 out of 10 for not being just an average horror trilogy,cruel
was horrible terrible disgusting disturbing bad worse all of the abovei got dragged to see it by one of my friends who loves the saw trilogy but i was the first out of the theatre i still cant believe i stayed for the entire thing i could stand the first two they were watchable i even thought the second one was better than the first but when i heard a third saw movie was being released all i could do was shake my head in disgustthis movie is rated r for a good reason i am under age to see this movie by myself and let me tell you the theatre had tighter security than the mona lisa and it was all for a good reason the theatre actually said this is really disturbing if you get too grossed out come back and ask for your money back my friends mom did so very quickly all this horrible movie was was blood guts gore tears unneeded and unwanted nudity and terrible acting it made me sick to my stomachone positive note it made the first two movies make more sensethats about it i dont recommend it to anyone but if you really want to see it i cant stop you,cruel
what i dont understand is how people are saying this is like the very first saw when in my opinion it is nothing like the first sawthe problem with this movie is that the first saw ever made was so good it was about time someone made a horror movie that werent a typical teen one by that i mean sex scene axe murderer comes up behind kills person number 1 runs after person number 2 person number 2 falls over a leaf and then is killed this bit to graphic to explainthe very first saw was not that it was graphical but it was psychological you never knew what was going on and through out the whole film you were guessing the film was excellent at controlling your mindit makes me wonder what happened to the psychology that made that film so great and are nothing but gore fest films all films have a good ending but only 1 film concentrated on the storyline on the way to the ending which was the very first film i like saw and in a way but when i heard was like i was left disappointed if you think youre in for a psychological treat thatll keep you guessing then youre going to be disappointed in fact the whole movie is just a little bit predictable a bad way to finish the trilogy in my opinion,cruel
i cant believe anyone with their brain still intact would give this movie an 8 or a 10 out of 10 this is trash its a poorly made sequel to a poorly made sequel to a poorly made original you might get a kick out of it if you enjoy watching people get mutilated but even the death scenes in this flick are so unimaginative and meaningless its hard to care the camerawork manages to be even more awful than in the original with lots of quick cuts creating a series of badly lit confusing nanosecond shots during what is supposed to be key scenes the acting is awful and not in a funny way either  but hey you knew this already this is saw were talking aboutbefore anyone attacks me for being stupid enough to watch the sequel to a film i hated let me point out that i was literally dragged to watch this film i feel ashamed of myself for making the filmmakers richer by actually paying to watch this garbage in the cinema what a pitiful freaking mess trust imdb users to vote this tripe as the scariest movie of 2006 the brokeback mountain spoof in scary movie 4 was scarier than thisit feels like a crappy tv series episode with a two hour running time and sloppy brain surgery save your money on this one id rather bath in chopped up pig intestines than watch this complete mess this utter waste of film again,cruel
most people who go to see will already know what they are letting themselves in for a continuous helping of stylised gore violence and torture where the only tongue in check will be one that is literally chained there in a macabre and psychotic trip that needs no justification other than an audience demand for videonasty type scenes with the slightest pretence of psychological storyline to justify prolonged physical and mental cruelty that makes the nazis look uninventivethe moral dilemmas seem pretentious in the extreme  a lovely doctor is forced to save a monsters life or be killed herself a man bereaved of his son in a car accident has to forgive all those vaguely involved to win his own redemptionas standard fare delivers  no more and no less than or the hills have eyes or the devils rejects and so on deranged serial killer devises complex games for his victims often involving selfmutilation clues are left on cassette recorders and the captives follow instructions to try and win a reprieve reprises some of the themes and loose ends from the previous two movies but stands up equally well on its own sadly after so many films of this ilk have been made particularly ones with the sophistication of say hostel or audition loses much of its shock value and is little more than a late night gorefest to wind up the series the overuse of loud and jangling sound effects from the very beginning is distracting and unnecessarily sensationalist and i found myself weary within the first three minutes you might want to concentrate hard as several lives are being tortured at once and separately but all is joined up at the end by the bedridden mastermind and if you were half asleep or drunk he goes over the answer more than once slowly this flesh ripping feast should not be attempted on a full stomach anyone tired of happyslapping will doubtless get inspiration,cruel
the midnight screening of was only about half full an oddity for a 1201 unveiling of a new movie at one of las most popular theater actually there were more filmgoers there than i had invasion and i was shocked that there were still as many people remaining when the credits rolledis a much too long much too ridiculous much to gory and not at all frightening piece of bmoviewithmoney trash if saw was clever and mildly gory was contrived and very gory than is bland and ultra gory the gore in the first one shocked as well as served a satisfying purpose here it just mortifies for the sake of mortification the twohour movie would have been thirty minutes if all flashbacks were eliminated i found myself thinking this film should come with a warning label that says this film contains 25 new material its amazing the amount of places that the audience is told amanda shawnee smith backstory and what she has done to aid jign the past the audience is given no credit for or incentive to watch the first two movies everything is spelled out in gory red detailed flashbacks folks if you want to sit through the first two films again and you dont want to pay 1500 to do it i suggest you close your eyes and remember the parts of the first two films that stick most in your mind piece them together like a montage and play it on a continuous loop if you do that for 2 hours you would have just watched i,cruel

part 1 was excellent part 2 was great and from the trailers it felt like this one would be the best in the series but to my surprise it was the worst i hated it i guess showing a lot was pissing me off like part 1 how they kept him a secret and no one knew anything now hes like i dont know i guess i just didnt like it at all it was bad its not even worth a rent it was that bad and i was actually surprised that i hated it this much as much as i wanted to write a great review i cant like im not gonna lie and no i am not looking forward to saw 4 anyways if you wanna rent this good luck but if you are let down like me dont say i didnt warn you,cruel
all three saw movies are really really really good my boyfriend introduced me to them and im really glad that he did i like how all three movies have linda from becker shes a really good actress and really gets into her partthe song that they play at the end of all three of the movies when they reveal everything is really cool its one of my favorite songs called hello zepp i would suggest looking it up and listening to it if you havent before wonderful acting wonderful plots much tension building theres nothing wrong with these movies if a 4th one is made ill be there on opening night d i give it two big thumbs up,cruel
just saw this in the cinemas today while its the most grotesque in the trilogy it can also crown itself as the worst it reminded me more of a 2 hour music video rather than intelligent storytelling it also had the worst acting as well whereas the first movie had some semi known actors and the 2nd had some actors from sitcomsseries this has none of the above reminds me more of a low budget christopher walken and the main characters like the female doctor and jeff doesnt create some kind of attachment or compassion for the viewer if u have seen tobe hoopers texas chainsaw classic and remember it had a blonde female character that screams a lot in approximately 30 minutes somewhere in the movie then just imagine seeing that in a 2 hour cocktail like thats what u get people that keeps screaming cameras that switch around nearly every second and a story flow that never captivates you the first movie was a blast and the 2nd was at least enjoyable but the 3rd is a blend of frustration and loud noises it certainly destroyed my view on the saw series as a whole,cruel
810ok before you ask im not making this up i have seen went to the cinemas last night ended up watching texas chainsaw massacre the beginning which was ok very predictable and basically everything i expected just more gory anyway through some contacts i got invited to watch some of the staff were watching it late nighthmmmmm ok its hard to comment on the film much because i really want to tell you the main spoilers but would get shotall im saying is half the people on the saw3 board are making spoilers up from what ive just readthis film reminded me more of than of i think in was taking the pss and having fun with his plan this one goes back to actually being like he was in yes the film does answer most of the questions people want to know about the entire series and at time is flashbacks before the original sawthe traps seem to unrealistic unlike where the traps were accepted as being able to pull off putting people in big mechanical traps considering jigs basically near his death in this film seemed very farfetched but this is another long awaited saw film so who caresthe gore was more violent in this film and i think at times was not needed because the original saw was implied horror you didnt actually see much apart from a few quick shots of bloodthere are quite a few twists in this film and i recommend watching and 2 before seeing this one just so you fully understand certain characters relationships to the past character basically this is still a class film and the twist although is very good didnt seem as shocking as the previous two films but was well written and remains a strong trilogyok not leigh or james writing the next film then there should not be saw 4this film just about pushed the franchise too far but was really great to see back in action but didnt seem as original as the past 2 films anyway its hard to rank the films in order i need to watch this at home again when on dvd but the original saw was the best even though i loved it was a great follow up i was a little bit disappointed to be honest at the way ended but it could of been a lot worse i suppose but still a great film which i was expecting way to much from,cruel
this movie is as equal as good as the previous two sawmovies i loved this one i just cant wait for it to be released on a dvd because i gotta see it again this movie totally kicks very thrilling and this movie is what i thought was about now jeff is walking through a maze and jigs so clever as he always have been i went to the theater with low expectations because the newspaper reviewed it and they said it was a really really bad movie but when i came out i finally understood why they gave it so bad review the main reason may be that they havent seen the two first movies trust me if you are going to see you have to watch the previous two sawmovies no exceptions if you go watch without youve seen any else movies you are a completely idiot you wont understand anything of it i promise nothing if you havent seen any sawmoviesas for those who already seen saw and go see this you will be pleased not as disgusting as the previous movies you could almost say that the sawtrilogy is a thrilling episode of tvseries 24 or specialepisodes of csi ,cruel
i thought that this movie was the most gross and frankly has the most disturbing torture scenes around it crosses the line between acceptable and something that you would find on the black market showing real torture scenesit has a totally confusing complicated plot that twists and turns like the bones it breaks in the movie leaving the watcher scratching his head with what just happened the torture scenes were disturbing to say the least but i wondered through the whole movie how the killer could have such precision timing even though he was on his death bed i think in this case less could have been more,cruel
is an average horrorslasher flick which had an intriguing social commentary regarding change in the individual this combined with a killer who technically does not kill anyone led to this fresh take on horror and what made the saw franchise successfulhowever the 2 problems i have with the culmination of this series were 1 the incomplete connections with the previous two films and 2 focusing entirely on the plight of the killers leaving the victims as afterthoughts which the second half of was all aboutfirst the connections i liked the extra exposition regarding and amandas allegiance but ultimately found it to be extended redundancy of what we learned in what would have been more thorough would have been the inclusion of detective tapp danny glover and dr gordon cary elwes in the flashbacks james wan for some reason finds it necessary to reveal to us the true fate death of adam leigh whannell but not dr gordonin fact none of the major players from the first saw have any impact on the rest of the story outside of and amanda who of course play bit parts at first simply revisiting that disgusting bathroomdungeon doesnt do enough to acknowledge the events of the first film and this leaves a sour taste in my mouth because i still feel that was superior i truly hope the reason for this was incompetence because deleting these characters entirely due to budget issues would be even sadder   because we all know how pricey cary and danny are especially when it results in an extra 5 minutes to the final productwhich leads me to my second criticism focusing on the villains set out a clear and interesting formula a killer imposes his sense of morality on society and forces the unworthy to change or die via trial by fire some live most die this forced the audience to think twice about what makes a criminal a villain a good citizen a good person and this change is only experienced twice in the trilogy the 2 survivors dr gordon and amanda by the end of dr gordon is moot and amanda is exposed as a weak fangirl of who talked a good party line but whose actions regarding the execution of jiggys games were the oppositethere wasnt enough depth for and amanda and this simply cannot be if the story is really about the villains and amanda have no arc they are the same aside from jiggys declining health his experimental torture games are exposed as complete failures when amanda fails the final game and we are left with the one truth we knew before saw was ever conceived people wont change for anyone unless they are the ones who want the change coercion has unreliable outcomes even if its a matter of life and death  case in point the perpetual violence in the middle east due to its inscription in the history and social conscience of its peopleguess what that means saw really wasnt this fresh new idea it was your basic goreslasher in disguise due to serious holes in plot two things would have solved this and allowed the story to make more sense 1 we need dr gordon and 2 we need more why from amanda and james wan could always write 5 to fill in the gaps but then id rather get front row seats at the local slaughterhouse to satisfy my blood lust at least that would be real,cruel
so basically if all you want to see is bone splitting blood and guts please go see this movie i should have known from the previews of movies such as hostile ii that this was going to be a bad experience i thought the ending was terribly predictable test itself was obvious the immediate death of certain main characters all useless this movie is more proof that as a trilogy goes on it just gets worse the only reason these movies are still being made is because people like me continue to pay good to see themfor all of you who love these terrible excuses for cinema no worries the movie perfectly sets up v,cruel
let me first off start by saying that i thought this was a good movie and decent but as a conclusion to the series it sucks i love the film and its exploration of and amandas characters and their relationships but i found the supporting cast in this one to be something different from the other two and that difference is that they were boring and that i did not really care for them all the other side characters in the trilogy had something about them that made you care in this one they were just second rate i liked the fact that adam and eric returned and i also thought the revelation that amanda killed adam was a better twist than the manufactured one that was given at the end they should have saved that tid bit for the final frames i am very sad that all the characters are all dead now or at least supposedly i still want final conformation on eric and gordon but there is always saw four waiting in the wings although i hear it will be a prequel which would be cool hope to see everyone there,cruel
it was about an hour after the screening of when myself and two friends were sitting around a small bar table drinking already a ridiculous amount of alcohol when i asked the question what was the last third installment of a horror movie that was any good no sooner did the question flow off my intoxicated tongue when the music in the bar stopped playing all patrons and workers froze in their tracks and crickets could be heard from the field across the road my friends sat there stunned like a gibson in squad car headlightsso we started rambling off films each one met with uproarious laughter or headshaking acknowledgement the exorcist iii friday the 13th in 3d no less jaws iii poltergeist iii halloween iii no no no no no oh the hours that have been wasted watching such trash although we all admitted that if any of these flicks showed up on our telly late at night we would probably sit transfixed through the end creditsgranted not all was bad nightmare on elm street  dream warriors was alright alien iii was also given a passing grade but in all we agreed how hard it is to maintain the same levels of fright awe and excitement three times overthat brings me to the latest installment of the very popular franchise that follows the infamous killer as he puts his prey through some of the most elaborate killing challenges ever put on screenstarts where the last saw left off note therefore that it is of great value that you have seen the first two films if you want to be able to follow the bouncing ball without giving too much away there is a darkened bathroom a police detective chained to the wall and a saw think you know whats coming youre wrongthe opening sequence of sets the tone for the rest of the film it is gory it is loud it is graphic and it will make you wonder if you would have the same passion to do whatever it takes to release yourself from your shacklesbarely able to take a breath from the opening we are on an express train of squirm as we watch through squinted eyes a man is tortured with flesh piercing chains take that hellraiser and a woman gets a breast reduction with a contraption so elaborate einstein himself wouldnt have been able to make it if you spotted him the supplies and blueprintsit was after this flesh ripping horror that i finally got a chance to dip into my popcorn vat for some air while i sucked the salt and butter off the popped kernels we get reintroduced to the killer once again played by tobin bell we are reminded of the frailness of his physical state and the reliance he started in with amanda shawnee smith jigs dying and there is an hour of film run time leftthe movie then shifts gears and follows two separate story lines one has the father of son who was killed when hit by a car being given the opportunity to save himself or exact vengeance upon those involved with his sons death and the trial for the accused driverthe second story line follows a doctor named lynn bahar soomekh who has been kidnapped by amanda and outfitted with a contraption that if heart was to stop her head with also cease to remain on her shoulders the movie then shutters back and forth between the two unlucky participants in the game of terror leading to an ending that will bring all parties together and will seriously spoiler alert affect how v might evolvedid something that the first two only hinted at it brings the blood and violence level to new highs where saw and had more implied guts and gore goes for the jugular throats are slit people are ripped to shreds and actors are shot and covered in pig entrails joy oh joy oh joy by the time we get to an unlucky man who is literally twist to death we have seen enough bones and blood that i wondered how the movie escaped the dreaded nc17 ratinghorror films should be enjoyed without expectations so as i normally do in my horror reviews i will leave most of the details of the plot and death to be experienced by the paying customerbut what i can report is that for those of you who have been disappointed time and time again by the rehashed installments of horror franchises sits on the side of nightmare on elm street  dream warriors and scream iii it is a worthy approach to continuing the story of our favorite characters while providing us with all the red soaked gunk that we pay to see every halloweenwwwrobertsreviewscom,cruel
let me preface this by saying that i am huge saw fan i did a philosophy paper on the morals of saw the film makers of saw three should be ashamed this was not the same concept that the saw movies tried to make this was as much a saw film as batman and robin was a true batman movie when you see saw one there is little gore and violence its all about psychology and philosophy and mystery its a masterpiece in that it doesnt make you wince at the action it makes you ponder the storyline is phenomenal and the whole dialog taking place is genius when you see the acting has improved there is a little more gore but the movie still isnt driven by it as much as the movie is about the dialog and philosophy when matthews and are discussing the will to survive and the cure to cancer that is genius in that is gives the audience something to ponder there are a couple of wince scenes but with good reason breaks the tradition yes there is still some dialog but it gets lost in the movie between the scenes of gore that drive it isnt about philosophy its about the inventiveness of the traps and that makes this movie nothing more than a really creative slasher film most of the violence was unnecessary and overly graphic not a saw trademark by any means and the movie makes you sick more than it makes you ponder even the twist which is suppose to be saws trademark and specialty is predictable and doesnt shock you as much as make you feel stupid this movie excels as a gross you out film and fails as a true saw film mix that in with constant seizureworthy strobes going off a couple people in the theater had seizures from all the strobbing and this movie is packaged for 15 year old goth in every family but thats not a what saw was about i know saw s a personal friend of mine and this film ladies and gentlemen is no saw dont waste your time hoping for another saw this movie is intellectually devoid on every level and is only good for mindnumbing violence,cruel
with both saw and having had plots that twisted and turned almost like mind i wasnt sure where a third movie would go i have to say however that easily matches up to the first 2 and brings to an end a very impressive storyline i hope more on this laterthe first few minutes tie up some loose threads from while at the same time laying some groundwork for the story as before people are being put into traps designed by with a possible way out if they are willing to do what is necessarythis time the focus is mainly on 2 characters a grieving father angry and devastated by his sons death and the lack of punishment of the person involved hes giving a chance to work through his pain via a series of traps inflicted on those most to blame for his pain mainly the driver his son was run over an eyewitness who didnt stop and the judge hes giving the chance to save them and in turn perhaps save himselfthe other person is a doctor who is abducted and must keep alive while the game is being played if he dies then she doesthe movie also delves into the relationship between and amanda both in relation to the current game and those of the pastto say anymore on the plot would give too much away suffice to say it twists and turns like the others features some brutal deaths and gives one last nasty twist which some people hope might result in a saw 4i for one think that the ending here cruel as it isshould be the ending of the story the saw movies have surprised me both with the plots and level of violence but i dont think you can take the story anywhere else and considering it covers some plot holes left over from  ii i get the impression the makers feel the sameif there is a saw 4 ill go and may enjoy it i hope though it ends with this fitting conclusion,cruel
i never did see the point of the saw moviestheres no real point to any of themyou know that whatever people do they are going to suffer plenty of gore but hell its only latex n sht and since the main characters are neither believable nor likable the viewer has about as much interest in watching their fates unravel as watching paint dry even quick drying stuffim not sure why i sat through the first two never mind this pile of drossavoid,cruel
follows the rule of decreasing quality and increasing gore that horror films continually find themselves in when they become sequelsi felt that the plot was quite implausible and i found it hard to take the film seriouslyand those messages left by the doll or the minitape playersoh purlease spare me your pathetic lectures on how each victim has wasted their life and deserves their fate unless they torture themselves to get freeit seemed clear to me that the target audience was american teenage boys who find the torture scenarios cool and debate endlessly on whether or not the victims deserved their fatethis film is not suspenseful its not very watchable it doesnt grip hold of you and there are moments when you think youre going to be sick by the horrible torture sometimes on display in other words its just not s it now that was a much better moviei advise fans of this series to watch this movie once its all youll needand for those whove never seen any of the saw movies avoid this like the plague youll think all those people who rave about the saw movies are sick morons but really its just the ones who rave about who are the sick morons the hype has passed now and its time to judge this film properly its not very good you get the picture,cruel
when i went to go see at cinemas i went with my boyfriend and my best friend my boyfriend having already seen it wouldnt tell me what happened but i have to say im glad he didnt i was amazed and grossed out during the whole movie it certainly is a lot gorier than the previous 2 but well worth a watch i would certainly recommend it to gore fansthe story was well planned out and kicked straight off after the previous saw the plot was detailed and you didnt know what was going to come next the characters were well played and the acting was brilliant amandas character has definitely developed from the last film and this definitely stands out a personal best well done lions gate 1010,cruel
was all i can say after leaving the theater why may you ask since the first two parts were simply shocking and raise the gore standardswell all i can say is dejavu or allredyseen feeling to be honest it was pretty hard to top the methods from the first two parts but at least you could feel the sympathy for the torturing ones while in this parts the characters are too week to feeling sorry for them except jeff angus macfayden whos role is well performedstill if you are fan or just dig the first two parts youll find some interesting moments but you wont talk a day after about them as you did in the previous parts and thats why a little lower rate,cruel
as much as i love horror movies this was a huge waste of time i thought this film paled in comparison so much to the first two that its almost albino i am so mad that i actually spent money to see itthere were so many flashbacks to the first two films that it loses your attention and the fact that they left this one open for another sequel is just crazy my only hope is that with the fourth installment the filmmakers redeem themselves from the tripe i viewed last nightthe scenes of gore were well done i will give it that but the fact that the plot pretty much sucked just took away from the film i dont believe a successful horror film can be made just with blood and guts these films actually need a decent story to go with them,cruel
if you liked the first saw for the suspense and the intense connection between the characters even if you loved for all the amazing traps that they had to struggle through to survivewell lets just say you will hate because it has none of these elements tried to be so amazing by having a lot of twists to the plot well lets just say when the plot is bad enough you cant really make these huge twists to itone positive thing i guess is the massive amount of gore but even that does not make a horrible plot goodoverall the movie just wasnt that amazing if you are a fan of good character development or even amazing traps i suggest to just watch the first two over again,cruel
i knew what i was getting into when i went to see the film if it was anything like the previous ones it would be sure to be gory gory was ultimately an understatement im glad they explained dect matthews death and what happened i also liked the fact they made the game done in a very interesting spin i must say jeff is such a moron for killing thoughtoverall the movie was just as good as i was hoping it would be i was impressed not only did they lay out the history of both bad guys but they also trashed our reasoning for many questions that were asked from watching i and ii bravo to lionsgate and twisted pictures,cruel
seriously seriously can anyone actually have enjoyed this absolute abomination of a film i thought the first saw was decent at best with acting that rivaled the best 9th grade media productions but this is just embarrassing it plays like it was edited by a rabid 10th grader on crack and after two prior films that have proved they can make money it still looks like it was made for about seven dollars the plot twistsare you serious it calls for a complete suspension of reason and then tries to act like its morally and intellectually superior to every other horror film ever made the sophomore philosophy major college dropouts who wrote this should be banned from making a film ever again i found myself looking around the room for anything to distract me from how god awful this movie was stay far far away really though when our taste has fallen so far that even when we seek cheap easy thrills we turn to such dryvel as thiswhat hope is there,cruel
are you kidding me i am glad i didnt pay the 3 to rent this retched movie if the creators were going for goregood job other than thatthere is nothing to hold your attention other than the continual gore saw the original was a well thought out film that kept you on the edge of your seat the only reason i was on the edge of my seat for this film was because i was inches away from getting up and walking out of the room the plot is lackluster and while the last 35 minutes has some major twists duh i cant believe i spent almost an hour and 45 minutes watching this movie the acting waslets just say if you can scream and look patheticyou got hired for this film the demeanor of the characters as well as the dialogue was absolutely unrealistic boring and almost mind numbing i found myself more upset with the characters than almost anything none of them developed well i didnt care what happened to them and in the end i was relieved to just see the final creditsif you have 3 dollars dont rent this movieuse it to buy paper a pen an envelope and a stamp so you can write to the people who thought this film was a good idea and tell them thanks for nothing,cruel
puts a twist into this one i thoroughly enjoyed this film my husband and i went to see it on date night which is thursday so the theater wasnt packed there were still a lot of people there for it not being a weekend anywho i had been waiting to see this movie for soo long i was very excited to see the opening start the way it did my husband was like a little girl about five different times during the show he had to turn his head and close his eyes he just couldnt stand to watch lol its too bad the guy who started this series didnt get to see number three cause it was definitely just as good as the others so if you have seen the first two and you liked them i definitely recommend that you go see this one,cruel
the methods of deaths are goodtypical saw but the story was lackingsome good back story linking it to the first but a big let down at the endat least for me im a big fan of big surprisesand the last two saws delivered but this one didntbut as a trilogy it holds its ownyes i said triligynot expecting a forth here fokes 4 stars out of 10my favorite death is the ice water scene youll know it when you see itspends the whole time in a hospital bed so its his partner doing all the dirty workbut somethings amisits worth the 10 bucks to see it oncebut only onceoh and dont take your kids to see itjk,cruel
this movie kinda sucked the first saw was great the second was partially better but this one just didnt hold up but ill give it a 4 out of 10 for some cool parts it was only special effects that were cool the story of this one and the acting blew but if you liked the first two what the hell spend the money to see it just dont expect so much oh i guess i need ten lines to post this ok well the first half hour was full of the oh i cant believe anyone would do that type of torture things but that was just to make up for the rest of the whole sad story thing and honestly i dont get where the indian dudes murder came into play it was just like oh lets show some dude ripping hooks from him and that was about the extent of it,cruel
ive had more frightening poops than iwhere to begin tobin bell is not a scary madman named he reminds me of my seventh grade bio teacher the sort of character who runs around with licorice dangling from his pants pockets bell is also a poopy actor but thats neither here nor there the whole concept reminds me of a really bad episode of the crotch chronicles i felt dizzyalso was anybody in that theater buying this cockamamie plot about the dude kidnapping the doctor whats that all about or the part where he maims that guy i felt like i was watching a different movie im comfortable in saying id be more frightened watching bull the bailiff from night court to infinite and beyondon the plus side i have to commend young angus macfadyen for his memorable role as jeff this guy is going to be the next derek daypuk he had me believing all this warped nonsense was really happening right there in front of me i had heartburnoverall i do not recommend i,cruel
excuse the pun but this third saw entry sews up some loose ends left behind by the previous installments once again the insane plays a series of macabre games in which various abductees end up killed in an ingenious fashion here one mans limbs gets twisted until they bleed and break and another man a judge is immersed in groundup pig guts the whole shebang is terribly overproduced and zapped of potential suspense by the fact that we always cut between the victimizer and his victim it all felt like wallpaper to me after a while i just wanted it to end the production values are high the sound mix is deafening and the films photographic facade is green and grim but its monotonous the nasty dialog is creative while the dialog in which humans are meant to interact realistically is weak i hate to say it but endless torture and bloodshed is boring,cruel
this film is a joke why should people earn money from such an awful disgusting film people who went to go and see this at the cinema and disgusting if they like seeing people getting ripped up and dismembered then why doesnt somebody do it to them things like this have happened before not as bad but still along the same theme die you little blank black you rip out your ribs and faint in the cinema isle this film is just like the 1st and 2nd wrong i hope that when the makers of this film and the people that watched this film have children that they watch this film and keep them up all night with nightmares along with their own nightmares of getting killed and there being nothing you can do about it even though people that watch this film are such lowlifes that they will never find somebody to love die all of you you waste precious resources chicken coffee pie,cruel
these movies are so ridiculous i cannot even get upset with them we have a poor guy that is dying of cancer a few months left to live according to yet this person is capable of organizing such evil plans finding big isolated apartments and buildings to use for his purpose probably he is renting them so he has to find the landlords as well to agree on a price sets up all the equipment he needs cameras traps state of the art electronics some of them should be patents as well they are not commercially available maybe this guy is in close collaboration with researchers in mit media labnot mentioning the fact that the guy must have a fat bank account since he is spending thousands of dollars for all theseok now in we have the cheap excuse that hey he is not alone he has help from his young student that was charmed of the professor but its still ridiculous and impossible things to just swallow and we have the best  the reason why he is doing this  well he woke up one morning and made the conclusion that people dont appreciate life so he has to take it from them so cheap and childish excuse to depend a whole film upon it but i am sure some people opened their mouths in the cinemas and said wowww impressive thats the reason that explains everything come on guys the movie is a piece of junk as a bottom line there is a limit in the number of flaws and the degree of stupidity a movie should have if this limit is exceeded then we make a movie without reason just for the people to go and give their 8 euros,cruel
first of all i liked saw and they both were intriguing not just gory it had a lot of mystery and twists and turns tobin bell is always good as but has the film went on it just simply failed to capture the magic of the first two it seemed to have a somewhat of a mystery but it became seriously unwatchable i was all hyped for this movie even after last years i was expecting it to be even betteroh boy was i wrong this one was simply destined just gross people out and deaths of people in this movie that are not only disturbing but pointless i wont say who youll half to see the movie and find out for me if there will a saw 4 count me out,cruel
lord i have nothing against violence so thats not why i hated this movie the problem with is the fact that once you get past the violence its a boring film with next to no originality the characters are worthless so why care when they die the atmosphere is nonexistent unless you count dim lighting as atmosphere there is nothing frightening about the movie no interesting plot no character development or empathy this leaves two things violence and boredom and to be honest violence with nothing to make it interesting is boring in of itself which means this movie really has one element boredom,cruel
oh my god this movie was horrific in the most literal sense of the word if you can imagine 10 times the gore and blood that was revealed in the spectacular flick saw then you will know exactly what this film will feature to be perfectly honest i have an extreme reaction to blood when watching blade i fainted and almost had a seizure but when viewing was not very uncomfortable however is nowhere related to its parent dollarmaker i had to leave the theater in the first 1520 minutes of the film because i thought i was going to throw upif you enjoy being scared by seeing humans mutilated butchered frozen alive sliced open burned andor broken then take a look at this if not i suggest watching signs or the grudge,cruel
some film critic somewhere sometime said something likewe have to watch these godawful movies so you dont have to that said it doesnt make it any easier or pleasant it can be an excruciating experience with such simplistic nauseating films in the torture porn genrethere is an honesty to these movies that is refreshing unlike say the passion of the christ 2004 they make these things for a certain audience and the films deliver what they want god help us one could argue that the movies are cathartic and release aggressions pent up in the viewer and therefore are a safe way to unleash animalistic instincts left over from a more primitive era while that is possible on the other hand it can inspire truly sick people and unleash a beast into society and thengod help usagain it is the price paid by a free society so here we are once again defending the indefensiblethese endless tortureporn pictures dont deserve much attention they come and they go with very little artistic remanence or rememberingthe best one can hope for is these megamoneymakingmovies can generate some cash that can be used to help the needy and the unfortunate holding your breath until that happens will be torturousnoteif you really must know this movie is average for this type of thing with the acting passable and the sfx unremarkable and expectantly graphic there is the shaky camera adding dizziness to the nausea a highlight is the pig guts scene and this movie may be the inspiration for sarah palins drill baby drill,cruel
i suppose that on a technical level at least this is a competent movie it just doesnt seem as if the saw series is going anywhere the motivation in s1 was a bit novel and interesting in s2 it got to be pedantic and overextended in s3 it just seems pointless ok okwere ultimately teaching people how to care and be compassionate i get it the slight variations and twists that s3 holds for us are not enough for us to generate any genuine concern even the surprise deaths at the end are just not of any real interestshawnee smith is over the top and mcfadyen almost unrecognizable in this role is pretty hamfisted as a protagonist tobin bell is well tobin bellsame as alwaysabout the only difference in shading in this movie is that many of the deaths are not only bloody but ultimately devoid of meaning or hope i couldnt help but think about final destination 2 in fd2 the characters figure out that death is coming for them but in reverse order from how they were originally supposed to die in s3 the motivations of the primary killer are unlike in the s1 actually based on a need for violence and vengeance its an attempt at a cinematic flea flicker playand it doesnt come off,cruel
hey heyjust saw this evening im not stuttering it is correct   and absolutely loved it  man oh man is this a sick movie in terms of all the horror scenes that is in terms of thriller storytelling acting  etc its all very good not that the horror parts were bad or anything im just saying on the contrary i would put these scenes next to hostel  and thats saying somethingif you dont yell get scared or flinch now and then in this movie something gotta be wrong with you oh oh oh  how good was this filmone thing that the i hate saw people need to understand is that s a genre on its own now the first was very good but you needed to look past some points were it could be better every movie has flaws and for a fairly low budget it was very well pulled offfor me its mostly the way the story takes one place  most of the time those places are horror murder scene  related   but has a totally different meaning towards the end and it produces these feeling in all the 3 films but you never get the feeling that its the same youre just wondering throughout the film who is testing and how is he doing it conclusion a must for thrillerhorrorscary movie fansbut one warning its not for the weak hearted you have been warned it surpasses the two previous saw movies in every way even if you think halfway that you dont understand what hes doing wait till the end  it is worth the confusion  thats the idea 1010ps a nice bonus touch for the fans of the previous saw are the flashbacks to the previous saw films very nice touch to bring them back,cruel
did for what matrix revolutions was supposed to do for matrix reloaded it made the sequel to the first installment a better moviethe plot of revolves around what happens in all three movies so be aware that watching the first to parts is highly recommended before watching this movie but if you have already watched parts 1 and 2 then will be like christmas to a child  full of wonders and surprisesi had counted myself to those people who thought the second part to be lame how could such a weak girl like amanda become a successor to someone like who by all means seemed to have shuffled off all his mortal coils it didnt make sense to me but alas now it doesof course you will be left thinking how they will ever make a fourth one but hey maybe they wont,cruel
let me first start out by saying that i am a huge fan of saw and i entered the movie theater to see with great expectations i came away disappointed is it just me or did the movie makers simply find a way to charge the public 8 for the deleted scenes from the first 2 movies i consider myself an intellectual and good storytelling is key in most movies but come onthe reason i watch the saw movies is for the inventive sadistic killings  even the killings in didnt seem as great no way out come on thats what makes them so great that there is a chance the victim will live but i digress i loved the rack though it just seems to me the movie makers are trying to keep this series alive when they should just quit while theyre ahead case in point friday the 13th 13great great horror flicks numbers 4 through whatever they are up to just plain silly jason in space come on,cruel
httpwwwrottentomatoescomnewscommentsentryid375954 ok true jeff has to save his little daughter kerry but jigs dead erm ok need another 7 lines in theory jig and amanda are dead but we see kerry so she is indeed kidnapped and in need of saving but how would it be possible have the traps been sat maybe idea if a saw 5 comes out it could be a flash back has been old during the last 4  saw 4 out next yr of cause so why not see how it all started and in a huge twist we learn that lives through a game like hes played in the last 3 maybe 4 movies erm ok need more maybe the writers could make a matrixailan movie maybe write a new huge mi type movies do they have any other projects in the works,cruel
if you havent seen or do not see iit is rare for a iii to do well a iii requires a lot more effort and thought to avoid being hackneyed and clich iii is a shadow of i and iisaws i and ii were more subtle more hitchcockesquire in their development was too rushed as if they had to get this turkey out before halloween weekend i could have left the theater to get a drink come back and not missed key elements to the movie on a good note continues to scare the crap out of me he is a combination of dr phibes and dr lecter with just a hint of dr mengele for added flavori left i and ii in a state of shock and awe i left iii is a state of confusion,cruel
the saw trilogy was a great go i loved saw and i thought was even better so when i saw the previews for this movie i was very very excited about it everything about the previews made it look like this was going to be the best installment yetthen i was finally able to see this horrid movie now do not get me wrong i liked the premise of the movie and the new but also famliar direction it was being taken i just think it fell flat to the high expactions of the other previous moviesthe acting by the actors was subpar and the story line had a few holes as seen by the flash back parts of the movie they tried to tell you more of the back story but just made it a bigger mess the plot was not as i was expecting at all it was very weak and it seemed to be thrown together to put this movie out on the marketthe special effects for this movie was up to standard and the gore and shock value was there as well it looked to me like that was what they were most interested in were the traps they wanted to try make new traps and go on the whole shock and awe treatmentagain this movie is not what i thought it would be to me the whole movie just falls flat on it face just a terrible gore infested mess that was put together just to make that all important dollarnext time when i hear he phrase i want to play a game i will shudder no not because of how this movie was but how terrible,cruel
is not that great in fact its not even scary i heard that it was much better than so i decided that i should give it a try although has a plot with as many twists and turns as the other two movies it could never bring me to the edge of my seat if gore scares you then this movie could put you into a state of shock it is one of the goriest movies that i have ever seen unfortunately gore alone cannot make a movie great lacked the originality that the first had and the plot could be guessed by anyone who had seen the first two if you love to play a game with then maybe this will still be an instant classic but for me it was like a lame bloody game of operation,cruel
if you really wanna see this movie which i hope you do be warned it is one of the goriest most violent and gruesome movies everthe storyline is surprisingly well and we even get to see a little more on earlier traps and background information that dont leave any questions at least not for methe plot is amazing and this time the main twist at the end is as shocking as the original shocker in the first oneall in all this movie is one hell of a ride for horror maniacs and especially sawfansbut just make sure you wont eat too much before seeing this movie it may end up on the floor,cruel
first the flashbacks were a waste as many have commentedthe logic and twist do not even make sense this timejigs testing amanda already done that at the end says to jeff i am the one responsible for the death of your sonand i have your daughter so wait a minute this time made jeff become a vengeful man unable to forgive the killer of his son i thought was supposed to kidnaptorture people who were wasting their lives now he provokes people into becoming the types of people he doesnt want them to be and whats up with the murder of the female cop at the beginning of this one we barely got to know her and her murder had no connection to the main test of the film that of jeff the first three gory scenes in the movie make it look like this will be about the investigation of the missing detective from then that part just drops out of the filmand were totally contained moviesthe twists at the end may not have made perfect sense but at least the killings themselves were confined within a coherent framethis movie has no coherence in short a good torturehorror film cannot just be gory because when the gore doesnt mean anything it loses its effect this is why seven is an effectivedisturbing film for instancebest parts of this movie brain surgery doctor getting her head blown off guy on the twist torture machine next saw amanda isnt actually dead wakes up,cruel
while there are more traps in this movie than the others and the fact that theyre more gruesome can only carry the movie so far this one is missing what the other two had in terms of pacing and it really showswhile jigs being operated on theres someone else trying to make their way through various tests when were watching the new person the film grabs your attention when thats not happening the movie loses a lot of steam very quickly because theres not much to watch during the operation in fact theres so much pacing thats lost that there are numerous cuts back to the other films to fill in various parts of the story in an attempt to keep it up im guessing they just used extended footage from filming before because theyre all built around scenes from the previous two movies in addition there are lots of quick cuts sometimes that makes it harder to understand whats happening including one scene where a mysterious woman is in the park which is then never explained in any sense i know the quick cuts are a staple of the saw franchise but they went overboard herethis one also isnt really scary more often than not it shows things with incredible graphic detail which might make you turn your head away more than theyd make you screamgreat writing fuses the two parts together beyond the ending youll probably see coming and does manage to tie everything up so the typical copout ending for other modern horror films doesnt apply here which has always been a strong point for the saw series then there are way too many quick cuts to sum up everything that has happened in case you werent paying attention to most of the moviein the end i cant recommend it as highly as the other two films,cruel
holy crap holy crapwhile i was a huge fan of the first 2 saw movies i could not understand why people thought they were so gory i mean aside from seeing a guys insides in there really wasnt an excessive amount of gore so naturally when i saw the reviews here claiming that the movie was horribly violent and gory i thought nothing of itbig mistakeill tell ya i thought hostel was gory what with all the decapitations vomiting and dismemberment but wow this one takes the cake as the goriest movie i have seen since silent hill and probably the goriest movie ive ever seen period there was literally 3 people that threw up on a particularly nasty scene and by the end of the movie we all sat in stunned silence while there were a remarkably few haters i overheard many people saying i cant wait til saw 4 comes out i must say i couldnt agree more1010,cruel
i saw at a saw marathon they played the first then the second and then the third it was the day before actually came out im not kidding when i say that that was the funnest night of my life out of the first two the second was my favorite now my favorite is the third the thing that the writers did in the saw trilogy is kept making the next movie better the second is better than the first and the third is better than the second in the third saw there are many different games with people if you throw up easily watching disgusting stuff then bring a little baggy with you if your going to watch in a theater cause it can get pretty sick the movie quality keeps getting better and better and the acting is also so much better than it used to be its always confusing what buildings theyre in you never know if its a block away or across the street or in a whole other region of the city i think they meant to do that tho it makes it more mysterious and confusing but in all saw three is fantastic,cruel
i am a real big fan of the first saw movie and it has gone downhill from there the drop from 2 to 3 was a big one indeed bad acting and unsatisfying ending and plot spells doom for the saw franchise this movie was so concerned making innovative traps that werent even impressive that they forgot about the rest of the movie the sad part about this is that it had room to become a great movie but it just simple faltered falling flat on its face i really hope that when we look back on the saw franchise that we remember only the first movie and appreciate it for what it wasthumbs down way down,cruel
this movie was so freaking good i mean every one is just sitting there staring it was so good the movie is unlike saw and where they save the chaos towards the end you know they like went full out one you like this guy had chains tied to him then he had to rip them off then he exploded then it went from that to the detective girl sticking her hand in acid and then her stomach getting ripped apart i liked the movie except the fact that some lady threw up all over the place good time i would definitely say that this was the best of the 3 you would be an idiot not to see this movie cause it was goodsee the first two before this one it will ruin it for youoh and there is a scene like in hostel with a naked girland if you dont like bones cracking and drilling into peoples skulls this movie is not for you or for the ones with a weak stomach,cruel
this movie is the worst ever made the idea is so completely uninteresting after it ends you have the idea that the director has no idea whatsoever about directing so he just says lets chop down every single character why because its interesting and scarybut the worst thing is that this horror movie isnt scary at all its so remarkably stupid that i think someone should legally pursuit the director the screenwriter the producer the makeup artist everyone the actors are the worst but they are not to blame its not their movie they should only be banned from filming any other movies,cruel
saw was original and well thought out the second and third have been sorry excuses for a trilogy i cant say that i went in with high expectations and why i should i have horror trilogys havent exactly had a lot to offer in historyall this movie has to offer is a dreadful storyline terrible direction and acting which is the only scary thing about this movie i love my horror films and the likes of juon and the ring are out of this world and provide everything this film did not if you like your movies and have recently seen the likes of the departed and borat etc stay clear as is painful viewing,cruel
bravo to what this movie does not have a single redeeming quality i can honestly say that i was thoroughly disgusted with myself after seeing this film and i was a huge fan of the first do not understand why nobody has been able to make a legitimatly scary movie in years yeah they can make extremely gory films but not scary the last great scary movie i have seen was rob zombies masterpiece house of 1000 corpes which doesnt say much for hollywood i can handle any amount of gore so long as it scares me in the process all i can say for this film is that i spent most of the time in the theater laughing at the fact i wasted 5 dollars and 2 hours of my life this movie completely blows,cruel
okay the first was reasonable and looked impressive but was not exactly worth a sequel never mind a second sequel is quite simply awful a poor script badly performed is hidden by flashy csi style editing and horrorstyle aesthetics in a lacklustre story about inhuman characters whom noone in their right mind should care for parts of this film aspire to become almost as notorious in extreme cinema as the fire extinguisher scene early on in irreversible it is horrifically gratuitous and misguided and the alleged plot twist is so obvious from an early stage that i felt later on like i should have walked out from the auditorium in disgust it will merely appeal to the friday night gorehounds whereas the first at least tried to be intelligent despite ultimately being crass and morally dubious so go and see this film if you want to feel violated by the end credits and for the rest of the evening,cruel
the first saw was a masterpiece that i still enjoy to watch now and thenhad some really fun moments in it it was a blast to see it in the theatersso i was expecting this one to still be a lot of fun boy was i wrong the movie can be summed up in one word boring i honestly cant think of one reason why i would want to see this movie againi was really counting on this one to satisfy my horrorgore cravings for halloween i simply cant believe that i just walked out of a saw movie and im still feinting for some gore,cruel
is the exceedingly messy both in gore and story sequel to the two other saw films that really shouldve stopped after the first film were treated to an array of very forgettable and purposefully expendable characters who are tortured and mutilated in a variety of very juicy and creative ways that ya horror fans have the good fortune of witnessing all others will be left either bored out of their skulls or absolutely disgustedc,cruel
the big problem with franchise is its all gore no suspense i like gore but that gets tiring when it becomes a predictable cyclethese movies might have had some punch after the first one if you were left on the edge of your seat wondering if they will get out let me spare you some time they dont anyone expendable gets the cutthe tedious personal drama at the centre the sanctimonious soliloquies of the incoherent nonlinear plot and all the waxing philosophical aboutsomething this is a movie that tries to be deep but all it does is slather an unoriginal slasher in pretentiousness to make it seem less stupid than it really is but this has the adverse effectits not just frustrating and boring its infuriating too,cruel
the fact that we live in a world where amy winehouse is dead but darren lynn bousman lives angers me in ways i cant describe she only released two albums and both of them are perfect bousman has had multiple opportunities to direct a good saw movie and cant even put out a 410 if he were put into a weird completely subjective saw trap where he has to direct a saw movie thats good or else he drowns in money he doesnt deserve hed be dead by now tells the story of jeff whos son died a while back and now he has to go through a trap because he wasnt dealing with his grief in a way that pleased jeff has to choose to wither save or kill people who had to do with his sons death he chooses to save all of them but two of them die anyway because the audience needs to see blood while this is happening theres also a bunch of stuff happening with and his cancer or whatever this movie is not good and it never will be watch it if youre a fan of the franchise,cruel
the 3rd out of 7 saw movies this movie is pretty good but not that good either i mean the traps and 2nd storyline are good but most of the movie is bad it makes you excited at the beginning but the scenes are just rehashes of the last few scenes it seems like the writers got stuck in the middle of the movie here is what the movie is like first scene oh my gosh 2nd scene im bored 3rd scene oh my gosh 4th scene im bored 5th scene oh my gosh next few scenes im bored ending oh my gosh the movie is a boring movie but it still should be a little enjoyable the twist ending is pretty big but not that special also be warned the movie is the bloodiest movie of the series in fact the goriest movie ive ever seen so this movie is not for kids at all good movie but nothing special 610,cruel
while some people are calling this gore flick the best of the three i would have to say the opposite has neither the plotted suspense of its original nor the fast paced bloodletting of the amped up predecessor yet the film plays like a halfassed amalgam of both i can imagine hardcore fans of the morbid franchise or people who have never seen a saw deriving the most pleasure out of this latest mechanized entry fans will eat up any bone these practical jokers screenwriters throw whilst trying to provide some sort of deadly scenario usually giving way to an inordinate number of flashbacks all in the name of allowing the franchises sole saving grace the blissfully creepy tobin bell opportunity to chew the little scenery his tired ass can likewise those who have never indulged in the current heavyweight champ of box office masochism may find a squeamishly fun time guided by endless twists and brutally unique gore for all those that fall into that third group which have seen these previous entries and are not diehard fans and over 20 will probably have a hard time swallowing this rushed misdirected cash in on the silly little craze that was once unique graphic and entertaining but now merely feels monotonous cheap and exploitive desperately trying to weave an ambitious narrative to help explain some of this sorry excuse for a trilogy the movie instead comes across as a convoluted hodgepodge of throw away ideas weakly connecting the overthetop and less frightening set piece death traps with all the personality and character development of a soap opera,cruel
i wouldnt really say that this movie is scary although it does have some chilling moments i would say that it was mostly suspenseful also most of the devicesor traps came off as sickening and disgusting they arent really terrorstriking like the ones in saw and especially they were too intense and lacked the horror quality theres a fine line between being scary and being gross and i thought this movie overall was just suspenseful and grossdont get me wrong im not saying that this is a bad filmspoiler warningone more thing i would like to add is that the story wasnt that well written as the stories of the previous saw movies that was probably the main thing that disappointed me in seeing that movie 1 this movie may also come off as confusing to some viewers who have not seen the previous saw movies before i would highly recommend seeing the first and second saw movies before seeing the third because this movie contains flashbacks that tie the first two into this movie 2 i do not like the fact that just about every main character in this movie dies and leaves me hard to believe that there will be another saw movie the plot should carry on and on carrying us into the next filmit is rumored that there are supposed to be six saw movies but for some reason this movie put it to a halt unless the next movie is a prequel or a midquel the ending of this movie was not a good one 3 normally each saw movie has a big twist that is not supposed to be known by other saw fansviewers sure the twist in this movie was unpredictable but it wasnt as great as the other twistsoverall not a bad movie to add to the series but it did not live up to the previous saws expectations,cruel
back but this time the modus operandi is slightly different in what was a game of pain life and death this time round it seems that theres an overconfidence that the unfortunate prey will not get out alive hence the death traps being literalbut of course those who have not watched will not know the suggestion at the change in mo in order not to spoil it for you i shall not mention a word but hey even without watching therere ample flashback scenes and newly created ones to bring you up to speed but trust me watching the second film first before this will help bucket loads as it picks up directly where the previous film left off with the return of characters played by dina meyer and donnie wahlberglike the previous movies of the franchise you have those elaborate devices for those sick games that likes to play with seemingly innocent men and women chosen for not valuing their lives and wasting it away through such games warped aim is for those who survive to learn to appreciate life itself then again just how many do survive since to do so calls for sacrifice often pain inducing in a massive way in a race against timehowever while the litres of blood continue to flow the devices and plans here tended to be below par sure theyre sick but this time it really stretches it a little things happen to fall in place and well they just do there seemed to be a bit of borrowing from hannibal with the use of boars although dead ones here and not since that film had i seen the power drill put to good use with that unforgettable sound of the spinning drill that skanky toilet makes a comeback too and it probably ranks up there with toilets from trainspotting and crazy stoneyou can guess the direction of the films narrative predicting where it will head and how but what you probably cant guess right is the rationale behind whats happening the why until the answers are revealed at the end itll also put to rest some of doubts and queries left hanging at the end of and in a certain sense wraps up the trilogy unless of course there is talk about making another film on the now cult figure which will have the franchise follow the footsteps of the inthing to do nowadays  the prequelswhile there are new characters introduced its kind strange that we do not care much about them except to silently bet if they would be able to survive their ordeal perhaps gore movies are such that an audience doesnt care what happens to them so long as blood is shed and bones are broken perhaps the influx of gore movies each one trying to outdo the other makes us just baying for blood to be shed by the characters and nothing elseso for those who have already watched the first two this one will bring everything to full circle and i cant get that all too familiar tune which is played each time reveals his intentions out of my head,cruel
i think we all know that 2 were excellent not only because they play with us and gave us an unexpected end beyond every imagination but personally i believe that saw movies are not only a movie that we see just for fun or killing timenote that down  saw movies are a lesson for life that we all need  not because we are unable to find it out alone but is a chance to see our life again from the beginning and understand what finally is that meaning of life at a pointafter my long prologue i finally get to the point  is maybe not as prototype as or as dark as but is gives an important lesson that i will never forget in my whole life i am not about to mention it for not destroying the end thats what you must keep from the movie the lessons it givessometimes while i was watching that movie i felt that the work that was done was not such professional as the other two films and the end it was somehow quick and i didnt enjoy it but i forgive it to itwatch that movie and remember me that the peoples with eyes that see beyond the movie will enjoy it the others will say that is an ordinary movie,cruel
i absolutely loved the first and second saw and the third and maybe last one had just blown them away it made the last two look like kids programmes i absolutely loved this installment well done to all the crew and castnot all of the time but normally films that have sequels in them arent as good as the first but is an exception tobin bell did amazingly as the blood and gore on this installment is unbelievable in a good way but it is kind of a shame that it may be the last one because i enjoy the saw movies very muchhowever it did leave some questions unanswered such as the envelope amanda received and what happened to the little girl however i hope there is gonna be another one as me along with many other saw fans will not get bored of this moviei give it a 910,cruel
this was a rather disappointing movie people say that when movies come out with sequels and trilogies they are usually not as impressive though many movies have exceptions this movie unfortunately fits the stereotypewithout citing any examples or spoilers i must say that the characters in this movie did not seem real enough to connect with the audience while it would leave me at certain times thinking thats what i would do other times the characters seemed a little fakethe first saw movie was rather okay being thought provoking and making you breathe just a little faster during the movie the second one was rather unimpressive but worth watching just for the sake of going i watched however i believe that this does not come close to taking the cake of the three i unraveled the plot in a matter of about 10 or so minutes into the movie and i was unfortunately proved right at the end people may dispute the intense violence and gore of the saw trilogy to be a thing needed in all the movies but there will be moments when even the most stomach strong gore enthusiasts may begin to think they are a little unnecessaryis this movie worth watching if youve never even seen the first two no there are people that can pick up on the storyline of a sequel even if they havent seen the first one however this one is just way too out there it will be a senseless slasher its not a slasher film but there are moments of slashing gory torture mind breaking inducement hour and however minutes it is longshould you watch this movie if you liked the fist two i guess so but i would say not to expect too much from it as an individual movie if not trying to milk the first two this movie is not one to be enjoyed it appears that the hype created from the first two saw movies were overestimated and this is probably the least impressive of the trilogy,cruel
i left this movie absolutely disappointed delivered suspense horror character development and an amazing story with a great twist has none of those things the only thing carried over is the grungy dark backgrounds and scenes of intense pain and gore the storyline is lacking at best the flashback scenes which were probably the most interesting parts of the movie seemed like they were leftovers of there was some character development and good performances but the characters themselves seem offbeat and illogical now puts people in his traps for absolutely bizarre and nonsensical reasonsmost of the movie was simply filler with no real substance to it the overdone  and i mean overdone  torture scenes are boring at best if this movie was shorter perhaps it could have kept the audience entertained however the lengthy boredom stopped the movie from amping up any tension and the signature twist expected from every saw movie was weak at bestdiehard fans of should steer clear of this movie is simply an example of greedy producers milking the cash cow dry casual moviegoers that just want to know what happened might somewhat enjoy it but this is not the kind of movie that casual moviegoers would go to anyway dont see this movie rent and watch it at home instead,cruel
if you expect high level of violence and blood you will not be disappointed by this movie in the theater i watched the movie there were people who couldnt stand it and left the place that was not shocking with all the irritating details about deaths of the subjects thats why the first two movies were simply better too much violence blood and disgusting scenes makes this series hard to watch comparing to saw and saw2 outcome was not bad nevertheless if you can take too much violence the outcome is satisfying this episode contains its own surprises none of them makes the effect of the first saw of course but they are surprises anyway,cruel
this is a good film but an even better one when you take the other 2 films in consideration as well it ties up some questions from the other films which remain unanswered if you liked either saw or then i really advise seeing this moviei think the build up about the gore in the film shouldnt be listened to as it is probably on par with the other two movies but it is the sound effects which add to the gore as the sounds of the drills squelching and crushing of bones is quite unnervingim looking forward to the next movie by the team i hope it is on par with these 3 films,cruel
what a way to ostensibly finish off your franchise this franchise has been the group of the most ideal horror films at least for me once i got through t shot straight up to the top of my list of best horror movies despite what snobs may say about it it has everything the perfect horror movie should have it has a scary claustrophobic atmosphere characters that arent stupid teens going camping eery abstract music constantly different killings and never a happy enough moment it really had an effect on me an effect that really shuddered me because im not used to being truly scared by a horror movie the way im supposed to be only a handful of other horror films have scared me substantially though it didnt scare me as much still maintained a creepy if not claustrophobic atmosphere and effected me with gore the way very few other films have has a great understanding of the sensitivity of body parts like eyes and veins and knows how to get the audiences goat by exploiting them is lackluster in both the scariness of the original and the gore disturbance of the second onewas said to be gorier than the first two films put together and what it really is is lacking in the amount of gore of either of them individually yes it has some gritty scenes and plenty of blood and body parts but its far from consistent and never is it as terribly creative or shocking like it is with its predecessors its atmosphere is not very creepy either the way the first film was claustrophobic in that it put us directly in the characters bone chilling situation this film is claustrophobic in that its missing something by not expanding further we keep feeling like theres supposed to be more to the story more to the action more to the violence and the horror but there isntthis third installment in an otherwise brilliantly frightening series of movies insults the audiences intelligence in the execution of its twists it ends too quickly to be affecting and its plot itself seems forced a part of the story that i like involves its main victim a grieving man whose son was killed who is pitted in games wherein he has to battle himself and control his vengeful thoughts i also like seeing behind the scenes of the first film the showcasing of the first films backstory even if knowing everything now that we didnt know when watching iteven if its a severance for the most chilling parts of its storydetracts from the fright it may not be as scary anymore with the footnotes provides,cruel
 out of i went to see this one opening day on the 26th or whatever and i have to say that i got pretty much what i was expecting gore now dont get me wrong i was pretty much positive that this film wasnt gonna scare me despite high theatrics good plot and a generally dark tone well it had all that but the main attraction here is the violencethe plot consists of a low level nurse being forced to try to keep alive for as long as another man can pass tests in some other rooms in the area whilst jigs dying of cancer in case you havent seen the first two films ill fill you in the killers hook is that he never really kills anybody but rather gets people to kill them out of their own foolishness this film has a nasty awkward weird vibe to start with in the first few minutes when people are stuck in traps that are pretty much impossible to survive no matter how hard they try or no matter how smart they are this film is really strange because the first two films were pretty much puzzle films many people probably liked the first two films because of the puzzling aspects of those films but unfortunately for saw3at least until the end where the twists occur there really arent any aspects of the film that really make you think about the situationswhat replaces it are some truly painful and disturbing scenes of torture and gore that become nearly unwatchable for the fainthearted this film is a true gorefest in the latest tradition and while im glad that they totally topped hostal in that area im hesitant to recommend this film but if you are a fan of gore which many who saw the first two films were boy oh boy are you in for a treat this film is probably the goriest film so far this year for example theres a device called the rack in which a man has his head arms and legs all plastered up to a big machine and every once in a while the spokes twist and twist his arms and legs and neck with it needless to say there is a lot of snapping bones and compound fracture complete with overdone sound effects and gore in another awesome scene a woman has her entire ribcage torn out while attached to a metal apparatusso yeah generally id say if you love gore check it out if youre looking for a good puzzle film try to sit through it till the end if you have a strong stomach and are looking for something scary for halloween check it out although certainly not as scary or intense as the departed it has a couple edge of your seat moments that should get you good check it outrated r for strong grisly violence and gore sequences of terror and torture nudity and language,cruel
what is about is revenge a father who is consumed by nothing else and only seeks out to get it plays by the rules and promises freedom when you win the game its a great movie and helps fill in the holes from previous saw movies its well acted well shot the suffering and screaming is frightening i wouldnt want to endure any of the games but i understand why its a franchise of horror violence that justifys the direction throughout i never saw the twist at the end and like the other saw movies its just as memorable get sucked in get involved with the people you see on the screen and understand why does what he does,cruel
an unrelenting assault on the viewers senses for 90 minutes does rate as something horrific yet one becomes numb and disinterested especially in the lack of the tempo all fast  no emotional modality no connections to the outside world the whole story is so insular that it neglects to connect with the audience and fails to set up an alternative world that the viewer is welcomed into and finds inviting in short what this movie lacks is imagination and a storyline it hath no substance  the nonstop shock card is played all too often by those lacking of true talent in contrast setup of the true horror films such as the italian giallo  dario argento lucio fulcio mario bava and the modern american horror slasher with backstory represented by john carpenter and don coscarelli evoke a more authentic response of terror  such as a simple scene from phantasm when the tall man says you play a good game boy is far more menacing terrifying and enigmatic than any line of dialog from any saw movie especially the latest installment in fact in the psychological element of torture is merely a poorly worded treatise relying upon convention and boiled down philosophy it lightly touches on the psychological but never the metaphysical it is a selfabsorbed exercise at best so a 610 for doing torture for no rhyme or reason for 90 minutes straight at best the movie is a representation of worthlessness which brings to mind sartres much more profound philosophical novel nausea  which deals with the metaphysical problem of worthlessness in an erudite enlightening manner to see a film that truly deals with sadism torture and mans inhumanity to man i recommend michael reeves masterpiece the witchfinder general check it out tho its not available on dvd in the usa only videotape i recommend the uk dvd,cruel
this is probably the nastiest of the nowfamous saw trilogy perfect for gore fans and just in time for holloween 06while the first saw was a nice experimentation on the torturehorror genre to see what would happen and the second was a dip trip on a few more extreme little puzzles and traps with a iffy story written in there the third took all the experience learned from the previous two and ended the series with a bangand amanda are back of course and they decide to kidnap a doctor who diagnosed the now ill brain cancer victim jign a race against time to try and save his life single handedly with the coolest open brain surgery performed on the silver screenwith power tools on the other end of the story a man named jeff is the new victim in puzzles who tries to solve them to get to the man who killed his son in a freak accidentthe signature plot twists are still as good as they were in  ii youll still be surprised and pretty wowd by the finale plus there are references to the previous films to intertwine the story developing and explaining certain events and characters while its at itso if you liked the previous two saws then do yourself a favor and check this one out with friends and im not kidding when i said this is gorier and nastier than the others hell it can be downright inhuman sometimes the graphic nature takes out anything thats been in the theaters before including hostel and se7en,cruel
is boring and forgettable garbage even its gore scenes are nothing to write home about none of the traps are memorable the only thing about the movie i expect ill remember is the stupid irritating voice of the bad guyof course they had to show us the real face of the man behind with his stupid voice im surprised the police ever had a hard time finding the guy hell he even looks like a killer how stupid are the people who make these movies how much scarier would it have been if they had chosen the last person you would ever expect to be behind such a thing like a young man who works in a supermarket or an elderly woman no instead they choose some character actor who has spent his life perfecting the look and facial expression of a killer from the imagination of an idiotthe movie sort of has a main character in some guy whos angry because his kid died and gives him the opportunity to take revenge the movie doesnt tell his story strongly enough and theres too much other garbage muddling it all up at least the first movie in the series didnt have that problem so what were they thinking this time aroundbut who cares right the movie is about elaborate gruesome traps and gore its just too bad they all suck this time around,cruel
i have read a few of the really bad reviews and i really wondered why some of these people even bothered to watch any of the saw movies to begin with did they not know what they bought a ticket for or did they come in it by accident while on cable and have a heat attack at the first sight of blood shedby the time the third movie comes along the series has pretty much figured out what it wants to be jigs dying and has found a protg the two of them set up two parallel traps the first is for a grieving man who blames the world for the death of his young son the second is for a doctor who is charged with keeping alive or her own life is forfeitwhat i really like about this series is that although it is bloody and gory you still do have to pay attention to what is going on and being said the gore might be front and center but it is often a misdirect to what is actually going onsomeone is playing a gameyou are never quite sure on who,cruel
the first saw film was an excellent grizzly thriller and the first two sequels were surprisingly good even though they were taken over by another director darren lynn bousman i think what i liked most about these sequels is that the director was willing to kill off many main characters from the earlier films this sequel also benefits from james wan and leigh whannell the writers of the original film returning to write the film this time tobin bell dying in a hospital bed but with the help of shawnee smith is still able to carry out his games kidnapping a doctor whos son was killed in a hitandrun accident and putting him through a series of gameschoicessituations where he can exact his revenge on those responsible the first saw film was unfairly written off as torture porn when its really a terrific suspense thriller that happens to be excruciatingly gory however the subsequent sequels this one included are the typification of the torture porn genre which is either a good or bad thing depending upon your feelings of the horror sub genre as films of this disreputable genre go is nowhere close to being as good as martyrs or hostel but is far better than the worst of the genre ie turistas or the i spit on your grave remake donnie wahlberg dina meyer and betsy russell also appear in the film and composer charlie clouser returns to provide another effectively unsettling score,cruel
i loved first movie i am aware that sequels are often worse than original but i expected them to stick to formula that worked so well in first movie so even if sequels have no quality they would at least be fun i saw second saw that pretty much keep up with first one and i could not wait to see more i never expected such unpleasant surprise i knew this franchise will in time most probably lose some of its awesomeness but such drastic drop in quality between two contiguous movies really surprised me is not so bad by itself but in comparison with first two this is complete catastrophe first it is boring few scenes twist stomach pretty successfully but to achieve that effect one does not need much skill tension suspension and fear are nowhere to be found second this movie insults my intelligence unlike in prequels story is completely linear boring and predictable and in addition to that its full of holes and illogicality characters and their actions are unconvincing especially jeff he lost so much time in every room for no obvious reason if himself was threatened in any way i could understand his hesitation but he was not i have no nerves to get into the details cause it would take to long further flashbacks are lousy and have no purpose in story for those who saw previous two films they just make this one more boring and unnecessarily stretch it to almost two hours last and the biggest disappointment was the end regardless of your taste and opinion about first two saw movies one thing you have to acknowledge and its genius mindfak twist that ends them both here they could not make effort even to achieve that ending is totally predictable i knew how it will end but i hoped that movie made me think that on purpose so they could make even bigger surprise when it ends differently but that did not happen it ended just as i suspected and i felt deprived movie ends in manner of lowbudget gore horrors in those its not a flaw cause they do not pretend to be more than they are  movies based on disgusting scenes that do not need intelligent plot to achieve their purpose but in saw franchise that present itself as intelligent mystery thriller this is unforgivable first hour i was bored but hoping that it will get better in time during second half i was just sad and had to force myself not to give up before the end510,cruel
brings back the killer this time so weak that he has to kidnap a doctor to keep him alive while his obsessed assistant prepares a final game with a man who lost everything when his son got killed during a car accident and seeks revenge for itunfortunately this part is not nearly as good as the first two have been it is still a solid movie dont get me wrong but it feels a bit like the producers are desperately trying to bring in elements of surprise which doesnt work out as well as it did before instead there are several backflashs that make it sometimes hard to keep up with the story and the stringency that was a centerpiece of the first two parts goes missing at least partly what you get is still a dark and sinister thriller that keeps you entertained but it sometimes tries to hard to be a saw movieall in all you do nothing wrong by giving this a try but you should know that you cant expect something as carefully balanced as the other parts of the series,cruel
the overall film was amazing to watch particularly the operation scene where they open up head to relieve pressure to his brain the drilling is particularly creepy and hurt my ears too a bit too loud for me but then again i t in the cinema anyway the overall film is great and feels like the first saw but more elaborate the only flaw if you can call it a flaw in it would have to be dying not his actual death but the fact jeff tries to save everyone but when it comes to he cant let go of the fact he voilated his wife and yet all this pent up anger of the jury etc seems to rub off like nothingeventually the best twist in the film was that adam didnt die of starvation but was actually killed by amanda she put a bag over his head overall i would have to say that this film isnt as bad as a lot of people have said not naming anyone like and i genually cant believe that people went to the cinema to see when they hadnt seen the other two its a film purely for the fans,cruel
i was a giant fan of the original saw film which i feel crosses a lot of lines when it came to genre most would classify it as a horror film while others would call it a psychologicalthriller and others would merely call it a splattermovie i think it covered all these categories making it fresh and original in terms of modern thrillerstried very hard to be a more psychological film but in my opinion fell short though it did deliver the gore it promised and was still an over all fun movienow is out the third and presumably final saw film it dabbles slightly in the psychological side of the characters but only enough to justify the films true purpose blood and lots of it it seems the filmmakers darren lynn bousman director and james wan and leigh whannell writers have embraced the gorefest aspect of the first two films full on this timethe story goes something like this the brutal man who tests his victims will to survive is finally dying his new apprentice amanda has kidnapped a young nurse to keep him alive if she can keep him alive long enough she will be let goat the same time a man in constant mourning after the death of his son is being tested as well he can chose to let those indirectly responsible live or die and each step brings him closer to the man who actually killed his sonthese parallel story lines both work as one unit being intertwined by amanda and the nurse must keep alive until the man seeks his final vengeance or forgiveness of his sons killerhowever i wish the storyline involving the man and his dead son was a whole movie on its own it works as is but would be more powerful as its own standalone filmoverall though the film delivers what it promises and is a worthy conclusion to the saw trilogy,cruel
there will be a saw 4 and will be in itmathews and drgordon are both still alive the same writers and directors will be returning this was confirmed to me via an ihssaw 4 will clear up all the questions about mathews obi adam amanda  who is dead tobin bell will return and play his part as adam really had a task the only way he could have lived would be to get the key out of the bath but as we see he lost the key in the very first seconds of the game the saw was only meant for adam that was his way out killing adam was dr gordons rest off yea it was great when dr gordon snapped you could see he had finally had enough and needed to do anything to get out to help his family adam had no such urgency so he didnt saw his foot off neither of the 2 had urgency to save themselves but gordon did for his familyand yea was drugged thats how he was motionless all that time as for the electrocution the first one was done by zepp when he was watching on the monitors that were inside the mirror but the second time he electrocuted adam himself when he tried to shoot him adam was out of bullets anywayi think the situation was lose lose for adam because ether way he would die if he saw his foot off zepp would have had to kill him and gordon after the time limit or was it just gordon only seen it the once so i cant quite remember but if gordon shot adam zepp would have had to let him go to get the antidote for the posion from jigm sure if they both cut their foots off they could have jumped zepp when he came in to kill them and tried to escape but we will never know sucks about the key going down the bath plug hole thoughim guessing you havent seen yet thats more gory than and 2 put together,cruel
maybe its just me but the horror genre has no real artistic merit the only horror films that matter are rosemarys baby rosemarys baby rosemarys baby night of the living dead psycho the exorcist halloween and even evil dead not the other two it became a parody of itself like the other long winded franchises otherwise than that how could anyone feel confident about the american cinema today after seeing garbage like this i certainly cant as just like its predecessors possibly the two worst films ever made takes the title as worst film of 2006the reason why the saw franchise is considered great by the fans that believe in it because there is essentially no difficult content theres blood guts and gore right in your face plastic dialogue screaming yelling and predictable plot twists explained at the end of the movie instead of having the viewer feel free to interpret things on his or her own this is the sad status of mainstream hollywood today the executives notice a trend and exploit it the horror genre was never good to begin with from its inception unlike the comedy genre which was very intelligent in the beginning but now we get films such as employee of the month with that jackass dane cook an interesting film genre was exploited by the studios many years ago sure they were in it for the money but one little movie caused an uproar it was called citizen kane and it was a major player not the only one that kicked off the film noir genre while film noir was not the most uplifting of genres it had different narratives was cleverly written see no further than the maltese falcon or sunset blvd and effectively reflected the mood of the times so i suppose the pointlessly bloody gorefest flicks with possessed children and stupid puppets in videos serves as expressionism of peoples frustrations over americas status in the world no absolutely not what 14 year old kid is going to think about this stuff when seeing the only thing i was thinking about was how much money i wasted over seeing this crap i could have seen a relatively unknown picture with a lot of critical buzz such as brick or good mainstream fare the departed even though it has the pretty faces of dicaprio and damon presentthe sad thing is that will be so much of a rousing box office success this weekend that studio execs will be pressuring for a forth one but real film fans know full well that 2 sequels to the original were definitely unnecessarythe only things that uplifted my spirits after seeing was that i will not have to see it again because it was so bad borat comes out next week and that i went home and watched a real work of cinematic art entitled the 400 blows by francois truffaut if you think teaches a valuable lesson to ungrateful people by torturing them francois truffaut teaches a lesson 10000000000 times more worth the value you dont want to be a punk kid wandering the streets of france without parents who dont love yousee that instead or any foreign film for that matter instead of i,cruel
in this movie however great the end twist usually associated with saw movies is does not even begin to justify the means the movies gore level in the first ten minutes far exceeds that of the first two movies combined in the previous saw movies spoiler for and 2 the endings were by no means happy endings but spoiler for this movies ending is so terrible that it left no room for thought like the others had now that is my personal opinion and by giving you no specific details i will let you formulate your own opinion when you go see the movie in other words me saying that it is gory and that it doesnt have a great plot arent spoilers thats why i dont have standard spoiler warnings but rather my own because this in my opinion is the best review done by a proclaimed saw fan if you havent seen the first two saw movies and you arent going into the theater with high and biased because of the other two expectations then you might think that the movie is okay but you wouldnt understand some of the things that are going on as they relate directly to the first two moviesas a big saw fan this movie was a tremendous letdown like i said though if i hadnt had such high hopes and if i hadnt been waiting so long then the utter terribleness of this movie wouldnt have been such a bad thing,cruel
first off i was never a fan of the saw series i found them to be just another clich dumb horror movie when came out this friday all of my friends voted on going to see while i wanted to go watch the prestige i hated the movie from the very start with the over use of language that is so unnecessary that goes for all the saw movies i then only last 15 minutes and left the theater for home my girlfriend was on the verge of fainting and was in a cold sweat and she turned her had and didnt see half of the gore i came to realize that our society is messed up beyond belief when masses file in to watch fellow human beings be torn apart when i ask people about the saw movies what is so good about them they all answer with how gory and cool it was personally i am disgusted by this film and wouldnt watch it if it was the last movie on earth that means id take ultraviolet or godzilla over this movie any day among the blood and guts there may be a story but no matter if its good or not its not worth the 98 of the movie which is figuring out how we can best kill someone pathetic,cruel
im a fan of the first saw movie it was really an intelligent thrilling and interesting movie then came it wasnt really good but it was a little bit entertaining but then i saw at the preview and i nearly fell asleep it was so awful the story is so artificial andm unrealistic that it hurts games are now really stupid and bad planned and theres no real context the actors without are also chosen very well d all in all its hard to believe that james wang made this third movie of saw he made the 1st and it was great he didnt make and this movie failed and now he made and he didnt fail he rocked the bottommy advise save ur money and watch the only real saw movie,cruel
if youre a fan of the first two movies this is more of the same and you dont need to read this just go see the movie if you didnt like the first two films this is more of the same and you dont need to see the filmmore of the same from a serial killer who wants people to experience lifesay what you will the filmmakers know how to make a great looking grotesque film the images from this film absolutely are stunning as are their designs for the weapons of small scale destruction i love the look of the filmwhat i dont like is the films mindless cruelty people are abused in the nastiest way possible there is no reasoning behind it just cruelty like when the condemned were fed to the wild animals in the roman arena while i will admit its well done i hate that there is nothing behind it the murders have become like the films that made up the spate of slasher films from the late 1970s and early 1980s which degenerated into clever ways to die with nothing to hold them togetherworse is the films lack of logic never mind that has expired any number of times how do this very elaborate death traps get made and built and attached to unsuspecting people in such short notice it makes no sense i know its not suppose to but there should be an internal logic to it all and any hope of that ended with the first filmthis wont matter to any fans who are looking for the cool ways to die i leave the film to the fans im going to go read a good book marquis de sade anyone,cruel
while i liked and havent seen is just so so it has a new story but it also interweaves an explanation of what happens behind the scenes of the good thing is that this movie is gory and has some full frontal nudity the bad things is that there is no character to care or root for and that dina meyer who is reunited with costas mandylor after their excellent but shortlived secret agent man tv show gets only a short tertiary role the main problem with this movie is that the character is neither scarythe mask is stupid nor likable in a twisted sort of way in the way one would like jason in the first saw his philosophizing about life and pain is quite interesting here its not its the same stuff you dont appreciate such and such pain this or that its your choice bla bla hes supposed to be a new pinhead but pinheads thoughts on pleasure and pain were actually memorable in we find a guy trapped who we are told is suffering due to the accidental death of his son and now he is bitter and vengeful his life is shown in photographic flahsbacks so we dont really care much about him hes on some sort of scavenger hunt designed by that takes him to different peopleinatrap scenes the traps are somewhere interesting but again that story line is not really emphasized the main story line is a dying john trying to get himself cured this movie is awefully long i could swear it was nearly 2 hours long its too loud as well a means filmmakers use to keep you from falling asleep every step someone takes sounds like the whole theater is going to come crashing down as is typical for bad scriptwriting the whole thing is supposed to unravel in the last five minutes everything is explained of sorts not just what happens here but also what happened in frankly by then i just dont care while the twist is alright the story line of the trapped guy is not given enough character depth everything is just too convoluted and we are expected to believe that jigs omniscient omnipotent and omnipresent for his plans to work out and they always do so many factors have to go his way its just absurd and when you think its over guess what he knew that too and that was part of his plan personally im not a fan of tobin bell and shawnee smith the main actors here they are good secondtier actors but they cant carry a movie this series has potential but someone else needs to be and the stories need to be less convoluted,cruel
well after watching it certainly was a good film so i was excited to see then i watched which in my opinion was brilliant beating so my hopes once again raised i finally got to see last night but sadly i have to say i wasnt to impressed first of all lets get one thing out of the way on gore factor this film most definitely tops the other 2 for goriness and gross visual effects so if you like those sorts of films this one is definitely a must see however for actual plot and content unlike the other 2 films this one seems to be running thin it does have a plot to some extent but the actual content in the film seems a little rushed and although it does make sense seems to lack what the other 2 did so well the acting was to a fairly good standard but shawnee smith amanda definitely takes the best performance for this film al in all its not a bad film i would still suggest watching it but for those who have high hopes from the other two movies i feel that the majority of you will be disappointed,cruel
no spoilersi just got back from a midnight screening of the most anticipated movie of the year and i was not disappointed this one will change how you see the other films foreverbousman was right this film puts hostel to shame gorier much gorier than both saws put together and the plot is mouah very interesting and deep way deeper than or iii did though see a perfect ending at one point in the movie and it was suddenly removed from my eyes a tad angry bout that but i accept it none the less very sawish indeed i guess i must remember that is a horror movie after all but man so close to perfect,cruel
i have racked my brain to see what limits i can put on my sadness and disgust at this saw franchise so far i have made it through 1 2 and the vile 3 these films are a celebration of hatred and mutilation presented to 20 year olds to develop their taste for pitiless violence towards distressed victims as graphic as pornography and as pulverizing as a steelmill these films are made to traumatize and then promise the spectacle of victim violence mixed with humiliation irrationality and plain viciousness it makes a recipe for some sort of corporate mind destruction towards young people who have not had much experience in humanity so these films are designed to pour acid onto their young optimistic minds to vandalize the senses and to entertain criminals and develop a taste for inhuman destruction of the human body as a fun experience it also saddens me greatly that the original films were created by immature australian boys who were seized upon by the american corporate machine that specializes in making sure these vicious pitiless traumatic exercises in evil reach the widest audience possible these films are designed to show you hatred to make a spectacle of the hatred and for you and your kids to enjoy watching the hatred the relentless destruction of the human form pantomiming as scary fun is probably the biggest most insidious evil permeating our culture hooray for hollywood as it is from there that this emanates no other country exports so much visual hatred as america no wonder less and less people go to the cinemas seeing other humans screaming in pain begging for their lives and dying in agony from mutilating wounds is so very sad in any film for it to become a horror genre is an absolute tragedy and a massive challenge in this early part of a bright new century this section of what was an exciting vibrant film industry was once applauded for cinema verite now it is to be condemned for what has mutated into cinema cruelite there is nowhere for these torture chamber films to go unless baby beating is forthcoming eli roth sounds spossible,cruel
was a great and surprising movie a socalled sleeper a sequel was unavoidable the reviews were not great but i thought it was a great movie with good acting and scary gore although the story seemed a lot like the cube franchise rounds it all up it goes over the top when it comes to gore but there are a lot of surprising twists the cast is once again great and the story gets you and wont let go for a second the saw trilogy is without a doubt one of my favorite horrorfranchises of the last few years i know they already have filmed part iv and even v and possibly a sixth for the near future i have very mixed feelings about this because the story is really over after the third one it usually doesnt get better remember the hellraiserfranchise  everything after part iii should be sent straight back to hell but back to earth ii is a great and entertaining trilogy no one should miss sometimes a little sadistic like hostel but few movies get under your skin like this one and everyone is in for a good scare now and then,cruel
was for me much better than i think that i even liked it more than the first one if you re looking for a gory and suspenseful movie with an unbelievable plot you should go see it has the best torture scenes by far out of the three saw movies it will keep you thinking about the movie for days and maybe even weeks after you see the movie also explains many unanswered questions from the first and second movies i absolutely loved and the other saw movies and i think that if you have seen the other saw movies and liked them you should definitely see also because saw 4 was announced and from reading the plot summary of it saw 4 seems that much of the movie is based on so if you plan on watching saw 4 it is probably very important to see to understand it nobody should go without seeing it blew my mind with all the twists and turns i hope that you rent it,cruel
what the hell were these guys trying to do when they made this movie they are entirely sick and sadistic never mind how clever they are i liked very much but for gods sake these guys dont know the difference between terror horror and gore seeing a trephine done with elementary tools or a man drowned in pig juice or a throat cut by a s not horrorits simply disgusting if you want gore and shock then any clip from iraq showing the real slaughtering of a prisoner can do better the makeup guys did everything possible to prove they earned their buck and they did it well my impression is that they made this film as a catalogue documentary for what they can do so they can make contracts with other production companies the thrills are childish like a school kid trying to scare the hell out of the chicks by eating frogs or removing his decayed tooth in front of them this is disgusting it ought to bring some screams  but this is not cinema this is not horror we used to think lucio fulci was sick now we know he was a romantic film maker apart from that i cant accept this plot anymore i cant believe 2 persons are able to design all these satanic demonic shows this would have taken an army of technicians the only good thing about this movie is shawnee smith she scared the hell out of me and everything about her acting was legendary as usualyou can never believe shes not really insane her eyes were scary her skin was scary her voice was scary this lady is the most gifted and most underrated actress in cine business today,cruel
ok i am one of those few that did not like the film that much and i can hardly understand why people find such good filmfirst of all throughout the movie i kept asking myself how one that is obviously in a very bad condition the killer has the power wit logistics money to come up with all the mechanic torture deviceshow is he or armanda able to get the victims where they are where the hell does all this take place without being noticed by authorities  the killer is no stranger to the police rightlack of logic everywhere my mind confronted me with a lot of questions all the time and that took away a lot of entertainmentsawi had a lot of elements it had gore suspense policeinvestigation hope despair all of which were put together with excellence it worked on a lot of levelslacks almost everything except the gore i dont like when i get the impression that the lack of plotideas is compensated with gorescenes that make you cringethere was almost no investigationscenery going on it was focused basically on one theme  the torturedespair of the victims i find this to be a bit onedimensionalhowever and maybe that was simply the intention it was hard to watch the whole thing i did feel uncomfortable and i was not in a good mood after wards it had a moving finale but more because i felt very sorry for the two maincharacters instead of being surprised by some awesome endingclue ok there was something greater going on with armanda but that did not convince mehad the most striking final seconds a film can havethe ending of is just terrible sad and dramalikei did find the film to be entertaining because of my latent voyeurism  watching people die is one reason we watch horror but if it is reduced to this one basic concept it does not succeed to fully entertain mesince v is already planned even sawv i wonder what sense this makes the concept is pretty much dead and the ending of somewhat makes it hard to continue the storysorry guys this was a disappointment however if you enjoy watching people die by sick torturedevices this is for you if you want an interesting story on top of it i guess you should look elsewhereoh yes i apologize for my somewhat strange english,cruel
 amazing and original  wow for once a movie is just as good or better than the original  wtf extremely disappointed the whole plot was screwed up the doctor was 3 breaths from dying in eaten up with cancer now all of a sudden you spend 50 minutes leading up to some stupid operation thats only going to prolong the life of the doctor another what 2 hours plus youve got this guy jeff that no one cares about and were not sure if were supposed to be rooting for him or what going through these tests but he passes them all quite easily in the first 2 saw movies you were with the poor saps going through these tests and horrified with them but jeff just quietly bumbles through them leads up finally to the guy who ended up hitting his son with a car all about vengeance and all that crap then the whole intern which was awesome in starts getting all emotional and stupid in this movie was such a waste flashbacks meant nothing they probably filmed the scenes while doing and wahlberg realized what a crappy script was and he bailed so to make some kind of transition seem to fit in they threw in some flashbackdeleted scenes reel from showing wahlberg trying to escapei was really surprised when i t was the same writers from and i figured this was some new intern writer or something working on this one very disappointed,cruel
the first film was compelling and highly original the second was below par and forgettable this third entry is among the most repulsive ive ever watched its relentless gloating in glorious closeup on pain and flesh ripping is positively insulting ive yet to catch up with several recent horror titles but theres no clearer indication than this of how low the genre has sunk  it has literally gone down the drain the plot itself is mildly intriguing and even features a nice final twist  but the films parade of gore creative torture devices god only knows where the moribund avenger picks up the various parts not to mention the energy to build them and selfpitying characters makes for unintentional hilarity all the way through,cruel
the first saw was let down by mediocre acting and a ridiculous ending i know i have seen the second saw but it was a totally forgettable experience and i can only vaguely remember the odd scene the third instalment terrible there is no characterisation at all you cannot care for the characters are they are all less than two dimensional the plot is basically an excuse for one gore scene after another but it has no impact as you do not care for any of the characters i am a big horror film fan but this is just utter rubbish this was a complete waste of my time and it was also far too long please dont let them make a fourth one,cruel
when saw was released people even mentioned that it was the one to beat se7en in this style of films and while in the same style as se7en suspense action dead bodies high violence and mystery it was a very original film with good acting and intense story full of twiststhis is a good sequel but has some problems of wrong choices the story is as smart as the ones from previous films but the way its told doesnt work well it seems they wanted to get to the tension scenes and the games right from the start of the film problem is that by doing so there was no presentation of jeff angus macfadyen and his life outside the game while previous films always showed us something to feel for and understand the main character by doing this its hard to understand or at least accept the fathers reactions over the people trapped we have not enough background information about why he acts this way or at least to know that he acts this way people in traps have no development at all and are only in the film for the gore fest in the other saw films the traps were made so people could learn their lesson not only to kill innocent people the important thing about character development is not to remember names but the actions they take why and the changes they go trough the whole film and though the father had really bad development amanda and dr lynn denlon are great characters and very well developed trough the whole film as you get to know them more though we dont get to know more about him is as good as in the second sawother bad choice is the amount of gore in this sequel though a lot of fans like it they are the fans who never really liked the film for what it was meant to be a good story with violence not lots of violence with story there is so much gore that you actually stop felling tense during this scenes and ii kept you watching those sequences because of all the tension not the gore while in the previous ones you would be as tense nervous and desperate as the characters in this one you might even start telling yourself good makeup effects and wont get involved with the scene the gore in the first and second was only shown when importantthe story is actually good and follow the previous events very well and the acting is on the same level as in and ii one problem with its story is the ending though its full of twists and as good as the other endings it is too unhappy even compared to endings there is not enough hope in this film during the whole film and in the end while in the other films you feel like wanting to watch the next one this one makes you feel bad and wanting to get out of the cinema as fast as you can because you feel like the characters have no reason to go onthey tried to push the film to the next level but unfortunately theyve chosen the wrong things to push the gore fest feels like loss of originality since we have films like hostel which brought back the senseless gore to the screen the traps are a lot more complex but lost their meaning characters are not the most important piece in this one and the story though not worse then the intelligent stories of was not pushed to the next level as we hoped it would,cruel
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning after taking care of two random victims tobin bell goes in for the kill and traps jeff angus macfadyen a man in a deep state of grief after losing his son in a drink driving accident he sets him a series of challenges to save the lives of those caught up in his sons death including a female driver who failed to stop and help the judge who gave the killer a pathetic sentence and finally the killer himself to test his resolve and to stop him languishing in a state of veangefulness meanwhile he also takes jeffs wife lynn bahar soometh a brash doctor who pushes everyone away from her to operate on the tumour that is killing him with the help of amanda shawnee smith his former victimall three of the saw movies have seemed to pride themselves more on delivering stomachchurning gore than genuine scares and theyve reached a crescendo with a truly nasty piece of work that reportedly had paramedics being called in to deal with fainting cinemagoers who couldnt handle the movies sheer level of blood and gore theres plenty of morbidly imaginative hellraiser style death scenes on display that see some characters die some of the grusomest deaths imaginable check out the terrifying looking thing the drunk driver is attached to at the end and the torture he is made to endure but its actually the most realistic gory scene that proves the hardest to stomach where a drill is used to go into skull and operate on his brain somehow seeing the real sort of thing is even nastier than the most unpleasant death device the screenwriters could dream upplot wise the movies pretty defunct we open with two murders that bear no relevance to the story thats about to unfold which basically consists of moving from one gory setpiece to another in a none stop attempt to turn the stomachs of the viewers as much as possible there seems to be some ridiculous rhyme and reason to motives wherein a sadistic killer tries to make a man feeling justifiable anger and vengeance get his humanity back as well as trying to get people to appreciate life by making them crawl and scream for it theres some fairly good acting on display though macfadyen raw and determined as the tragic antihero as well as bells calm rationalizing psychopath but unlikely as it seems one just hopes this is the last of the odious saw movies before the series gets the chance to get anymore morally adventurous ,cruel
was one of the best horror movies and sequel ive seen in years its bloody gory and very clever this film was worth my 800 and i have already seen it twice cant wait for saw 4 oct 2007 check this sequel out movie rocks big time the movie starts off with a bang and ends with a bang kind of reminds me of pinhead when he talks this sequel picks up where 2 left off and amanda are back and this time the traps are more deadlier jigs dying of cancer and amanda kidnaps a doctor to relie on her to operate and save life she is part of a game that invloves another victim who is playing a game he must face his fears and demons to win the game or die with the rest and in the end death commith for the all who will walk freely or in piecies,cruel
i was so upset with this movie i absolutely love saw and and i expected all the best for i couldnt wait to see the 3rd movie and i t on its opening week the beginning was terrible and i wanted to leave right away i stayed because of my loyalty to the first to movies i thought the beginning was like a catch or whatever to get the audience pumped but oh no it got worse much worse this movie was nothing like the first 2 i have them on dvd and i watch them all the time i doubt that i will ever see again this was a complete torture movie and it was to hard to watch i liked it better when was the only master mind instead of amanda she had some nasty games and the worse movie yet,cruel
i went to see last night and my mind is still boggling at the amount of twists and turns the movie crammed in yet again what an absolutely brilliant film i didnt see how they could make it work but they pulled it off in perfect saw style the traps were excellent yet again the acting was top notch and the storyline was brilliant it explained the previous films to a fuller extent and the story easily equalled the previous 2 i loved it and as did the previous 2 films it left me longing for more i am pleased to hear about saw 4 although i am worried about overkill and the fact the writers and directors are changing it is obviously for profit purposes and the story could suffer as a result as could the credibility but if they do match it then this is going to be the first line of films that actually retains some dignity after going beyond 3 films i hope that it is not a prequel as has already explained his reasoning for doing what he does and i dont feel the need to elaborate on that i also hope it does not ruin the saw franchise and it ends up with the respect it deserves as an entertaining gripping exciting and twistfilled set of films that fitted perfectly,cruel
after listening to the bitching and moaning exhibitors put on about how films are making less this year than last year one has to wonder who is in charge there proves a few things not least of which is that spending two hundred million dollars to make a film is unnecessary there is also a claim made by studios that a film has to be aimed to please everyone in order to make back its money also turns that claim right on its ear is indeed the first horror film and indeed only the second film period i have seen this year that could solidly be labelled as being for adults and it grossed back its production budget three times over in one week why hollywood does not take a cue from this is beyond me and it seems to be beyond hollywood too although reception among critics and fans is sharply divided is also easily the most intelligent and philosophical of the series to date although most people will miss the fact it has quite a lot to say about our ability to confuse justice with revengeat heart the saw films are about people undergoing tests where distinguishes itself from its predecessors is that the tests are no longer about survival the penalties for failure are still fatal but the tests are a little deeper than those of the mere will to live and everyone save for the ringmaster that is jigs being tested viewers who wondered what kind of apprentice amanda would make after will be shocked and satisfied in contrast to however the plot does not revolve around a group of individuals arguing with one another jigs less in control of his games this time leaving us with less cryptic yet exceedingly obvious clues to laugh at yet there is nothing he has failed to think out in advance with every angle and variation accounted for in another life he could have been a championship chess player however one loose end remains for him that of who will succeed him when the tumor that caused his epiphany in the first place finally gets the better of himshawnee smith and tobin bell are literally on fire in this film smith plays an emotional wreck so convincingly it makes one wonder what she had been up to in the time she had seemed to disappear from the media anyone who doubts her acting chops will be floored as she acts out the consequences of amanda failing to realise that she is being tested the big drama of is that jigs now so frail that he can no longer set up his games unaided and thus amanda carries out most of the work for him kerry the detective from the other two films investigates the latest of the killings she suspects something is afoul when she deduces that this trap was impossible to escape from fans of the first two films will remember that jigs all about playing by the rules or at least being consistent with the rules he sets i do not believe it is giving much away to say that amanda has been playing a little game of her own in between carrying out wishes and that jigs not terribly impressed by thiswoven into the story is the test of a man whose son was killed in a car accident and forgotten by the justice system in most hollywood films this would dissolve into a comment about how liberal our justice system is not so in in places his victim on a path to confront the people most directly involved both in the sons death and the minimal punishment the offender received his challenge is to overcome his hatred of these people for long enough to be able to save each individual from some of the most ludicrously cruel contraptions seen in the series of course it would not be a saw film if people did not die in ironic ways but the change here to leave the lives of several participants in the hands of another is exactly what is needed after familiarity with the standard scenario had been enforced by the other two films the most peculiar variation on the original scenario comes from the fact that knows his death is imminent and he delights in weaving that fact into the tests he sets those around himin case i have not made it clear enough credit is due to the creativity of the filmmakers robert rodriguez has said in at least two audio commentaries that once you turn on the money hose to wash away creative problems you cannot turn it off again every dollar of the twelve million spent on filming was used to much greater effect than a lot of films that spend ten times that amount having seen the insides of my own arms and one of my feet i can say without hesitation that in contrast to almost every other effect in horror films the removal of a fragment of skull made me ill special effects is meant to be an art of fooling people to believe they are looking at something they are not and is one of the few feature films of recent years to accomplish this i am sure a neurosurgeon or effects artist would be able to point out flaws in the scene other than the varying mark indicating drilling depth but this scene alone is enough to put the fear of mortality into even the most jaded viewer rarely do i walk out of a theatre feeling this satisfiedi gave a ten out of ten if you are like me and prefer your horror uncompromisingly brutal then it is essential viewing,cruel
nothing as in a blackness a depravity a hole into which maladjusted deviants masturbate their crippled humanity into twisted shapes of deathviolence has its place in cinema in places it makes a film kill bill dawn of the dead irreversible all those films and their genres benefit from a bit of blood but its blood with artistry those zombies didnt die in vain the crazy 88 gang were slaughtered and we cared but in i just didnt care not one bit i just sat wondering where can filmic violence can go now mainstream cinema can show wound shots and other graphic horrendous violence where does it go next i wondered whether the main protagonist women would have sex with the people she was killing it might have raised an eyebrow or made me think i should raise an eyebrow because in actuality i didnt care and you shouldnt crosses the line but you shouldnt care to watch it its a dreadful film people have been throwing up and passing out all in cinemas across the uk in vain you come out feeling violated but its all for nothing because its no badge of honour that youve seen it is a poor excuse for cinema its strange ive never felt bored and violated at the same time but that sums up my experienceit doesnt even tie up the series theres another one to endure the first two had compelling enough plot lines this was sadly lackingwill there be a plot in the next film or just go for the shock effect perhaps killing some children or sexually abusing them  dull incoherent toss,cruel

i have never been so excited about a movie coming out until and it didnt disappointthis film in my opinion was amazing and is up there with the best films i have ever seen and believe me i have seen a fair few it grips you from the start and this is the first movie in which i actually had to turn away in parts because of the level of gore that was shownin my opinion this movie was better than and put together and is the first 3rd movie that i know of that has been better than the firsti loved this movie from start to finish and the cleverness of the twists is overwhelmingin sum go and see this film it is absolutely amazing,cruel
i loved okay it was a little more gory than i would have liked my head was turned every three minutes but it was an excellent movie i had high expectations for this movie and they certainly were met it certainly surprised me because it wasnt what i was expecting at all i knew it would be good but it really took me by surprise the traps were awesome i liked these traps better than the traps in the previous two movies the saw movies have brilliant writers and brilliantly talented actors i love the way everything is so brilliantly thought out in each movie all three of the movies definitely go on my top ten go see it,cruel
what more can i say that hasnt already been said is one amazing movie all the saw movies are this one comes close to being the best one though i think the first is still my favorite still usually sequels stink after the second one delivers with more traps more twists explanations of the first two and definitely more gore i have seen every horror movie under the sun gore has never bothered me and i have watched horror movies since i was a young child almost made me feel like puking it is very gory you must have a strong stomach and a love for these kinds of films to sit through it and keep your eyes on the screen in the end i cant imagine saw fans not liking this movie it does not get any better than this in my opinion is one of the best horror movies in the past 20 years enjoy,cruel
if you loved saw and liked then youll find this latest and hopefully last instalment very disappointing theres plenty of blood gore and turn away from the screen moments but its just boring theres no anticipation no tension and no care taken with this film the characters are dull witch might not have been a problem had the filmmakers not tried so hard to make them the point of the instalment this was supposed to be the one where they inject some soul and meaning into the killings and the lessons and all the rest of it just keep it simple we get it the serial killer is some kind of morale inducer thats not why we came to see the movie we came to see the film where plot revolves around strands of a what would you do situation with dire consequences this long drawn out story needs changing what was so great about the first film was the mystery behind the killer and the twist at the end with this film we know whats going to happen we know the killer and the twists are there for the sake of having twists when we really dont care what happens anyway it should have stayed as a lone standing film and now its ruinedhollywood has track record of destroying good pieces of work what started out as a small independent movie which came out of nowhere is now a moneymaking franchise not concerned with what made the original a decent film but only how its marketable to the horror junkies and now we also have to live with the countless immitations of this gore subgenre which produces dire film after dire film,cruel
every halloween for the past 3 years i get excited it means that its time for saw the violence storyline and always shocking twist endings combine to make a very enjoyable movie for me as far as thats concerned delivers perfectly it is just like all the saw movies the gore is everything to expect from a saw movie lots of blood and horrible things the traps and violence make me cringe and so far s the movies are the only real movies that have been able to do that the storyline is great for the most part and evens provides insight into past saw movies explaining back stories and such as usual it has a twist ending that wasnt quite as good as or 2 but was still surprising compared to the endings of other movies dont expect anything to shocking but it is surprising like most saw movies it does have its flaws had its acting had an overly complicated ending combines a little of both the acting is definitely a step down from which is saying something because no one from was exactly oscarworthy also while saw had a surprise ending that was an instant shock had a long ending with several twists goes the with a long ending with several shocks one of which it pulls out of the bag way to early in the movie causing me to figure out a lot of it before it actually happens however measuring up to other movies it is a lot better than most crap that hollywood dubs horror movies and so for that i give it a high rating if you like gore or any of the other saw movies youll love if you like horror movies youll like it if youre squeamish you should go no where near it,cruel
i was at the celebrity release party on thursday and direct from the directors mouth v to be released halloween 2007 so the stones will continue to be unturned does create some closure at the end but of course not all questions are completely answered by not tying things up in a nice tidy way they leave the audience as unsettled as some of the gruesome devices used in the film you walk out a bit freaked out and at the same time something in the back of your head is going i want morei especially like how iii through flashbacks gave so much more depth to the characters and situations from the first two movies unlike most films where they use archived footage with a soft edge filter there are scenes from the first two movies that are completely redone from he vantage point of another character brilliant,cruel
what can i say but went to the pictures and watched on opening night in uk had slight doubts as i thought how far can they go with this but i was happy to say they can go much further this is by far the best one and that is very good as the other 2 were good films in their own right lets just say some missing pieces are added to the would i recommend this film you bet i would oh and by the way this is the first time i have been to the cinema and seen people walk out cos of the contents of a film  so a big thumbs up there the3 acting is top notch and the gore is well goryput it this way i went with my girlfriend and she was moaning about someone being on their mobile and speaking loudly and i never noticed i was that engrossbest horror movie this year,cruel
this s gorier bloodier and more extreme than the past two it lacks a solid story however and is honestly just a gore filmthe ending is predictable far more so than the previous two and the doctors acting is shall we sayawfulim not saying dont see it just telling it like it ismost saw fans will likely enjoy it dont expect any traps that we havent already seen in the trailers there are few surprisesthe film is shot oddly not quite as cleanly done as the previous which is likely the result of a rush job dont look for too many positive reviews for this one but then again what exactly is one expecting going in to see ,cruel
i am really reluctant to give this film even a 2 wow how many takes on the same old story can we conjure up yeah saw was okay but please can someone please tell us a new story 2 was bad and 3well i reluctantly give this a 2 halloween trick no treat here oh i guess if we add more gore then everyone will love it if you want a gore fest thats entertaining may i suggest feast yeah now thats gore with an original twist and lots of black comedy but man theres nothing there yeah theres tons of guts and gallons of blood but the one thing they forgot wasa story yeah that would help its the age of sequels and prequels because hollywood doesnt want to hire fresh new writers they just settle for washed up sequel scribblers and thats why we get crap like ihelp can anyone make a decent horror film out there,cruel
well after the disappointment of most people myself included figured that the only way this series could go was up so you can imagine my surprise after seeing and finding out that its actually worse none of these films are very well written and this dreary third instalment is no different as were given an unimaginative central plot line that is nigh on impossible to care about along with the usual amount of swearing crying and sweaty people looking frightened in rooms that are often so dark that you cant see whats going on director darren lynn bousman seems to have got it into his head that flashy editing equals good storytelling but that is a ridiculous assumption as all the editing does is make it hard to see whats happening  and that means that all the effort put into the film where the gore and inventive traps are concerned is ultimately wasted as you can never really appreciate it while youre squinting at the screen trying to make out whats happening this all happens mostly in complete darkness as well dont forgetthe plot line is of the highly convenient variety as despite being bedridden with terminal cancer has somehow managed to find a man who hates a lot of people for murdering his son naturally he wants to play a game with him and so hes bunged him into some grotty place along with all the people he hates and theyre all hooked up to grisly traps  the idea being that he has to forgive to win the gameetc etc meanwhile has got the doctor in to help him with his cancer  the catch being that if he dies her head blows up believe it or not this plot gets even more convenient once we get to the final twist i actually feel quite insulted that the writers of this twaddle actually thought that people would buy into it  there is no reason to care about absolutely anything in this film the film gets messier still when the director tries to tie all three films together with a series of boring and distracting flash backs where assistant amanda remembers stuff theyve done together all in all is a load of crap and im struggling to come up with anything good to say about it  and thats not usually something that happens when a film is as gory as this one the kids might like it but serious horror fans will need to look elsewhere for their thrills,cruel
this movie was wack i want my 13 back i literally fell asleep during some scenes in this movie this was some of the phoniest acting in a horror movie that i have ever seen the screams were unbelievable i laughed so hard when the judge said please i dont want to die and the man said shut the  up i should have known that the doctor was married to the man whose son was killed in the car accident another funny scene was when the witness to the car accident was naked and being froze to death by water she told the man i didnt do anything then the man said thats right you didnt do anything that is why my son is dead now the writers of this movie tried to confuse to death many people with the plot when they made this movie this movie was so bad that i want to see and ,cruel
doesnt possess many of the qualities that made the first two movies so good there are still crazy deathtraps and excessively gory scenes but thats about it the twists are weak and predictable at that the acting is mediocre the plot is actually somewhat boring there arent any genuinely scary scenes just graphic images that make you cringe this movie seemed dumbed down everything was overexplained the connections to the previous two films are weak and poorly done i loved the first two movies but this one is a significant departure there were also several cgi shots that werent convincing at all i do not recommend this film for saw fans there is violence and gore and not a whole lot more 4 out of 10,cruel
i am a fan of the saw series however after seeing this movie it made me wish that they just stuck to a sequel as opposed to a trilogyif you like gore gore gore and more gore than you might like this in my opinion gore was not the leading factor in this series this one has gore and a rushed plot that makes me believe they just ran out of steam i did not want to be let down by this series im a big fan of these movies and wish that the writers chose a different way to finish the story in summary the first one was good second was great this one pitifuljust pitiful,cruel
im not stating that saw and are two of the best horror movies of the last decade  neither of them come even close to a top 20 spot but at least i was positively surprised after seeing them especially turned out much better then i and almost everybody else for that matter expected given my traditional skeptic attitude toward sequels mainly based on that experience i sort of looked forward to the sequel of the sequel the final chapter in the story of the killer well afterwards i must say i feel rather silly and stupid for being excited about a flick like after only 10 minutes when a police womans chest is ripped in two right after the old killer one minute to chose between life or death routine you can conclude that this movie will never live up to the standard sawexpectations no thrills no nerve tangling tension no clever games no slight reflection of the elements that made the first two saws worthwhile and entertaining to watch  nothing but pieces of flesh and skin being teared to shreds spilling a lot of meaningless blood produced by horrific absurd machines and for those who figured i was still talking about that police womans scene too bad i was reflecting on the whole 110 minutes this movie is tasteless and dumb even the plot doesnt make any sense its nothing but flashback after flashback retelling story lines of saw and instead of creating a new one i venture they made half of by montaging directors cutscenes from the first two saws a very economical way of filmmaking of course but also boring and very very frustrating to everybody with a weak cardiac condition i wouldnt recommend  not because of the tension mind you but merely because of the frustrations and crushed hopes this movie generates,cruel
i really loved and 2 they were really interesting and kept you watching its exactly the same with the third installment which is in my option the best so far out of the three it has all the twists and all the equations you could want or think of for a movie it really was worth seeing i cant wait to get it on dvd i suggest people go out and see it even if your not big fans of and 2 you can at least appreciate a good movie when you see one and absolutely fits into that categoryit is a truly awesome movie and i give it 1010 and i would see it again many many times,cruel
first of all i am a huge  ii fan quite possibly my favorite movie series ever made i had very big expectations going into this and was very much let down it almost seems like the writer was searching for a storyline the movie is pieced together and does not flow well at all and just as the comment before me says it is incredibly gory the blood and guts is way over done the great thing about the saw movies was that they werent solely revolved around the gruesomeness the saw movies have incorporated incredible writing and wit but this one changed that it seemed like the goal of the movie was to show as much blood as possible there are a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up but i cant really see them justifying yet another movie basically the soul of the saw series was lost in this one slightly enjoyable but overall a big let down,cruel
i am not a big fan of the films and go along just because my friends do however i do like the idea that you have to play the game to survive was a bit confused with this film because the rules are not there and they havent been since the very beginning i understand that the whole three films have been a game to test amanda suitability but everyone we watched play the game die  even the people who win  so what was the point effectively everyone dies no one survives and the film no longer has the ability to capture its fans who enjoyed the rules of the game on top of this you connect more with the storyline and become attached to the characters you also see how sick jigs because i am sure anyone who has lost there son would want revenge and jeff when given the option to seek it fights with his inner demons and eventually chooses not to jeff then finds out his wife has been held hostage by and has been shot when asks for forgiveness without showing remorse i would kill him to i give the film an excellent gory factor of 910 because it was the best out of all three for this,cruel
has all the gore and gruesomeness you could want but that isnt the reason that we watch is it its that fascinates us he is such an amazing judge of the human condition though his methods are quite disturbing we understand why he does what he does maybe not to the full extent yet but enough to make us come back and see saw again and againthe saw movies are more than just a bloody horror series they make us think too many horror films these days are about the cheap scares maximizing the use of todays technology making the bloodiest goriest movie they can disgust us with s so much more than that movies like hostel and texas chainsaw massacre dont haunt you mess with your mind like saw does a horror movie that does more than try to scare you is my definition of a well done moviei want to play a game the rules of the game are simple would you have the will enough to survive,cruel
i cannot understand how the original creators whinnell and wan who wrote such an excellent first film could go on to write one of the worst two hours in modern filmmaking this film is not just awful in itself but is so awful that it ruins the original film for me as well the only redeeming characteristic of the film is donnie wahlbergs brief appearance and even that is not all that impressive none of the characters are convincing or even likable and you can tell that the entire film was just built around the fact that they want to kill as many people in as many bizarre ways as possible that cannot be the premise for any filmdo not waste your time or money with this money hungry cop out from wannabe filmmakersawful,cruel
i remember seeing the first movie walking out and thinking wow what a great horror movie it had both story and good thrills the second one i thought still not the worst story but the gore contributed positively to the movie and still made another great horror film made for the money i thought the traps in the film werent as deep and didnt have as much meaning as the first two films all this movie really did was kill person after person and move on which is your typical slasher flick that no one gets surprised from the original story portrayed in the first movie is lost and misplayed and loses out to torturing and watching people suffer darren lynn bousman who directed and did it very well tried to keep the same style with but it ran out of magic here bousman wants to keep a dark atmosphere with suspenseful music in the background while the gore piles on but there is no story to back him up so the formula fails in fact anything that tries to show substance ends up failing either due to the screenplay or due to bousmans formula as a character is still written well with james wan and leigh whannell still getting credit for sticking with the franchise but its the rest that doesnt merit my attention doesnt capitalize on what did well gore and story but continues to be a thrilling character who whenever he says something it catches the audiences eye the traps are gory but they are unbelievable and one must wonder how these elaborate schemes actually continue to thrill the viewer everything seems to just be available for amanda to make a ultra scene like the judge pig trap where somehow a whole bunch of pig liquid is justavailable and ready it doesnt make sense also although jigs still written great as a character the lines of wisdom and life is precious get repetitive and annoying overall although there are still scenes that will make you cringe such as a brain surgery scene heads exploding or rib cages being pulled open this movie is just a shadow of what once was a thoughtful franchise and the premise of a million mediocre movies to come,cruel
well as in most horror franchises we have an awesome start a crummy sequel but those writers and producers just keep on pushing the story is ridiculous and rather horrendous predictable i wouldnt say that just really really really dumb jigs on his death bed in this one yet he keeps on coming up with these nifty little traps and what not oh yeah and an unlimited number of warehouses and an unlimited bank account to buy all these damn things and amanda is so loyal youd swear was actually paying her some of this money and finally the guy seems near omnipotent the only thing he somehow did not predict was amanda killing off the survivors convenient right do yourself a favor and watch funny games and treat yourself to something truly diverse far from a true horror mystery or thriller let alone a real film for that matter the film is basically for those aroused by gore it simply has nothing else to offer,cruel
oh dearfirstly i thought saw to be a fantastic film im not a fan of films who boast about torturing people but the violence in saw was kept to a minimum considering the circumstances  finally a horror director who substituted blood and guts for a gripping storyline the flashback storytelling device worked nicely it was wonderfully written and had a fantastic conclusion  one of the best i have seen i then found to be a creditable film it was totally different to the first instalment and despite being much more violent was also quite well written despite traps edging towards the realms of total absurdity the film overall was entertaining  and in these times i think its about as good a sequel as your going to get especially for a serial killer idea such as this despite number 2s merits i still wish they had just left it after the first one but due to their ongoing success they just couldnt let it goit seems darren lynn bousman is contempt that if he thrusts a load of graphic violence in your face he doesnt need a good script opens with 20 minutes of torture scenes which are quite unnecessary in the first 2 instalments references to previous traps were brief and made for effective scenes for the traps in the makers have obviously ran out of ideas they are now ridiculously unfair and are totally stupid how rich is to get all these traps and places to put them he must be a multimillionaire the writers seem contempt to think about clever traps and then ignore the plausibility of them the only problem is  they arent clever either traps now include getting drowned in pig juice thats all i have to say on the matterthe story contained some pretty stupid things despite their constant claiming that has good motives he now has moved on to torturing innocent people most of the people he also targets to torture in this film is basically for doing their job well for instance a homicide detective is targeted because she spends her time trying to figure out how people died  baffling stuff also they try to make us sympathise with with a scene with his presumably exwife what the hell the man is a sicko thats the whole premise of his character dont try and make him human why must people try and ruin the most wonderful film villains there are also numerous flashbacks to the previous films which are just annoying and proves the writers have nothing fresh to add to the franchiseto top the film off theyve once again theyve gone for a twist ending  but this time they have 2 saws ending was superb and s was acceptable but both twists here were totally awful and made no sense whatsoeverone final criticism the lighting okay its not a happy film but a bit of light here and there wouldnt hurt would it there is a scene between a protagonist and his kid in his house and the place was shrouded in darkness what the hell you put the lights on at nighttimei am sad to see that the saw franchise has been influenced by hostel it seems theyve taken away all that was good from the first film and just turned it into a regulation horror flick that anyone could think of despite the fact both villains are supposedly dead yet another sequel is about to be released will they ever learn i would have given this a 45 if it wasnt for the dismal ending some of it wasnt that bad although never enjoyable,cruel
no spoilers the saw franchise is best described as a psychological thriller with personalized traps such as sawing off your own foot or having to kill another living person and this one had to deal with something that everyone has a want for revengeof course in this flick revenge has been taken to a new level the revenge is already been put upon but the infamous and it is up to jeff one of the stars of the film to forgive the victims wrongdoingswith the byfar the best acting best effects best story and the best twist this movie stands tall among the other saw films but a word of caution not for the squeamish,cruel

this installment of the series was better than the last but how can you go wrong when youre writing a script about hacking people to death in 2005 we saw detective matthews be trapped in the same place that we saw the victims in 004 this time amanda must confront her own destiny as she is put to the test by again when a couple on the brink of divorce decide they cant get along plays a game with the both of them the husband jeff is distraught by the death of his son and must face each person that had a part in the deathjeffs wife a brain surgeon who is having an affair with another man must come to the aide of and keep him alive your life depends on her amanda as echoed by jign the final moments jeff gets to the end of his game as amanda decides she cant take it anymore so she shoots jeffs wife in retaliation to this jeff kills amandathe final moments are to much to tell so youll have to watch the film,cruel
stupid stupid me there was one reason and one reason only i opted to watch and that was to see and his protg die a horrible death i mean i wanted to see them die in the most gutwrenchingly painful way far more painful than even the imagination of the writer of this movie could come up with well whereas they were killed i think they died far too humanely and in no way was justice servedsaw being successful is the equivalent to the decline of humanity as we know it is it too much to ask for the sick sadistic criminally insane megalamaniacal killer and his female pit bull to be erased from the face of the planet in the most vicious manner what world do we live in where such murderers are not only allowed to escape the law time and time again but they are allowed to continue to maliciously murder time and time again as well at least in the movie seven in which you had an equally freakishly sadistic killer he was killed in the end however humanely it wasi already knew going in that innocent people were going to be killed and by innocent i mean those who havent really committed a grave offense or an offense that they havent already been punished for or should be forgiven for but i was willing to sit through a couple or even a few pointless and egregiously graphic death traps just to see the ultimate demise of and mrs and though they did meet their end i am still wholly unsatisfied why because 1 every single unwilling participant in died because of the iwillmakeyouseethelight king of the castle or as i like to call him the devil and 2 they sheepishly left the door wide open for a part four part four will only mean more meaningless killing of which the only ones who will watch are those like me who want to see the bad guy get his just deserts or those unlike me who revel in blood gore and the sacrifice of innocent victimsand what disgusted me even more than even the brutal deaths was the lame justification continued to give and his sincere assertion that he was in fact not a murderer um ok and fire is not hot fat meat isnt greasy and water isnt wet that brain tumor squeezed his brain so tight that his moral compass went haywire whatever universe or astral plane jigs from where up is down and down is up lets pray that no more of his kind emerge and find there way to civilization or let us pray that should another rise from the fiery pits of hell he or she lands in an area where the deaths of numerous people is investigated better and such killers are captured before scores of people are decapitated dismembered or otherwise sent to a painful deathi just want to know what kind of mind even thinks of such movies as mean how twisted demented and certifiably insane does one have to be to come up with these horrific games and traps ill take a jason freddy or michael any day over at least they keep their slashing limited to sex starved teenagers and they resign themselves to desolate and largely uninhabited areas without a doubt the writers and directors of the saw series of movies no everyone to do with the production of the saw series should immediately have a psyche exam and serious thought should go into whether or not they should be admitted to the looney bin to sum it all up i was completely and totally disappointed in the end only the sick and twisted justice of was served and evil reigned supreme now excuse me while i go throw up,cruel
its been a while since i saw this movie and i have given it a lot of thought since i couldnt feel anything but disgust at the end of the movie and something tells me that is not a good sign for someone who can take a lot without being offended some of the teen girls who were there were almost crying perhaps because they felt they had to endure it just as i did why did i not walk out because i expected that there might be a lot of gore in the beginning and then some twist and a little purpose but when i wiped the blood from my face the scrolling credits were on as someone else mentioned jigs not the villain of this movie the ones who made it are they made a movie to satisfy a psychotic audience i feel so ashamed to be counted in this group i was there but i wish that i wasnt because i didnt enjoy it at all its a snuff flick no doubt about that they abandoned all elements of horror and suspense in exchange for visual gore was excellent and was pretty good too but was just a void trap that took my soul this will probably be the last saw movie too maybe they felt that they could cross the line this time because there wasnt going to be a number 4 and people would rush in anyway because 1 and 2 were good damn it dont watch this movie if you still have the chance and still have some human dignity id rather watch terrorists decapitate hostages although id never watch that,cruel
this is the sickest movie i have seen so far no story really just makes a person sick i am out of words to describe its sickness this movie only shows flashes of scenes rather than showing actual scenes in continuous motion even though after being they story didnt end after all i would suggest viewers to see some comedy movie right after watching it i was sick to the stomach after watching it since imdb requires me to display at least 10 lines of comments to describe the movies sickness i will utilize that opportunity to do so the movie starts as usual as you would have seen in other versions of n this particular sequel every scene tries to clarifies the previous versions every victim is lied about the promise of the game therefore every victim dies,cruel
this was a letdown and no one is more disappointed than i am that this is the case i am not one to shy away from gore and bloodi mean after the first two one must enjoy that kind of entertainment right but the murder scenes lacked the originality of the first 2 they were just gore and prolonged and a waste of screen time i felt nothing towards any character and could have cared less when they were killed the movie lacks the emotional depthcleverness and horror that we came to appreciate in saw12 the movie was erratic and i was never scared or amused horrified or engrossed i admit i know nothing about the director of 12 but i cant believe it is the same one here something is different i believe the movie is worth renting but be prepared to be let down the movie ends with the idea of a 4th firmly in placelet us hope that they go back to the teams behind 12,cruel
i quite enjoyed the first film  the second was ok though it did tend to stretch credibility to breaking point but this third and hopefully but unlikely to befinal story is just a chore to sit throughafter the second pretty much left at deaths door i did wonder what they were going to do with the 3rd film what i ended up sitting through was a pointless meanspirited and disgusting to watch filmi enjoy horror films normally and gore is not normally a problem with me however this film just seemed to throw everything it could in terms of sickening images at the screen and then along toddles the story long afterwardson a positive light the acting was ok and it did look well put together during the scenes that where not so dark you couldnt see anything then there was the ending which although quite obvious from early on in the film they then insult me by doing flashbacks of everything that i have just watched like i couldnt have worked it outsince my friend is a fan of this series i shall probably end up seeing a fourth if they make it and the tacked on feeling end of the third seems to indicate there might be one however i hope they remember that story is more important than gore doubt it as the core audience now will expect ever sickening traps and that they do not try and get round the ending of this one and bring certain characters backfilm makers need to remember that horror does not equal gore this series has gone from an interesting little thriller with the first film into some subpar slasher series that is as bad as some of the horror sequels of the 80s,cruel
in 2004 the world was treated to saw saw was a brutal horror flick with excellent gore a thrilling story and a superb plot  it combined the absolute best of a lot of things and with that became a new standard not too much later the follow up came  and that sequel confirmed the myth that some sequels can withstand the comparison with the original was in my eyes just as good as the first one now in 2006 sees the cinemas does it withstand the comparison imo no not by a long shotthe premise to the story stays the same a criminal going by the handle puts people that deserve a lesson in his eyes to a test the setup for the film is the same as well  lots of excellent gore fear and agony burning on the screen the background story is different the plot attempts to make the film fit in by adding tieins to the other parts and succeeds to a certain level yet it fails pretty hard as it makes a number of jumps that just dont make any sense at all it also misses the one thing that made the previous two films twist and turn  a severe twist of plot in the end that made them unpredictable this film is very predictablei guess it will now draw to a conclusion in a fourth part but i cant say i am really looking forward to seeing it  it can only mean further downfall5 out of 10 mutilated victims,cruel
this movie disappointed me very much first the ending is still game over although it is a double game over for amanda and jeff this did not bring any surprise at all i already expect it after the first 15 minutes of the movie the first two movies surprised me very much especially the second one i personally think is the best in all three movies the ending surprised me the most the traps are original and shocking especially the trap for the detective which is his own son in the third one traps are stupid especially the pig trap the ending is expectable and worst of all died the only thing that is good is it explained the riddles in the first two movies i recommend this movie to the people who do not understand the first two movies if you are looking for surprise dont watch it sucks,cruel
completely unnecessary regrettably unpleasant third installment to the grisly horror series adds little depth or relevance to the franchise but instead just offers viewers an opportunity to watch victims suffer needlessly cruel and merciless deaths this time around the mysterious killer with help from his reprehensible protgtargets an aggrieved father still mourning the death of his young son like the unfortunate and countless victims before him he must play the killers deadly game in order to survive taking into account the films deliberately nonexistent plot you cant expect very much beyond relentless violence gore and sadistic deaths which while inventive are far more gruesome and unbearable than its predecessors a mean repulsive and endless display of graphic violence and mutilation that will disgust the squeamish but probably entertain the most extreme slasher fans ,cruel
i have seen this movie and i loved it i bought a fangoria magazine that has information about the movie before i ever t i read about the fact that the writer and the director were tired of people calling it a slasher film and calling a crazed serial killer when once you think about it he really isnt it is totally up to them to get themselves out seriously though the movie is spectacular the make up the tests everything was amazing the storyline actually surprised me when normally i can predict horror films but this totally took me off guard i truly believe that the fact of that even tough they specially built the tests every contraption works in there if they werent careful the contraption would have done what it was made to do i truly loved it and would suggest it to any horror move fan,cruel
spoiler holly cow this is the goriest movie ive ever seen open skull and the chain thing are brutal but this movie has more message than all the disney movies together is excellent the explanation of the 3 movies and how they are connected is amazing and is open to a fourth movie because of the envelope that amanda opened the missing explanation of what happened with dr gordon and vision during his agony the only thing i didnt like was the lack of gore in the death of kerry and the 3rd stage during the jeffs test i hope v wont be like seed of chucky and the rest of the fourth part movies,cruel
i think part 3 was the best it was freaky but good and i heard there is gonna be a fourth part but i dont see how but if so i know ill go see it to because im sure it will be worth it also and another movie i recommend is texas chainsaw the beginning its good to i think that part is better than the other ones but thats my opinion and one more i recommend is the grudge two i think it was better than the first part just watch them tho if you havent and youll see but horror movies is the best anyway another one i wanna go see is the return has anyone seen it if so is it any good i know its got low rates at the box office tho but i wanna see it,cruel
gorier and darker this great sequel ties the first two together with complete genius in writingi love the acting the plot twists and different types of situations and trials all the characters go througha great addition to the horror department of filmsrent saw and before going to see the 3rd it will enhance the flavor brilliantlyseeing films with as much blood and gore as this does not sicken me but kind of excites me to how much our movies have changed and improved over the yearsthis new and thrilling trilogy is just what the new millennium needed,cruel
hi my name is tedis avanesians im armenian but i live in iran i saw this films two parts and im waiting for 3 part i wanna ask a question that i wanna know if the saw  amanda wil success at this time too because i love the way that his taking in his life  i dont wish die these 2 characters  thank you  best regards to you 2 actors i love the scenario of this film its number one i beg for the 4 part of this film i love the director of this film i have a great emotion when i watching this film tell me at my email if these two characters will survive and keep vanishing bad people whose dont know whats the meaning of their lifes,cruel
well if you are a die hard fan of these saw movies you may still like this one it has lots of blood and gore torture and killing however it is the same thing to the letter again and again when will they at least add something new and different to these movies like a real story that is truly a frightening story its the same story line over again on  on nothing new happens in this one that hasnt happened in the last two movies hey lets get a story going here in these things at least here we are starved as society to see some creative story telling on the movie screens its a hard thing to find these days we certainly do have enough writers out there so lets get up off the tush and do the job people lets get some good stories out there to go along with all these blood an gore moviesif need be or bring this legacy to an endangelx,cruel
hello saw fans yesterday i went 2 the movies and seen the years best movie see it this is movie unlike anything youve ever seen if your a fan of and shits all over both of em its the best one of three by far if your a fan of the films or just like heaps of twists see it  this movie is full of gore twists freaky traps gr8 acting you couldnt ask 4 anything more you will never expect the ending this movie also kinda goes into the back story of and his apprentice so u get 2 see a bit of there pasts im not gonna give 2 much away plz see it i cant stress enoughi give this movie 1010 ,cruel
this movie is a perfect example of the demise of americas culture this movie is nothing but a meaningless bloodbath the main character jigs a mad man who on his deathbed dictates brutal cruel tests on victims he has chosen to try and show them the importance of life this however merely is an excuse to make americas thirst for blood and guts seem somewhat meaningful im not a squeamish person and i dont freak out when i see blood but all of the blood in this movie was pointless i wasnt the only person to leave that theater with that opinion trust me if you dont have a need to watch people suffer for no reason dont bother watching this movie,cruel
a bit disappointing and the weakest of the trilogy for me im not usually bothered by gore if it has a stylistic or narrative reason for being in the film but some of the stuff in this film seemed there just to gross out the audience like the brain surgery the devices werent as interesting this time around mostly because they had no way to get out of them though i guess that was the point the beginning felt very choppy and didnt flow well into the rest of the film it seemed to be there just to resolve the stuff from the last film the main story was alright the twist wasnt as shocking as i thought it would be  i knew how it was all gonna play out once all the characters were introduced the relationship between and amanda was intriguing though i wouldve like some more flashbacks into the behindthescenes stuff of the first two films pretty intense at times but not as wellwritten as the first two the very end was killer pun intended but not really logical all in all it was okay but not great,cruel
i am a huge fan of the saw movies so naturally when the third came out i was very excited i must admit that i had my doubts of the creators being able to pull off a third in making a third it would definitely be compared to the first two when i watched the second one i thought to myself wow its just as genius as the first when i went to watch the third i was very pleased to see that it had explained a lot of the questions that have come up in conversations ive had with friends so if you questions saws techniques or okay how the hell did the old man pull that one off or things to that effect this movie really ties it all up and makes all the connections for you once again they created an awesomely entertaining movie that makes you think while you cringe,cruel
lets just start off by saying wow as with many of the saw fans my expectations for this movie were low who would have thought that both the first and even the second saw films could be outdone im pretty sure no one could i would like to start of by saying the gore was way more than i expected the traps featured ill be it a little complex to be figured out and built by one single person seeing as jigs bedridden where masterpieces in a twisted way ill have to admit i looked away at times because of how gruesome some of the deaths where in terms of plot this film took a new approach yet again to wow audiences trying to keep this comment spoiler free is very difficult because even the simplest thing could possibly give the ending away whis leads me to my last point prepare yourself for another extraordinary endingi for one didnt see it comingif you havent seen this movie i say screw any other movie you had in mind to see and catch the late night showing of you wont be disappointed i guarantee it1010 stars,cruel
eric mathews is dead spoilers it picks up with him in the shackle and he cant work up the courage to cut his own fit off so he grabs the toilet lid used to kill zep in the first one and beats the  out of his foot till it is broken and limp enough to pull through the shackle he limps through the hallway and catches up to amanda kicks her around a little bit until she kicks his broken foot causing him to fall he yells your not several times she gets mad turns around and goes back you never actually see him die but later in the movie says what she did was wrong and they arent murderers she replies with no one ever changes i havent changed a bit im a killer this is proved when she makes the ribcage trap inescapable and refuses to take up dr lynns shotgun collar says i had to go clean up your mess but i forgave you at since jigs so against murder he obviously didnt kill him and amanda did eric mathews is deadddddd,cruel
ok jigs known for punishing bad people and trying to make them good again you know what i mean ok in the girl chained up in the frozen room she was chosen because she was the only witness to the car accident and to the death of the little boy and she didnt do anything about it right well you see since john knows that the girl was there and she witness the whole scene then obviously he was there too and he saw everything and also did nothing about it but to think of another one of his sick games and make people pay their doings when he could have done something good something useful and tell the judge that he was there and that the guy in the car was at fault and stuff but no he decided to start another chain of games and torture some people that have done the exact same thing he did which is nothing they didnt confess what they saw are you following me ha ha,cruel
welcome to a world of torture owned by the one and only we are taken into a world of devices and tortures unthinkable by man of course we throw in a twist or two in there and some great acting and youve gotten was amazing but it lacked one thing people surviving well duh but i mean seriously half the people i wanted to live died well quite frankly all of them but in the end you still get the satisfaction you came to get when you entered the theatersthe death that most disturbed me had to have been the crucifix trap this trap in which a character is nailed into a xshaped crucifix and then takes a turn for the worse when their arms legs and then head are twisted until they break and snap off their limbs the sound effects made this death a horrifying experience a must for any horror fanin the end i say if your a fan of any good storylined horror class genre go and see you wont be disappointed,cruel
after the huge deception of watching the grudge 2 this was refreshing and gave me hope for sequels you need to see 2 before seeing 3 well it would help alloti dont understand why so many here comment on the fact that their is little plot in this movie jign this movie is testing 2 peoples to see if they can change forgive the main plot is about jeff and his quest to find the guy who killed his son and the subplot about amanda i wont say more than this only one is alive at the endthe traps are ingenious the gore is more present in this movie than the others kept me at the edge of my seat and tested my stomach on many occasion its a sick movie with many twist and it open the door for a saw 4 but im not sure if they should do it since it would have to be a complete new story copycat only one is left alive,cruel
unlike the lame actually has a point and a story to it there is actually some character development going on and i give a lot of its respect to the writershowever i think bousman wanted a very gritty documentary feel to the film kind of like the others by using all handheld camera shots i think he took this too far and the shaky quick moving shots with the fast mtv style edits just ended up giving me a headache and not moving the story along or creating any tensionwhen i go to a horror film i want to not just be scared but i want to watch as if i am actually there in the film and see everything but these mtv flashes and edits always take me out of the story and make me feel like i am watching a movie which is not the right thing to doall in all this movie was much better than but not the same rush as the first saw great gore and great writing worth checking out for any horror fan and a must for any saw fanas for me i cant wait for hostel 2 cause i know eli roth can direct a horror film,cruel
about two or three hours ago i sat down and prescreened at my theater i wasnt sure what to expect except blood gore and twists i am not sure if i am pleased or disappointed yetthe movie lived up to the the blood and gore parts i never thought the first one was bloody or anything but while watching this movie i had to look away a few times great right yes i liked the movie i felt the movie was created beautifully ironic huh and lived up to my standards i thought the twists were a little predictable but still good one of my friends made the comment this movie is a setup for saw 4 i am not sure i agree with that some of the death scenes could have been a little more drawn out and just more umph to themthe story line plot is simplewellsort of bell is dying just like the other two movies doctor lynn has to keep alive long enough for this man to complete several games if they both succeed they win the movie also gives flashbacks to other victims in the other two movies i felt there were several plot holes in the movie i am not going to get into them because that would cause spoilers but if anyone wants to discuss with me feel free to message me all in all i enjoyed the movie as much as i enjoy feeling tensed and freaked out which is often,cruel
ive just got out of an employee screening of and all i can say is damn this movie completely out does its previous ones this film reveals just about everything about the whole saw trilogy up to its very beginning in great and indepth details of work makes the audience understand more of how and why he does his games this is why is the best the story and plot was all together with interesting twists from left to right the characters were believable in the face of their death and the ending the ending that you keep you puzzled for the rest of your life youll not know what hit you if you are going to see any movie this halloween definitely submit your arms and legs to the third saw 810,cruel
i love the way this one wraps up and perhaps the last good saw,cruel
this third installment in the saw series is full of pretentious selfrighteous nonsense that should have you begging for it to just end already i certainly wasplot in a nutshell a dying serial killer forces a kidnapped doctor to keep him alive long enough to witness the outcome of his latest deadly gamewhy i rated it a 3 some reviews here made much of the idea that this film contains thoughtprovoking themes and explores the philosophical aspect of forgiveness they are saying this i suppose because part of the plot revolves around jeff angus macfadyen a man who has lost his son in a car accident and is unable to forgive the driver he cant let go of his son and curses the fact that the driver got off light the serial killer has come to the conclusion that jeff has not been grieving properly yes this is as stupid as it sounds and dont ask me how knows who jeff is and how he is grieving and so has determined that jeff should endure a series of games that perhaps will teach him how to forgive as if has any moral standing when it comes to forgiveness here is a person who has sent countless people to their grisly deaths because of their perceived sins why couldnt forgive any of them instead of setting them up to die hmm anyone and now hes going to preach about forgiveness hey how about practicing what you preach buddy moron wow what a stupid plot line colossally stupidcoupled with this is a dreadfully uninteresting concurrent story about on the verge of dying due to his terminal cancer a doctor has been kidnapped and been forced to administer to with the challenge of keeping him alive at least until jeff finishes his game so the doctor must perform a crude operation with limited tools to get the job done and if this sounds like it could have been part of a tv hospital drama youre right thats not a complimentas if all of the above isnt bad enough it gets worse hows that you ask how about if i told you that this film  which is supposed to be a horror film right  is in fact a love story i am not making this up here is a direct quote from the guy who wrote the screenplay leigh wannell it is a love story its a love story between and amanda essentially theyre like father and daughter oh yeah thats great you know when im in the mood for a scary horror film theres nothing i like better than to have it centered on a good fatherdaughter love story gee what should i watch tonight or father of the bride wowhas all the markings of a film that was thrown together as quickly as possible to take advantage of the series popularity in other words its not good its not even average its bad there is a scene where one character shoots another and admonishes  in all seriousness  you just ruined four lives uh what how about all of the people has sent to their deaths in the first three films how many lives has he ruined as a result of his actions does this selfimportant idiot even listen to himself this is laughable the writing here is so poor its mindboggling310 would i watch again yn never in a million years hell no,cruel
this is the third in the saw series and honestly i thought this was fairly good there are two main plots going on one where a man named jeff is being tested and another where has kidnapped a surgeon to save her life the parts with jeff are easily the best as we see it build up wonderfully the movie ends by revealing that jeff and the surgeon are actually husband and wife honestly i really did think it was clever how they set up these two stories together i had no idea amanda would dieit really did make sense within the context of the story i also appreciated how they really did raise a lot of moral questions that jeff was going through yes its very gory and graphic but i honestly think there was more to it than meets the eye the most graphics bits are probably the surgery but really i found that kind of justified given that it was well surgery ive seen so many awful movies with a mass murderer leprechaun lately that i really did find this to be much better im not into horror movies butplease dont judge me i was entertained okay ,cruel
the third installment in the grisly nasty saw franchise is much gorier and more stomach turning the original saw movie havent seen the second one and i dont think i will this makes the fourth saw movie ive seen and i honestly dont know why i have watched that many first one wasnt too bad on the nastiness but this one was unbelievably over the top when there are dead pigs being shredded up and their remains and innards poured into a hole where a man is drowning in it seriously in case its still a mystery thats the scene i nearly vomited during there really isnt anything thats at all good or redeeming about the film except the acting the acting is actually not bad but that one good thing is very quickly overshadowed by the poor writing annoyingly over the top gross out gore and torture and the bad ending there are sooo many other horrorsuspensethriller movies out there that are much better quality wise and wont make you horribly sick while watching pick one of those and please for the love of god dont let kids or young teens see this 310,cruel
begins in a supergrisly fashion that sets the path for extreme gore with a trio of extraordinarily unpleasant incidents the first sees a virtual reprise of the gag from the original saw flick  a guy wakes up with his leg chained to a post and theres a hacksaw to hand however in a novel twist this guy sees fit to get a porcelain slab and proceed to smash his foot out of shape until he can twist it through the manacle soon after theres a native american guy who has to pull a series of hooks out of his flesh before a bomb goes off and this is indeed the most sadistic unrepentantly grisly moment in the entire movie  anybody who watches without flinching must be emotionally dead the final incident sees a woman having to put her hand inside a jar of acid to get a key to unlock the bomb thats wired to her rib cage it all goes wrong and her chest is gruesomely torn off had enough yet after this barnstorming opening things slacken off for a derivative storyline about a sick killer and the doctor whos got to keep him alive  or she dies theres none of the gore that we n the first ten minutes instead the film becomes largely uninteresting let down by too many scenes of cod psychology and lots of flashbacks to events in the previous films that dont serve to go anywhere  incidents in the previous movies didnt really need to be fleshed out because they were self explanatory the film also reveals why shawnee smith never really became a star after appearing in 1988s the blob  its because shes not a very good actress and her wideeyed expressions of shock and her mumbling do not amount to convincing actingon the other hand tobin bell is selfassured and gives an entertaining performance as the fiendish killer and iranian newcomer bahar soomekh is great as a leading victim but angus macfadyens worldweary cop is boring his grief unbelievable and theres not a shred of sympathy for him as the story unfolds of course theres a series of weird deaths this time including a gratuitous naked girl  you wont believe how many shots we get of her naked body  and a bout of unpleasantness involving some rotted pig carcasses which tries to get the viewer spewing the rack is probably the second worst torture in the film  a black guy has his arms legs and finally head twisted out of their sockets  but by this time the viewer has become jaded to the bloodshed  its not as effective as in the film hostel in which the brief glimpses of torture made them all the more disturbing things culminate with some brain surgery youll see worse in casualty and some yawninducing twists which pave the way for yet another sequel so is okay if youre looking for gore but offers little else to entertain,cruel
the movie wasnt too bad not as good as the first two but still alright in fact the worst parts of the movie were the characters particularly amanda and the guy who goes through all the traps not sure what his name is amanda or accomplice was really quite pathetic and destroyed the entire purpose of the saw franchise with unwinnable games she was annoying and confusing and really didnt live up to far superior actor however she only contributed partly to the problem with this moviethe protagonist guy was incredibly frustrating to watch i know he was in mourning and everything but seriously he could literally save every person from the traps but didnt what made him more annoying was that with every person he could save he was indecisive until the last moment when he decided to save them and hes too late frustrating just because he cant make an obvious decision people suffer brutal deathsother problems id like to note the surgery scene was far too gratuitous shouldve been removed also i didnt like how got angry hes always incredibly calm and under control why did the writers make him crack overall if you enjoyed the first two movies you should give this a watch but dont expect much,cruel
saw and are both good horror films because they were focused on twists and thoughtprovoking themes related to justice and morals unfortunately this has one thing and one thing only on its mind to spill as much blood as possible the film bounces between needless expositional flashbacks and goresoaked uncomfortably nasty torture setpieces throughout a runtime of 2 hours which is far too long in this one a doctor being held hostage is forced to keep alive while he and his apprentice amanda put an unfortunate man through an incredibly brutal test in fairness is powerful at times and features surprisingly good performances from those involved however its just too disgusting to satisfy theres an entire sequence giving closeup detail of having head surgery why did we need to see that extremely gruesome sequence why its just the filmmakers exposing themselves as the immature bloodhounds that they are this one isnt even particularly scary and is more disturbing than anything else whats worse once you get to the end and endure a relentless bummer of an ending which kills off the franchises 2 best characters and makes all the gruesome bloodshed youve just endured futile you realize there wasnt even a point410,cruel
victim troy had to rip out the chains implanted to his skin to escape a bomb but he fails a swat team breaks into the devastated room detectives mark hoffman and allison kerry continue their investigation and haunted by the missing detective eric matthews kerry is kidnapped and set up in her own trap shes too slow killing her troubled er doctor lynn denlon is abducted by apprentice amanda young to treat her master john kramer suffering from brain cancer lynn is fitted with an explosive collar to be released if john is still alive after finishing with his present victim jeff jeff is obsessed with avenging his sons death by a drunk driverthe start is fine i like taking kerry as the next victim i also understand the temptation to surprise kill her however it would be much more compelling to switch jeff with kerry i dont care about jeff or lynn i dont care about jeffs story jeffs flashbacks are boring the body horror is still there but it doesnt have the shock anymore this is not scary amanda is back and thats good the ending is disappointing because it doesnt take the natural successor this franchise insists on killing my favorite characters instead of continuing the series with them,cruel
well robert the bruce is our hero donnie wahlberg escapeskind of amanda goes even more bug eyes crazy and buys the farm in this third saw movie that is vast improvement over the second installment and benefits even more from the viewer not thinking too hard about whats happeningwe begin with detective matthews donnie wahlberg showing considerably more intelligence than doctor imgoingtosawmyfootoffwithahacksaw gordon from the original breaking his foot in order to get it out of the chain thats holding him he limps down the hallway and into oblivion apparently because the film fast forwards six months and not a soul has seen him in that time this is explained in the next filmhas returned and he would appear to have changed his method and is now setting unwinnable traps to torture people to their inevitable demise for instance some poor unfortunate has to pull out chains that are attached to his body in order to escape a bomb but even if he had got the chains loose the door was welded shut at the crime scene we get reacquainted with matthews former partner detective allison kerry who is inspecting the crime scene with her new partner mark hoffman costas mandylor of picket fences fame we feel kind of sorry for kerry as mopes around all depressed about matthews disappearance i wonder if the story will give us more insight into this interesting character whos been around since the first film of the series of course not she gets abducted from her house and gets killed by another unwinnable trap having her rib cage torn off after burning her hand in acid we find out its amanda shawnee smith whos setting these unwinnable traps andgood lord im already three paragraphs in better wind this upok a doctor lynn denlon who has marriage issues revealed in a conversation with a man who wants a divorce is abducted from the hospital and wakes up with a bomb strapped to a collar on her neck thats going to blow up if dies before another victim finishes their test the other victim is jeff a man who lost his son in a drink driving accident 3 years ago and became bitter and damaged leading to him neglecting his daughter and all but leaving his wife jeff is going to have to learn to forgive as part of his test and at the end he will meet the man responsible for the death of his child so jeff has to forgive a silent witness who never came forward at the trial of the drunk driver try not to think about how stupid that is unless jigs either telepathic or god the judge who let the driver off lightly and of course the driver himself his results are mixed to say the least but he does take the opportunity to forgive the driver mission accomplished i guessin the meantime amanda is acting more and more crazy as lynn struggles to keep alive then we get two twists firstly lynn is jeffs wife the man at the start who wanted a divorce was her lover secondly this is also amandas test he wanted to see if she was willing to let people live which she isnt as she first refuses to take the collar off lynn and then shoots her just as jeff comes in who takes out amanda with one bullet then we get another twist as jeff remembering that this movie is called saw slices throat with a power saw killing him but not before he plays one last game from his little tape recorder remember how told jeff he would meet the man responsible for the death of his child well he wasnt talking about the drunk driver who ran over his son he was talking about himself and the fact he had kidnapped jeffs daughter and was the only person who knew where she was good one jeff you can forgive the man who killed your son but you cant stop yourself from slicing the throat of a dying man and now your daughters going to die as dies the collar on lynns neck detonates and jeffs left to freak out just like adam and matthews in the first two films as credits roleof all the saw movies this probably has the victim i sympathize with the most in jeff bravehearts angus mcfayden jeff is probably the best realized character in the whole saw series apart from himself i also for the first time was able to somewhat buy into method jeff is being taught a positive lesson for the first time i wonder of maybe jigs more than a crazy wannabe zen master who gets kicks out of torturing people to death and uses the delusion hes teaching people life lessons to justify it however that good will is lost at films end the last 5 minutes seriously just kills it the guy learns nothing jigs a very bad teacher with a very ineffective methodis a relatively satisfying film and in spite of all the threads left hanging comes the closest of the sequels to standing up as a film in its own right this was the last installment still involving the original creative team of wan and whannell and i think they were probably expecting the people they handed the ball off to to run a lot more creatively with it than they do,cruel
in almost every film series the first part is good but hardly any sequels lives up to its name and match the standard in quality it doest matter if all the films are directed by same person or any other it depends on how good the script is and the ability of the makers to deliver the good outputthis is the third installment in the series got a lot of gore and torture scenes but boring characters and jigs pretty much useless here he plans a new game but this time his successor amanda takes the legacy forwardin this film the background and little history of jigs opened up and this thing will continue in the rest of the films after this which is bad in horror films it is better to film the story in chronological order otherwise it is a pure mess its not star warssome new cast members are added here the rest cast returns shawnee smith once again gives a great performance surpassing everyone elsethe plotjeff is held as a hostage to play games amanda kidnaps doctor lynn to keep john kramer alivethe tortures scenes are too much in it but once you start to like them you will see too many cuts made by censor same goes to paramount studio why they do this is out of my head bad editing and boring slow story with this jeff guy was annoying plus that head surgery scene of oh god and how can any doctor use a large circular saw machine on the head without killing the personoverall 2006 is a once time watch but only if you can tolerate some boring dialogs and blood otherwise stay away my rating is 510,cruel
jigs dying and his apprentice introduced in the previous film kidnaps a doctor to try and save his life the doctor is promised that she can go free if she keeps alive though one of his games the game revolves around a man who is given a chance to save the life of the man responsible for the death of his sonthis time the game is only secondary to the plot the film is really about the drama between the apprentice and the doctor there arent as many twists as in the earlier ones although there is quite a powerful and unexpected revelation at the endsadly the plot is almost literally drowned out by the blood and gore factor they completely ignored the concept of psycho horror and tension and went for over the top graphic violence purely for the shock value however after about the third disembowelment it stops being shocking and becomes disgusting and repulsiveone thing i neglected to mention in my earlier saw reviews is the soundtrack the music throughout is fairly generic horror background music but the theme that plays during the big revelation at the end is impressive and combined with crisp editing it ensures a powerful hair raising moment of realization at each films climax by the third movie i found myself looking forward to this scenethe acting suffers from the same problem as number two and his apprentice are really good but the other characters are shallow and unrelatable whether the fault lies in the script or the acting or both i found myself bored of the secondary drama as well as disgusted by the graphic nature of the filmis definitively the weakest so far not that you can expect something different from a second horror sequel there is almost no tension and a superfluous amount of blood and gore in my opinion it is worth enduring for the twist at the end but unless you have a strong stomach andor are a fan of the series i recommend you skip this one,cruel
third installment easily inferior to the first two is a massacreliterally and metaphorically john kramer bell now on his death bed is having second thoughts about his apprentice amanda smith despite his pain and weakness he still has one more test to give as jigf you look closely you know this isnt the last installment one of the films biggest weaknesses is that the story arcs as if its concluding a completely unnecessary action since just by watching the film you know its not the final chapter bahar soomekh wins the title for the worst acting of the series the film can sort of be commended as one of the most ruthless of the franchise but still weak in comparison to some of the films that followed and definitely the ones the preceded out of four,cruel
i noticed something really weird in this one in the scene of the angel trap where that chick has the hooks attached to her rib cage that in itself kind of proves that you need a lot of experience in the medical field to do that so jigs obviously incapable to move let alone put hooks into someones ribcage and amanda well that pretty much explains itself and all that medicine and stuff for you cant get that at any cvs so like i said in my review from the second movie and this review i think its safe to say that dr gordon is still alive and if he isnt well that could pretty much fail the entire saw franchise,cruel
as i have said before i am not a big fan of chop horror there are very few exceptions the saw series is just brilliant for its genre because the bad guy is completely opposite the expected norm hes a dying man who doesnt directly kill anyone but is so brilliant that he knows how to manipulate people into killing others by not sacrificing themselves he is of course a murderer in any court of law but he doesnt think of himself as one he says he despises murderers that is what is smart about this franchise because the character of jigs not unlike some psychopathic murderers in the real world who do not see that they are really doing anything wrong in contrast they may even see themselves as doing something very rightthis unconventional series continues to engage in suspenseful plot twists that keep you wondering what has up his other sleeveas for the posters which are intended to attract people into the theater gasp i did not watch and iii at the theater precisely because i thought the poster was revolting and i have no interest in torturefests ala hostel which was dreadful gosh youd think i didnt have to say that torture is not entertainment but i guess for some people it is its not the torture that is good about its the plot twisting and the character of himself but except for the first one i managed to catch up on the series on dvd,cruel
horror fans are sort of trained to accept sequels that are largely unnecessary rehashes of elements that worked well when they were fresh however after proved to be such a promising followup one couldnt help but hope that the third installment would prove equally solid what were offered here isnt necessarily terrible but the third film in the stillburgeoning saw saga shows the franchise laboring a bitwhile the games in the first two films were certainly absurdly complicated enough to force a suspension of disbelief the sprawling devices found in are complex to the point of ridiculousness were inclined to accept that jigs a master of such deadly tools but knowing here that his apprentice is the one doing the handiwork its a bit harder to reconcile these extravagant finished products with shawnee smiths novice handssmith revises her character from the first two saw films and in fact this outing picks up almost the moment the last one left off this bodes well off the bat since the excellent part ii gave us plenty of likable characters wed be willing to root for through more nstallments unfortunately they mostly appear in to be killed off one by one for no apparent reason a teethgritting opening with returner donnie wahlberg goes unfulfilled when we find out later in the film what actually happened to him in the moments after we first see him likewise seeing other characters that gave an adversarial foil in being excised from the proceedings simply to fill out the bloated running time with senseless but admittedly grotesque splatter setpieces squanders some potentially strong future story linesthe ending of was dodgy enough but there was promise that this sequel could develop the puzzling scenario given to us at the end of the previous film after this whole convoluted maze plays out were pretty much left with the conclusion that everything weve seen in and iii was all for nil the way things are wrapped up it almost seems like the filmmakers intended to make number three the finish of the series as the ultimate finale here ties a bow on the trilogy of course we know now with saw vi slated to hit theaters in october 2009 and more sequels likely to follow for as long as the franchise stays profitable this film isnt even the halfway point of this opus given how strapped for crisp ideas the filmmakers are here it may be a long and dreadful ride until we get to the end of this linethe gore on display here is truly sickening and zealous so stomachs will likely be tested while taking all of this in however the scraps thrown to splatter aficionados here are too overblown to have much impact sure theres tons of blood and plenty of intestines and acidwashed flesh throughout but it all seems like overkill as if the filmmakers knew they had a rickety offering here and followed the mantra of more blood to try and make this sequel live up to its namesake the intricacy of the traps and gadgets used to inflict the carnage here is simply too dense to have any reallife grounding while the first two films were brutal but ultimately semirealistic drifts well into the realms of fantasy even if you can accept the mechanical improbabilities of these instruments of death after one scene where a doctor performs cranial surgery on with a powerdrill an oh come on now response is the only course of actionditto with the twist ending which is actually like five twist endings in one none of which have any lasting impact and at least two of them are pretty stupid when you get right down to it by the time this cyclopean web of plot turns unfolds weve already been invested for two hours so its rather frustrating to be anticipating some sort of conclusion but find only muddy questions that we dont really care about having answers to instead two hours is too long for a sequel this derivative and theres a lot that could have been trimmed here bloodfeasts shouldnt be laboriousby the end of this film we have jettisoned almost all of the characters the franchise was starting to become built on which means the series producers have a fairly clean slate for v despite the obvious weaknesses theres plenty here to merit the interest of fans of the first two and the veins havent run so dry that the series can get back on track with some fresh blood for the next outing so im not ready to give up on saw just yetany franchise has its weaker chapters and time will tell whether or not this was a rare misstep or the start of saws downward spiral into directtodvd redundancy either way has plenty of blood and guts but no heart,cruel
there is a common phrase throughout the third edition of the saw series namely face your fears perhaps a sly nod to the audience themselves as they go through this ordeal of watching someone else go through a further ordeal  psychologically as well as physically you have to hand it to the people that make this stuff the marketing is disturbingly effective initially we were dared to see saw and maybe we did maybe we didnt now we have face your fears pasted over most walls and doors in the film as the beginning of a new test is established to about to happen and we inhale grab hold of something and get ready for the next grossoutsquirminyourseat moment theyve roped us in via the dare to see the first two now we cannot help ourselvesthe third saw film was not the disaster i was expecting in fact it actually attempts to flesh out a character and for the first time presents us with a delicate protagonist at the films core who is given the chance to essentially play god with some previously set up traps what the film wants us to think he undergoes in the long run is a transformation from vengeful depressed individual to a man forced to come to terms with his emotions forced to forgive those responsible for his prior feelings and undergo some sort of journey of redemption but thats not what anyone is watching a saw film for thats for sure the ideas are there and theyre developed in a certain regard but the film is clearly more interested in the blood the gore and these traps that the screenwriters and producers in some manner or another manage to dream upthe man undergoing the ordeal is jeff macfadyen a man whose son was killed in a hit and run accident in which the guilty parties involved were the driver himself whom got a very short jail sentence the judge that gave him that short sentence the onlookers that saw the incident but ran off and the doctors that couldnt actually save the boy each of them are rendered helpless in a series of audacious traps that tap into medieval torture the sensation of drowning the sensation of freezing to death as well as out and out decisions based on whether you can find it within yourself to execute a man some are more gruesome than others and after each trap before venturing into the next jeff seems to remove a layer of clothing such as a jacket or a cover or something perhaps a shedding of a persona or a skin as the film progressesbut again no ones come to notice those sorts of things the films immediate beginning sees a hapless individual hooked up to several chains but a preceding scene is set in the dungeon he is trapped as the police investigate several dismembered pieces of flesh following a small explosion the cutting to the chained up prisoner trying to escape is a futile exercise as we already know whats to come and this is just an excuse to show us some of the material that gives ts reputation as this senseless mindless passage of traps horror and blood following this a female law enforcer is snatched for merely doing her job and is punished for love of her work through a device linked to her ribcage  its as nasty as it sounds but its completely unnecessarymercifully and i do mean mercifully the film ditches this short passage of play and actually gives us a narrative plus protagonist to latch onto he being jeff and the series of scenarios he finds himself in on a strand happening parallel to jeffs crusade bell himself must rely on assistant amanda smith and nurse lynn denlon soomekh to see him through some gutwrenching scenes of brain surgery as lynn is charged with performing a life saving operation  the catch is if he dies an explosive collar attached to lynns neck will go off thus killing heras a lead character its easy to connect with jeff hes given a meek amount of precrusade buildup as we see him dejected and vulnerable in his suburban house dressed in some pyjamas its all rather manipulative but in jeff we have a very specific reason to engage in the text and will someone through the film rather than just sit back and observe people we dont really know that well quite possibly getting cut up will no doubt appeal to those that are fans of the franchise much in the same way episode three of the star wars franchise might or recent prequel hannibal rising might to fans of those respective franchises this is due to said films attempts at the deconstructing of the villain and looks to further deconstruction that began in it attempts to humanise its chief antagonist  the reason so many nasty things happen to so many bad people in this regard it succeeds but like mentioned examples only on a very very basic leveli think it would be too harsh to say masquarades as a study of morality redemption and forgiveness but it is this sort of study dressed up around a lot of gore and dismemberment fanatics will enjoy the traps and the horror of it all those such as myself whom view it with a neutral eye might get a kick out of the study plus twists and those specifically out to hate it wont take to it at all but the most interesting thing about the film for me was that amidst all this gore and all this blood the most distressing scene involves an oven some raw emotion and a few stuffed toys combining to make something thats a bit gruesome for very different reasons,cruel
the third instalment of the series and the best one at that a typical gory horror movie obviously not it will be very hard to make a better horror as gory and as entertaining as saw a insane old man who plays tricks and clever mind games on people sets them up in a trap and gives them a chance a choice flawless writers did an amazing job a step up form but do not worry if your not very familiar with your history on saw you could still watch without worrying about things you wont really knowdefinitely not for the week stomachbut a entertaining horror full with gore the traps were better this time toothey were all different it may lack some story but it doesnt take away anything from the film because this one mainly focuses on the game rather than a brilliant story tobin bell did great as usual and his role as fits him perfectly all in all a great gory entertaining horror that will your jaws open at times if you dont like lots of gory scenes and a lot of blood then avoid this one but if you like saw and or horrors then go see it 910,cruel
after watching the first two films i thought i have definitely got to watch this one afterwords i was quite disappointedthe story was pretty good but with and amanda the rules have changed because he is not really a killer he gives the victim the choice but with this it feels like its saying yeah he is a killer and is saying you have no choice you die anywaygood connection with the characters and pretty good actingthe gore scenes i think got way too much even i felt i had to look away from the screen a few timesdisappointingly the traps were kind of ridiculous and over the top as the film goes i kept thinking how could only two people make a trap bigger than a tank you need loads of people for thatthe twist was average and left loads of unanswered questionswatch this by all means but i really think it should of ended at ,cruel
it goes like this either you somehow go for the saw series lot of superduper camera tricks its everso intricate plots and killing schemes and the whole gameness of how the killer goes about his schemes and how the filmmakers create these bags of horrormovie gimmicks or you dont i dont its that simple but somehow even after watching and finding the first saw movie to be one of the most idiotic horror movie claptraps of the decade i got drawn into this third part of the series a friend filled in whatever convoluted gaps there were to fill or whatever wasnt too damn confusing with the myriad of flashbacks from part 2 just to see how stupid it could possibly get this is a film directed at best with some professionalism and at worst like an epileptic marsupial who doesnt know how to let go of the color filters and the so scary editing touches like flashes and quick cuts that are more likely to make us go into seizure than frighten uslets face facts too entire plot here is about the most hackneyed ideal of redemption that can be possible in modern movies he kidnaps a man and his wife who of course happen to have a dysfunctional relationship or other places them in a mousetrapstyle maze of hazards and boobytraps and notes left with guns and gigantic limbtwisting thingamabobs and then big choices have to be made like if to save a mans life its worth getting shot in the head by a trigger hooked up to a switch or something theres also a brain tumor subplot with as he has one and has his assistant or daughter or whatever drill into his head to remove it in short there are a lot of things that happen in and they all amount to material that more or less appears like the image provided by a scene where a victim is tied and sprayed by an onslaught of shredded hogs how much of this can we take basically the big problem this time around is not so much that all of the acting is terrible though a lot of it is like from shawnee smith even a somewhat skillful actor like tobin bell is reduced to monologuing from one spot and dribbling silly in his seat or that the cinematography is oversaturated and made to look like washedout pair of hippie jeans though it is with some exceptions but with its attitude this is the saw that tries and makes us think or at least come away with seeing something that supposedly deals with guilt and grief and natural human flaws as if in the realm of biblical proportional philosophy its all about making the audience as much as the people who tortures and kills see the error of their ways as he rots away with his lovable old brain wart not before of course making sure if he goes someones head explodes to bootits also an excuse for a lot of irredeemable bloodletting limbtearing headblasting and gutchurning that is just there for not much reason except for the fetishists for this kind of stuff or for that matter those who appreciate it ironically if thats possible i wish there could be something else to this or for that matter be scary or thought provoking what it really is in the end is trash masquerading as a deep tale of revenge and other soapopera tricks and did i mention the flashbacks like every other minute taking up almost more than half of the running time couldnt they even get donnie wahlberg for more than one incredibly unitentionally funny scene with his torn feet beating a womans head against a wall yikes against me for watching it and hopefully yikes against you too,cruel
im going to say a thing right off the bat you have to be a fan of the saw franchise to like this film you have to be willing to think your way through puzzles as the film progresses if you can not do this do not see this moviesaw was perfection personified in my opinion when it came out in 04 had its minor flaws but over all was a good successor to the original had very little flaws and completed a cycle in one of the horror genres greatest film series to datepicks you up right where left off i will not spoil anything if you havent seen because if you havent seen two you probably will not see three but for information to those curious it picks right up where two left off just seconds after the last frameyou find out the fate of the last player in twos game and where exactly this film is going to take youjigs still alive but barely he is on his deathbed and needs a doctor to operate on him and keep him alive so is lynnsbahar soomekh game she is to keep alive while he and his accomplice test one final subject if she doesnt she will die simple rightjeffangus macfayden is a single parent who is distraught over his sons death and wishes revenge on those responsible he wakes up in a box with a tape recorder beside him telling him he will get his chance to exact vengeance on those responsible for taking his childamandashawnee smith is now apprentice she will take over legacy when he dies she keeps watch over jeff as he goes through his tests but is it his tests or does the have an ace up his sleevesurprised me even more than did because you rarely ever see a horror movie carry on past one sequel let alone two this is in part to the superb cast of characters and story that the writers have come up with this and actually has a grittier feel than that of is predecessor s major flaw was that it was too hollywood too clean for a sequel to saw but that was its only flaw brings you back to the grit and grime of the original and hooks you from the first few frames til its last twist in the game it leaves you wanting more it leaves you wanting to know how it continuesif you are a fan of the franchise than more than likely you have already seen itif you are curious this film needs to be picked up in the trilogy pack you need to see all three for any of three to make sense that and if you watch three first you will have the whole first act ruined for youflaws  gore this by far is the goriest of the first filmsi havent seen four or five so i cant tell you rather or not it is the goriestpluses back to the original feel of the film grit and dirt and depravity if you have seen or are going to see the first two the third one clears up a lot of questions you might have concerning the first two films really good thinking mans film it does have gore but as is the gore is easy to bare because of the story and ideas behind the filmsall in all this is a must have for any fan of the franchise and a must see to clear up a lot of the holes left in the first and second filmsmakes my recommendation for anybody who likes their horror with thought shock and awe,cruel
while good lacked the odd charm of the first installment by trying to be more complex a fact that also derived from the previously unrelated script having been adjusted to fit in the franchise mythology which was written by series cocreator leigh whannell and based reportedly on an idea by the first films directorcowriter james wan was meant to finish the planned trilogy in a glorious way that didnt happen and sadly the only one to blame is whannell himself despite his best efforts he even manages to elicit some sympathy reprising his role as adam in a harrowing flashbackthis time tobin bell has reached the end line his brain tumor has reduced him to near immobility but since he still has one more game to play he needs to stay alive for at least a few more hours hence his decision to have his apprentice amanda shawnee smith kidnap dr lynn denlon sakar boomekh a surgeon who has to keep the killer alive while his plan is set in motion the caveat she has an explosive collar attached to her neck meaning that if flatlines she dies as well meanwhile detective eric matthews donnie wahlberg is still missing after being kidnapped in the previous film and a guy named jeff angus macfadyen has to face the toughest challenge of his life he will cross paths with three people who were more or less directly involved in his sons death and in pure tradition he will have to choose whether to save them or notthe moral question at the center of the saw films has always been intriguing to say the least if your life depended on it would you sacrifice someone else changes that format in that jeff is in no immediate danger but has to decide if those who are in such a situation deserve to survive that idea is quite strong and macfadyen conveys the ambiguity required in those scenes with the right dose of doubt and desperation actingwise the other performances are as decent as one can expect from these movies with bell once again being the best of the lot even when the role essentially demands nothing more than him lying on an operating table and explaining his view on life death and the necessity of tortureeven bells work however cant cover the weaknesses that emerge from whannells plotting whereas the main storyline is as said before strong enough to justify the film the flashbacks involving wahlbergs character are nothing but a lame excuse for pointless brutality swearing and shawnee smith screaming like a madman or woman more correctly in fact smiths turn seems to have no real purpose for most of the movie not that amanda had any real depth previously but thats another story and that leads us to the latenight conversation topic of choice when the saw universe is involved the final twist which worked superbly in the first chapter less successfully in the second and comes off as a major disappointment this time around mainly because it contradicts whannells intentions  he set out to make the saw films a complete trilogy which is why he takes time to explain what many perceived as a plausibility error in the original movie and yet its obvious that his definitive epilogue was going to leave the door open for further installments as such while brilliantly filmed and appropriately upsetting is the weakest link in what was meant to be a mere trilogy theres almost a sense of cruel irony to the bit where for the last  time says game over5510,cruel
would have been better as a standalone movie in my opinion sure it has gore by the bucketload but it takes more than that to make a good horror movie it takes a believable plot line and i am afraid this does not have one the idea is good but there is very little connection to the two previous films sure we see how and amanda developed as characters and how they started out with the killings in the original film but that is all and bearing in mind the third film takes off where the second on ended there is almost no link whatsoever to itat the end of the second film a dying jigs in police custody yet in the third film he has managed to escape and even more amazingly manages to survive open brain surgery whilst awake and no gen anaesthetic he would have died of shock just too unrealistic for me and for a dying man and young woman to be able to kidnap the victims and put them in the various traps is too farfetched the first two trapskills had no connection to the story other than to increase the blood count no longer takes a shaped piece of flesh from his victims which is after all how he got his name the guy in chains was doomed anyway because even if he pulled them all out the door was welded shut and the lady in the angel trap would never have pulled those things off her ribs even if she had undone the harness both these go against the rules of the game as neither of them had any chance of surviving it would have been better if it was a standalone film or the sequel to the original started with the lady doctor being kidnapped and the first two traps being incorporated later on in the film cant say i am enthused about watching any more saw films and i am giving it a five purely for the inventiveness of the traps the pig one was the best,cruel
2006 is the third part of the ever popular saw series jigs gravely ill but he is determined to finish the game that he has started now with an apprentice has a new player and we learn more about his past and hints to what motivates him to continue in his quest to show how valuable life is or does he is a step down from the first two films and a lot more twisted more screen time is focused on bloody and at times a bit sadistic set pieces but if you love the series then youll have to really pay attention to some of the hidden clues thatll be further expanded upon in the next film even though its not as strong as the first two films i would not miss this onehighly recommended,cruel
in my opinion is a very clever and hip horror sequel youll love which will leave you feeling good the only things about it that made me uneasy like the first two were some of the blood and gore other than that i enjoyed it very much before i wrap this up id like to say that everyone involved in this film did an outstanding job in conclusion to all you horror film lovers that have not seen this very clever and hip horror sequel youll love which will leave you feeling good i highly recommend it youre in for a good time as well as some pure chills and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it turn down the lights lock all your doors and windows and enjoy,cruel
jigs back once again he is now on his death bed but one final game is in place follows jeff a man whos son was killed by a drunk driver he goes through a series of tests in which he must face great emotional pain if he is to get out alive meanwhile jigs being treated for his illness by doctor lynn denlon who was captured and forced to care for him but new apprentice takes serious issue with lynn and everything goes down hill fastok the first saw probably never will be equaled but overall i was highly pleased with its definitely better than ii everything has been stepped up another notch especially the gore this movie has some damn awful torture in it i hear a lot of people bashing saying that the plot was dumb and the twist at the end was predictable but those who say this dont realize the true message behind it is about how bad emotional distress can really be you know before seeing it that the gore will be there so the emotional suffering was new but enjoyable nonetheless the twist is not what people think it is its rather difficult to understand at first but once you know what the true twist is you should really appreciate this movie,cruel
i felt as though they were really pushing it with the 2nd film but this one is just daftits gorno fully realisedthere is no substanceintrigue or tension anymoreits clear to see that the film is a product of the success of the previous film and that there is no real inspirationthe film desperately wants to be a clever riddle that has you guessing to the last minute but the problem is most viewers will be long past caring when the inevitable final twist is unveiledadd to the mess a series of unlikeable and distinctly churned out acting performancesmtv style direction clearly aimed at a younger demographic and you start to get the picturei think this was the final straw for gorno in my bookand hostel ii particularly sold out and are not good films,cruel
okay so ill admit itdoes have an unbelievable amount of gore hard to believe hostel has more gore than this well anyway the movie isnt bad at all the critics just say its bad because theyre squeamish ever notice a lot of the positive reviews come from people who review really gory movies what really makes all the saw movies great is their amazing storylines and plot twists and is no exception yes you do have to fight at times to not throw up but the movie does exceed even with this flaw i cant imagine of a better way to have started the film than by showing detective matthews break his own foot this beginning alone is a great thrill and really pumps you up for it all the following scenes were all shot expertly the screenplay is great and really delivers the film is the best it can be in my point of view and the only threequels i can think of that are better than are halo 3 and the lord of the rings the return of the king is actually much better than most films i see the gore can be at times unnecessary but for short periods and timothy young in the rack was just borderline shocking but the storyline still is great the movie progresses quite nicely i can also praise the camerawork i have never really seen a lot of groundbreaking camerawork save for cloverfields first person view i really liked how the camera moved from troys crime scene to kerrys housethe films strongest point is its suspense when jeff was reminded of his sons death by puppet lying on the floor in a contorted position i could totally feel his frustration i can recall cringing at my seat when judge halden was being splattered with pig guts and asking myself if jeff was seriously going to leave halden to rot showing pictures of jeffs deceased son dylan before he burned all of dylans possessions was just a cool touch the film had great suspense and twiststhe movie unlike the original saw had a more crimemovie feel at points rather than an unknown killer chase on movies like se7en this movie and really had established a csilike feel with their crime scenes and that is a good thingpeople call the saw series overrated star wars harry potter and back to the future are actually movies that deserve this tag okay maybe they had one or two good movies in those series that were good but everything else was crap you know who you are harry dont believe the naysayers is a great film that is more than definitely worth a watch,cruel
the original saw will be forever one of the most brilliant movies ever made from beginning to end the first time you see it you are left in amazement the second movie was a bit of a let down but nonetheless very entertaining to watch but too much of a good thing is a bad thing which leaves us withthisthe thing about the first 2 movies are the plot twists that no one sees coming and while the first and second movies the first time through anyway have that killer xfactor by now movie fans are looking for the twists the sad part was i wanted to love this movie i liked it because of the gore and tobin bells continuing brilliance of johnbut i wanted to love it like the first two movies but i couldntseveral plot twists become disappointingly clear well before theyre supposed to be revealed which ruins the suspense when you know somethings coming you can come up with the endings twist simply by putting 2 and 2 together about the possible parents of the childrenthe plot of it isnt that great either a man loses his son in a car accident and must save all the people involved that did nothing about justice for the child least the first movie centered around a doctor with a shady past and the second around a cops son trapped with a bunch of people his dad locked up the dude running around debating whether to save people or not was not really something to get behindnow lets get to the goredina meyer gets her ribcage ripped out a woman literally freezes to death a judge almost drowns in pig guts and someone gets turned around 180 degrees i must say they kicked it up a notch from the first 2 movies but more doesnt necessarily mean better where the hell did and amanda find 100 dead pigs anyway unlike the first 2 movies this movie didnt end like there would be another sequelyet they made one anyway i can only hope that one can be a lot better than this because this was just too predictablethe highlight of the movie has to be the ribcage thing i thought she got it bad in starship troopers but this takes the cake 5 out of 10,cruel
the darkest and most emotional saw movie this time they take the gore to the next levelthe traps to the next level but take the twist down a levelthe twist felt empty and was very forgettable but dont worry when you see v the twist makes much more sensethe gore in saw movies never bothers me but if you you have a weak stomach you may be covering your eyesthe acting was 5050 some of the actors that find themselves in a trap dont always come off as believable but it will doi recommend this if you have seen the first two films and make sure you see the first two before this my friend watched this one first and then watched number 1 big mistake610,cruel
like a great many millions of fans i have come to enjoy this series since being forced to watch the first filma friend of mine told me i would like the first saw and made me watch it i was impressed like the first scream the ending blindsides youso of course i watched the second one i was left a little hollow there and glad i waited for it to air on hbo but made up for my lack of enthusiasm for the secondthe thing i most enjoyed about the first saw was the compelling story and fine acting and being a true horror buff naturally i enjoyed the blood as well while takes the viewer to new places and the lowest of lows lows in a good way i also think it overcompensates for the shortcomings of the story of was well written and well cast however they over indulge in the gore just a touch i have little doubt that the producers took the fans criticisms of the second film not enough gore and went out of their way to shove it down everyones throat by doing everything in their power short of taping our eyelids open to make us watch and potentially make us sickby which i am referring to the length of a few of the scenes in particular they drag on and on forcing as much gratuitous gore upon us as the mpaa would eventually allow and dont you dare shield your eyes you are best suited to watch due to those scenes being laced with flashbacks and important plot points thus my reference to taping our eyes openwhile it also obvious that the producers are pushing the story to a degree simply for the sake of setting us up for more sequels the story did have a natural flow to it jigs more defined and we are allowed to get to know him amid all of the violence and peril he thrusts his victims in you can actually see his point of view and almost come to accept itbottom line i am a fan of the series and although i would love to know that with every october i can count on a movie with the word n the title i hope they dont push this series too far because it is all to possible that saw could fall into a trap of its own and die a horriblegruesome death because it couldnt head its very own message,cruel
this film is both well done and somewhat sadistic  so its hard to get excited about it there is a lot of graphic horror usually horror movies are pretty ridiculous but this ones done well enough that its actually hard to watchthis movie picks up on the themes from the first two saw movies people are put into positions of having to make truly horrific choices these usually involve a person causing a permanent selfinflicted injury in order to survive  or to allow someone else survive this last component is prevalent in ithe principal cases here a doctor is fated to save a patient  or die with the patient and a man is put in the position of having to save the people who were involved in his sons deaththere are some twists and surprises as the story unfolds if you can make it past the first 15 minutes of the movie youll survive the rest the horror is genuinely strong the story is reasonably engaging and the acting is decently good if youre a extreme horror fan this is the movie of the year to see for everyone else its a little too disturbing to watch,cruel
i actually think this third installment is a huge improvement on the second part in the second part the contraptions were less gruesome and the horror felt more mainstream finally they go back to the core of the concept by focusing on the sick and twisted mind games of the the characters are judging themselves by becoming a part of the serial killers masterplanthe movies start to feel like a television show as prison break every episode gives more insight in the characters and their motives so keep them coming i wont be seeing them on the big screen but theres a video rental store around the corner,cruel
oh dear after the amazing first movie and the even better sequel i couldnt wait to see the third instalmenti walked out the theatre very disappointedthe first few games makes his victims play are nothing more than gory tortureporn the thrill and suspense of the games presented to us in the original saw are now replaced with sick ideas designed to do nothing more than test you on how long to can watch without feeling squeamish its a shame this franchise has had to turn to mindless gore to entertain its fans it looks like the blade on this franchise is becoming dull,cruel
its extremely difficult to make a good part 3 in any franchise and s a perfect example the descent in quality from parts 1 and 2 to this one is so precipitous that it makes me think of the fact that in trilogies or otherwise good second sequels are extremely hard to come by back to the future and alien 3 are the only two that i can think of at the moment and theres a saw 4it starts with the investigation of a man who had chains attached to numerous parts of his body and he had to rip them off in order to get out of a room before a bomb exploded one of the detectives says that that was all he had to do he gets mocked for this by another detective since the man had to rip chains out of both of his achilles tendons makes it a little hard to walk out of anywhereat any rate before long we sit through a pointless series of scenes showing the kidnappings of various victims ripe for the fastforward button by this point in any series or franchise or whatever the formula will be getting pretty old and tired unless something new is added theres nothing new here its the same old crap about this guy john kramer somehow having the time to devise unbelievably complex torture devices and little puzzles for the victims to try to solve in order to escapethe biggest problem is that by now it is getting so ridiculous to see this guy devise schemes to literally rip people to pieces while at the same time trying to criticize people for neglecting children and wives what sorry john but the brutal tortures and murders are having the little unexpected side effect of damaging your credibility just a tiny bitin this installment john has kidnapped a doctor and is forcing her to keep him alive i love her introduction by the way she performs one of those movie operations where she does something miraculous saves a young childs life and everyone around her gets mad at her for it i love that talk about not being appreciated and on top of that her marriage is falling apart soon she finds herself kidnapped and wearing a collar thats basically half a dozen guns pointed at her throat maybe my own luck isnt so bad after all and the brilliant talent of angus macfadyen is totally wasted as jeff dr denlons bahar soomekh husband and another of victimsheres the whole movie  hello so and so i want to play a game the device you are wearing is attached to your whatever in order to escape youll have to pass a series of tests let the game begin blah blah blah blah blahif this is getting old for you dont feel like youre missing anything if you stop watching these movies now by this point the saw films are only for hardcore saw and horror fans the latter of which i used to consider myself but with each movie like this that comes along the further away from the genre i feel remember hostel if thats where horror movies are going to that level of vacuous thought and logic im done i can tell you that right now is a hundred times better but still a bad movieone of the major revelations that this sequel adds to the series is that we see an interesting setup to the original film as well as behind the scenes of how and why some of the devices are created and amandas relationship to kramer the killer their relationship is ridiculous in the extreme they just dont make a lick of sense as human beings not even a drug addict would get as emotionally attached to such a pasty brutal man as this guy her tears before his surgery are outdone in bizarre ridiculousness only by her reaction of disgust during his surgery ripping that womans rib cage apart didnt seem to bother her so much maybe it was the licensed physician that was worrying her speaking of which there is nothing dumber than people who blame doctors for their illnesses dr denlon was one of the diagnosing doctors of kramers inoperable tumor so he decides to kidnap her and punish her for i dont know not being able to operate maybe if she was superdoctor and could do an operation that no one else in the world could do he wouldnt be so upset then again jeff in anguish over his sons death by a drunk driver allows a witness who fled out of shock and fear to freeze to death before his eyes for doing something that a good percentage of normal people would have done she was terrified and then he considers allowing the judge who sentenced the killer too lightly what state gives 6 months to drunk drivers that kill kids to drown in rotten pig guts following that kind of logic i wouldnt have been surprised if he had wanted to punish god for the irony of letting a drunk driver kill his son in the middle of a sunny day the end of the film has an unexpected level of complexity some of which works but also includes an unintentionally hilarious shotgun blast and a device called the rack which is truly sickening and disturbing and not in the good horror movie kind of way the end of the series is well past due yet im sad to see that there is a part 5 being made i hope they can manage to get a shot of someone kicking a dead horse into the movie somewhere,cruel
if you thought the first two installments of the saw franchise were bloody and you seriously should watch them first before you even think about watching this one than  think again or better yet watch this one  again and again because its so bloody that the german equivalent to the american mpaa or some other state department that i dont know the name of at this very moment did put this one on an index list  that means that you cant put any advertisement of the movie in any magazine and that it can only be sold in separate shopsareas of shops that can only be entered by adults and they didnt even allow the unrated cut in germany so im talking about the cinemarrated cut but is the gore content guarantee for the quality of a movie of course not the tension is there and the story good enough for a sequel it firs into the rest of the storyline quite well especially seen them as a whole,cruel
despite a promising first episode the saw saga is becoming a nonsensewe have a maniac moribund with a mental instable assistant that are capable of setting traps that in a real world will require an army to be built they have all they need they are capable to forge complicated mechanisms and to prepare traps that requires entire buildings to be set uplol more than this they are capable to kidnap people even in their own houses trespassing alarms and keys and having even the time to set up hidden cameras and circuits into their victims roomsnormally when horror movies have to force down our throats unbelievable facts they rely on supernatural or scifi so we have demons ghosts magic or mutantmonsters and so on on the contrary the saw saga tries hard to be logical without succeedingits more believable to see evil ghosts and mutantmonsters than one single horrid trial set up by this silly omnipotent five stars because there are some visual interesting inventions but the screenplay is really awful it tries to build a logical puzzle but all we get is a million holes cheese,cruel
i was surprised saw was great was equally good but thisthis wasnt i mean it was good had unique traps and everything but it justhad fallen from the first 2 i guess my biggest grievance was amanda i didnt like her since we all knew she was helping john and she wouldnt let us forget it lynn also wasnt that great a couple of times i wished the contraption would just go off also there were too many unanswered questions not that there werent in the previous movies but this movie seemed to live off of them torture seems to have taken over rather than fear in this movie the first 2 movies dealt with fear and panic while this relied on pure torture and agony this also seemed to rely on gore for its scares rather than sudden climaxes howeverit is a saw movie i did like the storyline and some of the contraptions john was good jeff was very convincing i also liked the twists in the movie 610 not badbut please try harder next time bousman,cruel
yes i know that the future of torture porn has been declared dead that does not mean that it is not worth watching in fact amid the intense pain and suffering is what could be called some socially redeeming valuewho among us has not been wronged in the past how many of us torture ourselves with those memories and vow to get revenge how many of us are crippled because we wont let go of those who wronged us tobin bell was doing the people he tortured a favor by exposing them to the demons that possesses their lives and helped them release those demons maybe he went a little far to prove a point but he had some pure motivesenough moralizing the movie was creative and exciting the devices were ingenious and i am sure the cia is using these films as training material for their own torture operations forget the blood the chopped up pigs was brilliant yech how disgusting cant wait to see number iv,cruel
i am a saw fan i really liked the first one with the twist ending and the second one was pretty good but takes a dip in quality of story and entertainment amaanda is now shown to be in cahoots with and probably the worst of the two i just didnt like her character she didnt really want to play the game like and give anyone a chance to win she was a winy psychothis time the story revolves around a dr lynn who is forced to keep alive long enough to finish a game she has a bomb around her neck that will explode if dies we get a very gruesome brain surgery during this timethe other part of the game involves jeff a man who lives for vengeance since his son was killed by a car has captured the men jeff blame for his sons death and gives jeff a choice jeff can show forgiveness and save them or let them die in gruesome ways in the end jeff tries to save all of them but is never successful the guy in the rack was the most gruesome of the death traps bones being snapped like that is never goodthen the twist is the link between jeff and lynnfinal verdict ok but not as good as the first 2 its worth watching if you like gore and blood,cruel
this is a difficult film to rate considering its content versus its cinematography lets review the latter the plot scenario buildup imagination creativity and filming are really excellent sound and camera effects are mastered as well as scene lighting for this i would give it an 89 how about rating the movie with its content it is one thing to reflect on the deepest and sadistic side of human nature while dealing with an overall story concept this was beautifully executed with the silence of the lambs but in sadistic torture becomes the centerpiece when further listening to comments by leigh whannell and director daren lynn bousman it shows that both enjoyed the subject and wanted to please the viewers that is one thing which disturbed me then there is the subtle perversion to show the jign a more understandable if not positive way he is not a murderer in opposition to amanda and the rules of his game always enable the victim to escape at the expense of great pain of course finally each civilization has its wave of torture the most bloody examples going back to the mayas the spanish inquisition and more recently the nazis do our present times miss torture to explain the appearance of the sagas of saw and hostel,cruel

well one thing saw franchise always delivers is the tag line they have been innovative and wicked in equal measures well lets see how this sequel to is the story is more complex the traps are more twisted and he has in fact out done himself on some of the sub plots present in the movie i think the saw guys are just fooling people when they there is no need to see the old movie to understand the story with people who have seen the first and second movie itself it is puzzling in a few sequences god save those who start the franchise from the story is the same saw traps a few more people asks a few to make decisions and based on the decision makers discretion some one bleeds hmm  sweet the blood is there traps are there unfortunate victims are there and in the end it gives a satisfactory feeling knowing jigs no more there but a bit disturbing knowing there are still people trapped meaning more movies from the studios to cash in on the saw craze lets hope this is the last movie and a fantastic trilogy has come to an end i rate this movie 910,cruel
demonstrates the law of diminishing returns despite the script from james wan and leigh whannell and direction from s darren lynn bousman this third entry left me cold theres a lack of suspense in this movie and some of the plot turns were in my view unsatisfactorythis time around the traps are more sophisticated and farfetched and the gore content has been upped shock value outranks goodoldfashioned tension and fearthe performances are okay but i expected so much more from this third film that i found myself restless throughout perhaps a repeat viewing will change my view but i very much doubt it6 out of 10 disappointing,cruel
is a typical sequel it bombs in many ways while it has moments when it definitely rises to challenge the first installment one thing that never felt right was all the useless gore and blood sometimes this movie felt like a pointless and utterly empty parade of different kind of deaths although some of them quite inventive and twisted but beautifully designed most of the time they do feel out of place the first parts greatness came from the mental pressure and the analysis of people reacting to the difficult circumstances the husbands role is very clear hes but an instrument that leads from one execution to another hes lacking any kind of personality and his character isnt going anywhere for most of the film john is there to be there after all hes the main character the doctor gets the same treatment as the husband and amanda is wandering about aimlessly the only thing that saves is  a bit surprisingly  is its final scene its a glorious moment when the characters suddenly get depth its tragic nature overwhelming  yet unable to lessen the feeling that weve been cheated not bad overall a strong piece of gory entertainment but hardly more,cruel
i just watched this movie last night at a friends house and ill admit that i felt sick through the entire movie i had never seen the first 2 saw movies and i wasnt planning on seeing this one either but after being talked into it i was relatively sure id regret itnow i expected a lot of gore in this movie after hearing about it from friends but i never could have expected just how graphic it really was the fact that it was rare for them to cut away from a body being torn apart surprised me at first and even though you grow to expect it i cant see how you could ever get used to it and although the traps werent all that bad maybe im the only one but the woman freezing didnt gross me out too badly there were a couple that could haunt your mind for quite some time such as a girl having her rib cage torn apart and a man having his limbs twisted offnow i cant speak for hardcore saw fans or saw fans at all for that matter but even though after the movie finished i promised myself i would never watch it or anything like it again im already starting to want retouch on the feeling you get while watching it sure it was just plain gross at times a man being drowned by liquified rotten pigs but there was just something about it that makes you want to come back for more,cruel
i had wanted to see when it was in theatres but never managed to get a chance to go and see it when it came on dvd i attempted to rent it right away but was too busy and all the copies were always sold out so i had to wait until now to finally get my chance and despite the simplistic content of the film i am still really conflicted about it more than a day after seeing itopening with a rather bizarre string of character tieups and two notso elaborate death sequences the actual key characters in the film are not introduced for the first fifteen minutes at least tobin bell is on his deathbed so a brain surgeon lynn bahar soomekh is kidnapped and put into a game where she would have to keep him alive or will end up dying with him at the same time jeff angus macfadyen is being put into multiple tests to see if he can conquer his ultimate fearsimply put is not as good as the original film but does improve in a few areas over its disappointing predecessor the film is focused on a small number of characters this time around and does not make the audience try and feel for more than a half dozen like the previous film as a result it feels more focused when these characters are on screen and allows for more character development of course we do not hear a lot of it until the films dying minutes much akin to the other films but it feels like a vast and much needed improvementthe performances are also much better done here even though he is stuck in a bed for most of his scenes bell proves to be the most menacing and evil dying film character ever all of the fear and chills he has given in the past is all present here and never wasted just looking at his sad and twisted body now heavily dependent on oxygen as he is introduced to lynn is just terrifying shawnee smith who returns as amanda is also very good i did not like how emotionally twisted she was at first but as the film goes on her actions make a lot more sense and feel much more authentic and proper newbies soomekh and macfadyen do an adequate job in their roles with macfadyen really pulling in the brunt of the emotional sequences they deliver but are overshadowed by how good bell and smith arebut they are also overshadowed by the fact that the movie while being about their struggle to compete in twisted games is not about them it serves more as a backgrounder on the events of the first two films filling in the gaps of logic and questions that many of us have had since seeing the films i will not ruin all of the surprises that the film reveals but there is a lot of back story covered for both and amanda it was a nice touch to also have former game players leigh whannell adam in the first film and donnie wahlberg detective matthews from the second film return for a bit of background on what happened to their characters no cary elwes appearances though having so much historical background material though takes away much of what is happening in the present and makes it take a bit of a backseat in a lot of cases these events are just nowhere near as important and their lack of definition is felt throughout the movie right up to the ending which fails to deliver like the other two films as a result of thisanother thing i resented was how meanspirited and violent the film was yes the previous two films had their shares of gruesome violence but the limits are really being tested here the death and the torture scenes just do not feel fun anymore for lack of better terminology what impressed us about the originality of the violent ends in the first two films feels a lot more dull and half baked here yes they are still intriguing ways to kill but they just do not feel like they are on the same level on the same token the blood seems to have been anted up to help compensate for the loss i cringed in a few sequences and in others i just felt like the gore was being way too overdone it was bordering on the selfparody of hostel for much of the film and considering how horrendous that movie was is not much of a complementas well the whole scheme and meaning of the games that tests people with has been changed all around what we are meant to believe in the first two films is not the true meaning given in the third it takes away a bit of the morality felt throughout the first two films and just gives into the mindless excess of every other horror film being released every few weeks what was original and unique gave in to becoming mainstream the deaths were characteristic and had importance here they just feel like they are being done just for the sake of it there is no love or emotional attachment to anyone because they are introduced and last even less time aftersome people may have liked some of the liberal changes made in this film from the previous two but i really think it took away from the mythos and emotional appeal that made the films so uniquely successful in the first place i appreciated how much light was shed on some of the questions i had about the other two films but on the other hand i was not completely satisfied in the end i just hope v is not exactly the same710,cruel
i waited ages for the third piece of the franchise to come out and was sorely disappointedthe first film was genius the second a little messy the third just plan dumb to be fair i got the version that has been dubbed extreme but could find no other on dvdthe murders are overly voyeuristic and pointless which to be fair is kind of the point of them in this film when any good horror movie director would have cut away to live the rest to your imagination the camera stays on the scene and stays and stays and stays and stays it is truly horrific in parts and what is worst there is only a point to every third or so killing very few have any significance to the story except to cram in more goretimewhere as was an enigmatic character who although we hated a small dark part of us could sympathise with he is paradoxically brutal and weakto me saw was an extension of seven this is a high budget low rate gore fest without having the coolness or humour of say living dead or bad tastei found myself sitting through hours of torture to get to the inevitable sting in the tail which evidently was very weak unless you love sixteen gallons of blood to go with your popcorn i would recommend saw fans stay away and pretend the series ended at 2,cruel
takes off from where we left off in with detective matthews trapped chained to a pipe in that significant and almost tomb like confine of the bathroom from the first film this then leads into another series of games orchestrated by now bed ridden with cancer and his assistantapprentice amanda they kidnap a doctor and force her to perform surgery on to releive some of his suffering while at the same time a father grieving for the accidental death of his son is put through a series of tests which will test his ideas of revenge and forgiveness while the first saw film was a brilliant and tense film and while upping the brutality stakes was a worthy if moderate follow up lacks some of the twists and tension used so brilliantly in the first two films and proceeds to bludgeon the viewer with a round and after round of brutal and at times gratuitous violence im not bothered by that and dont mind blood and gore onscreen and will give credit for the director and writer for pushing the limits and intensity that an american rrating would allow yet bored me pretty much whereas the tension built up in the first film was through the idea that one of these guys would eventually use the hacksaw to cut through something other than a chain pummels us with a guy breaking and snapping his own foot of a women having her ribcage pulled open a guy pulling rings out of his skin that have been attached there all in the first twenty minutes followed by brain surgery with non surgical tools and a man having his legs and arms twisted in fact it came to the point of the brain surgery scene that i almost laughed as i imagined the filmmakers with a list of what gory scenes they need to do and ticking it off one by one plus the characters are not as well written the grieving revengeful father geoff seems like an idiot at times and doesnt illicit any sympathy through his own idiocy saw 4 will be round the corner for this halloween all i can hope is that they focus on producing a better story with better characters and keep the gore just dont pummel us to death with it,cruel
delivers what it promises blood gore pain these go down to certain extremities which are unbearable to many people i can understand now why the board of classification couldnt lower the age certificatethe storyline is pretty good with a great twistconclusion but in certain points the movie lets go too much on the gore side and this annoys everyone a friend of mine who is a fan of gore movies was even disgusted with certain scenes of barbarismoddly enough the movie sends out a good message dont live your life consumed by vengeance as in the end it will turn against youanswers questions left open in the 1st and 2nd parts and in the end seals the trilogy as it should i loved the ending but it will make many people angrya 4th installment is pointless,cruel
i have in short time become a fan of the saw movies that was about when the first shots of came out i was very skeptic about weather or not 2 was just more bad horror movies but i saw them and was surprised tobin bells was even better than hannibal lector and i became a huge fan before i saw i had considered the fact that it would perhaps not be as good as the other when i t i must say i was a bit disappointed were had fine dialog and perfect dialog dident have any was about amandas present and past last hours and a poor man in his dangerous game dident say great lines like he did in the 2 film and i dident really like the way the story turned out to be and the twists wasent as surprisingly but i have kept in mind that still is a must mainly because it continues the saw story but also because its still way better than all other horror movies like scream i know what you did last summer friday the 13 and nightmare on elm street so even though i dont agree with the story line im still hoping that the rumors about a saw 4 will turn out correct it would be a shame if the best horror films ever dident get to at 4th installment hope we will see more to tobin bell a great actor and the scariest man alive,cruel
apprentice amanda is in control this time jigs near his death and thus another game begins throughout the movie you think the guy and the doctor are being tested and they are but the big twist is that the movie is about testing amanda amandas traps are unfair in that the victim cant escape exeption judge character the woman with the thing around her ribs was completely impossible bc there was no lock to use the key with i thought that was kinda crappy anyway i doubt that a saw 4 will go because nearly everyone died at the end that is a huge disappointment amanda and the doctor lady all die the only one that lives is the doctors husbandlike they can make a movie out of that i was enthused grossed out and then left feeling like the ending couldve been way better like the previous saw films,cruel
runs with the same based deadly games as the 2 previous ones if you liked the first andor the second youll definitely like the even more killing psycho games of the thirdsurprisingly here is the fact of the precisely chosen people to play the games and how feelings can change persons to do things they would never dothis movie makes you also aware of how small the world may be i highly recommend this one because really reveals the psycho mind of the master brainthe choice is yours watch or die,cruel
i loved t was a while since i felt so uncomfortable by watching a horror flick i thought was good and is definitely worth watchingthe reason why i thought that the first s so wonderfully refreshing is that you do not know what is coming you just go along with what the movie brings you not only is the whole game concept unclear but it is also a very unpredictable movie anything could have happened and it didin there are more predictable standardscare setups things they use to scare you with but you know beforehand they will not happen because it would ruin the rest of the film furthermore the movie uses a lot more gore which by itself is not bad but again it is a predictable proved horror movie pathdespite those predictable inbetween scenes the final piece of the puzzle in the plot of manages to lift the level of the film up to its predecessors so definitely worth watching 710,cruel
if its blood and gore youre looking for this is the film to watch after having watched saw1 and saw11 and being scared to death i couldnt wait to see the follow up film it certainly was gory and i was not surprised to see a least one person faint in the audience my only disappointment was the fact the ending was very predictable some of the scenes were truly revolting and ruined the whole excitement of the film as i spent most of the time with my hand over my eyes the acting was excellent and very realisticthe special effects were brilliant and they brought the whole film to life i would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who doesnt have a delicate constitution,cruel
i was not a fan of this series but was very intrigued by the viral un signed youtube teasers for this moviethe move starts out very well and has many many bits of real creepyness but after the first two grisly tests and the fantastic opener it looses steam and slides into this phsyco episode of eri get the feeling that artistically they got those things right ie the first 30 minutes but either time andor money ran out and things had to be rushed out in fact i think you could edit this down to about 55 minutes and have a better movieit is a go see but dont have too high expectations,cruel
man this movie is off the chain this movie is the bomb sky rocket high although sick in the head is the man this guy is on his death bed and still going at it man you guys have to see this movie this guy never gives up and the end is a huge twist you would never think that it would have went down like it did i mean yesssss it gets you wondering pondering not knowing what sick game is coming up next it gets you going you cant miss one part this movie is like wow if you havent seen it yet i urge you too this is indeed a movie you can get your moneys worth oh yeahand 2 were just as good and im glad that the 3rd one ended with a great finish its more sicker more nastier more ouchier i am serial this movie is an a all the way check it out people saws trilogy is the best that hit the market besides scream that is,cruel
is going to be another one of those maniacs  aka jason vorhees or michael myers  who simply cannot be killed i dont know but he makes another appearance in which  to me  is far more gruesome than the first two but oddly less satisfying it starts with the opening of the movie and a couple of people caught in traps sequences which seemed to serve little purpose for the movie except to make the audience squeamish right away there were also quite a few flashbacks which ended up being a little confusing in relation to the timeline and the ending was decidedly unhollywood but so gutchurning and made me so uncomfortable and im not talking about the gore but the ultimate way the events unfolded im not sure i can watch this movie again all in all though it was a solid horrorsuspense movie  albeit the lesser of the three saw movies no 2 was probably the best one though the ending for no 1 was pretty darn cool and the door was clearly left open for at least another installment which wont be such a bad thing ,cruel
first of allthe words that you are about to read come from a man whos brain and heart are still shocked from the viewing of two hours have passed since i left the cinema and probably my brain is still not fully functional so please forgive my overexcitementif you have seen the first and second movies you know what s about you know that what made it different from the usual thrillers was that it gave a reason to the violence that it depictedit gave a reason above the cheap excuse of a maniac serial killerwho have gone mad and started killing innocent teenagers it gave a reason a moral reasonit made you feel guiltybecause it showed people paying for everyday sins sometimes small sometimes bigsins that we all could have done it showed a killer a humana vulnerable killer a person that you wouldnt probably notice in your everyday lifeit forced you deep inside a worldin which moral judgment prevailed ruledforces you even deeper it lets you feel not only what the victims feltbut it also guided you through the complex mind of a genius killera man who carefully crafted punishment in ways that made it look like a tool of forgivenessof self liberationas a thrillersplatter made a difference it had extreme gore unsuprisingly but it didnt gave the viewer cheap thrills instead it gave intensity a two hour roller coaster rideintense in almost every second of it also it did well by filling almost all the plot gaps that saw and left behindand it didnt lack the originality it gave new dimensions to the tortures that usedand most important it showed the sane insanity behind their real purposesaw had the plot had the action combined them in the most perfect goryscary extravaganza that we have seen in the last years without any doubti have to choose it as the best saw movie eversinopsis skip if you dont want to spoil the fun a doctor gets kidnapped by apprentice amanda in order to help him stay alive but of course he doesnt miss the chance to teach her a moral lesson about the way she lives hard she will be forced to help stay alive this way testing her will to save someone or she will die too right in that moment lynn the doctor will be told that there is another test subject near there whos decisions throughout his version of the game will decide her fate as well as his of course,cruel
well the question i have is did they end this movie as they thought this would be the last one and now that its doing so well they figure to make another one i think itll be a sequel with many flashbacks to johns past i believe that amanda is alive and that jeff would get killed off in the first part of the filmother than that im at a loss of what else they can do without it looking like its been done before in sawhow could be alive since he practically cut off his neck they could always show that amanda got shot in an area that doesnt completely end her life either way we know that the doctor is dead and that they kid will be alive thoughts anyone jon a,cruel
who is on his deathbed gets his apprentice amanda to kidnap a doctor who is told to keep him alive or she will die meanwhile jeff is the next person to fall victim to gamewhen choosing to see a horror film one should not listen to what the film critics have to say about it usually they will tear the film a new one simply because theyre not a fan or appreciate the genre horror is a genre for its fans not its critics its no surprise that the critics hate the third saw film but the fans rejoice around it while is not the best film of the trilogy its not the worst either improving over the mess of a sequel that was tries to piece back together missing pieces in the and succeeds at doing sobarelywhile many thought that himself died at the conclusion of the second film we were all wrong hes still alive and kicking well not kicking but alive its up to lynn a doctor to keep him alive for her sake she is attached to a device that will blow up is heart rate stops and she leaves his proximity sounds very battle royalish she is only a small part of a much bigger game that jigs playing in a couple rooms over another victim wakes in a wooden box this is jeff he is unwillingly like everyone else thrown into this game of life or death his so called crime according to jigs his inability to let go of the past a car killed his son and jeff has yet to let go of this so he is sent on this quest to get to the man who killed his son he must choose to forgive and save three victims who all have their hand in his sons death or let them die eventually all of this somehow leads up to the films end where it throws its expected twist which isnt as good as either of the previous filmsdidnt go over so well because it took a different angle and failed does the exact same thing yet somehow gets away with it by an inch mind you what made the original so compelling and unique was that it took place in this dirty bathroom in the sequels its multiple rooms this is a double edge sword while its neat to want to see what crazy contraption has in for us behind door number one two or threethere is no real sense of urgency or confinement jeff makes his way through roomtoroom trying to save the victims which include drowning in chopped up pig stuff being frozen to death and being twisted to death yup i said twistedthe film picks up exactly where the second film left off you could basically splice the two films together and watch one long bloody film no pun intended we see eric the detective from the second film chained up in the same bathroom he tries everything to escape his chains and finally comes up with an answer no he doesnt saw off his foot like dr gordon he smashes it with the toilet cover and then breaks it that was the one and only squirm in my seat moment for me as the rest if really just blood and guts yes is the bloodiest of them all youll get foot smashing as i mentioned heads exploding bodies twisting freezing suffocatingso on uses flashbacks to show us things that we didnt know about the first two films such as the fact the amanda has been in on it since the whole dr gordon and adam fiasco she even killed adam instead of him starving which is what we were led to believe still to mention of what happened to dr gordon though but im sure we can all agree on him dying ever wonder why adam and gordon never saw breathing somewhat explained here these flashbacks seemed like they were here just to cover up plot holes found in the first two films yet they work in an odd way it makes you want to pay more attention whenever they go back to the previous films you want to pay attention cause you start to think you may have missed something some of the flashbacks may take away from the earlier films especially with adams deaththe saw theme music is here yet again this time with a couple tweaks its the new remix still has same effect but possibly to a lesser degree builds up to its ending for awhile and once it finally hits youre left sitting there asking yourself if that was suppose to be the films huge twist the twist is okay in it but doesnt even compare to the sizes of our jaws after watching the first two more then its blood and guts its a story about and amanda who become humanized with their emotional connection between the two of them she cares for him and he cares for her there were many things that were left not answered here like who was the blonde girl in dream or what did the letter say that he gave to amanda why the hell did he pour hot wax on one of the tapes will these be answered in number 4 i dont see how they are going to manage getting another film out but they probably will the saw series will always be torturing new victims as long as we still want it to will take you back to the beginning and will please the saw fans and fans of something bloody but dont expect to be surprised by their socalled twist at the end its a real stinker,cruel
first of alllet me just say movie rocked big time there was really not a lot of gore what little gore there was more than made up for suspense the movie was exactly the right length and the producers should be proud of themselves for such a crowning achievement so if all of you obsessive movie fans out there are ready for a thrill a millisecond ride than let the games begin peace outwhatever you pay for this movie i promise you will not be disappointed this movie is for the thrill seekers in us all i love the fact that this movie was thoroughly engaging from start to finish i would vote just about any amount of money that this will win the highest honor of all the award shows for man y years to comebut i do caution you and implore you from the depths of my soul that this movie is n to for the faint of heart enjoy responsibly,cruel
spoilersthe third installment in the saw series finds everyones favorite unsolicited life guru struggling with his new help amanda you see amanda whom we see in flashback dedicating herself completely to after having survived his games from isnt entirely in tune with jiggys altruistic vision you see she keeps setting up the games to be unwinnable bummer that is basically one really long and bloody employee evaluation that sadly she fails the tricky thing about is that its trick is less obvious the twist is not so much a revelation as a culmination many people are left wondering why so much of the movie is spent dwelling on the past two episodes but if youre paying attention youll figure this out easily every saw film has told the story of the players in the game through flashback what at first glance appears to be saw behind the mayhem turns out to be the most important clues to why amanda was chosen for this particular game the death traps this time out are as inspired as the first two though probably a bit too elaborate for a deadly duo to construct the rack is especially stretching it pun intended however the movie is smart in that it shows us that jeff has enough time to save these unfortunate souls before that clock ticks down but hes too focused on who these people are to keep his wits about him while the plot holes are numerous and gaping the story keep moving briskly forward leaving little time to dwell on the questions that afterward plague the brain like how did know jeff wouldnt die grabbing the key how did he know that the other dude would what is his plan b i think people who liked the first two movies will come around to this one eventually its got gore surprises and its brings amanda  story to a logical conclusion,cruel
i know all you hardcore saw fans are going to kill me or click that no i dont agree with you button when you read this but well wasnt really that goodfirstly its hard to do these films you need a good premise which saw had and an even more elaborate plan for any sequels which did very well in that respect no matter how cheap the ending was on the other hand did nothing to liven it upthe story is predictable i figured it out pretty clearly by the second last quarter the characters do soso in terms of acting no creepy intellectual conversation like in aww and the movie on a whole didnt live up to its expectationssure there was some mild suspense and the occasional jumpoutofyour seat moment which ill admit there were a few but frankly thats about it the traps which is why people essentially watch these movies were pretty lame and not powerful enough  nothing to truly make you cringe however theres gore galore the plot had a few rare good points and the ending rocked i really hope this is the last saw for at least these characters because it ended so fittinglyall in all any horror fans or saw fans will definitely appreciate this movie no matter how many faults it carries personally however theres nothing much here its more of a rentalpros gore gore gore cons iffy script notable in the saw franchise weak story but fitting ending,cruel
i just came back from viewing and i must say that it is probably the most intricately woven piece of crap ive ever seen fortunately for my sake i went into the movie with low expectations so i ended up being only slightly disappointed my main problem with the film is that it makes a very tired attempt at masking its characteristics of a snuff film by throwing in a shoddy storyline subpar dialogue and a handful of excessively mediocre plottwists holy s sawpeople youve pieced together not just one but several weak montages of random flashbacks supported by the same lame music for every sequence unimpressed in addition the logical inconsistencies are beyond abundant but the films realism or lack thereof is a factor of considerably less importance in determining the value of this film to be honest i dont have the motivation to expose what a travesty this movie really is because its more than capable of proving this without my assistance in summation i do not regret seeing this film because it has provided me with some much needed blogfodder to the reader i must say i could care less whether or not you see the film or not but consider yourself warned because if you do choose to watch this trainwreck of a motion picture youll have no one to blame but yourself for wasting 8 bucks not since mels passion of the christ has a snuff film attempted to pass for something more whats even more disappointing is that through the unintentional support of viewers like myself and the intentional support of the legions of retards comprising the moviegoing public the saw enterprise will continue to discharge more cinematic dysentery for many a halloween to come whats even more disappointing is that its received a collective rating of over 7 stars am i the only one whos shocked thats it for this review im going to watch something with some redemptive values like monty python,cruel
this movie started out just plain and the same old thing  the movie never really changed basis it stuck with the old formula of games and then death  the plot was really bad and it just didnt do much with the movie i felt like i watched over again  the movie kinda gave some background to why all of this started but it just didnt do enough for me to get me to like this movie  it was like they took both old movies and cut some scenes out of it and put them together and it never they had the characters didnt do much to help the story  they just brought the movie to a circle and it seemed like they had nothing else to do but do try new ideas because they had used everything else ,cruel
if i had gone alone i would have walked out after 10 minutes i felt like i was going to throw up i did like the first movie because it had and interesting story and was a little more plausible than this one right off the bat some random guy is crunching off his foot then a few minutes later is the guy in chains i thought that and amanda were too pretentious the story twisted so many ways that it started to topple there was little known about any of the victims which made it hard to sympathize for either side the thing that bothered me most was the unrelenting gore the wet crunching ripping screaming was nauseating the worst part of all was there was after sitting through all of it there was not one thing redeeming for any of the characters and therefore the audiencenow i have seen some weird gross stuff and it hasnt really bothered me in the past hostel was a bit strong but it was sparse with the torture when it needed to be i enjoyed the jackass movies so im not being prudish if you like pure raw gore then this is your film i on the other hand left feeling nauseous and insulted,cruel
i loved the first saw 910 510 was quite a disappointment but honestly i didnt really expect that much as i knew they were not going to build upon or go in a new direction with a sequel and that it would be just a rehash of old ideas is pretty much the same as ii nothing new added same old territoryalthough this one i found was worse that ii mostly because half of the movie was in flashbacks which really didnt add anything to the current plot or do much for character development of and his apprentice it was just filler because the writerdirector had such a weak story and didnt know what else to doalso charlie clouser the composer created an excellent piece of music at the end of and unfortunately he knows it because he uses it over and over again in this film it was great the first time but it gets tiring hearing it over and over againfinally i also found the quality of acting writing directing also quite shabby when compared to the other two films at least though we did have a strong ending but again one that was totally predictable unlike the great unpredictable ending of ,cruel
horribly boring horribly horrific horribly bloody horribly grotesque horribly acted horribly directed horribly scored horribly filmed horribly long horribly graphic horribly written horribly staged horribly horrible possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen in my entire life that is coming from someone who considers saw the original one of my favorite films of all time is not for even a millisecond clever original or creative people who can bear to see this have serious problems and how this is not on imdbs bottom 100 i dont know i would expect it to be at number one do yourself a favour and never see this film they might make a fourth one  wait a minute they are thats fair scarier than any moment of this terrible filmhorribly bad,cruel
having watched and loved the first then being slightly let down by no2 it came as no surprise that the latest installment of the hugely popular saw franchise is a real stinker unfortunately there will be a forth installment but if you watch number 3 until the end credits as i did then you may ask yourself this question where do they go from here anyway well leave that up to the powers that be as for this one well the less said the better jigs back with understudy amanda and theyre up to the usual tricks some poor schmuck or in this case schmucks are going to be made to jump through hoops of torture only to have to jump through even more as a sign that the producers knew the plot was tissue paper thin the gore factor has been turned up way past 10 to ensure there is plenty of lookaway moments in the end however its all in vain and after all the bloodsplatter and bone breaking we are left with a pretty poor follow up to what was once an original and gripping idea,cruel
why this is a bad movie in 4 easy steps 1 the plot holes there are so many of these that it ends up making the entire movie pointless i wont go into all of them because they are covered in many other reviews but i will never understand how even with the help of his new student can obtain all this torture equipment medical supplies  dead pigs without arousing suspicion or at least going broke and there is now way that he in his sickly state or his student could have installed it all so they must have gotten outside help youd think somebody would ask so uh why do you need this furnace installed in the middle of the room right next to the giant food grinder 2 the pathetic attempt to explain plot holes of the previous movies more specifically the gigantic plot hole in the first saw when we found out that the guy in the middle of the room who we thought was dead for the entire movie was really the mastermind so how did he lie perfectly still for 2 hours and why didnt anybody notice him breathing well according to he injected himself with some sort of heartrateslower right before hand that really makes a ton of sense3 the laughable gore i guess the extreme violence is supposed to be shocking and scary but the nude woman getting her ribs ripped off her body looks so fake that it just makes me embarrassed for the person who designed it apparently this movie takes place in a universe where the only things that occupy the inside of a human body are miles of smallintestine and gallons upon gallons of blood that looks more like watered down ketchup4 the simple plot and onedimensional characters that are impossible to care about between the poor acting the storyline which is secondary to the gore the plot holes and the pointless flashbacks i really have no idea how to begin caring about any character in this film the main characters seem only driven by the fact that their son is dead and that they dont want to die the father is so vengeful that he just seems like an abusive parent anywayit escapes me how anyone could like this movie it is bad even for a hollywoodhorror flick which is a notoriously bad genre to begin with,cruel
its called contrived horror movie which has a contrived horror movie villain who has a contrived horror movie villain voice and is represented by a contrived horror movie puppet that engages in contrived horror movie puppet laughtercan you withstand the torture of sitting through yet another saw movie make your choicesame crap different pile the tag team duo of and his obedient apprentice amanda who have way too much time and money on their hands return in to trap torture and kill more of their hapless victims this time theyve managed to find the time to kidnap a man named jeff who recently lost his son in a criminal accident the perpetrator in the case a witness in the case the judge in the case and oh yeah jeffs wifeand daughter too if youre willing to suspend your disbelief and forget about the chances of and amanda not getting caught and you get a thrill out of watching people get trapped brutally tortured and killed then is your movie there really isnt much point to any of the saw movies besides watching people getting trapped cruelly tortured and killed,cruel
the weak plot is the biggest but not the only problem for this movie the beginning of the movie contains some typical scenarios but it quickly becomes evident that the victims literally could not escape their fates regardless of the amount of will that they mustered honestly im not sure it is even physically possible for someone to rip a solid iron hook through his own jawbone in a minute without any tools  not to mention that you find out later that the escape door was welded shut anyway the tests basically degenerate into ways to torture someone to death without the victim having any chance of escaping  basically false hope i guess the plot was that this was amanda behaving badly against wishes but he is supposed to be pretty omnipotent so it seems a little stretched that he wouldnt have noticed the first time that she did thisthe later scenarios which consume most of the movie revolve around a perpetually angry guy who cannot move on from his sons death in a car accident he is confronted with various tests of his ability to forgive people involved in various ways with the accident the obvious difference from is that this guy holds the fate of each person he encounters in his hands and he can relatively easily save them  in one situation all he has to do is burn his sons belongings in a fire to get a key  but it takes him an inordinate amount of time to accept that he should do this hes just not a very likable guy and he himself is never really in any danger it seems unfair and unthat this man gets to choose who lives and dies  that is supposed to be left up to the victims who wasted their lives in fact his anger is so great and consuming that it should have been him whose will to live was tested by the other aspect of the plot that was boring was the doctor being forced to keep alive or die herself  it just got annoying to shift back and forth between the warehouse life and death scenarios and the deathbed scenes there really wasnt much suspense in the deathbed scenes,cruel
in this second sequel to james wans inventive 2004 lowbudget shocker saw an exdrug addict and a terminally ill psycho once again play sick games on those judged guilty of wasting their lives after the lamentable which upped the gore content whilst overlooking the need for a credible plot i expected the makers of this one to go back to the drawing board but instead they opted to go one step further and deliver the sickest of the series so far and saddle it with the lamest plot possiblethis time around amanda shawnee smith assistant to creative killer tobin bell kidnaps a doctor in order to keep her mentor alive to witness the outcome of one final game amanda who has somehow become a top machinist and designer in between abducting people has created some really nasty traps this time round and these provide the film with its raison dtre to disgust the audience in as many ways as possiblenow im no stranger to gory films and have been known to enjoy some pretty dreadful movies solely on account of their high level of bloodletting so when i say that i found very tedious despite of its extremely graphic violence you can take it as gospel that the film sucked big timebetween the unbelievable death scenes the movie is as dull as ditchwater and very farfetched with spouting more drivel about giving people a second chance at life via his sadistic games whilst amanda looks on adoringly this crap is obviously seen as some kind of justification for his evil doings but when an innocent doctor is threatened with having her head blown off by multiple shotgun cartridges the sickos spiel loses its resonance packed with the annoying grungy mtvstyle editing that is so overused in horror movies these days some really awful acting particulary from shawnee smith and saddled with the most ridiculous twist ending since m night shyamalans signs is the kind of tiresome bilge that is giving the genre a bad name,cruel
lame overhyped waste of time this movies ranks with the stupidity of house of wax texas chainsaw massacre the beginning hostel the hills have eyes or any other road trip gone wrong movie yet another cheap movie made for the specific reason of a mass return at the box office nothing else bad acting stupid traps lame scene design this movie has more flashbacks than an alzimers patient if youve ever seen any of the afore mentioned movies youve seen them all you may also note that every movie made like this is incredibly predictable and never scary just mass amounts of blood which never seems to be scary just grotesque in short this movie was a total waste of timenever see this movie,cruel
the brilliance of has appeared to be clouded by the drug junkie his new intern amanda who is hell bent on murdering people as opposed to testing them breaking all rules in the process may be the budget was insufficient or there was a lack of effort to make this movie a well made movie the lack of anything new in the story line failure of lead characters is written all over the moviewas much better by showing the death of jign end i think it marks the end of the series as well in some of the shots jeff seems to be overacting and not able to act the part even the death of jeffs sons killer has not been shot properly there were too many cuts or edits in that part,cruel
well wellwhat i am going to say about the perfact movie i had ever seenactually there was a high number of twists in the movie which binds the person to see the movie completelyi didnt move since the movie started till the endi will definitely say that if you really understand what the saw says through tha past saw moviesyou would definitely understand this movie too the acting was marvellous  donot forget the he has been a marvellous serial killerthe last thing i would like to say that please if you want to understand something about the psycology of the serial killers do watch  to make some efforts by watching some documentaries on serial killersi have seen manyhope you will do it too,cruel
this movie was sicktwistedbrutal and absolutely brilliant tobin bell once again proves why hes the man this movie should go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time shawnee smith played the role of amanda and did one hell of a job she was absolutely insane the traps in this movie were absolutely disturbing especially the rack which was my favorite also bringing detective matthews back for this movie was a very good idea because he was my favorite character i give this movie 4 stars and i cannot wait for v to come out because these movies are now becoming a halloween tradition is the best of the 3 saws,cruel
s a great horror movie with a very intelligent story and with an excellent stylethe second one wasnt bad but it was more focused on showing extreme violence that in a good storybut is only extremelybut very extremelyscenes of violencethe story is minimumit looks like a 107 minutes video clip with a lot of bloodthis movie has twists but not like the second movie or the first moviehas good atmosphere but sadlyit has a very poor storygore in movies does not bother me when theres a good story as a complementfor examplefinal destination 2but when theres gore with a poor storyit bothers mei do not recommend only watch it if the only thing you want is watching extremely graphic violence without a sense,cruel
first off dont see this movie if you havent seen the first two now this movie is awesome it has twist after twist in the end the acting is much better than the first and there is much more gore than the first two the screenplay plot story writing and script were all intense go see it u wont regret it this one actually explains a lot about he past two yet not enough its obvious there is going to be a saw 4 but there are no guarantees the producer just doesnt cease to amaze me in the first one i was like he cant do anything more we know who hte killer is now the second one i was like he cant do anything more the guys dead and now im like he cant do anything more cuz its just too hard to top that,cruel
i truly loved this film i traveled from mexico all the way to orlando floridas universal studios only for 1 day for the 31st of octuber universals halloween horror nights festivity and spent almost 2 hours on its cineplex at the beginning of the park watching  a lot of people might think that if i was only to stay for 1 day in universal i shouldnt loose time watching a movie but let me tell you that for halloween it was a real treatwas all i ever wanted to see in this episode it has great flashbacks to the other 2 movies and made me think that it was so greatly done that it made look good and to make look good was a hard task but they pulled it off just rightjust like that guy with his chainsoh godthis movie has to make you cringe in your seat it has some hard scenes that i was just into them so muchi my it had some cheesy dialogue too but besides all i loved its twist and everything that had to do with its ending it had me completelyits a must see but make sure to see part 1 and 2was way better than the haunted houses at universal,cruel
i went in seeing with fairly low expectations because from what id seen advertised this movie didnt look like it was going to be too great luckily i was really surprised this installment centers on lynn bahar soomekh who starred in crash a doctor who finds herself awaking to a horrifying situation turns out that tobin bell who is near death from a metastasized brain tumor has chosen her to operate on him with an elaborate device clamped on her neck that will explode once heart rate bottoms out she is forced to perform a surgery on him to help save his life with his assistantprevious victim amanda shawnee smith present meanwhile another man finds himself a part of one of horrible games but this time its up to him to save the lives of others who previously wronged himi enjoyed the first saw film greatly and also thought while a little belowexpectations was still a very good horror film but man this one was really great better than the previous sequel if you ask me the plot is cleverly woven together to leave the viewer wondering throughout the whole movie but it keeps your attention the whole way and manages to be enthralling and consistently interesting the character development was excellent in this film something that i think the previous sequel lacked the characters were sympathetic and a lot of time was spent on their own psychological torment that tied in with the horrible torture that was occurring in front of their eyes just for that i think this film easily surpassed the directing was well done and is very similar to how the previous movies were shot  lots of dark and light colors and damp rusty atmospheresthe violence this time around is just about as nasty as youre gonna get in an rrated movie those who have a weak stomach are advised to avoid this film at all costs i was questioning whether or not the limits were pushed a little too much myself but there is a good story to be found underneath the gore so i think the gratuitousness is forgivable the only thing that annoyed me about this movie was a characters decision near the end of the film  i wont give it away but man i saw really frustrated oh well the rest of this film made up for that minor annoyanceall in all is the best sequel of this series in my opinion at least it was clever unpredictable wellacted and written and relentlessly disturbing for fans of this series and other relentless horror flicks is definitely a must see 910,cruel
half way through the movie my husband passed out i would love to describe at what point in the movie this happened but if youve seen the movie or plan on seeing it youll know what part it is when you get to it he and i watch a lot of grotesque movies and i was very surprised to look over and see him out cold i thought that this movie definitely deserves a 10 if a man like him cant take it we would like to see the ending some day but that might be a while they might have gone a little too far with the grossness of it all but if you take it that seriously then i dont think you should be watching it maybe next time ill leave my husband at home just kidding honey,cruel
i thought it definitely picked up the slack from and 2 theres more emotion more horror and lots more gore and killing which is a must in a horror filmplays such an oxymoron role as he begs this doctor to save his life even after playing god for the past couple of filmsamanda man such a shame that she had to go i think she couldve carried out work even after his deathbut it was an appropriate way for the movie to end and i think the saw series was definitely one to remember because it makes you think this really could happenso watch out and appreciate the fact that you get to wake up everyday or you never knowhello your name id like to play a little game,cruel
im going to make this review nice and short on friday when came out i couldnt help but myself but watch it on the opening day having loved the saw franchise so far i knew that i was in for a treat and oh boyit was quite a bloody treat perhapsat times i felt the film was too bloody but stillit was packed with violence suspense great acting though i wasnt too impressed with bahar scouldve been better and a great script with a nice twist at the end and a nice way of connecting the previous films with reasonable explanationsacting 910 tobin is no one else can play the role i really admired shawnee the girl who played amandashe was great like i said earlier bahar s didnt really do it for me she was like on and off and the guy who played jeff did a great jobcinematography 1010 i love the way this film was filmedvery professional and nicemusic i actually noticed the music in this filmit was creepy and upbeat and i digged the piano part 810 directing better job directing this one than more stylish more gore just one casting mistakeeverything else perfect bravo 1010 script apparently it was written under a week though the ending wasnt as twisted as the first two it was memorable still cool deathsvery creative 910 gore 1010 this is the goriest film ive ever seen if theres a gorier film than that please email me with the title id like to see what beats this film in terms of gorewould i see this movie again yes in fact im watching it tonight with a bunch of friends on halloweennice eh if i was the filmmaker what would i change cast someone else other than bahar si am waiting for an uncut dvd and if anyone has a title of a bloodier filmplease email me with itthank you h nameer the honest critic,cruel
if you loved the first two movies this third instrument and hopefully not the last will not let you down the games become bigger better and more gruesome if you can watch this movie without cringing then theirs no blood in your veins awesome fantastic geniusoh and gory as helldespite knowing a twist would come having seen and it is still damn near impossible to tell what is forthcoming best to gain a knowledge of and before going to see it but when you do i guarantee it will not let you down great storyline great acting great directing great screenplay great everything bring on v,cruel
since 2004 the saw series has been thrilling horror fans around the globe and is hailed by many as a new life for a dead genre the box office intake for each film has increased with each movie made pleasing not only the fans but also the films creators the movies are all made on a very small budget which makes their success even more of a delight after seeing i can safely say that this may very well be the best horror trilogy ever created while v is already set for a release next halloween im not sure that they can ever top what happened in the first three movies is directed by darren lynn bousman and written by the brilliant leigh whannel adam from saw writer of saw and and james wan writer and director of sawin jigs on his death bed his cancer is finally about to end him and he plans for amanda his apprentice to take over once he dies as a sort of going away present plans one final game of grand scale this time around lynn an experienced surgeon and jeff a troubled father become entangled in grizzly web of torture and violence lynn must keep alive until jeff finishes his testswould be the ideal ending to the saw franchise with loads of flashbacks explanations nearly perfect closure and the most gore of any film in recent memory the gore is really piled on here with bones snapping pig carcasses grinding ribcages ripped off  it doesnt get any worse than this but this is perhaps what makes these films so great for horror fans with all of the blood and guts displayed on the screen is a wellplayedout story with plenty of twists and turns and interesting charactersthe traps are also an important part in any saw film and we get plenty of them here including a twisting mechanical crucifix crudely titled the rack a device that attached to ones ribs that tears them out and many others which involve chains shotgun shells and other such horrorsthe film also delves much deeper into the relationship between and amanda and gives the audience a behind the scenes look at what makes these killers tick the acting is superb perhaps the best so far in the series the writers and directors seem to have learned what the fans really want and delivered an amazing horror movie that is an instant classicyoull shield your eyes youll look away in disgust you might even throw up  it really is that nasty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film which makes it all the better while is still my favorite movie of all time is definitely on my top 10 rating  1010,cruel
for anybody that has ever had anything bad to say about the saw movie franchise this movie should shut them up it was a masterpiece from beginning to end dare i say that the fans of this series will have a harder time enjoying the movie because of what they have come to expect from rest assured for all you loyal fans just get through the first 20 minutes with an open mind and i promise it will come to you his plot as the first few scenes seem very unlike his previous works this movie ties up any and all loose ends concerning the series previous movies and brings a finality to the series that not even spielberg lucas craven and cameron put together could revive the only way this series could breath again even 10 years from now woud be if they went even further into his previous work as we can all be completely sure about the fate of from this movie and to think this continuation of the series is truly unlike a lot of movie quite literally a continuation of the series from part one through its current release you will not be disappointed and a word to the weak stomached people you may wanna save your theater treats for after the first 30 minutes of the film or you may end up wearing what you just ate,cruel
this movie was awesome everything from start to finish was great the bloodthe torturewas all made out so wellmere perfection a great end to a trilogy oh mani am still so amazed by this moviei cant wait till it comes out on dvd so i can buy it i personally thought the 2nd saw was horridso i was a little sketched out about seeing thisbut manit was worth itit does remind me so much of the first onethe twiststhe director said it himself  if the trilogy was a fightthe first two were only jabsthe third is a kick in the balls fin excellent go and see it you will be pleasedif your a saw fan that is so go,cruel
why should i see you ask deftly avoiding yet another lame pun on the movies title i didnt see saw or well first of all if you didnt see those two shame on you ill forgive you of course because im nice but shame on you nonetheless both of the previous two saw films are fantastic horror films a real credit to the genre i mean theyre eyepopping in their gore but theres enough of a psychological undertone do always keep the audience guessingit is as you might surmise the same with iii only heavy is the head that wears the crown the team behind the saw films are victims of their own creativity its one thing to churn out meaningless sequels when all youre doing is splattering nubile twits but when youre following saw and you have to fight to reach the bar youve set for yourselfluckily james wan and leigh whannell have done just that the nefarious tobin bell is back and as we saw at the end of hes not alone  his accomplice is the lovely the twisted amanda shawnee smith near the beginning of the movie we see a swat team burst into a room where one of victims apparently exploded from one of the villains diabolical traps this might lead you to think the movie will be a cat and mouse game between and the cops but this notion is quickly quelled when the lead investigator becomes a victim herselfjigs all about games of course so although it takes a little while to get there we finally get to the storys main game a young man wakes up in a large wooden box he eventually is forced through several tests each of which is somehow related to the death of the mans son in an auto accident can the man played by angus mcfadyen of braveheart face his inner demons by way of these tests games carry a moralistic theme meanwhile as we saw at the end of jigsnt doing so well physically speaking so he enlists er coerces a pretty young driven doctor bahar soomekh to keep him alive oh and to entice her to do just that he has amanda fit the doctor with a special collar he wouldnt be without his collars i may have given away a little too much already youre thinking but theres so many twists and turns and sudden shocks that it shouldnt matter much at all the movie is chock full of pulsequickening heartpounding horrors from the creepinguponyou kind to the wham hitting you in the face with a shovel kind that is director darren lynn bousman is quite adept at manipulating the pace of the movie to freak you the heck out do you like closeups of oozing blood limbs and sinews bursting how about brain surgery do you have an affinity for that i wouldnt recommend the movie if youre the kind who has to run from the theater when a needle punctures skin or if youre pregnant  a couple of these jolting scenes might induce laboris the latest in whats become the new wave of horror movies lowerbudget films with small unknown casts that are heavy on shock and plot rather than special effects and pizazz if you enjoyed any of the previous two saw films andor hostel if you think watching an autopsy would be a wonderful first date then shouldnt cause you much worry  well maybe other than holding your hand in front of your face sometimes not that i ever did thatthe ultimate question of course is whether there will be a v since a recent trend is for movie series to contain only three films i cannot unequivocally say that there will not be a fourth entry because although the end does seem final there is at least one major loose end that could be explored,cruel
well i saw this todayand being a horrorgore buff i went in with no expectations i was completely bored for the first thirty minutes my friend with me said the other two scared her but this one didnt even scratch the surface of scary the ending foreshadows yet another movieyawn again the franchise needs to dienow i should have waited for the rental oh well the victims werent fleshed out this timeno pun intendedand the deaths were boring maybe im getting old and movies like this arent interesting to mehence the new crappy texas chainsaw flick ill probably go see 4 just for sts and gigglesso ill shut up now but its really not that greatso just be warned,cruel
this movie is nothing like the first or even second saw movies it was very predictable and merely another excuse to gross the audience out with its overthetop violence after the first two games that people lost i was actually feeling like throwing up a little which has never happened to me the plot was not interesting to me but since i dont want to give away the ending as if you couldnt figure it out for yourself halfway through i wont say anymore about itif you really love the first saw movies then i guess go see this one but if youre a mild fan of the series maybe youve seen one or the other or parts of either dont bother its not worth the price of admission,cruel
personally i think is mediocre and the definitely the worst of the 3 films the suspense intrigue and mystery the first two films is missing in the third film and the visual creativeness that bousman brought to the first sequel is also unapparentthe film is rushed the writing is lazy and uncreative instead of doing these films every year and turning them out quickly take a year off work on the script longer possibly 6 months fine tune it and release v halloween 2008 skipping a year is not going to diminish the popularity of the franchise a weak installment like does diminish its popularity is poised to gross even more than and will be the 2nd highest grossing horror of all time next to the sixth sense a bigger box office total will rescue the weak from taking a hit in popularity but why is it essential to turn these out every year every other year is more than enough horror fans will never go away the western and musicals are long dead pure scifi is rarely produced but the popularity of horrors never wanes,cruel
i was intrigued by the release of saw3 my main hope was that it wasnt a ploy to cash in on the success of the first two films a la nightmare on elm street friday the 13th etc thankfully this isnt the case if you were a little confused by the second one this film goes along way to explaining some of the detail behind the first two films as a whole it also gives more of an insight into rationale and a bigger chunk of amandas history and her involvement the trap scenes are up to if not beyond the standard set in the first two films and trust me if you are squeamish you may find one or two of them hard to watch once again there are main characters that the story centres around and plays with the emotion baggage they are laboured with and it is done to great effect what i found especially good about this film is the pace of it it doesnt let up from the opening scenes until the end it keeps you in suspense and also as with the first two there is the niggling feeling there is one final twist that you may have missed or not expected does it have one well to find out you will have to go and see for yourself suffice to say in my humble opinion if you are a fan of the first two films you will not be disappointed by this one,cruel
i was very excited about the 3rd installment of the saw series i always enjoyed psychological thrillers however the makers of this film totally disregarded the premise set in the previous two films in exchange for a gore fest which at the end really leaves the audience pretty upsettheres so much going on in this movie that is completely ridiculous tobin bells character still being alive lacy performing open head surgery with a power drill etc etc unlike the previous two films this one focuses less on story and more on goretorture scenes if you are a fan of the series because it was an intriguing story stay away from because it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and it wont come from the excessive amounts of goreblood the makers of this film decided to include,cruel
wow wow wow this is such an amazing movie i walked into the theater saying to myself to expect the unexpected but what i expected to be the unexpected was expectxed and what actually happened was way out there it was just an amazing movie i sat in aw the entire movie i went 2 hours early to get in line and sat waiting for them to open the doors and every second of that freezing weather was totally and one hundred percent worth it you have to see this movie it is absolute breath taking and will leave you speechless for hours and hours after you see it to you leigh you are amazing wow you dont even know what a huge genius you are thank you,cruel
this movie was nothing like the first and even the secondthis was completely grotesque the acting was horrible horrible i felt the movie was made just to be made and gross out everyoneyes the movie had twists but they were not the kind that really surprised you like and even the secondthis movie felt rushed and i didnt see any puzzles that were present in the first and second moviesas for the gore and violence this was one of the most grotesque movies ive ever seen im sure the gorefreaks will loving seeing thisdont see this movie it is not even worth a rental,cruel
this movie didnt have a great point it was just about the blood and guts it was terrible i recommend paying 50cent to see this movie is way to much dont ever see this movie in your lifetime if your not into wasting timei dont have much to say about this movie except for the fact that is was horrible i would rather watch 12 hours of barney1this movie had too much blood people only made this movie for money not even for good ratings is the end of saw movies always gonna say theres another movie coming how boring advise dont make the sequel forget about itps don not see this movie ever,cruel
i liked the first sawwas not even watchable this one is a bit better then but still awful the plot is so predictable youll know the ending within the first 20mins of the movie and the movie is just plain boring granted there are some good gory scenes but they are thrown in parts where the movie is slowing down and i cant help but feel like they were thrown in because the script was so lame they needed to keep people interested and get ready for 20mins of flashbacks just to make sure the audience knows what is going onnice idea but it just gets annoying unless you are comepletely retarded or 3 years old you will need these 20min long flashbacks that basically just insult your intelligence people in the theater i was at were literally yelling  we get it already at the screen seriously guys rent this one,cruel
ok i work in a movie theater i preview films before they are released i watched all the saw movies before they have been officially released saw one was great shocking ending number 2 did a great job as a follow up you couldnt ask for much better number 3 seemed like less was going one than in one and two i mean there was plot there was crazy stuff but it didnt go over the edge like 2its a good thrill but in all honesty i was hoping for more you knew the movie was going to end with a twistso why didnt they make it a better one i mean my hat is off to them i couldnt have thought of betterbut it could have been better done the right way,cruel
after a grilsy yet intellectual first movie and an intense psychological duel for the sequel this third entry in the franchise deals with the philosophical aspect of forgiveness serial killer john kramer is on his deathbed but he keeps organizing his twisted games in order to make people value their lives until his final breath he asks an accomplice to kidnap a doctor who must make sure the serial killer survives until his latest victim succeeds in completing a series of particularly intriguing tests as a broken family father must decide whether he forgives those who are responsible for his sons tragic death that also destroyed his life however its not only his latest victim who has to decide to be forgiving as another person is also playing a game without even knowing itthe strongest element of the movie is its philosophical depth when the viewers needs to wonder how they would react under specific circumstances could you forgive a driver who hits your son so badly that he dies how would you feel about a witness to this accident who doesnt intervene what would you do to a judge that spares the reckless driver from a harsh sentence the movie teaches us that we are all monsters inside but have different capacities in controling themthis third entry is also the one with the greatest depth regarding the dying serial killer one understands his motivations better than in previous installments he is open to discuss his points of view on his deathbed which gives us a strangely fascinating yet gloomily repelling insightthe films stunning conclusion manages to surprise yet again as all loose ends are tied together and lead to a dramatic showdown that viewers wont see coming the scriptwriters still manage to add intellectual depth at the most unexpected moments the clever ending is rewarding and already leaves the viewers wanting to watch the next installmentthe philosophical aspect of forgiveness makes this movie stand out the dealy traps are slightly less twisted than before but much more personal for the test subjects thanks to this fresh approach this film is only slightly less intriguing than the strong immediate predecessor fans of the series cant get around watching this film underlines the franchises status as greatest horror film series of the new millennium,cruel
loved it loved it loved it nicely tied up all the loose ends although few and far between really liked how everything in and 2 was so ingeniously wrapped up pity had to die though despite the macabre and horrific nature of his crimes he gave all the ready and willing victims a choice and they all chose wrongly and paid the ultimate price really glad i binge watched 12 and 3 everything made perfect sense and the planning involved to execute his game although mindboggling at times was sheer brilliance these 3 are going to go down as some of my alltime favourite scary movies and are a worthy addition to anyones scary movie collection 9510,cruel
saw should have stopped after i and 2 by episode 3 my interest dwindled the torture scenes were pretty much being recycled as they tried to come up with more imaginative ways to make the victims suffer sadistic in a way,cruel
finally saw all the saw films prior to seeing as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year during a quieter and less intensive period heard a lot about the films good and bad but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expectthe films as an overall series are a very mixed bag the original saw had a great premise and while it was problematic it was still pretty good and one of the best in the series had its own problems but it was still one of the few followups to be just as good and have what made the first click as well as it did however whereas there was the sense that the novelty was still there with in its the opposite not just gone but almost done to death it just goes over the top in some elements and forgets what elements were instrumental in the series appealis not unwatchable by all means credit is due for providing origins for one of those characters where his modus operandi impulse and justification sets him apart from most characters of his type and his enthusiastic helper the music score is suitably eerieactingwise the film is also performed surprisingly quite well especially a suitably tortured angus mcfadyen and a bonechilling tobin bell if there is one thing that hasnt lost impact and continued to not do so its bell donnie wahlberg continues to show that he is a vast improvement over cary elwes but he doesnt have much to do hereon the other hand a big problem with is that it isnt that disturbing or puzzling there arent the truly ingenious traps just as imaginative demises or the devilishly clever twists seen previously primarily the twist ending of the first they are instead replaced by rambling exposition a flashbackwithinflashback framework that just confuses the story and the viewer and a distastefully overblown overreliance on violence and gore it was just overkill and actually made the film exhausting and almost unintentionally funny in placeswill admit that the script was not a strength in either of the first two films but even they werent this flat or insultingly contrived at least too they had clever and intriguing moments and were easy to follow this cannot be said for the script for the story is basically a retread thats both overdone and anaemic and has little sense of unease or suspense the expositionflashbackheavy structure and the very flawed execution of it hurting it severely it also multiplies any credibility lapses and ridiculousness of before by a hundred and doesnt really go to anywhere much until the climactic moments which felt so unresolved it was almost like a cheatmissed the effectively claustrophobic look of the first saw and the more elaborate and no less creepy one for the second film here the production values just look rushed and amateurish especially in the editing bahar soomekh does her best as lynn though believing her as a surgeon is a bit of a stretch the direction doesnt seem as assured and the film really could have done with being 1520 minutes shorterin conclusion okay for saw series completests but neither disturbing or puzzling 410 bethany cox,cruel
ok i bought the dvd with the first 7 saw movies the first was decent when i t years ago watching it last year no more surprises so i thought it was just ok a c rating for a b movie 2 sucked full on crappy lighting cinematography editing acting dialogue convoluted story just plain garbagenow 3 the best part about this movie was the chained guy and the chained female cop straight up copy from hellraiser and i enjoyed donnie smashing his foot next time they should try donnie smashing his face besides these scenes this movie is garbagethe cinematography was not as bad as 2 but still amateur point and shoot the editing is quick and garbage the lighting is crap the acting is horrible the characters are garbage nobody acts like this tobin bell seems like a decent actor but i hate his voice and his character and dialogue is garbage shawnee smiths character is garbage if shes crazy then make her character crazy but then how the hell could they pull off all the kidnappings and all the equipment and set up it is impossible it cant happen and that is where most of the problem is how the hell did she get into the female cops apartment without the cop noticing think about it where were these abandoned locations the only way you can have access to locations like this is if you have a film studio paying to rent them and shooting the film but not if youre a wackjob on a mission to teach some people with emotional problems a lesson on how to appreciate life the female doctors acting was ok not great and the husband who lost his boy this guy was plain horrible the frozen woman was ok but then we get a scene of her completely frozen very stiff the judge ok the black guy well he acted terrifiedthe story and the twists now im sure someone can come up with something better than thislast two weeks i watched the first 8 hellraiser movies first 2 were decent because of the stories the rest were below par mix bag of i dont know what but at least all of them were better than or 3 the older i get the more i want stories compelling stories with characters that relate and actors that can portray plausible situations within the context of the film and do not do that these stories only happen because the screenwriter wrote them and the production team went ahead and filmed and produced the product for our supposed entertainment i cannot believe that some said hey how the hell did some sick guy and a drugged outwacko chick pull off all these sets and traps and kidnap all these people lots of equipment all around is jig independently wealth so some points for the chain kills near the beginning of the film minus stealing scenes from hellraiser this film is a complete failure f 1 star garbage,cruel
this movie is just awful there is a short 9 minute version of the first saw movie from to 2003 that was great movie very scary 10000000000 time better then this crap 004 is better movie and that is awful is a better movie and that is awful this movie is badly written the ending is awful do not see this movie it is a wast of money it is also a wast of time it is not scary at all it for people who have to see a lot of fake blood and that is the only way they can enjoy a movie this movie is an overrated pile of pooh pooh i need more lines and i am running out of things to say this movie is pooh pooh pooh pooh i tell you pooh pooh,cruel
the great thing about is that if you skipped out on the first two outings you will not be lost the bad there is not much to see here i mean if you like your limbs twisted ripped apart and frozen you could certainly do worse picks up from where ended this time amanda is apprentice and matter is taken into her hands to amandas dismay life is ticking away like his heart meter this can only mean that lynn an elite neurosurgeon will step up to the plate and get up and running in the meantime has implemented torturous traps which eric leads this sounds like a pretty convoluted and incoherent story line but is really the former surprisingly i found the plot to not meander and i found it pretty consistent of course the breakneck pacing and mtvstyle jump cuts get tiring but enough questions are answered to keep saw fans satisfied what is refreshing this time around is that there is more attention paid to the characters we learn more about john amanda and even eric now this is not some shakespearean character study but i give director darren lynn bousman some creditthis also seems like soap opera saw running a good two hours as opposed to the standard 90 minutes of mayhem this is john kramer at his most personal for gorehounds there is plenty of gratuitous spill here there are at least two traps that will make you vomit as much as john kramer yet bousman lowers the body count this was a smart move because the script comes first then the gore screenwriter leigh whannell definitely does not disappoint in those categories while he minimizes the amount of dismemberment he does not minimize it enough when the film arrives at the the rack trap the violence becomes masturbatory masturbatory to the point of some traps being copouts it seems like everyone is made to go through hell even when they won or already underwent their missions what also does not work is complicating erics backstory too many people are involved too many consequences for a particular incident and etc it seemed like whannell wanted to make this the twin towers of ville there is just so much payment and chaos it does not come off as profound it just comes across as misanthropic and utterly gratuitous what i did find refreshing is how different this film felt compared to and saw was a remake of the first but not as interesting the exposition was so mindnumbingly dull it was a chore to sit through the traps made up for it but we come to saw for a decent plot line and some traps we do not just take the gravy and leave the mashed potatoes in we get more exposition than the first but it is more interesting and dynamic the pieces really fit in a while it sounds like i admired which i did to an extent it is something i will not see again this is csi level of entertainment and it is nearly made on that budget you will get some cool insight into the characters the ending is pretty climactic or should i say anticlimactic and oh yes there will be blood as promises it just feels like too much i would advise a rental if you really need to seek out tobin bell latest outing,cruel
this is the second sequel to the gruesome horror movie saw where dr lynn denlon is kidnapped and locked in a room with the cancerridden and his apprentice amanda the doctor is forced to keep alive so that he could see another one of his game victims jeff complete his deadly gamethe story uses the same elements as in the previous two films mindplaying games revenge and people in despair there is no shortage of blood gore and graphic scenes which make this more of a gory rather than a scary horror film like the previous movies this sequel is very disturbing  just the bloody intro will give you an impression where this sadistic film will take youthe acting was pretty good but the rest of the movies elements is just dark and depressing im sure most even some horror movie fans dont find downright sadistic and gross plot elements captivatinggrade d,cruel
by 2006 the nowpasse torture porn subgenre was in full swing the producers of saw were enjoying the profits made from cheaply and easily grossingout morbid audiences with icky gore and people screaming its not clever and its not even remotely classyclocking in at just under two hours this is the longest of the saw series but the constant flashbacks that bloat that running time are already becoming very tiresome and gives the movie the feel of a tv show chopping the heavy plot into vignettes is not very theatrical or interestingwith still at large and donnie wahlbergs angry cop now missing the cops begin to suspect that jiggy has an accomplice this is all forgotten about by the fiveminute mark as the movie then sidetracks into a story about a man who has lost his son in a car accident and wishes for retribution jiggy arranges for the retribution to happen but advises him to save the people responsible from gruesome death instead of letting them diejiggys judgement and justification is already becoming dubious and morally suspect by this point i half expect him to start kidnapping and settingup people for watching too much nickelodeon or flying too many kites the morality should go both ways if jiggy is subjecting so many people to unbearable agony then he should have experience and knowledge of much much more than simply dying of cancer and surviving a car crash who does he think he is ultimately hes just as bad as the people he is judgingthe story is worthy of a higher score but as usual it is bogged down by horrendous editing cheap photography filled with fake filters a loud sound design filled with nonsensical effects and characters who do not think logicallyit reminded me a lot of hellraiser only with none of the magic unfortunately for anyone watching the whole series its vital that you digest every minute overwrought plot point,cruel
upon having myself my very own saw marathon to catch up on the horror series i missed out on i have decided to end it here the reason in all honesty i no longer felt comfortable with the way the series was headingbut lets start at the beginning picks up where the second left off with detective eric matthews still chained in the infamous unused bathroom featuring the corpses of past saw characters here the film promised a lot as i enjoyed donnie wahlbergs irritable takes no nonsense portrayal from the second film but with a bang boom and snap the character just disappears from the story the film is then split in two following a father going through a series of traps in test for forgiveness and john himself being treated for his cancer firstly lets tackle the most well known section of any saw film the traps as latest are presented it is very clear the makers were now going for shock over substance this reliance does not bode well for the final film as i personally found myself cringing and looking away hoping that these elongated gory scenes would hurry and finish i no longer had the fixed morbid curiosity the first two played on so well the horrified thought process of what would i do in that situation was gone that creepy intelligence the first two had replaced with dumb slasherlike kills my first disappointment the acting which i didnt expect to be topnotch considering this was a third installment to a horror franchise wasnt especially atrocious but it wasnt exceptionally good either tobin bell is as meh as ever and from what small amount of time donnie wahlberg had was entertaining due to his understanding of his own character other returning members of the cast include dina meyer who was unforgivably underused and shawnee smith who was unforgivably overused new members of the cast are extremely average most memorably angus macfayden who portrays the tragic father character mentioned previously i must say the actor deserves an award for playing one of the most unlikable protagonists in cinema history everything this character does is idiotic and frustrating macfayden seems to do the best he can to work with such a horrible horrible part but its just not enough my second disappointmentas much as i despised the disgusting trap sub plot i cant say anything better for the ill plot itself although initially interesting tense and a breath of fresh air from watching pointless suffering it quickly turned to nonsense and became quite a bore i dont know why the makers are adamant on the audience caring for the villain i was far more interested in bahar soomekhs brain surgeon present but perhaps thats a matter of opinion but as a trademark eventually these subplots came together in a twisting revelation delivered in the final ten minutes of the film ill admit i spent much of the film watching only to hear a reprise of that oh so good hello zepp theme traditional in the saw films but this payoff was so lazy confusing and layered it only came across as humorous and silly my third disappointment and as you know three strikes and youre out overall its a poor film and the fact that the saw films were reduced to this is sad although i cant expect anything else from a cheaply made studio ordered sequel only made for money over purpose of story i still expected something anything that would be enjoyable but no the story is flawed the characters are awful and the trapstests are almost unwatchable in regards to gore horrible if youre thinking of watching this after you enjoyed the first two do yourself a favor stop there and remember the series as two successful clever films and not as the torture porn ridiculous series it has become today,cruel
if its been awhile you need to review the events of 2005 before starting on this one this will help explain the prologue which is really only a tidying up of a teased sequel starring donnie wahlberg as eric matthews that does not really happen here next has disappeared along with his new apprentice amanda shawnee smith the puppetmaster behind the cruel intricate games that have terrified a community and baffled police has once again eluded capture and vanished while city detectives scramble to locate him doctor lynn denlon bahar soomekh and jeff angus macfadyen are unaware that they are about to become the latest pawns on his vicious chessboard according to the home video sleeve scriberthis saw does not have the earlier films structure we begin with a series of violent torture sequences that seem to have no connection the do become connected but after you care as usual for the series the gore is or should be considered xrated the story would have worked better if one suspenseful story strand had framed the film and provided a foundation with the rest providing pieces to the overall puzzle it would have been interesting if the contest between tobin bell as john kramer and ms soomekh provided the foundational story with mr macfadyens quest leading up to the climax and final revelations 102606 darren lynn bousman  tobin bell shawnee smith angus macfadyen bahar soomekh,cruel
the makers of construct the film the way a preschool child makes a block tower for the first hour is not only more freaky than saw but it is one of the freakiest of slasher films with each new block placed on top of another the scenario gets more extreme until one block too many causes the whole thing to collapse the last twenty to thirty minutes of the film are a clumsy error of epic proportions it is hard to say whether the makers were looking for away to bring an end to the saw series or a way to continue it all i can tell you is that what starts of pretty good turns into the kind of thing that makes you loose complete faith in james wan just another young mind who had a brilliant idea which he took too far and is now six movies jigs dying and his apprentice kidnaps a young nurse straps an explosive device around her neck which will go off the minute heart rate stops that doesnt give her a lot of time to save his life meanwhile on the other side of his layer next victim is about to play the game the one advantage that had over saw what that we got to meet himself not the puppet jobin bell did his best to bring a large dose of hannibal lector to the role something which he was not able to do twice in he is no more than a piece of rotting flesh spewing badly scripted lines i blame the script writers more than bell for the lousy characterization of jign this moviethe climactic twist is the most frustrating part of the film because not only do you see it coming but it wrecks the movie had the filmmakers thought things through a little better may have been good enough to make the idea of v sound promising for once id like to see a horror franchise in which each entry is just as inventive as the previous,cruel
a horror movie with brains splashing all over your feet as they fall out of someones skullokay now its officially gratuitous begins the ruination of the saw franchise not only is it needlessly gory original saw writers leigh whannell and james wan try to connect the existing saw movies in a grande trilogy that almost works but only succeeds in pulling back the curtain on the skullsplitting intrigue that drove the original sawshawnee smith who keeps getting hotter with each saw reprises her role as amanda and it is revealed that her role in all three saws was more integral than any of us had imagined backstory flies all over the place like intestines at a werewolf party seems that after amanda escaped the infamous headbeartrap in saw she was so thankful to tobin bell for alerting her to the error of her junkie ways she became his bottom bitch and has been aiding him with gags ever since  including the very first one with leigh whannell and cary elwes in sawtmi dudes dial the backstory down to oceans twelvepicks up exactly where left off  donnie wahlberg as detective matthews chained to a pipe in the movies most powerful scene which hearkens back to the hook that separated saw from its knifekill ilk  selfmutilation for the sake of escapeunfortunately as with ii after the stomachchurning opening its downhill on a tricycle with no brakes jiggie doll eckeckecking his little spiralred cheeksthe connecting tissue in involves two stories nurse lynn bahar soomekh must keep alive through a graphic head operation with the threat of a bullet necklace going off in her face if she lets him die and jeff angus macfadyen wanders through a house of traps where people involved in his sons accidental death are in midtorture his decision to either forgive them or let them die  but forgiveness will bring him one step closer to the ultimate killer of his sonthat microcassette gag has become tiresome beyond redemption at every trap jeff finds that infamous cassette that explains his conundrum but the traps and situations are now so complex it wears on our senses the question becomes not how to escape the trap but how ingeniously the trap was set up people have to be stalked studied captured inserted into their marvelously deadly traps which have to be constructed from scratch from no existing designs meticulously working on timers with all their escape points nullified so that there is no escape psychologically or physically the logistics are mindbogglingand thats when the nonsense of it all bleeds through even if amanda was the most ambitious serial killer in the world she still wouldnt have time to set all this up avoid the authorities pay the electric bill and still have time to apply makeup and lip gloss and keep her hairstyle so streetcred skankyand when we see convulsing and vomiting in pain on his makeshift hospital bed we recall our own human frailties think about those stomach aches that throw your whole day into disarray a virus gas kidney stone botulism renal failure a thousand sicknesses could double you over and make you a wailing child again and you cant focus on anything except stopping the mindcurdling pain you cant even plan ahead to lunch  yet whose pain levels are immeasurable as he reminds us constantly can still summon the will to concoct ridiculously innovative methods of killing other people to teach them a lesson insanity or genius it just doesnt gel with what we know of human pain in the midst of pain it is impossible to think of inflicting it on others  we want to selfishly stop our own pain firstadmittedly jigs a psychopath but most psychopaths we encounter in knifekill flicks are in prime health jign the throes of convulsions would still feel physical trauma as a human would that he used his ingenuity to outfit his dank little dungeon with methods to curb his pain rather than spread pain outwards through amandahis first gags in saw were in the early stages of his disease so his psychosis could be accepted as that of a dying man erroneously mistaking killing others as grasping for a last spark of vitality but here every semblance of reason and motivation has been lost due to his near death conditiona powerful surprising ending does nothing to curb our pain and we know that even though ties it up with grand deaths all over the place the franchise will limp on fueled by contrivancein the words of monty python oh youre no fun anymore,cruel
i saw this installment originally in the theater but this is the first time i watched the extended unrated version i hear theres also an even longer third version thats a directors cut but this is getting confusing in the third chapter jigs literally at deaths door so he has his devoted assistant amanda shawnee smith kidnap a young female surgeon named lynn to force her to operate on him to save his life the doctor and her husband jeff are currently facing a rocky road in their marriage so jeff is now simultaneously forced to undergo a series of tests in maze of horror and death contraptions with lynns own survival hinging on the outcome jeff has also been living a life full of anger and bitterness ever since a drunk driver killed his son and his journey through torture chamber may hold the key to confronting the man who was responsible this entry has a few good ideas and boasts some of the most inventive death traps in this series and we also get to feel some sympathy for and his dedicated apprentice amanda a slight drawback may be that  at least with the extended unrated edition  there is way too much overabundance of blood gore and guts to the point where it takes a little away from the effectiveness of the film as a whole even for a saw sequel however this is a saw movie after all and all things considered its a strong enough entry that should satisfy fans of the series to one extent or another 12 out of ,cruel
i am a big fan of the saw series and i was naturally anticipating to be perfectly honest it really was the worst out of the seriesthe horror and gore is on top form and the various traps that a fluent in the movie are inventive but my problem with this film is that it is too relentless and i dont remember a single character surviving even though there was many chances for a few of them to live through the story it kin of got repetitive because i knew that everyone was going to diemy other problem is the painfully irritating main character who seems to take forever to make up his mind on whether to forgive the people responsible for his sons accidental death then just as he decides the good option they end up dead that really annoyed mewith a franchise like this you have to tread very carefully that the story doesnt dwindle and fizzle out and i thought the series was dying out with this movie because it didnt offer us anything new or anything to care about the only difference is we find out a few twists at the end but wasnt enough for medont be disappointed however as saw 4 was much much better,cruel
i honestly believe it is such as shame that this so far good franchise was damaged by this pathetic excuse for an entry into film series the first two films of the series relied a lot on suspense and scares but disgustingly this film does not it transforms itself into a mindless gorefest that seems to be trying to make people throw up rather than provide them with suspense and scares from the word go the film will disappoint many fans from each turn the ones complex and intriguing plot is replaced with a bmovie storyaside from providing the viewers with a good scare and of course a good time i believe this film also fails on many levels including writing pacing and character development the writing in this film is filled with clich and predictable dialogue that seems to be used in every horror film for example some of the conversations between amanda and lynn seem bland and as i said earlier clich the characters in this film are developed poorly and seem to be very uninteresting and unrealistic this is scene with apprentice amanda on many occasions amanda will suddenly become angry and seconds later start to cry and then revert to a neutral emotion i mean come on that is unrealistic even for a movie aside from amanda the character of jeff is developed hardly ever and if he is i think it is rather done poorly as the only real development we see of him is in some crummy little flashbacks that i think are rather forced into place rather then carefully placed inaside from issues with characters the film also possesses problems with the plot the plot is developed very poorly and seems to jump forward prematurely as well as plot pacing issues the very simplistic plot which does not do justice with the plots of the first saw or even aside from these negatives there are thankfully a few positives that unfortunately are smothered by the horrible negative factors of the film on the light side the film does have some very good gore which will satisfy gore hungers but not me and also does have some rather different and far more complicated traps then seen in the first two films these traps did provide me and i suppose everyone else with a sense of progression with and amandas work and of course there engineering skillin conclusion i would recommend this film only for hardcore fans of the series and lovers of gore it is also fair to note that this film is far more violent than its predecessors and i would not recommend it for anyone below the age of 14 as they may be disturbed by the violence and torture summing up i will give this film a 3310,cruel
here we go again jigs back does more tortureand bores us to death with itdull story meets an even duller twist that was less a twist but more a side notethe first was good but thats where it should of ended now we have sequels and ripoffs not to mention a horrible new genre of horrorthat do nothing but suffocate theaters with crap in place for real filmthis heap of sht can go right back up the dogs ass it came fromrating  of 4 entertainment negative  of 5,cruel
when i watched i said to myself this couldve been better but after watching i changed my mind about that was mediocre but not the best one in the series so far the only time it felt like the original saw feeling is the first 20 minutes of the movie after that it felt the movie landed into somebody elses hands the gore in this one was amazing and brutal but flashing all that blood to me did not cut it for me the flashbacks were cool but the current events were just bland i did not like johns two new victims at all because they didnt feel like they were connected into the story the acting was decent and the actress shawnee smith played amanda was incredibly hot in this one i notice there were a lot of mini cliffhangers throughout the movie which is a sign for the fourth one which i totally liked but what turned me off the most was the ending im not going to spoil it for you but lets put it this way my reaction to the first ending whoa omg i didnt see that coming my reaction to the second ending really damn i never thought of that my reaction to the third ending what cmon you gotta be kidding mesee so anyways if you are a fan of the saw movies its ok to see it its not gonna kill you or anythingor will it,cruel
finally great third part as i can see most of us think the sametheres a lot of great twists in the filmin my opinion the acting is finei mean i liked all of the actors without exception in this filmthis time dr gives new life for a man howplease see this film after the firstand second partand you will understand an important messagewhat will be very useful to youthe concept is not less than earlierthat is why im very excited about the 4th parts qualitythis time lot of gory scenes help to feel the hell in this filmbut this time the film not just gorydirtyand perversetooand enough realistic to makes you scare and fearmaybe to think,cruel
the first saw film wasnt the best movie and it had severe flaws in the directing acting and scriptwriting but its plot wasnt very derivative although influenced by se7en and other such thrillers it was a pretty damn good plot line in a time when horror movies seemed to mean nothing else but crappy remakes of japanese or korean films with busty blonds and pale anorexic little children possessed by evil spirits it was a fun movie with some good gore and some very interesting ideas and was overall watchable if you turned off your critical brain for a few hours an above average film overall after months and months of critical acclaim and popularity that seemed to spread like a disease we got the second saw which was mediocre at best and then we got this the very next year while initially appealing sadly continues the downward spiral into mediocrity that had so plagued the second film after more than one viewingwhats wrong with it id say its just weak the saw movies may get brandied about on radio talkshows and newspaper clippings as being the most extreme outrageous violent movies out there but if you walked into this one looking for blood and guts youll be rather disappointed this is actually the weakest of the three saw films not only in terms of quality but also in terms of goforthethroat brutality and plot twists compared to the madcarnival thrill ride of the first saw which only featured two men alone in a room by the way this film is positively neutered sure it seems menacing at first especially the fabled brain surgery scene but once youre used to it you realize just how blunt this beasts teeth aremy main example here is the games featured here the traps on display here are oddly restrained the first movie featured an intriguing spinetingling trap involving a man who cut his wrists regularly even though his life was perfectly fine our suicidal friend was locked in an iron cage barbed wire crisscrossed over every bare inch of space inside it to make it out alive hed have to cut himself again and again on the spiky barbs to reach the door which would close forever once an hour was up compare this to the first main trap featured in  we have a naked woman tied to some poles above her in an icecold freezer dangling there like a pendulum as our hero enters the frigid prison his task is tosqueeze in between some bars and fetch a key behind them ripping off some skin on his face as it touches the frozen bars excuse me but i expected far far more from a movie like this you could tell me that the hooks trap from the beginning was good and maybe it was but it still doesnt hold a candle to the barbed wire stunt from the first movie either way mainly serving as a poor ripoff of that one if even that its pathetic really that all they could come up with here was either a boring rehash of an older trap or a weak attempt at being lol wtf gross the pig guts trap  lame the final trap  the rack  is very good on the contrary boasting the dark tortured genius that we all know the saw films can pull off and its a shame they only really let loose for 5 or 10 minutes out of the whole movieyou could say that focuses more on the plot with jeff and his crisis and all but thats crap these movies are torture horror films and theres no point in watching them aside from seeing the cool traps and watching people die theyre like the cyber generations friday the 13th saga as much as leigh whannel wants to jazz things up and make this movie seem better than it actually is with the fancy hollywood gloss and polishedtothebrim special effects that lose the charm and allure of the more savage primal ones from the first movie also is far far too pretentious and takes itself way too seriously this is a neutered film that lacks the power and raw unbridled anger and conviction of the first one and its a damn shame although it was certainly bound to happen sooner or laterthe plot is a bit of a departure from the more pugilistic and straightforward ones in the past two movies and this time we get a much healthier and stronger dose of moral goodness stuffed down our collective throats this kind of thing was always cheesy but here its taken to absurdly dizzying heights and i cant even take it anymore in the first two movies we got some similar ideologies but never were they as fleshed out as they are here and never were they as clich and boring as they are here in traditional saw fashion though the final 20 minutes of the film are quite gripping and endearing and at least the ending of this one is far better than the ending to the previous sequel and i doubt most people expected it to end this way there are indeed good things to be found here but the problem is that theyre buried beneath a rather sterile preprocessed horror movie a film that relies too much on special effects and trying to gross us out i did give it a 35 though as this movie is still genuinely watchable and onpar its just a severe disappointment,cruel
just finished watching this film and as i knew the stories for the first two but didnt watch them i am not a fan of the series im just reviewing this film as a film on its own the first scene makes you cringe but the rest of the film doesnt everyone was telling me how sick this film is but after the first scene i just thought it was a wasted movie i am not a fan of blood and guts in movies but it didnt make me sick watching this film and also its not clever the main story is pointless i hated it and cant understand how you can like a film like thisawful awful film gore is not cool,cruel
before you go see this movie just realize this is nt the thriller with horrortendencies like part one was this movie brings a lot more gore to the screen flesh is being ripped ribs are pulled out arms and legs are twisted and manages to beat part 2 in terms of sickness and thus becomes the goriest film of all 3 is that a bad thing not for mestarts off slow even though with already a few tortures but as soon as you see and amanda again for the first time you know this movie isnt going to disappoint this time the tone is much more put on the tortures itself rather then the actual murder and thats one of the things that makes this movie interesting to watch because it never leaves you boredmy first guess was that part 3 of saw was going to progress more into the typical clich psychological horrorthriller thing with stuff youve seen already but instead the creators aimed more for a more hardcore horroraudience with obviously more violence and gore and even a hint towards the horrorclassic hellraiser and gore and violence is not the only thing that this movie presents it also unvolds a clever plot as the story develops towards the end of the movie like only a movie like saw can delivereven so it has to be said that you have to be a sawfan to fully enjoy this or at least a fan of the genre for those who arent leave out your lunch before watching this movie,cruel
sequels are a funny thing or a tragic thing depending on who you ask it seems that the formula for sequels in hollywood is more is more not less is more so with saw that formula equates sicker traps sicker games and of course more blood in that regard the third movie is a completely logical stepwhat i liked about this movie is the whole set that they have built its a really disgusting warped reality with rotten pigs disgusting smells i imagine and plenty of rooms with sick games this time two people have been kidnapped for apparent and not so apparent reasons the formula is basically the same although the characters are beginning to reach the end of their arc amanda is obviously deranged and jign worse shape than ever also thats one of the things i found quite admirable that the filmmakers were actually able to keep any interest in what was basically rather simple characters to begin with sure had a motivation and an idea but that didnt exactly make him threedimensional but here i find myself actually caring what happenswhat i didnt like so much was that the level of disgusting effects and gore has been turned up another notch or two most of all i felt it was quite unnecessary the amount of blood in the first movie was quite enough the amount in the second movie was pushing it and here its excessive i guess most of the audience at least the real fans wont think so though so i understand why they do itthis is not a bad movie its not as entertaining as the first two though mostly because the charm of the concept is really beginning to wane i would say that this should be the last movie in the series but i know that there is already at least one more film in the making i doubt that i would watch that one though to me the sawfranchise has been milked enough and then some after this movie i rate this 510,cruel
i just viewed this for the first time the other night i had seen the first twoi loved the first one a true masterpiece for the horror genre and one thatll always stand alone no matter how many horror flicks youve seen the first one has major originality they did quite a few things that hadnt been done before and did other things that had been done but did them betteri enjoyed the second one but not nearly as much as the first onespoiler time killing off the cop dina meyer big mistake she played such a small role in the other two they barely had enough time for character development breaking johns tradition of giving someone a way out even if it was profoundly difficult was also a mistake then theres the underlined thing here i must confess that im a guy and like other guys out there we hate seeing the hot woman get all messed up like that she must like dying in a gruesome fashion in movies starship troopers dont worry dina someone out there will feel bad like me and resolve not to let you die off like that amanda huh what ill admit shes not the most likable person in this one in fact she was rather irritating shes such a nut job in this one that its kind of a relief to see her get whacked at the end i just wonder why they bothered to kill her off right then and therejohn last but not least we get to himself why did they bother to go to all the trouble to save him just to kill him off too i think this could have easily been good for one more sequel if not for thatone last critique here spoilers again the two plot twists the bit with amanda and the bit with the jeff just really seemed tired and unnecessary maybe one of the two would have been both but in this case more just wasnt better i think they could have done without one of themnow with all that in mind this was a good movie i really enjoyed the new traps and the new goodies they had the last one they showed was particularly ingenious gruesome but ingenious the twisting of the mechanisms was particularly hard to watchi hope theyre able to pull off v,cruel
all i want is a scary movie dont show me the weird love between the characters all i want is a scary movie dont tell me how the freaky killers grew up and find for them so reasonable excuses to kill so many people because a lot of stupid movies have done before like perfume a story of a murderer all i want is a scary movie dont give me a open ending dont make the monster never die we need a strong quick and bloody hardcore end like the hostel all i want is a scary movie but not the saw 4 the only reason i give this movie a vote 5 but 4 cause its much better then the so actually all i want is just a simple scary movie is it too difficult all i wanttill the 10th line,cruel
the new horror chiller wraps up the bonegrinding bloodsodden grand guignol torture trilogy with an unimaginative convoluted ending that suggests mankind prefers to kill rather than forgive each other for their crimes the original 004 qualified as a provocative but unsavory whiteknuckled exercise in surprise suspense and sadism that established new standards for fright films its clever but lackluster sequel 2005 degenerated into a stylistic but repetitious drill in suspense and sadism with more sophisticated deathtraps minus the visceral quality of its brilliant predecessor sinks far lower than in its pretentious commentary about mankinds murderous penchant for mayhem the latest installment literally scrapes the bottom of the barrel in a slaughterhouse of stellar special effects that dont so much frighten as sicken mind you if the sight of a man trapped at the bottom of a giant vat as the groundup liquidified remains of maggotinfested pigs nearly drowns him strikes you as amusing then youll crave this obnoxious nihilistic belowaverage sequel unhappily those who demand interesting characters andor victims intriguing plot twists and turns and an ending that delivers a slambang upbeat sendoff will condemn as both predictable and pedestrian worse if you missed the first two saw movies a lot of the storylineseveral flashbacks about the first two filmsmay strike you as incomprehensiblescenarists leigh whannell and james wan who coscripted saw have written an elaborate morality tale about the futility of revenge not only is the notorious tobin bell playing lethal games with a fresh batch of hapless victims but also he is testing his homicidal apprentice amanda shawnee smith of tvs becker who wants to carry on his serial slaughtering ways the plot whirls on where shut off exjunkie amanda dons a dead pigs head and kidnaps all the cops from the first sequel and sticks them in various bondage contraptions designed to kill them again if you skipped the first two saw sagas most of these early scenes will baffle you of course coherence and credibility arent important where most horror movies are concerned horror movies are designed to make you scream and the torture devices that amanda claps these poor slobs into will make you shutter at her callous disregard for life for example the corrupt evidenceplanting cop finds himself shackled by the leg and left to die in the same grungy toilet from the first movie instead of cutting off his ankle with a rusty hacksaw he smashes his foot so thoroughly that he can slip the mangled remains out of the shackle afterward things get progressively worse or depending on your repressed sadomasochistic tendencies progressively betterin the antiheroic was in bad shape as a result of his inoperable cancer in he spends the entire movie on his death bed and suffers from horrible headaches he dispatches amanda to kidnap an emergency room surgeon lynn bahar soomekh of mission impossible 3 to relieve his headaches by boring holes into his skull mind you it isnt important that anybody could survive this kind of surgery and still be as fiendishly clearminded as jigs of course poor lynn finds herself in the unenviable position of performing surgery with a steel collar encircling her neck amanda has designed lynns noxious necklace of sorts and equipped it with firing mechanisms loaded with 12 gauge shotgun shells if lynn errs during her operation on the killers lifesupport systems will trigger those devices blowing the surgeons brains to bits meanwhile amanda has abducted another unfortunate character jeff angus macfayden of braveheart who has been suffering ever since a motorist killed his son jeff has neither recovered from his grief over his sons accidental death nor his contempt for a legal system that let his sons killer off with a light sentence none of the unredeemable characters in learn the lesson that it is better to forgive and forget rather than destroythe violence is surpasses anything from the earlier saw movies in fact it makes hostel look like childs play unlike hostel however nobody survives sophomore director darren lynn bousman who helmed and kevin greutert the editor on all three saw films display their technical mastery for staging brutal scenes and condensing details indeed benefits from topnotch production values and superb visual blood and gore effects although it is a malevolent rawedged crime horror thriller with virtually no redeeming thematic value the filmmakers have done a brilliant job of showing us some frankly farfetched stuff the scene where lynn removes a chunk of cranium with power tools stolen straight out of bob villas home repair workshop is an assault on both the eyes and the earsironically the people who wrote and directed this devastatingly meanspirited melodrama appear to have carved themselves into a corner although they were able to create a sequel to the original film and its initial sequel the chances of a sequel to look pretty remote the saw movies have never been about the supernatural thrills and chills like either the friday the 13th or halloween flicks so it will be interesting to see how they will contrive v,cruel
never has there been a a third film in any trilogy that beats the first or second is no exception because its the worst of the three but i can always say its the best trilogy out there and i am proud to have them on my dvd shelfcontinues from the second finished with detective eric mathews donnie whalberg locked in the bathroom from the first he gets out by bashing his foot in with the lid of the toilet he manages to slide is crippled foot out of the chains and escape the bathroomis plain sadistic but is still excellent its got real hardcore gore showing someone getting frozen to death rib cage pulled out and someone almost getting drowned in pigs blood and guts the film follows jeff who has to go through a 3 stages of hell and meet the people who were involved in the death of his son this is a witness judge and then the killer himself who ran his son over he has the choice to let them live or watch them die its sick and gruelling torture film however what he does not know is that is wife who is a nurse has been kidnapped to aid the dying she is forced to wear a death collar thats connected to heart monitor when it drops to zero she diesits not for the faint hearted and its the worst saw but dont believe for a second that its a rubbish because its not its a great film that pushes the boundaries of screen violence and gore,cruel
as the title says this movie was gory bloody and the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life the bloodiest of the 3 and the most goriest movie i have ever seen in my life i remember that day i watched it with my friend in the theater i still dont know how i survived that day since when i watched it again in my own living room i was scared i had to turn it offthe most disturbing scene in the entire movie is when captures the female cop and makes her go through the most gruesome game in the history of the saw trilogy the trap was hooked onto her rib cage the only key to unlock it was in front of her sounds easy right think again the key is in some fresh acid which easily dissolves ones hand after a series and of screams and shrieks she puts her hand in the acid and thats when i couldnt take it her hand had no chance but she luckily got the key but due to certain circumstances in the movie that i am not going to spoil she ends up getting her rib cages ribbed out of her body and instantly dies a terrible and gruesome deathgrasping the handle of my chair and the hand of friend i moved on to more gore to pigs guts and insides spraying over the judge to the naked women turned into an icicle from freezing to death then later to a man getting his arms legs and head twisted so much they broke off his bodyyet i will criticize this movie read the title it left no room for saw 4 and i just recently learned that one was to be made but how can it john and amanda died who will take the role of jogn the upcoming film makes no sense and the creators of saw just should of stopped and make this a trilogy and not ruin it910 doesnt deserve any higher,cruel
after watching this one i have to admit that i was lost for a little while till i started piecing together all ofhte twists and turns that has to offer i liked the traps especially in this one they were without a doubt pretty dam clever it was good to see back in action amanda was way more evil in this one i thought i especially like the scene with the four pigs that was pretty cool i must say overall i th ink that this one does some explaining from the previous two movies tying together and 2 very well although there are still some loose ends in my mind that need to be tied up i dont think this one was as good as the first saw but sequels are so hard to be better than the original but it was a dam good ride,cruel
and by dark i mean the way it was filmed not content i give this film a 8 only because the original saw was perfect thus making this one one notch lowerfirst of all for all those of you who so horrible turned in disgust this movie is not made for pansys like you go watch a comedysecond for all of you think the movie is not credible so what you go to the movies for entertainment in other words to see things you would otherwise never get a chance to see you want realistic watch a home movie instead this comment is especially for those who ask where are the authorities boo hoo if you watch then you know that and amanda can get to anyone at anytime inlcluding the authoritieswith that aside this is a great film gory to the max maybe not so much but it does attain that effect with bone crushing and flesh tearing sound effects a good improvement for the seriesthe story line is very good because this time around the victims do not soley rely on themselves for salvation but rather on other peoples actions for those of you too ignorant to grasp the concept of needless killings ill explain it to you the reason most of the victims were doomed in this installment is because was not fully in control but rather passed on the torch to amanda who is even more twisted than she somehow blames the world for her state of mind and seriously believes that no one changes after they are given that second oppotunity she of course bases this belief on her own lifethe second plot involves a father jeff who is so consumed with hatred over those responsible for his sons death that he would rather let them die right before his eyes including a witness  the man responsible and the judge in the casethis rules out senseless killing of innocent people finally there is lynn who because of her failing marriage turns to adultery to satisfy her needs sound familiar does dr lawrence gordon ring a bellso once again puts this sinners through a series of tests to prove if they appreciate the life they were given and for the comment about these being innocent people newsflash last time i checked wrath and lust were 2 of the 7 deadly sins so in no way are these people innocentthe tests this time around involve torture devices that border medieval times but are still fun to watch not at all for the squeamishalso very important are the flashbacks that explain missing puzzle pieces to the previous two films  all in all a very complete trilogy and a great way to end this saga oops too late part 4 is underwaymy only questions about the movie are what really happens to deteric mathews other than a crushed ankle we are only told that amanda left him for deadwill we see his actual demise in part 4 and what of the poster scene were teeth are being pulled out or did i miss this when i went for popcorn somehow it doesnt fit into the storylinefinal words a great addition to the horror genre who ever didnt like it or complained about gore and nudity should really just not go see these movies all you really do is waste time with your pansy reviews,cruel
dr lynn denlon bahar soomekh left for work at the hospital after an argument with her husband she arrived there saved a boys life that couldnt breathe by doing surgery on him in the emergency room never mind that she didnt wait for a surgeon goes into a room and pops some antidepressants into her mouth like they were candy then she doesnt stay at work somehow she ends up not knowing where she is winds up at tobin bell because he chose her to save his life since he was on his deathbed dying with a brain tumor at this same time her husband jeff angus macfadyen doesnt know where he is either and he ends up at having to take a test while his wife is to save life something tragic had happened recently with jeff and lynn which caused them to argue and it was ruining their family life so does a test called lets play a game and if jeff passes the test then everything will be all better and if not then it will be worse jigs aided by his assistant amanda shawnee smith she was also his test subject at an earlier time she had passed her test and now she got to do physical work for him he had dragged her up out of the sewer holes of life and she is so grateful to do whatever he wills her to do she even gets jealous over him with dr lynn denlon i wont tell you what happens or how it ends since i dont like to do spoilers but this has got to be the worst saw movie yet if you like gore its very bloody and gory because games are all about torture of course but the most torturous part is having to sit there and watch it all the way through it flips through flashback scenes all the way up until the end the whole time it keeps you wondering is this happening now or is this what already happened the best part about the whole movie is at the end when its over and the way that it ends there shouldnt be a v in my opinion but you never know could just at will want to play another game the best part of his game in this movie is when he says game over,cruel
the internal logic of this movie will not let you down if you can stomach the grotesque imagery then this dark twisted romp will satisfy in the endthe film makers have returned to name sake and put together a puzzle that fits together very nicely once again seems to have a twisted code of ethics which got lost in the second movie he states i hate murderers and do not condone murder and by the end of the film we can believe he meant itlike many recent horror films the descent 28 days later this film doesnt insult the intelligence of the viewer but rather tells a good story with believable characters if you are a fan of the horror genre then dont miss this movie,cruel
when you watch the first two saw films you are actually surprised by the big twist at the end of the film in this film its more a hmm moment and then you begin to pick apart the ending as it is the not as wellthought through as the previous filmswith the previous two films i empathized with the characters caught in the games not so much in this one i became annoyed with the guy because he was so slow to act and he moved around like he wasnt in any hurry maybe that was the intent to make you want him to get what happens to him in the end even the doctor wasnt someone i felt any empathy for and as i said the big twist really didnt shock me at least not like the twists from the first two filmsnow there are some good points to such as revisiting the setups to the games played in the first was surprised to learn that amanda had been with for those and it was interesting to see what happened to eric from this saw also has some of the most gross scenes of the whole trilogysurgery and the judge nearly drowning in pig guts top them allis worth your time if youve seen the first two films and liked them this one definitely has some of the sickest scenes as i already said and youll appreciate seeing a little behind the scenes of earlier games you wont remember this as one of the greatest horror films thoughits not up to the standard of the first 2 saws,cruel
and there was me thinking hed probably be a labrador or a small goat its bad dialogue though surprisingly its not the worst offering in this tired repellent sequeli was shocked to discover that the writing team is exactly the same as it always was through all three movies meaning that the same hands that were behind the inspired and original saw are responsible for this repugnant dross as darren lynn bousman was behind the first sequel  which was also inferior though nowhere near as bad as this  then its possible that its his direction that kills it certainly hes not able to get a decent performance out of angus macfadyen or give us characters to care about his obnoxious jump cut cinematography only serve to distance the viewer from whats going on in the fiction of the piecewhereas once saw was about the inventiveness of the situation here its just about the grotesqueness of the mutilation borderline misogynist at times there are even traps with no escape just a high level of blood count the news that a fourth film with bousman but with new writers is in preproduction is sad news indeed the original saw was a striking movie but sadly the  talks and more of these will continue to be made to ever decreasing returns,cruel
after the ingenious saw and the breakneck comes following the separate story strands of doctor lynn bahar soomekh who must keep a dying alive and jeff angus macfadyen who is trying to avenge his sons death the film is guilty of severely diminishing returnsthe attempts to inject this series with some human drama falls flat with a collection of unlikeable and stupid characters and the pacing is flabby the gore which used to be inventive and fresh is now just nasty and gratuitous the chest scene being a particular lowlight the tension that made the first film so good is nowhere to be seen with the film providing none of the shocks and jumps of say the camera flash scene of nstead we are treated to a series of genuinely repulsive torture traps each one more revolting than the last dont get me wrong im a big fan of the original and even quite enjoy the second but this just left a nasty taste in my mouththe final scenes wrap the series up relatively cleanly and i would like to say that this was the end of this rapidly decaying franchise but with saw 4 already in development for an october release i think will be playing games with us for the foreseeable futureget ready for a lot more blood,cruel
during the time i was watching this movie i was fidgeting in my seat almost the whole timebecause it was scary no because of the five billion ways of torture that is visualized not reallyto me saw has become a series that walks back and forth in its own footsteps trying so desperately to shock that it fails this time its ten times the gore and ten times the pain and somehow i feel that it overshadows the good part of this movie  the parts that makes it a bit different from the other twothe movie starts with the usual hey ho killing again where different kinds of funky ways to kill a person are displayed this is basically just a gore fest which doesnt bring anything to the movie except for being simply that gorethis time with help from amanda kidnaps a nurse who is meant to help him survive while hes helping some other poor lost soul finding meaning in life truth is i enjoyed watching the conversation between the three of them far more than the actual process of the game most of the time i was simply wishing for the movie to speed up a little because watching a man deciding what he should do for several minutes is hardly entertaining at least not in this kind of moviei wont say its all bad in fact its better than both the first and second one why first of all it has character development an important element which was slightly forgotten in and mainly secondly the plot is better peoples reasons for doing certain things are more logical and they put in a couple of unexpected twists which makes it a whole lot more interesting the third reason is that the actors are better was in my opinion a disaster in that area and thankfully they seemed to pick their actors more wisely this timedespite all the efforts to make the characters human this movie bored me most of the time it felt like nothing really happened despite the makes of the movie actually moving the concept up a notchthe problem with s that the unexpected becomes expected and when a movie depends upon it as much as this movie does it just ends up being boring and predictablebut if you can get through the first 20 minutes of utter blah you have an interesting movie that unfortunately is slightly ruined by the fact that it is too similar to the older less good ones,cruel
the entire series has been surprisingly strong the first film had the element of mystery and surprise the second ramped up and fleshed out the saw universe while the third manages to tie all three together and come to a great conclusion the traps are more elaborate the games more convoluted and the blood runs heavierthe only thing thats curious is that there will be a fourth saw how they can do that when they have effectively wiped everyone involved out makes me wonder sometimes its best to quit while youre ahead and is definitely aheadill have to see v when it hits this fall but more out of curiosity than any realistic expectations,cruel
while technically well made and very good in terms of special effects the saw series is that one unforgivable in movies its boring someone else gets tortured someone else gets murdered someone else gets in a situation where they have to mutilate themselves or someone else to get loose same set up variations on trapsover and over without any reason for the viewer to care particularly in theres no on to care about the kid hes a cardboard cutout with no character development a clich kid the rest who cares what happens to them i dont have to have a hero per se an antihero will do fine just someone to care about not my cup o tea,cruel
if theres a plot here i fail to seeunderstand it i thought the first saw was ok  interesting ideas and decent execution but still not great horror movielacks any sense of a plot  i was convinced that the dina meyer segment was a dream sequence as it had nothing to do with anything and almost literally goes by in a flash im glad it was a free view  how can people pay us10 to see this kind of trash i would really like to understand how so many people here can comment that this was great or the best of the three did we watch the same movie its hard for me to believe that at all its also hard to believe that amazon er the imdb has such a strange way of counting lines and thus making me add additional commentary when the simple summary i wrote originally should have sufficeddont waste your time on this  read an old clive barker book  itll be a better use of your time id recommend the books of blood,cruel
jigs back the third installment picks up where the second left off where we learned amanda is part of game this time she is appointed as his apprentice this time kidnaps a doctor to perform surgery on him in order to keep him alive while amanda kidnaps an unlucky man and puts him through an extremely twisted testi really liked the original thought it was clever and atmospheric retained a decent amount of the same elements while pumping up the gore factor the problem with is how far it veers off course from the original two installments one  two had their share of gore but didnt rely on the gore to make the movie is all about gore shockvalue and i dont mean that in a complimentary fashionthe plot literally feels like an excuse to string together a handful of shocking gruesome death traps the director has no intention whatsoever to keep the series ideas going veering so off course and paying so much attention to how much blood can spill and how many bones they can crack you feel like youre strapped into a chair in an execution room seeing person after person get brutally slaughtereddoes have its strengths the twist in the final sequence is surprising and satisfying although its an alarmingly weak setup for the next installment acting is solid and the film does have some creepy welldone flashback sequencesthe beauty of the original saw film was the gimmicky setup was pulled off with ease the second film had its weaknesses but improved on the plot of the original the third film lacks focus on what originally made the saw series a boxoffice smash it focuses on what body part will get ripped off burned or torn apart more than it focuses on plot direction or acting2 from 4,cruel
im not sure where to begin with thisthe 3rd installment in the saw franchisei guess ill start with the gorethis film is much gorier and graphic than the first 2howeverit is not gratuitousit all fits with the story and is essential to the moviehoweverthere is one sequence which i found stomach churningwhich had nothing to do with gore or violenceits just a sick scenewhich really wasnt necessary and i could have done withoutfor methis actually lowers the rating of the movie slightlythere is some nudity in this oneand i dont recall the 1st two having anythe traps are more complex in this filmas is the storylinethat is to be expected at this point in the serieswhile the first film had a rough unpolished feel as did the 2nd to a lesser extentthis 3rd film is almost slick in its texturebut that doesnt detract from the quality of the filmfor meit is a natural progression for the seriesbeing the best of the franchise to this pointset the bar high and although its closei think overall this 3rd film sets a new standardnot just for the series but for the genreit has more of an emotional impact than the 1st 2 filmsand that is no small praisei give a 910,cruel
ok first of all i rated saw a 1010 and a 710 and now im rating a perfect 1010 as well and here is whyfirst thing the deaths in this movie could not have been done better they are absolutely amazing my personal favorite as well as in the film was the twist machine it had me feeling that guys pain it was that bad and the way it was done was even more disturbing i even rated all the deaths in the movie from my favorite to least favorite1 twist machine death 2 rib cage machine death 3 the hooks death hellraiser style 4 girl freezing to death 5 doctors death not the shot in the stomach but the shotgun shell machine 6 johns death 7 adams death 8 the judges death 9 eric matthews death 10 amandas deathanother thing that helped the film was the fact that they went into complete detail on how they performed there game in the first film as well as showing create the doll he uses in all his videos etc but the end just left me thinking how the hell are they gonna do a v whoever is directingwriting it better have a good reason to because im worried this franchise might get ruined it only takes one person to ruin the series and it could happen i really hope darren lynn bousman returns,cruel
it was a few weeks before halloween 2006 that i was able to get my hands on the uncut edition of 2005 and boy was that a nasty entry in this horror series but the third film is probably the best yet following the first 004is probably the series low point with part iii bringing it presumably to a breathtaking close james wan directed the first saw and darren lynn bousman has been behind the camera for part ii and part iii leigh whannell adam in the first saw wrote the screenplay for this third entryagain like the infamous killer the evercreepy tobin bell is out in the open and so is his young apprentice amanda shawnee smith who survived a reverse beartrap device in saw and whose true identity was revealed in this time the terminally ill killer has amanda kidnap doctor lynn denlon bahar soomekh to operate on the ailing killer the twist is lynn has a bomb strapped to her head and in the event flatlines or shes out of range well she wont be having anymore headacheslynns horror story is paralleled with the plight of the vengeancestricken jeff angus macfayden whose young son was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver has set up a tricks  traps funhouse that jeff must make his way out of in two hours and in the process face the demons of his vengeance and thus let the games beginof all the saw movies is the most reflective often drawing on the past two films to advance its plot and wrap up shoddy details from those films what i have always admired about the saw films is the excellent writing if at all i would just like to praise whannell for one heck of a story but the only thing that detracts from the saw movies is some of the haunted house elements and occasionally uneven writinglike saw and benefits from its trippedout editing trippy score and cinematography the tricks  traps scenarios the filmmakers present us with get nastier and more grisly with each movie tobin bell has been the central figure of the last two movies and his creepy performance is likely to rank as some of the best work of a screen serial killerit will be amazing if a fourth film is ever made810,cruel
awesome movie perfect ideas  smart tricks and a mind blowing ending i liked the flashbacks they told us so many about the current part and the two previous parts also it was so good making the events going from somewhere to another without disturbing the story or confuse the spectators i liked so much the performance of tobin bell it was so realistic  suitable for the character  maybe some over calm but still great shawnee smith was also great  and she made the best of her bahar soomekhs performance wasnt quite enough for me maybe because her character was actually so hard to act and needs a lot of hard work well i can say that darren lynn bousman was the best and for sure a million thanks for james wan by the way i wanna play a game,cruel
its more sick and twisted than ever but highly unrealistic  there wasnt enough blood when someone was cut the characters didnt seem to mind when they was tortured the ordinary people would at least loose consciousness when they are put through those kinds of things obviously the people in the movie are extraordinarysuper humans i have felt pain and i know how the human body react to pain apparently those people havent because they couldnt even act as if they were in pain i got up three times and if the movie was a little longer i wouldnt have stayed till the end which wouldve been the only mistake i have to admit that the ending is very good and surprising as any other saw movie i await saw4 hopefully it would be better and more realistic ,cruel
i was also one of those people who got very hyped up to see the movie i was not disappointed the movie opened up with a scary scene ended with a scary scene and had all the plot twists inbetween to make a fantastic saw moviei definitely liked much more than i liked although there were certain similarities several games going on at one time the plot twist at the end the horror in the middle i absolutely loved the characters in this movie amanda was almost psychotic i immediately fell in love with the character even if she is practically insaneif you havent seen this movie yet get your butt out there and go see it if you have seen it but it as soon as it comes out no horror movie collection is complete without it,cruel
yesterday i decided to see my first saw movie in the cinema i had already seen and 2 and i decided that it was time to see one of then as soon as i came outthis movie is the first one i saw that was rated for 18 years old in portugal that is rare for non porn movie this movie is for 18 not because it has sex scenes but for the amount of blood and torture in it in the theatre there were only about 30 people and less then a half of then didnt have 18 years old as long as you know what to expect not sex but blood you will be okso let me tell you what you should expect  overall not as good as the first one  better than  an ending as good as the first one  another onenow you might ask your self is this review any good i would tell you yes not because i wrote it but because i only tell you what you should expect if you believe me go and see this movie if you never saw and see them first and only see this one if you liked any of the two,cruel
this is one of the worst movies i have seen it takes way too long for the plot to get moving and you dont get to know the characters well enough to care when they die which you know they will anyway when the judge was saved from the vat of processed animals which was the stupidest trap in the movie by far i knew it was a matter of time before he died in a quick and pointless manner finally the surprise ending just seemed kind of stupid and tacked on to me the one scene that made this movie possibly worth watching was the brain surgery which was very tense and gory other than that this film falls flat three stars,cruel
i think really is a murderer as remember in saw1 where he is being chased by the two detectives he slashed his throat which doesnt mean he really intended to kill him but he set up trip wire which did kill the detective which would make him a murderer right as for this film i had my hopes up too high i imagined it would be x 1000 as i loved the film but my hopes were brought down what i really wanted to know was who is going to be the next jigthink lawrence gordon will not be in the prequel i think its stupid if they do bring him back as it means they are desperate for characters and two films without him doesnt help,cruel
my favourit saw flick of the three it has more of the other 2 more blood more gore more deadly traps they even have a fully naked lady i dont recall one from the first 2 ahem anyway it was more bloody than the first 2here is a quick summary of the story jigs dying and he kidnap a doctor to keep him alive and will be free if another person who is also kidnap complets a gamelook out for the twist and turn in the story the grade a gore the creative traps the puppet and more of amandaif you didnt saw the first two watch them first before you watch so that you can understand more about the story so stop reading this and go watch the movie,cruel
ok i have rated for this movie 810 at the beginning the movie was boring a little bit but the twist at the end wow that was cool real cool why 1 tested amanda 2 tested that other guy twice  i forgot his name  first test to save the witness judge and that other guy i forgot his name actually and the second test forgive or kill  and he chose to shoot him so that let his wife deadbut what i dont get it is how are they going to make saw4 if  amanda are dead  if amanda is going to be alive at saw4 the movie will be a joke also if jigs going to be alive in some magical miracle or even a stupid way it will be a joke you cant think of the script of saw4 only that guy is going to save his daughter but the question still remains what happened to drgordon  we already knew from saw2 that adam is dead  heck he deserve it  but drgordon  and his family ok another part of the movie when that girl officer was killed by amanda  who was at saw2  well it is unnecessary and when they have put eric at the beginning well it was unnecessary either another thing amanda is too stupid to team up with and sacrificing her self to him  you will give me every cell that i need  or something like that amanda said that the victims arent learning nothing of games well amanda you havent seen them out of the cell to judge and actually i was happy when you were dead  at script  but you were great at the movie and i really like your acting part and your acting it self now about the surgery  how can u make a skull surgery or whatever the surgery was by one person its impossible and the problem that was alive after the surgery and he wasnt even screaming at the surgery and not moving either well thats impossible what i have liked about saw3 that there is no cops which gave the movie a little bit thrill more than action unlike saw2 it was action more than a thrill i really enjoyed the movie at the end but we hope that the script of saw4 will be better and we hope that your not running out of ideas,cruel
saw  are two good films i think the first one had a much better story than the second one but the acting wasnt better in the second one cary elwes doesnt really do it for me as a serious actor anyway when i saw the second one for the first time i was pretty shocked in a good way though  so i was really looking forward to seeing this one i went to the movies with my girlfriend the day after i showed her the first ones shes not a horrorfan at all but kinda liked them we saw the third one and she actually was angry with me afterwards she didnt think the movie had anything but gruesome and pointless torture scenes me on the other hand had a blast i could agree on that the story was better in the first two but this did not disappoint at all cant wait for the dvd hope they make the fourth even gorier hail horror,cruel
does what most third installments dont do it comes back at us with a tight script super laden with mystery and yet despite all the loose ends that tighten does not lose its power coupled with this are supreme images of ghastly terror within the modernized medieval type torture devices that we never get enough ofpicks up lightly where the 2nd one left off but does not dwell there long in this film were reintroduced to yet again but more of the focus is on his apprentice this time meantime several characters some strangers some not come into play one of the key no pun intended members of this cast is jeff played by angus macfadyen jeff is apprehended by someone and soon finds himself in quite a predicament the key again no pun intended here is that unlike other victims of the vigilantevengeance psychopath known as jeff is not shackled bound or trapped his quest is to take place throughout the industrial maze of brick steel and cement landscape that has become a staple of hangouts jeff has not been paying attention to the family that needs him but only because of hatred that has filled him over the loss of a loved one now he must play final game to see if he can overcome his problems and in the process simply survive the carnageapprentice amanda played by shawnee smith has quite a past of her own as we soon discover despite the power you would think she would yield we quickly learn how fragile all the seams of life really are again shows great imagination and unique direction in the horror genre with such devices as the shotgun collar attached body chains ribcage reversal vest the ice shower pig guts vat and another called the rack played brilliantly by veteran actor tobin bell has more tricks up the sleeve than you can shake a blade at the writing of is superb as it intertwines multiple characters on a destiny soaked with death the key again is also its ability to not make to much of a puzzle of it as much as intertwine past events of the first two movies to make it come together with one final showdown what will become of jeff what happens at bed when the minute is up will the apprentice fulfill her mission or die trying gore factor of this movie is a 9 of 10 at times is able to freak you out with its nailed hands ripped skin and breaking bones the humanity and irony that surrounds some of its more special parts is often drowned out with glimpses of complete carnage so gory that you just better hope you saved dinner for later,cruel
the best compliment i can pay to this movie has already been said but i think ill give my 10 cents worth takes you mentally back to the atmosphere of saw the only thing good about 2 was the pimp character and without him would have been a flopbut is dark gory and leaves you thinks of all the implications of the twist at the end which could never beat 1 but is pretty good so its a shame that we now have to bid adjour to the saw trilogy but please dont try to add onto 3 unless you do a prequel which is the rave right now the saw trilogy will be remembered for bringing us some of the most innovative ways to torture since the 18 century thanks guys im gonna lock my door tonight,cruel
i think was a good movie but wow whats with the pigs omg totally grossed me out was a good sequel to saw and but i think the best one at of all the movies was saw was okay but a lot of gruesome scenes was good the only thing i was not impressed with was the pigs and the new traps that were invented by the psycho but overall i would rate the movie a total of eight out of ten i would like to say that if they have a saw 4 they should make the events less gruesome and bloody that would reduce the amount of blood in the movie lol its okay blood is what made the movie okay and added more drama to it,cruel
its incredible after the long wait see the third saw and i get a a sad feelingthe blood was there the message of the squandered life a saw special was there too but it just doesnt have the smart story that i expected from saw now that it had all the money it needed all the bloody effects it could getthat being opposite to the bath from hell as i and my friends call it which had low finances all the money they had couldnt yield a good scriptin this decade of trilogy i guess this will be the last of saw but you never know maybe there will be a 4th terminator and a 4th lord of the r or how about a 4th matrix but dont bet on it,cruel
when i first left the movies of saw two years ago i was shaken i loved that movie it wasnt just a normal horror movie with some old guy with a chainsaw chasing after teenagers it was different smart with an amazing twist i felt this way also about but it wasnt as great as but still good when i saw i can say i was very disappointed and should have been expecting this all is is just a repeat of the other movies a lot of sick games you discover more behind the characters such as and there is a shocking twist in my opinion saw was a smart idea a killer with the motivation to kill people who dont appreciate life and using their problems to link to their trapsdeaths i believe the makers of saw should have stopped there is not smart all it is is porn for people who get off others suffering and also to shut up people on the internet who keep going on about what happened to dr lawrence and adam i think no saw 4 should be made the saw trilogy is just a dying animal refusing to die and it should be shot,cruel
shawnee smith and tobin bell return to their roles of amanda and john respectively for while perhaps not so much of a scary movie is certainly filled with lots of action and plenty of gore there is also an added element drama the drama mostly revolves around the complicated triangle of amanda john and dr lynn denlon who amanda kidnaps to care for john during his last standshawnee smith is brilliant in the role of amanda a complicated character who is unstable both emotionally and mentally tobin bell does an excellent job of reprising his role as that fact that he spends 999 of the movie lying sick in a hospital bed means nothing bell pulls it off excellentlybahar soomekh who plays dr lynn denlon is amazing her interactions with amanda smith are what make the film angus macfadyen is equally good in his role of jeff the unfortunate victim in final gameoverall the movie is excellent at certain times the movie seems to drag but only because the rest of the movie is so fastpaced there are plenty of twists with one very shocking and unfortunate one at the end and backstory galore not to mention the storyline is superb smith bell soomekh and macfadyen all do excellent jobs at bringing out the depth and emotion in their respective charactersis definitely the best of them by far with a v already being discussed one is left to wonder how the writers will find a way to top its predecessor,cruel
well what can we say about this movie apart from its great this is my first ever comment on here but i had to make sure it was for i only saw the movie today but oh my life its amazingi must admit i think that one of the worst parts has got to be the trap which is called the rack i think so anyway and when i saw that scene i was simply horrified by it although i have to admit i also think it was great i also have to say that the trap was a bit too good for just 2 people to build especially when one of them is dying sorry for that but didnt know how else to put it it has all the twists and turns that we expect and many more which is just greatalso i was thinking that there would definitely be another saw but after the ending of this one i arent quite surefor those that have seen it you will no what i mean but for people who havent and wish to know both and his sidekick amanda dieso if there is another one i would like to know who is going to be the master of the cunning twists traps and everything elsefor those people who havent yet seen it get yourself to your local cinematheatre whatever you wish to call it get yourself a ticket a drink and watch it i would warn people to eat before they go to the cinema not while you are there and dont expect to go to mcdonalds after neither as im not sure if your stomach will agree after watching this amazing film i absolutely loved it and i would love to see another one,cruel
no that was not a good movie i am huge fan of  ii there was so many secrets i had my mouth opened at the end of but now there was way too much gore yeah there was a lot of blood and suffering in previous saws but thats not what i liked there like john said to amanda your games were unwinable she just thought games are meant to end on death yes some secrets as i call them where revealed but that was weak i could watch without watching previous saws and i would know whats that all about i gave 1010 for and ii  there were just perfect definitely my favorites but just got 5 out of 10 few days before watching it i looked onto my myspace profile and i noticed there one thing favorite movies  ii  i was so excited that i will watch soon i was thinking about adding it to favorite movies on myspace but the true is that it was actually a bad movie and im sad about that it was a film that i mostly wanted to go on this year but i just got disappointed,cruel
initially when ever there is a very original horror film any horror fan knows that sequels are not going to be as good yet for saw the rules seem to have been bent obviously if you want to see youve seen the last two and as original as they were to enjoy you must not expect an over blown powerhouse movie that the last two were if you do you will not be impressed to start out with s a thriller mystery saw two was more of a slasher thriller with some mystery elements still in place yet saw three really takes out the thriller and just becomes a slasher horror film as i was sitting in the theater i was impressed on the all in all visual style of this film compared to the last two saw three is an all out dark and macabre peace of art yet compared to the last two witch were more on the side that made you think is pure visual saw three is not as intense as the last two but is for sher make your dates tummy turn with people saying that they hate it to people saying that its the best saw yet all i have to say that it meshes great with the other films by being strikingly original in its own way this movie is fun grotesque and if you want to be entertained for about 90 minutes i suggest that you go see this movie only with the knowledge that its not going to break the horror movie barrier or be completely visionary have fun when you see this movie,cruel
as a fan of the first 2 saw movies i was eager to see the result of the third not being a horror fan i can cope with the saw series as i find them more thriller than horror but boy was i wrong about the latest instalment right from the scratch its just sickening stomach churning gore as i said i could cop with the others but this one really doesnt leave anything to the imagination the way games progress they just get sicker and more sadistic throughout i still enjoyed the movie but felt weak at the knees when leaving make sure if you choose to go and see this to go on an empty stomach because it really is that sick not for the faint hearted,cruel
i truly believed this film was gonna be better than it was i felt disappointed with the ending and was hoping that this would end the trilogy and make for a good series how wrong was i i think fans will love this and trust me im as hardcore as they come i just wished they had spent more time on the characters than the gore if you really want to watch this but have not seen one or two  i suggest you do so cause you will be in the gutter if you dont i suppose the premise seemed good but things obviously changed as it progressed i would recommend this and hopefully saw 4 will be even betterthis was for the fans,cruel
everyone who had to make a review for this film told that this was the very best film of the trilogy i really had great expectations about this one and i couldnt wait to see it but i gotta tell u guys that as each minute went by my expectations began to fade away too much violence and blood and few ideas on this one the are a lot of things that were hard to understand and im not an idiot i guarantee that yo have to watch this movie for yourselves and then youll be able to make a conclusion im not saying that this movie was awful but i can say that this was the worst of the 3 ones i also think that it is too slow and lacks of imagination that imagination that shook our foundations on the previous 2 films,cruel
ahhthe sweet taste of blood that metal taste that you just want to spit out luckily the third installment of the saw movies is worthy enough to not be spit out although there is plenty of blood to tastethe movie is in my opinion not as good as the previous two but still is a good time the new characters are interesting and seem real as does amanda as new apprentice she really works it the writers delivered yet again an exciting layered script with other story lines and twists awesomethe sad part is that the movie is longer than the first two and it is really noticeable it doesnt drag a lot but it just doesnt have enough entertainment to fill up that time slot completely to my satisfactionit is a good movie though,cruel
in 2004 saw was released it was a good movie but it wasnt great a year later came out it was a great movie definitely one of the better horror sequels out there but it seems like everything goes downhill with 3 scary movie 3 was a very funny movie but not as good as sm1 or 2 scream 3 halloween 3 its the same with a bunch of movies 3 may be a magic number but it rarely is with movies horror mainly and thats true with as wellbefore i get to the good stuff lets go over the bad stuff the traps werent that great they all did the same stuff they blew up stuff one froze some naked chick and another twisted this guy and another one drowned people with freakin pig guts another thing is that they went overboard with gore and blood they showed a full naked body they showed tons of blood they even said a certain word that starts with a c and means the same thing as a part of the woman anatomyalso the movie was too long the other saw films were pretty short the first was about 100 minutes and was 92 minutes this is 107 minutes too long an ultra gory flick like this only needs to be about as long as well thats the bad stuff next comes the good stuffoops forgot another bad thing too many outofplace flashbacks some flashbacks were needed but others were flashbacks of stuff that happened in this movie they showed each flashback about 100 timesright now i dont feel like naming the good stuff i just hope they dont make a v if they do ill rent it but i wont spend 6 bucks on a movie ticket besides dead i know they can write him in somehow but hes deadwho knows though maybe v will be good halloween 4 was better than halloween 3,cruel
i love horror movies  thats a fact you name it ive probably watched it so its safe to say ive seen pretty much everything ever thrown at us from the the horror genrenothing can prepare you for what your eyes are about to witness i dont think ive ever watched such a violent movie and you know what  it was awesome saws drills guns traps decaying maggot infested bodies badly lit corridors twists turns naked woman and of course  that damn puppet are all thrown together with gallons of blood and crunching twisted bones to complete idont eat before during or after you watch this  it wont stay downyoull want to leave the cinema  but you wont  in anticipation of what happens next  what is just behind that next door the sound affects really sent shivers down my spine the crunching banging screaming metal grinding affects that seep inside your ears and make you imagination work overtimego see it and pray you sleep well after it,cruel
i can understand why people would be walking out and fainting from this film and when i say people i especially mean the 1517 years olds that shouldnt be seeing this film i work at the cinemas and ive never seen people walk out from a film because they felt nauseas ive also never seen so many people leave to go to the toilet in the first half hour this is almost definitely due to the first three scenes which are all pretty nonstop violence and theyre needing to get out to have a break from it i cant understand why this film doesnt have an r18 certificate here in australia im 20 and i wouldnt be able to sit through all of those scenes the most appalling however was a man taking his son aged around 11 to see it this isnt allowed to happen with r rated films this is the only film where i have felt truly bad about letting minors in to see it,cruel
i went into the cinema with a hopeful but open mind in my eyes saw was good but not brilliant if the acting and direction had been better it would have been an awesome movie was not as good as the first but still had its moments totally blows the first two out of the water the irony well sort of is that without the first 2 the third would make no sense well duhhhhh very rarely do sequels outdo the original but kicks arse once again the acting isnt brilliant but it delivers a much darker and wicked movie i only wish the first two had been made this way it was indeed a very clever formula that made for an enjoyable if at times cringeworthy i mean the torture scenes and booby traps 90 or so minutes i loved it being a big horror fan go see it now,cruel
i did not come into this movie with any expectations whatsoever if it was a bad third installment well were getting used to them final destination 3 santa clause 3 well this is one of the better endings to a trilogyin this sophomore sequel to 2005s john kramer aka jigs sick and near death he is terminally ill but apparently refuses to accept the fact to keep him alive and his protg amanda kidnap dina an antidepressanttaking doctor in a crumbling marriage dina is forced to play a game to keep alive as long as stays alive so does sheangus macfayden gives a magnificent performance as jeff a father who feels that he failed his family when his son was struck and killed by a drunk driver he is also kidnapped by and put through a series of tests at the end promises that he will meet his sons murderer tests are about jeffs morality and forgivenesswith extra gory scenes of torture and decapitation the third installment in the saw series is by far the most graphic but also the greatest i was told that it had lack of surprise this may be true but the movie makes up for the lack of surprise with a surplus of suspense it will keep you going until the end910,cruel
i was so anxious to see this movie that i actually paid to watch it in the theatre rather than waiting for it to come out on dvd the film had pretty much everything i expected gore gruesome traps and a decent plot but it didnt really have the surprise factor that made the first one so interesting the third installment of saw follows two main subplots the first involves dr lynn denlon playing a game in which she must keep alive hes not dead yet just on his deathbed with cancer the catch is shes wearing a shotgun collar that will kill her if dies or if she goes too far away from the second subplot surrounds a man jeff who we learn lost his only sonhe also has a daughter in a hit and run accident since the death of his son jeff has been obsessed with exacting revenge on the man who killed his son because of this chooses him to complete a game ill call forgiveness v punishment in each phase of the game jeff is presented with the opportunity to save or if you will forgive someone who was involved in the death of his son the only witness who fled the scene the lenient judge and finally his sons murderer if jeff completes his game successfully then the doctor will be allowed to go free spoiler in the meantime the viewer learns that protg amanda is actually just a bitch seriously and isnt really teaching people to appreciate life with her traps as does in fact the traps she creates are actually impossible to escape from overall this movie made me cringe often some of the traps and partial brain removal were quite grisly and for fans of disturbing horror movies i would definitely recommend it still i was disappointed with the major plot twist finding out that jeff and the doctor are married because in the beginning of the film you think that the doctor is married to the man shes actually having an affair with in the opening scene he tells her that he wants a divorce implying that they are married but really he wants her to get a divorce from jeff,cruel
it is perfectly understandable for the creators of saw to incorporate this series into a franchise focused on generating dollars at the expense of the quality of the product what started out as innovative and genuine story telling has deteriorated into the pool of bland horror flicks which it had distanced itself once before and will only get worse the more they continue to generate eg hellraiser halloween and friday the 13thlet us look past the fact that there was great anticipation preceding the release of this film im sure that im not the only one that believed that this would be the endallbeall conclusion to the series and thus deliver the hardest punch to the cinematic world to look at this film for what it is it is just another horror flick sequeldespite the good acting they could not overcome the bland script what once were cruel but ingenious lessons on the value of human life have now become exhibitions in death there attempt to go out with a bang was a dudthe first movie was great the second one stepped it up like very few sequels can accomplish the third installment took away everything that made the series stand outgood but not as good as it could have been,cruel
was indeed a great movie it lived up to its anticipated hype it tied up pretty much all loose ends left by saws 1  2 yet still left a few questions unanswered and opened some new ones leaving many people frustrated wanting morea whole new array of traps and higher budget gave better special effects seeing the bone coming out of wounds and other great additions had the psychological edges had the gore brought the best of both into oneindeed was just really gore quite upsetting really but made up for its predecessors stuff ups did set the pace however so without seeing 1 and maybe even 2 will seem only half full great twists in plot and change in characters great acting by angus mcfayden tobin bell shawnee smith and bahar soomhek some unexpected surprises also a great movie beats hands down and compliments the original,cruel
just want to say that leigh whannell is a genius is absolutely amazing im an aspiring actordirector and to see two guys make such an amazing trilogy from the simple idea of having two guys in a room and playing a game is just immensei salute you anybody who has anything negative or derogatory to say about these masterpieces need shootinso holla at me n well debate i wanna play a gamemuch love to all you movie fans out there its a shame that the games over but hey no need to worry one day ill get the recognition i need for one of my works in progress n the world will be a much better placewith more couch potatoes n film buffs lol,cruel
wow was great since i saw the first one i had high hopes for and that was great as well the third in my opinion was the best out of the other two they couldnt have chosen a better team to play and amanda those two worked awesome together the ending really threw me for a loop i sure wasnt expecting it at all im such a sucker for scary moviesi love them but i get all queasy and cant watch half the time although i had to turn away a few times during the film overall it was probably one of the best movies i have seen all year if you havent seen it yet get off the computer and go buy a ticket to the movie im surely going to buy this once its out on dvdgreat movie saw 4 anybody,cruel
the first saw was not that gory aside from gordon cutting his foot off and amanda cutting her cellmates stomach open was a lot gorier with xavier cutting the back of his neck off and getting his neck slitthis one however by far takes the cake i have a pretty resilient stomach when it comes to gory stuff on the big screen but when lynn was operating on head my stomach seriously started to churn a little the way kerry died was seriously disturbing this in my opinion is slightly better than the 1st but doesnt match the 2nd more gore and harder traps to get out of make this one stand out over the other 2 i thought it was also cool how it showed john and amanda setting everything up from the start,cruel
hey i happen to be a close acquaintance with director and writer darren lynn bousman and would like to clear a few things up about the 3rd film sawfirst off i dont know how much of you remember in which order scenes in the film took place but the tape which john pours hot wax onto occurs as amanda informs him that jeff has got past the 3rd test darren has plans to go into more detail about this in the fourth film of course he isnt the soul writer but tells me that has been made with an intention for a fourth and has been left with a lot of options to refer back to all three filmsi dont wont to ruin the fourth film for everyone so i wont go into much detail in the fourth film you will get to hear whats on the tape containing some very interesting info on dr gordon from slightly bigger spoiler coming up so youve been warnedas far as i have been told in the fourth dr gordon will be back and will be set as a prequel to and 3 a sub sequel to gordon will be involved in another one of saws games working for saw not out of free willthat is all i can think of for now that and that there is plans for saw v to be set before during and after the story of hope that helped at all any other questions just ask,cruel
the 3rd part of the trilogy comes to finish the story or not of jighave never seen a better horror film in the past 5 years and i think the saw films will remain in history as ones of the best horror films everto put the whole thing in a nutshell in weve got it all again blood goosebumps and a great plot twist simply brilliant assuming that in the end of amanda was going to take over jigs still alive this time though he is quite sick and in need of an operation amanda is kidnapping a top surgery doctor to perform the operation while on the other hand there is always someone playing the gamewhile i was watching the film i was constantly afraid and i felt my heart ready to jump out of my chest if this doesnt make a horror film great then what,cruel
this movie hardly met my relatively low expectations it was more gory than the last two but the violence seemed to be the only thing the movie was about it seemed to me that they came up with some of the most violent and creative ways to torturekill someone and then wrote a storyline around it the plot was compelling but somewhat shallow and the ending was as expected openended i left the theater irritated and wishing that i had saved my 850the acting was good though one of the main characters amanda got to be extremely annoying by the end of this film character was no different from though by the end he was starting to sound like a broken record with his games and testsall in all it was entertaining to watch it definitely made me cringe squirm and freak out but dont expect something that will blow you away as its lacking in most of the elements that make up an allaround good movie definitely doesnt have the charm of the original saw,cruel
i absolutely loved saw and they were absolutely great the games the plot the characters absolutely great even the acting was quite impressive which is usually not the case in horror gory movieshowever left me not only disappointed but also disgusted i have observed my share of openheart and brain surgeries considering i am going to med school i have absolutely no problem seeing guts blood any kind of injuries i see them all the time needless to say i have no problem seeing someone being ripped open i cant say that about it made my stomach turn which i guess you would say the movie succeeded in its goal however in the past movies when played his game he made it possible of a way out there is no way outbasically instead of having a plot a story with characters to make the story believable its just a movie of a fest of torture i liked saw because of the whole being ungrateful of your life and it has not followed the same paths in the sequel i was in a big surprise and it wasnt a good oneit was my first movie i walked out on within the first hour not because it was too gory but because it was not worth the 15 dollars i paid to watch something that has no plot no believable characters and is not anywhere near the original i wouldnt waste my time nor money for this movie unless you can get it for a dollar at the box if you really wondering what its about but even thats not even worth it,cruel
i normally dont like bloodygory movies but for some reason i love the saw movies probably cause there is actually a story behind why he does the things that he does ok so an excellent sequel basically you have a cheating doctor and a grief stricken man who are both going through their own games jigs barely alive and the woman has to keep him alive as long as the other guy completes his little game its a very good movie there are a lot of ouch scenes though spoiler here so stop reading if you want especially with the guy being twisted around otherwise good suspense although all i had to say after watching was ouch,cruel
jax wardle  although i thought it was good at the time looking back on it it did concentrate a lot more on gore than any others did there is still a good story line and lots of twists he he however i would like to know which people thought it gory enough to actually faint so please if you know anyone that either had to run out of the cinema or actually be taken to hospital because they fainted please get in touch im quite proud really i sat through the whole thing only having to put my hand to my eyes only twice although to be fair my dads prouder as he could watch the whole thing eating popcorn at the most goriest bits men,cruel
man i love saw but was only good just ok all this movie really does is answer all the questions plot holes or complaints people had on the first two saws with that being said it was also quite bloody the story was pretty good but very predictable with the first two saws i did not predict the ending especially the first sawsuch questions that are answered are  how did lay on the ground so long without moving  what happened to adam  when did amanda meet with etcstill a decent movie and was enjoyable to watch in the theater some scenes like hand reaching for a key in a thing of acid and the twister may have you cringe in your seat the baudio sound effects was great alsostoryline 4 acting 6 horror violence 9 directing 6,cruel
if you check out critic websites such as rottentomatoescom and read their reviews youll see a lot of people who just dont understand the kind of audiences that enjoy these kinds of movies i consider myself a hardcore horror fan and even more so a lover of all movies is not by any means worthy of an oscar but does fill the special voids that horror fans like myself have it ties up all of the loose ends of the previous two installments and concludes rather strongly yes it is gory yes it is violent and no youre not going to be impressed with the intelligence behind the story however if you liked the first two movies as i did you dont care with the saw series its not really the events in the movie that are meant to scare you but more so the idea behind every one of them its the idea that people dont appreciate their lives and the whole philosophy about that which explains to us and his victims thats what created the franchises fan base the gore is really just icing on the cake for enthusiasts in short if you liked the last two saw movies then youll like this one if you didnt like them then you just dont get it,cruel
i saw this film twice friday night and let me say it blew me away for some odd reason the second time around it was better i caught a lot of things that i missed in the first viewing the plot outline and story is outstanding and this is by far the best saw to date i only had to problems with this film 1 bahar soomehks performance didnt convince me but she did a decent job and 2 some of the traps were a little unrealistic i can go for a box with razors that would cut your hands when you stuck them in but some of the traps in seemed a little unrealistic for example kerrys trap see the movie to know what i am talking about over all great film and story props to the creators,cruel
ok i wont lie sometimes i wonder how some sick demented person can actually even think of these plots and make money of them it seems as if the only outcome if will be realistic reenactments of what the viewers are seeing on the screen however besides the fact that it can give others sick ideas it interesting any idea that seems to scare an individual while sounding intriguing because of its content will attract a person is a perfect example yea its gory and disgusting but it kept me entertained and at the edge of my seat i was dazzled by the things i was seeing and only could guess what would happen next in my opinion tops i and ii together its the biggest twist yet and if you put all the blood and drills aside it does have an overall moral thats hidden if youre looking for an intense thriller that not only scares you but makes you want to vomit its the perfect movie this my sound farfetched but its true why do people want to go to haunted houses if they will only get scared its the same thing  entertainment i can promise you that you will be satisfied walking out the theater and left contemplating about a possible v if these movies are your type will contend definitely a two thumbs up,cruel
gorefest oh yes should you watch it after you just got done eating not recommended for those with weak stomachs but who would watch it with a weak stomach anyway i loved it its twisted its puzzling its everything we loved from the first  second films there actually were a few moments of sentimental value which was surprising  revealing on behalf but that made it even deeper  meaningful i wish they showed exactly what was in amandas envelope but we really dont need to know do we i didnt like how they threw us off  the beginning of the movie on who the doc was actually married to but thats ok i forgive em i loved it its just a bummer there wont be a 4thor will there i definitely will want to see it,cruel
for me was better than the second yet still not the firstthe first was a lot scarier nevertheless this one really brought a lot more gore into the show i thought it was worse than hostel there are a good amount of traps all of which ended in deathall i heard before this movie came to theaters was how gory it was going to be i didnt think it would be any worse than the texas chainsaw massacre the beginning amazing but it was i was surprised on how crazy it gotthis is the first one to have any nudity all my friends were like sweet im gonna see some good stuff but its not like its nudity and romance the woman is being tortured it is only like a 10 minute segment so there isnt too much with that womanall in all it was satisfying definitely a must see if you are a fan,cruel
i walked into the theater thinking to myself that there was no way this movie could surpass the other two filmsi was wrong as soon as i sat down and it beganbefore i went to the theater i made sure and watched the other two films again to keep all my facts straightand trust me i have seen both at least 16 times apiece and at parts i was still confusedbecause i mean one second your like oh i get it and then the next your left in a dazei loved how the film always kept you guessing but threw you off every time you thought you had the answerthe gore if you are squeamishstay home the gore was amazing surpassing the other two films by numbersthis is truly the perfect installment into the saw franchisethe acting by tobin bell and shawnee smith was superba perfect on screen matchthe emotion that was displayed by these two actors was like never before seenthe plot and script was amazing darren bousman and leigh whannel are movie geniuses this is a must see for any true horror loverthis movie is truly a perfect 1010,cruel
this movie was the most well thought out movie ive seen in a long time the way he brings the story together in the end is overwhelming what made this movie good was not the terror it was not the gore it was the story that is not to say however this movie didnt have gore it definitely lives up to the standard of the saw series in that factor but the plot of this movie is what really amazes you to create a movie like this requires a great imagination and wahn and leigh should be well credited the direction was good too bousman allows you to have emotion for the characters in this film you begin to have sympathy for some of the characters the fact that a movie from the horror genre can achieve that is very admirablethis movie is by far the best in the saw series it has every desirable feature you could want in a horror film this movie is award winning quality if there was one word i could use describe this movie it would be brilliant,cruel
i went to see this movie earlier today and i knew it was going to be good from start to end some cool traps and i couldnt even look at two of them the story is great and twists just keep on comingthis is definitely the best of the three because it ends a great trilogy which you dont see very often the acting was very well done and a lot better than the previous filmstobin bell manages to capture the role of perfectly yet againshawnee smith seems a little more evil in this film especially with some of the stuff that she reveals to at the endgo see this movie if you havent already it is well worth the moneyi will definitely buy this movie on dvd,cruel
i just n theatres and from the first five minutes i knew it would be a good film im a big fan of the first two and i wasnt disappointed in the least there are a few important things to hit on with this film though some good some bad but i plan to show you why i liked the film why people who liked and disliked the first two may like it and why i can understand if you dontone is greatly similar to the first two films with the same feel same atmosphere and same style however it has a new interesting concept in tack closure i knew many people who shared similar interests in movies with me who absolutely hated saw as well as for more than anything a single reason they told so little about how they ended up there as well as why tells you nearly everything youve wanted to know the only thing it doesnt reveal from my experience unless i missed something is what happened to dr gordon it also has a very dramatic climactic ending to it that both humoured and horrified metwo the gore many people didnt even watch the first two in fear that they had immense gore well the first didnt have nearly as much as it was rumoured to have the second one had some but done in a way that didnt seem to obvious with everything else that went on got you a lot more with how shocking it was than what happened is twice as gory as the first two combined i am a big fan of gore when used correctly and i can see many disturbing things but this film made me look away and cringe at least three times its graphic and intensethree the plot the plot of is very well done and very developed with very few questions like the first two had while the first told you almost nothing about the story and the second one told you only the bases of the main story while giving you very little background on the characters this one tells you nearly everything it goes into why these things are happening and how they all go together is very intriguing if you disliked the first andor second because it didnt tell you enough watch this one it may redeem the first two greatly and turn you into a fan the films are like a puzzle which is very expressive and symbolic of the trilogys naturefour the ending god what an ending sad intense dramatic emotional twisted and brilliant i can understand why some fans wont like this ending at first i wasnt sure if i did but after thinking about it it couldnt be better my only disappointment is that it nearly guarantees the lack of a fourth installment it closes off the series but its an amazing end to the trilogyis a good film but i can understand people disliking it its not a film that you have to love or hate but it probably will be itll either impress or disappoint you,cruel
i went see this past weekend which i been waiting for all year long and expecting it it to beat the first 2 and my my was i right or what this was just plain genius and amazingthe minute it started to the minute it ended i was just speechless the gore the suspense o and lets not forget of course every saw has a twist at the end well this was one has 2 twist which prolly is the shocked one of all at least in my opinion despite the fact jigs in his dying bed he takes it to a whole new level here and youll never see the ending coming well the whole movie starts off with detective matthews trying to escape which i heard he dropped out but i guess they just fooled us and like always there something gore right in the beginning by twisting his foot offughhh lol then of course it starts off with investigating with kerry she gets herself in a trap has the movies goes on thats when the suspicion starts to come kidnaps dr lynn and in order for her husband and her to survive she must save but the device she wears around her neck is a neck collar that controls heart rate which means if he died it will go off and blow her head off wow huh lol but like always the ending happens with the twist that i never saw coming not spoiling nothing here but you have to listen to again in this one to get the endinganyway this was definitely worth the watch and it beats the first 2 saws 1010,cruel
i gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because it was the most gross movie i have ever saw but there are some downfalls here one where the detective was locked up in a machine that will rip her rib cage out what she has to do is grab the key out of a jar of acid and unlock herself well she does and unlocks herself and it seems that she wasnt suppose to get out and the machine goes off and when i saw this part it seems so fake good scenethe detective matthews part where he locked in a room in the end of yes this part countines in he get the gun that was next to him and finds out that all the bullets inside of it where blanks and he grabs the flashlight and looks for something and he finds the saw tries to cut the chain etc the its seems that he going to cut his leg off he throws the saw and grabs a toilet cover and breaks his ankle to go through the chain i advise people to go see this movie,cruel
after seeing the first two saws i began to vastly enjoy the genre it was digging into the first film was and still is one of my favorite to date horror gory movies the second was nicely structured and dug into the plot nicely though this third installment was a slight let down i enjoyed it and it did serve most of its purpose though many moments during the film i didnt feel like i actually needed to pay attention a few things seemed irrelevant and slightly random though were cleared up later that didnt immerse me in the action as the other films did quite fine the plot that had increased in flavor in the second saw was watered down during this saw the gore seemed forced at some moments and not as thought about as the other films but it did work in making me feel uneasyish if you liked the first two saws you should see this one and get your own opinion then come back and respondthats me cheerio,cruel
when i went to see from all the pictures and interviews about the movie i was afraid that it would be just blood and gore from the rating i gave it you can tell that wasnt it at allwas an amazing movie that blew its prequels out of the water the acting in this movie was an amazing display of human emotion and the visual effects will make your jaw not just drop but detach completely despite all the new and improved props sets and grisly inyourface special effects youre still getting what you paid for saw the true saw trademark uniqueness that we all know and love this movie will not disappoint you,cruel
i watched this movie last night and it was amazing its the best saw yet and its the most gory and brutal some parts are just so disgusting i couldnt watch it was intense and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film i cringed at quite a few of the grizzly bits as they were just so awful and gruesome the whole story is extremely clever and it makes and 2 look like disney films i cant wait for saw 4 hopefully they will make it better than this film which at the moment i think is impossible overall it is definitely one of the best films ive ever seen definitely the best saw movie and definitely the goriest i cant wait to see what is coming next,cruel
this was one of the best movies ive seen in years much better than saw and i almost want to give the movie 910 for one reason i want to know what was in the envelope that left for amanda in his desk drawer whatever it was seemed to push amanda over the edge more than she already was maybe i just missed it  whatever it wasbut i think it was important anyway twisted pictures is absolutely right the traps were absolutely disgusting  i loved it and the twist at the end of the movie was worth the line to get into the movie theater you do not want to wait for this one to come out on dvd go today or better yet   go tonight,cruel
ok let me start by saying that this is without a doubt the best saw movie of the three and possibly one of my favorite movies of all time theres just sooo much to love about it the great acting especially tobin bell who chills you to the bone the relentless pacing the crazy traps the magnificent story yes story in a horror movie and the gruesome gore hell we even get a shot of boobs nicemild spoilers we get some good characters back from the previous two movies like donnie wahlberg as matthews and leigh whannell as adam it shows a lot more of what was done to adam and what ended up happening with detective matthews there is no dr gordon in this movie i personally wish there would have been but the simple fact is that he is not in this movie so let let all the asshole lowlives on the board fool you with those completely fake endings theyre making up but anyways this movie is just an allout blast the only thing im missing is the big twist that weve some to expect with the saw movies although i have absolutely no problems with the ending and thought it was very strong if i remember correctly the total body count is about 10 including adam although we already knew he was dead it just showed us exactly how it happenedbottom lineis a relentless gruesome helluva ride that never cuts away even when bones are snapping and ribs are being ripped out its anchored by great performances all around and byfar the best traps weve seen its the most gruesome sadistic smart disturbing and entertaining in the saw trilogy and possibly my favorite movie ever even if youre not a fan youre missing out big time if you pass this one up this one is a must to the highest degree,cruel
no spoilers i loved this film in my opinion it eclipsed and in terms of horror and just pure terror with enough gore to give the living dead series a run for its money and completely run over the evil dead like it was some comedic joke kept me at the edge of my seat throughout it was thoroughly suspenseful and interestingthe visuals traps and scares in this movie are endless and takes this one to a whole other level music was also great all around it was a terrific movie definitely worthy of being enlisted in almost anyones top 10 horror flicks,cruel
beware there are spoilers to saw and in this reviewno spoilers to but spoilers to the films before itive been waiting for this film since i watched first off i must say that it doesnt disappoint true fans of this series like myself while was a good film it didnt even come close to the original is an even better film and comes a lot closer to matching but it too is not at the same level darren lynn bousmans direction behind this film is very well done again and im very glad he stayed around to direct both sequels the best part about this film is that leigh whannell and james wan the original minds behind the epic trilogy are back and in top form as the helm the story and screenplay while telling you the plot line in detail is a gigantic slap in the face to you the reader ill give you the basics of ittobin bell is dying things dont look good for him as his cancer is beginning to catch up with him more than before his apprentice amanda shawnee smith is following all his orders taking care of a few victims every now and then her next task is to get a doctor namely lynn denlon bahar soomekh of crash to keep alive for as long as it takes jeff angus macfadyen of braveheart to finish a series of tests lynn must be careful because if dies she dies no questionthe technical aspects of these films are what makes them so psychologically powerful the lighting mood and music define this series as of course does the legendary villain darren lynn bousman has such an extraordinary vision for these films and it is portrayed beautifully on screenit just plain looks like a dark psychological horror film granted this is not a film for the faint of heart the gore in this film is near vomitinducing and im saying this even after the last film i saw before this was jackass number two makes its predecessors look like childs play compared to the blood and gore in this film which will make you feel very uncomfortable at times this and the fact that it loses some realism throughout the film which is one part of why these films are so good are factors that keep it from getting a 10 the acting behind is also very well done at last all the main characters act near perfectly especially tobin bell and angus macfadyen bells john kramer aka jigs easily the most fearsome villain of the past two decades how this actor can make you know hes in control while being stuck to a bed is just inexplicable he brings you in and never ever lets go shawnee smith is good as his right hand woman the secondary villain of the film she can be scary at times but nowhere near tobin bell angus macfadyens jeff is a wonderful character and he really takes advantage of this wellwritten character and makes it his own a conflicted father is not really an original character but this one is bahar soomekh as the hostage doctor lynn denlon is very good she is really a great actress because we are always aware that she has some control over the situations because she holds life and of course her own in her hands despite the fact that shes a hostageone element of saw that is always present in all the films is the unpredictable twist at the end of the film in the first film arose from the floor between dr gordon and adam a twist no one could have predicted in amanda was revealed as apprentice and heirapparent in iwell youll find out for yourself 010 810 810spy,cruel
this was the best movie i have seen in years you would want to watch 1  before seeing 3 because all three are tied together so well my father in law and i watched 1  2 at the house back to back and then went and saw three for the late night and i think that made it even better this movie was so well put together and really keeps you on your toes throughout the whole film i dont think this is the end of the series pay close attention let the game begin,cruel
i saw this movie in the theatre at a late night show and i have to say that i was a little disappointed i will admit that it had its up and downs but it was really sketchyfirst of all i am fairly sure that this movie was hard to make because saw fans wanted to see more gruesome killings than anything this was given to them but at a sacrifice in the plot this story was very predictable and it was easy to figure out what was going to happen in the ending the plot follows two victims a doctor and a father who each have their different tasks they both have their fair share of bloody and disgusting scenesthe plot doesnt explore any of the places it could have such as deeper into the fathers life but for a horrorthriller movie i guess it was expectedsecondly the acting was iffy the only decent actor was tobin bell who i personally thought was great the supporting casteven shawnee smith didnt meet up to the standards of the second moviehowever this movie did tie up some loose ends from the first two movies very well meaning the first two movies made a lot more sense i liked some of the traps they still could have been better but the movie just didnt live up to the saw series standardsi give this movie a 510 all i can say is they gave it a shot and nice try,cruel
in my mind the title tself used to suggest the most astounding horrorific cinematic experience you could imagine from a horror and gory movie lived up this expectation but has failed terriblyany real saw fan would be somewhat disappointed by the pace of the story itself has deteoriates where in the story progressed really fast and many things happened with multitude characters  is rather slow unconvincing and sometimes offer chessy and lacking of solid story line and suspensesome gory scenes and tortures may moved my butt to the edge of my seat  but other than that the story itself and the movie did not move me at all,cruel
i finally was able to witness first hand a great movie that was brilliantly put together much better than the second and contains some awesome traps if you are a fan of the saw series you will like it regardless of what anyone tells you but if this is your first attempt at a saw movie i do recommend seeing the first 2 before this one than you can definitely get into just some things wont make since the blood level is up in this one and the number of traps exceeds the first two movies put togetherthis one will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish actually even before the start so make sure to get to theater early so you can see the short but sweet hostel 2 trailer,cruel
i saw the midnight showing last night hubby hated it i loved it once again it draws you in and spits you back out as the screen goes black and the credits roll by now you are expecting the 6 degrees of separation theory as the plot that hasnt changed what changes is the level and the depth of how far will you not go i dont want to put any spoilers because it wouldnt be fair you definitely must see one and two in order to be up to speed the film delves more into amandas mental state of mind if you can over look the expected gore you will realize this movie is deep i do not recommend this film for young children also if youre squeamish dont eat before you wont be able to during,cruel
i saw a saw marathon last night thats right they showed all 3 in a row i gotta say it wasnt any where near as hard on your ass as it was watching the lord of the rings trilogy all in a row and those ones had the extended editions for the first 2 well enough about lotr back to the saw marathon i fell in love with right from the the first 15 minutes to the point i couldnt believe my girlfriend who hates scary movies loved it as much as i did thats a sure sign it was head and shoulders above any other scary movie out there what a great way to build up the tension and suspension for by showing all of them in a row this one is fantastic youll love it i wont tell you anything about it dont want to give away anything i look forward to seeing it again on the big screen,cruel
when i went to see the first of the saw movies i could not believe the twists and turns that the movie led me through not in my wildest dreams did i think the movie would end the way that it did did the same thing it kept me on the edge of my seat i am pretty sure i didnt blink the entire time did it again one of the only horror movies that really didnt disappoint me this year sure you can say that it is way too gory and it is the downfall of our civilization to consider it entertainment etc really one has to appreciate what the kind people at twisted pictures have brought us the saw franchise has brought the viewer something that i believe no one has ever seen the blood is only dyed water and the marks on people are only makeup as for people reenacting the saw traps everyone is so quick to blame the movie and not the person i think it is funny how that works no one ever complains about the violence in war or action movies so why complain about this i believe this movie to be a real must see for saw fans and if you dont like it dont complain just dont go see it it is as easy as that,cruel
this new saw movie is awesome and totally rules the latest halloween season i liked it mucho i will see it again and again i think it will get better and better with each paid screening please pay to see this movie a lot and not just because it helps my fantasy mogul team if i were to rate it on a scale of letters from a to r with r being the best id give it an r for sure its bloody in a classy way no doubt about it and the bad guy is scary and smart and sexy sweet but mostly scary if this movie were grits it would be the cheesiest and bloodiest but mmm mmm tasty cheesy bloodoh and dont see babel please someone else in my league has babel and i want to win so dont pay to see it maybe download it or sneak into it after you pay for yet another viewing of the movie of the year ticket,cruel
and his female accomplice amanda two sadistic serial killers with way too much free time on their hands return in this third  and definitely not last  installment of the successful saw franchise its just more of the same really only a lot grosser as director darren lynn bousman treats us to extended images of an open brain surgery as well as a wide variety of other stomachchurning scenes is a really extreme and sick film better not to be seen immediately after dinner and a vast improvement over the mediocre second entry but still lacking far too many elements to be labeled as good horror the scripts main problem is that exactly like with the first two it tries to be overly complex and intelligent even though it totally doesnt fit the overall tone of the film john cramer developed into some kind of wise prophet with his endless speeches about the value of life and remission but hes really just a pathetic old man who cant swallow hes terminally ill and the rest of his surroundings are not most people in this situation go into therapy or join internet forums but instead john lethally punishes the people that too easily take their lives for granted but according to him hes not a murderer no nohe even despises murderers he simply tests people yeah right amanda a former junkie whose eyes were opened by assists the bedridden lunatic in his new diabolical plan centering on a female doctor who doesnt treat her patients tactful enough and a man whos confronted with the people that were responsible for his sons death she needs to keep cramer alive otherwise her head is blown up and he has to find the power to pardon the people who ruined his life or hell die himself the surprise  shock effect of the fist film have completely vanished so youre not very impressed anymore whenever a character threatens to get killed by some type of inventively fabricated device and there are plenty of those for example one girl has to reach into a jar filled with acid to find a key thatll get the bombcollar of her neck and one poor sucker is tied to a floor and flooded with pigintestines gross otherwise is a rather lackluster film its roughly edited and very very dark not talking in terms of atmosphere here but justdark lightbulbs apparently werent included in bousemans filming budget and thus many scenes are just shot in the dark for some reason the character of amanda played by shawnee smith also suffers from completely pointless flashbacks its an admirable attempt of our director to try and connect the three films together but his intentions are too ambitious and his style too hyperactive the tremendous amounts of graphic violence and blood was more than good enough for me oh yes there will be blood,cruel
note serious spoilers read at your own riskthis movie is simply bad i doubt if the director of really accepted such a weak story line gore fans get everything they want in this one but things just doesnt support the plot at allthis movie has very low profiled traps i wonder if they have run out of ideasquick recap of the movie john on death bed lynn kidnapped to save john real amandas past shown amandas will tested by john jeff tested by john jeff suffering from his sons death amanda jealous of lynn and johns bonding johns skull operated by lynn amanda playing her own game jeff passes all tests amanda fails the test and killed by jeff lynn killed by amanda jeff kills john jeff fails the final test and would never see his daughter againdont waste your money on this one and watch babel or grudge 2 or the marine instead,cruel
i have just seen tonight and all i can say is that i am disappointed i just dont understand why they made this movie the answer could have been to tie it all up but still i had an idea what happened to adam what happened to eric how did amanda become apprentice and all so why  why the whole movie to show me flashbacks wellthats cool but wheres the twist all in all  he played a game for amanda thats cool but it was his third already he and now we get to the jeff part the fat man with a bad temper so this guy basically had his son killed by some student he tries to save the student the witness who saw the accident in which his son died but never confessed the judge that sentenced his childs killer to only 6 months in prison he feels bad for them all you can see that but he kills he cannot forgive who basically didnt kill anyone dear to him hmm thats weird jeff never observes the huge collar around his wifes throat either i guess theres nothing wrong with that either hmm nothing funny happening  all in all i think this is the weakest of the saw series almost forgot to mention the huge machines built for torture by a woman with a lot of technical abilities i guess and an almost dead who can hardly move  the twist if i can call it a twist is totally not interesting because you cannot feel anything about jeff eric adam and gordon were developed nicely but jeff will always be a fat man with a bad temper for memaybe just the actor was bad i dont know  i give a 510 only because i liked and and i liked john in too  but if you want to remain with a good idea about the saw series stop at or even ,cruel
wow i mean wow this was so worth seeing it in the movie i know all the saw fans will just be amazed with new traps to people that dont respect their lives and i like the twist when amanda is going to take his place when the old man dies this was sicktwisted mind blowinghorror fun to see and get scared because once your in little horror game for the only way out is courage trust and blood so if you dont have what it takes then its of to hell for you so dont forget to see the other saw movies because if it wasnt for those to movies then we wont have right nowso go watch because this is top one on the best horror movie in 2006 so have fun,cruel
moving the franchise into a trilogy the third brutal torture horror film explains a bit more how pulls off the sick games while showing even more gore the film begins with eric matthews donnie wahlberg breaking his leg in an attempt to escape captivity detective kerry dina meyer searches for eric but she also falls victim to awful torture the main story consists of john kramer tobin bell and his pupil amanda young shawnee smith kidnapping a surgeon lynn denlon bahar soomekh in order to keep john alive wants to oversee one last game before he finally passes away so attaches a deadly necklace to lynns neck that has shotgun cartridges all around it and will go off if johns heart rate stopsthe test revolves around jeff angus macfadyen who must go through a series of awful tortures he lost his son in a drunk driving accident and has never recovered his first test is to help the woman who witnessed his sons death danica debra mccabe from freezing to death she is hung up naked in a frozen locker and has water sprayed on her periodically unless jeff grabs a key he burns his cheek grabbing the key but doesnt save her in time the next round is the judge who let the killer go judge halden barry flatman the judge will be drowned in rotten pig guts if jeff doesnt burn his sons possessions to get the key check out more of this review and others at swillikycom,cruel
is an amazing horror film and one of my favorites this movie has some of the best special effects ive ever seen also not to mention some of the best traps in the entire franchise they were gory and very abstract my favorites were the angel trap the shotgun collar the pig juicer and the rack i also liked how the story in this film was more emotional than the previous ones i was able to feel for the characters and what they were going through and that surgery scene looked so realistic man so much detail went into the making of this film love it,cruel
is the third movie of the saw series and in this one we have who kidnaps a doctor to keep him alive and in the same time he plays with his new apprentice who put in a brutal testi liked this third movie because of the connection with the two previous movies of saw and because of the interpretation of tobin bell who plays as and john kramer i also liked very much the interpretation of bahar soomekh who plays as dr lynn denlon and i believe that she was really outstandingfinally i have to say that is a really nice movie and i was not expected to be such a nice movie,cruel
rather sadly isnt quite as good as the first two films in the franchise but at the same time the bar was set very high by those two films what held this film back was some inconsistent acting by the supporting cast too many games taking place in a short amount of time with some of them having very little relevance to the story and although the plot was once again very strong the final twist wasnt as shocking nor as complex as the previous two films making it appear as if the writers took less care on the plot and more interest on the gore content the acting was rather strong in this film but not as good consistent or as strong as the previous films with some of the leading cast being a little bit inconsistent with their characters and performances for instance bahar soomekh delivers a good performance overall but there are a few certain scenes in which she made lynn an unbelievable character which removed some tension from some scenes shawnee smith reprises her role as amanda once more and on the whole is amazing but once again there are a few scenes which were a bit under acted which made me very aware that i was watching a film and therefore it made it a little less compelling tobin bell however once again excels as and is marvellous throughout the supporting cast was very mixed indeed but overall i felt that they were pretty weak unlike the previous two films where the supporting cast were just as brilliant as the leading cast for example mpho koaho seemed like an amateur and anyone could have played his role and it wouldnt have mattered or made a difference another pretty weak performer was barry flatman who portrayed the judge who wasnt bad but was also far from being good as well the other victims were pretty believable though and did quite a lot for the screen time they were given as for the rest of the supporting cast i felt that dina meyer especially shone in her role for once and its her scenes which stood out for me personally costas mandylor and betsy russell were only on screen for less than a minute and only had about line each but they still managed to deliver their best performances in the series the plot was good but as i stated before the ending wasnt as impressive as the previous two elaborating on the overall plot it was good but for me there were too many traps and this became a problem because now its starting to get repetitive one trap that really was not necessary was dina meyers for we already know that amanda created an inescapable trap and i personally would have liked to have seen miss meyer in future instalments but at the same time that trap had a major presence and it was this trap which haunted me for a while after seeing this film the rest of the plot though was rather good in my opinion and it was interesting to get a deeper insight on and amandas perspective on that note this film accomplishes something that the upcoming saw films completely fail at flashback scenes they primarily revolve around amanda and these scenes make her seem more humane and empathetic than we might have first thought we get a better insight on why she cuts herself and it clarifies some mysteries that the previous instalments did not answer and i loved this effect as it was effective and unique in the telling of this story and it also made the telling of this story more fluent too another feature that i love about this film is the slow evolution of characters especially amanda and allison both of whom are minor characters in the first film but by this point they are pivotal characters in the series who are continuously referenced after their demise so in conclusion this film once more has a good plot and a good ending the acting on the whole is mixed and does effect the quality of the film just a little bit which is a great shame what is also made apparent in this film is their focus on gore content which in turn shifts them slightly from the plot and it is this that ultimately spells disaster for the future saw films nevertheless is a very enjoyable instalment and a must see for fans of the franchise,cruel
i could not believe what had happened at the ending of this film i really thought that amanda had some feelings for jign this film and had some hatred for the doctorlynn denlonwho had been by his side most of the time and she wanted her trap go off and see her die but not jigthought that all the traps in this film were pretty good but the trap called the rackcross like twist trapwas pretty intense for the viewers i thought that man in that trap didnt quite deserve that way to die and i did feel sorry for jeffgoing around and trying to prove justice to all that did wrong in the case of his dead sonat the end because not only did he lose his wife but he lost his daughter somewhere in the warehouse and he was stuck in a room full of dead bodies with not really a way out but he should have realized that device around his wifes neck would kill her badly and wait to avenge his son until the collar was off of her and she was in good care of paramedics but it was to late now i love every trap in this film but the one with the woman being frozen to death was pretty bad for her and jeff because he didnt have time to release her from the chains or stop the water from freezing her down into a frozen slab of meat but very good movie i cant wait for the next film hopefully will return good as new maybe maybe not,cruel
the very first saw movie was very boring but had a great storyline ok acting and a fare amount of gore the twist was the best part of the movie lacked acting skills and trap gore the gunpeephole was pointless i would have rather seen the dude go through the house and redeem himself when no one else could and finally comes out tops the first 2 by far it is the longest movie which allows better storyline the storyline gets me hooked if the traps fall short of expectations ie saw the dialogue was very good and the emotion felt real especially with shawnee smith i loved every second of it beginning till end but even now i still cringe when matthews crushes his foot gross and painful but still smart and reasonable on his part kerrys death was also gory but still epic the only thing that was bad for me was jeffs test i felt that every chance he had to save someone it was fairly easy the freezer room just put your jacket on the poles and get the key the pig vat just burn the toys the rack make sure no one is in front of the shotgun stupid judge and untie the key everyone should have survived jeffs test but oh well amandas final testtwist was good i loved that knew she wasnt changing and tested her again she never learned and so she had to die i felt that if she truly loved john she would have listened and followed the rules but she is dead the best part was the twist again jeff had to save john and forgive him to save his wife and daughter but jeff let anger control his life killed his wife john and himself great movie overall best of the series thought it comes in second to d dont hate910,cruel
the saw series descended to absurdity in the second sequel of the franchise picks up where left off with conducting his final testthe performances are average the violence bloody and extremely gory and the storyline watchable but not gripping is most definitely the worst n the neverending seriesfor hardcore saw and horror fans only510 rated r for extreme violence some coarse language drug references  brief nudity,cruel
jeff is an anguished man who grieves and misses his young son that was killed by a driver in a car accidenthe has become obsessed for revenge against the man and reckless with his wife and daughterwhen dr lynn denlon who has troubles with her marriage is abducted by the deranged apprentice amanda she is brought to a gruesome warehouse to keep john kramer alive in spite of having a terminal brain tumour amanda puts a necklace gadget full of explosives around dr lynns neck connected to john kramers life support system and tells her that if he dies the device will explode meanwhile jeff is submitted to a sick game of forgiveness with surprising dark consequencesthere is a lot more drama in this then the previous two there is a lot more gory deaths as well it has some really nasty deaths scenes in this with some cool traps small spoiler there is one death scene which did make me look away as it had got a lot of broken bones in that scene i just can not watch broken bones the acting was so much better then the last two  the whole cast was really good the endind was really good its a shame they carried the series on as this would have been a perfect ending to the series as i find this perfect ending to series i going give this movie 7 out of 10,cruel
the saw franchise gets so much hate the films get hate for being torture porn and while i liked it a lot if i had to label any film that it would be the opening scenes the one involving detective matthews the one with the man in chains and the one with kerrys final scene are all probably the most disgusting gruesome disturbing scenes ever in a horror film i was flinching so much and maybe the strong opening is what got a lot of critics mad and from then on they decided not to like it i actually had that same attitude while saw was disturbing but did not show much and the sequel more gruesome none of them ever came close to the torture scenes in and so i was prepared to hate it but as the film went on i noticed how different it was from i loved the mystery and tension in the original and while does not compare i actually think it comes close to being just as good is actually a much better film than which i would never have imagined goes the formulaic way of horror films with a group of people trapped in a scary house each getting killed one by one is not like this it revolves around two stories and giving us more information on and how amanda came to be his assistant it is all very interesting and while i thought bahar soomekh was the weakest i found shawnee smith and tobin bell are very strong actors they completely made these characters be what they are and while we had already seen tobin bells great acting in we had not seen smith this important before she really creates a very compelling and scary character her facial expressions her moods she gives one heck of a performance and good for her towards the end the film does become more messy but i loved it all the signature twist did not disappoint although we can hardly be shocked or surprised as much as in the original saw because we know every time there is a saw film there will be a twist at the end but props to this film i can see the reason many critics hate it is because of the gruesome and bloody torture scenes but the film does have central themes about human nature that doesnt make it a brainless horror film is actually better than and almost as good as the original now i have to see the next installments,cruel
upon watching this movie i hoped it would redeem itself from the previous saw movie which was greatly inferior to the first installment unfortunately it proved to be even more boring and redundant than its predecessor the movie follows a man i already forgot his name probably jack or jeff or something common like that through a series of games which the mysterious a dying serial killer has prepared for him in order to test his forgiveness meanwhile has captured a young doctor who is to keep him alive long enough so that he can witness his final gamethe movie fails in many ways the plot is similar to that of the two previous movies yet the tension which was one of the main strengths of the first s almost inexistent the acting isnt that great either the actor who plays jigs decent but the rest of the cast are hopelessly under par the whole experience is in fact quite an ordeal and i was relieved to see the movie end after two hours dark scenes and useless wandering by the supposed protagonist finally the shock ending is needlessly complex and not very different than that of the two other movies it even foreshadows more bad news a fourth saw movie this makes me wonder how much worse can these movies get,cruel
the inevitable deadening effects of repetition are beginning to infect the saw franchise now having produced its third installment in as many yearswhile provides a decent number of new twists psychological as well as torturewise it necessarily lacks the originality of its predecessors and  if the blase response at an openingday screening at new yorks amc theatre on 42nd street is any indication  audiences may be beginning to develop a been there done that attitude the film opened friday and unlike the prior editions was not screened in advance for pressseamlessly similar in style to the earlier films this sequel finds its archvillain tobin bell again delivering a quietly intense and scary performance not doing so well desperately ill he and his loyal follower amanda shawnee smith have enlisted  well forced  the help of a female doctor bahar soomekh to perform some emergency surgery helping to motivate her is the fact that shes been outfitted with an explosive collar tied into heart monitor so if he dies she dies with him,cruel
tobin bell is dying and his protg amanda shawnee smith is slowly taking his place jigs planning a huge game for a vengeful father jeff angus macfadyen who wants revenge for his son death since his son got hit by a car since jeff is trapped in a huge mysterious industrial place jeff has to find all the clues to get out while kidnaps a doctor bahar soomekh to operated on his condition but this doctor finds herself frighten by amanda what the doctor jeff or even amanda doesnt know that jigs planning a huge trip for them which they should play the rules to survivedirected by darren lynn bousman made an strong second sequel to the successful saw movies director bousman and screenwriterleigh whannell saw go on a darker route on this one by fleshing out character development having unique death traps and some sadistic dark humour this is the darkest of the three films although isnt quite suspenseful as the first one or wicked as the second one but it is different despite some slow spots here and therethis is the unrated dvd by having some minutes of additional footage dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen1851 transfer and an strong dolby digital 51 surround sound the highlights of the dvd are the three commentary trackswhich they are informative humorous and entertaining commentary one is by the directorbousman screenwriterwhannell and executive producerspeter block and jason constantine commentary two is by the producersoren koules and mark berg commentary three is by the directorbousman editorkevin greutert and director of photographerdavid a armstrong dvd also includes featurettes and trailersthe best achievement of is actually the good production designs by david hackl even though has a story it feels more like style over subtances wins this one over dina meyer returns in this one in a small part and as well donnie walhberg from whannell appears as adam in a cameo from the first film has some strong moments some unexpected twists and a few surprise cameos seems to be the perfect way to end the series but since it was an box office success studiolions gate and directorbousman are already working on saw 4 i always felt that runs of steam towards the end by saw 4 hopefully they should come up with new stories and characters if they want to make this franchise fresher its daring but directorbousman did a good job with the second and third of the series probably still has the right elements to surprise the audiences with the future movies story by james wan dead silence death sentence saw and leigh whannell ,cruel
well well what a waste of my time and money rented this out after plucking up the courage to watch itoh dear god why after hearing so many reports of it being stomach churningly violent with blood and guts and revolting tortures i was biding my time until i felt i could stomach it after all id heard people were fainting and throwing up in the movie theatresif all you like is gore and eeewwwww moments then this is probably for you i have no problem watching gore nut its in your faces all the time now that it takes a lot for me to cover my eyes in the first scene of this film for example i burst out laughing which somehow i dont think that is what they were aiming forthe storyline was disjointed and confusing i had no idea what was going on and how everything was supposed to link together this could just be my fault as my mind was wandering quite a bit i stuck it our for a full half hour then left my fianc to try and make sense of it he gave up shortly afterthey seem to have sacrificed a decent plot to try to raise the shock factor didnt work for me,cruel
i couldnt wait for this sequel after the first two films and i was not disappointed this film is really one for the audience more gore more imagination and no mercy i am no stranger to blood and gore and very rarely grossed out but this film for some reason really got to me there were times namely in the second to last game where i was squirming in my seat wishing the victim would just dieif you are a saw fan shame on you for not seeing it yet its easily on a par with maybe even above the first movie stop reading this and get to that video store now but if you are easily freaked out just give this one a miss,cruel
just seen it at the movies and it was not just boring but also disgusting at a level i was going to get away from the seat and ask my money backthis is not a movie someone can enjoy to see this is something to use in the fireplace instead of woodi really really didnt like it it was extremely disgusting right from start to end and it was sad and without good things in the end i wont spoil what happens but in the end you wont feel quite satisfied from the whole story the screenplay and stuff is okay but the story is just crapi was going to walk away and ask my money back that should be enough to describe the movie,cruel
if you can handle gore and violence and torture then this is the movie for you im only 14 and ive seen every nasty movie out there this is a nasty movie me and friends started watching it and there was 6 of us and by half way through it was just down to me and my one friend this isnt one of those movies that shows half of ityou see everything its amazing how real it looks to there is lots of torture and blood and just creepy scenes where you will be asking yourself holy crap who comes up with this stufflike really its pretty random gross stuff this movie has a few twists like the other two if you havent seen the other two its probably not a good idea to get this one because you might not get some parts but even if you havent seen 1 and 2 and your looking to get scaredtrust me you will,cruel
when i saw this film i was to be honest expecting this to be like the 2nd film with more gore than psychology but i was surprised that i was wrongmanaged to keep the psychology of the 1st film and mix the gore with the 2nd film to be honest i cant see why people passed out in this movie it wasnt even that gory compared to hostel the mix was surprisingly good i was on the edge of my seat for most of the filmi dont see how people can brand this movie as a horror movie as i like many other viewer were not scared once maybe horrified at one stage and surprised at the shockingly twist at the end but not scaredin the end this in my opinion is the best in the series so far and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime thriller,cruel
hi first of all i only want to say that this movie has to be seen by all fans of the trilogy and by all horrorsplatterthriller  freaksthis movie contains really ugly painful and awful scenestraps which shouldnt be seen by people with weak characters or mindsin spite of the ugly scenes the film ends really astonishing i was very critical be4 i saw  this film because i heard a lot about a weak story and the end shouldnt be very great but i has been reteached about my prejudice 3 part only 2 make money  only splatter  no story and so on  but after the end i loved it the third part is rounding the complete story of all three parts and its all in one now it explicates the things from 1 and 2 part which werent clarified until now i really hope there will be a fourth part so watch this film and judge by yourselfgreez,cruel
is the best so far far out gore twice the suspense and overall awesome acting it takes a certain kind of person to act like its truly happening in front of their eyes i have to say makes me look forward to pt4 i cant waitif you havent seen it what are you waiting for im a huge fan of thrillers horror and psychological thrillers and so far is on top of my list ii are already on my shelf of musthaves and this is the next movie that will be added to my evergrowing collection of gore flicks this movie will have you saying oh man that must hurt ouch ,cruel
yeswith no doubt  this part worth every penny  the scenes are strong to the extreme  if u loved part 1 then u gonna wish for part 4 coz watching part 3 will prove to u with no doubt  it was definitely a successful sequel  hold your breath  and dont watch it with your family or even at night  guarantee 100 suspense and unexpected ending u must see it now  a little advice  better to watch  ii first it will increase your entertainment when watching part 3 to 10000 both the acting and camera angles were great  i wouldnt be amazed if this movie selected the top best among others of its same category  the directing was fascinating too  just imagine this  u gonna loose track of time the minute u start watching this movie  and i think u wouldnt mind loosing it again  if u decided to watch it one more time  lets just say  it will be the best lack of time u will ever enjoyso go ahead and  enjoy,cruel
first of all i know this review is gonna be frowned upon by the lame folks out there that take movie making a little too seriously this isnt rocket scienceits i must say i was shocked that this movie completely out did the first two especially when in comes to the gore factor and the latest versions of the traps good story aspect as welli found myself in shock and looking away at times in a goodfun wayit is after all only fiction but this kind of reaction to a scene is definitely missing in the genre this is definitely gonna stand out in my memory along with the ring part 1 and blair witch part 1 as a classic in the genre and the trilogy itself is a memorable series910,cruel
the first saw was intriguing although it was so obviously derived from seven i still thought it was clever one of its traits i admired was that it made me flinch from the gore without actually displaying any gore in my humble opinion that is an example of the art of movie making i admit the ending caught me offguard and in a fun icantbelieveididntseethatcoming sort of waynot worth the breath required to cast a commenti heard great things about of course i had heard great things about king kong 2005 too i was disappointed in fact i had to literally force myself to watch the film i saw the ending coming within the first 15 minutes i felt absolutely no pity for any of the characters save the poor chap who was forced to swim in pig guts the gore was disgusting in an obnoxious and irritating kind of way is a prime example of a film franchise that needs to be put down to sleep permanently,cruel
not a bad horror film though i have to say the first film is still the best in the franchise  is a better film than this one in the storyline department but the gore in this film is better than its 2 predecessors great gore scenes where gets brain surgery  the lady dr has to very graphically open up his brain  the scene of dina meyers detective character getting her ribs ripped open was extremely brutal if kinda disappointing as the cameras pulled away at a crucial moment also the judge having to slowly drown in the rotted pig corpses was especially gross  very inventive and the storyline of amanda being the one who was doing the killings for explains a lot as i used to wonder how in the hell a sickly terminally ill man could kidnap  then concoct these elaborate torture devicesbombs to pull these people apart not a bad film but i heard they are planning on a saw 4  i dont see how due to the death of tobin bells character at the end of this one but please dont make angus megatons character a follower of methodsthat would be lame  out of ,cruel
greetings again from the darkness third in the saw series developed by james wan this one is significantly better than the second but falls short of the first due mostly to the lack of freshness three is as two wasdirected by darren lynn bousman who benefits from a much more complex script and less complicated gadgets and contraptionsthis story centers around the eerily great tobin bell playing one of his infamous games with a brilliant yet detached doctor played well by bahan soomekh who is charged with keeping alive during his last tests on his protg amanda played horribly in her third turn by shawnee smith the twists are minimal in this story but as opposed to the twists and turns make sensebe prepared for even more gore than the first two but again we have no character that we really care about or pull for amanda may be one of the least sympathetic film characters ever the flashback scenes are not very effective  the exception being donnie wahlberg and his poor foot as always the best scenes include tobin bell and his lessons of life for the misguided souls who end up on the wrong end of his fair tests,cruel

leigh whannell and james wan created one of the most intriguing filmsfranchises that most notedly arrived at a trend of torture porn while violence has been always present in horrorthrillers its a key element though contemporary film makers have taken heed to throw their audience into the violence head first without hesitation the victims suffer pain and agony while similarly we the audience suffer in respect having to witness such anguish unsuspecting people thrown into intricately designed games to inflict pain and suffering with death as the usual outcomewith his new apprentice amanda continue there quest to free people from their lives which they act is worthless they soon release how much they value their life when placed in a live and death situation saw started of as a simple two hander up the body count with multiple victims is a strip back to basics stripping the cast back ultimately creating the best of the three filmssaw had amazing concepts and potential yet not executed well a flawed yet effective thriller dropped the ball with characters you wouldnt give a second look just waiting idly by while each one meet their maker in grizzly deaths whannel taking helm with the pen again regained focus and drastically change the formula around takes time and doesnt rush you may think other wise when two victims are dispensed straight off whannel calms the chaos of simple consecutive killings and develops characters you care and connect withrunning two games parallel has kidnapped dr lynn denlon to keep him alive or she dies along with his fate concurrent is another game with victim jeff a depressed father unable to move on from his sons death jeff is faced with a series of tests in an ultimate battle for him to let go unlike the previous installments pathos is given to both lynn and jeff trapped in both their predicaments layers are revealed in amanda trying to take on legacy and her initial genesis time slips back new angles revealed upon parts of saw and developing the story and digging into the characters payed of enormouslyback to the torture porn its an element used extremely well by director darren lynn bousman while used minimally and effective by james wan bousman over drove the gore and violence in without much merit to be given violence for violence sake taking focus slowing down the hyperactive quick cut directing the violence and gore works more effectively extremely more effectively its gut wrenching and energy draining its exhausting after this ride is over each test sees an increase of extreme torture hitting to the most disturbing center pieces the wrack paradoxically the violence is the main drawing power to this franchise and the most deterring for bousman pushed to the boundaries too far becoming all too much at times but credit due exceeding in his plan to make you shift uncomfortably in your seatraising the level in another aspect is the acting tobin bell evokes eeriness just from his voice shawnee smith is steely cold and maniacal and the best out of the whole cast angus macfadyen mixes pain resentment and sorrow in jeffs turmoil bahar soomekh is amazing stuck in a conflict on interests and morals maybe as bousman took time to pull better performances out of his cast you care more about them and what actually happens to themwith time and focus given to the story and development of the characters instead of churning out a simple money spinner to play off the original saws success supersedes its predecessors,cruel
i find the saw series very overrated the first was watchable and something a bit different the second was the biggest piece of st sequel in recent years so i went to see this with low expectations and was actually surprised that they did something very differenttobin bell is dying thats not to say he still isnt devising traps jeff angus macfadyen is put through a series of tests he is wandering through different rooms where he meets different people involved with his sons deaths he needs to save these people from various traps meanwhile lynn bahar soomekh needs to keep alive or the device strapped to her head will explodethere is much more character development in this one than in the others i cared for the victims and there was a lot of insight into john and amandas characters the acting was actually good in this one and the special effects were topnotch that said there were a few things that really bugged me about his movie one major problem was the editing like all the other saws the editing is quick and flashy and its very irritating as is the music also this movie relied way too much on sadistic gore to scare the audience it gets quite boring after awhile rendering the movie absolutely scare free25,cruel
okay well the movie was amazing for starters it lived up to the saw title yet again there was one problem due too how much the first two saw movies made you think and piece together everything like a puzzle you knew something would tie the events together so my one main problem with the movie was that it was way to predictable about a half and hour in i knew what was going to happen i knew how everything was tied together and i knew who the people were i say that even though the movie was still quite amazing the first two beat it to a pulp maybe it is just me and it did not explain all that much in the movie about how they got the other people but that is all i will say without giving away anything dont get me wrong i loved the movie i hope they make another less predictable installment in the series,cruel
i just t this evening and i was very pleased i was looking for more suffering blood guts and gore to redeem it from pt 2 which was still good but if i had to put them in order it would have to be 312 everone go see it with all the horror movies coming out that are pg13 we need something to shake us up and saw deliverswith it delivers more inventive traps and devices  more suffering  more twists turns and just kinda thinking ahead even with the way it ended i still think that i could even pull off a good saw 4 even though i just read a column that they were announcing october 26 2007 i was thinking of ways that i could make this continue onyour suffering will be legendary even in hell,cruel
both me and my fianc went to see tonight and i felt like walking out after 10 minutes if not less dont get me wrong i know its just a film but it just goes beyond the extreme in terms of gore i like to watch a film and let my imagination do the rest but this way too graphical i watched quite a lot of the film looking through my fingers and at some points i had to close my eyes and cover my ears i know i might sound mellow dramatic as its just a film as my partner says but its just the concept of it other people had to look away as well so needless to say its definitely got the realism factor so apart from the fact that it is very gory and a couple walked out 10 minutes before the end the sound and visual effects and acting were very good if you enjoy these type of films and dont take them too seriously like me then id recommend also because i couldnt overlook the sick factor i didnt pay as much attention to the story which is a shame really because it had the scope of being an excellent film like the first one,cruel
after being very disappointed of i expected another lame movie well with this one the movie makers really tried but somehow i couldnt get excited for it many of the strange things in the movies are getting clear at the end of it so i wont complain about them though i didnt like the way the policewoman was treated what i missed was suspense was psychological pressure on the people despair anger being really horrified the people killed in this moviethey had almost no personality none of them thats what i dont like about this one thats what i didnt like in movies like hostel you dont feel anything about the people because you dont know them or you dont like them it doesnt matter to you if they are tortured to death or not you maybe think okay that was rude but nothing more the family father in he was chosen because he was so sad about the death of his little 8years old son really come on what the hell is that a crime this is pretty farcatched the conclusion at the end of it was unfortunately not so surprisingly and so well prepared like in how could it it was just part 3 but somehow i had the feeling that the people working on the movie really tried to make an exciting movie but in some way i think it was more or less boring the more i think about it so 3 stars is okay it was bad the story wasnt too good but it wasnt as bad part 2 which was a relief see it once and then forget about it,cruel
as a huge fan of the saw series i counted down the days until this movie opened up in theaters ive heard nothing but good things about it since then and i can see why a lot of the people were disappointed with i actually liked better the acting in was more gutwrenching for me than the gore and this movie proved to tie both together into something everyone could appreciate they did an excellent job researching what fans liked about these movies and it truly feels like fans were delivered the best that could be offeredwhat can i say without giving away anything the pace is excellent opening up with 2 gruesome traps to get the heart pumping and nonstop suspense switching from situation to situation the traps were horrifying disturbing intense and extreme guaranteed nightmares i find it incredible that the director can create sequences that provoke tension anxiety horror and terror without having to input senseless gore the saw series is impressive in this day and age of bad pg13 horror movies alagrudge because the horror sequences arent used to create the bear minimum of entertainment they are used to dictate a great and clever story is carrying along a great series keep em coming,cruel
this was a great film indeed i usually dont flinch or turn away from horror films but this one was sick and twisted i cant believe almost everyone was shocked by this film i thought the film was going to be short and not that good i saw the other two and barely sat through them but this film i was on my toes and anticipating every next move i thought and 2 were ok but not as good as texas chainsaw massacre 2004 and the remake of the old one too i recommend this movie to everyone you will think this is one of the gruesomest movie almost ever made theres nothing but death after death and you never get a chance to see too many people but once or twice before they die so go ahead and watch this movie i guarantee if your a horror film lover you will definitely love this film,cruel
i absolutely loved this movie i actually saw the saw trilogy where they played 1 2 and then 3 in a row and it was the best night of my life i could not wait to see the third one i was expecting it to be good since the writer leigh whannell said it was the goriest of the three and that he got physically ill while watching it he was right i have never felt like that from watching a movie before and it was so good i went to see it with some friends and we were literally squirming in our seats so yeah it was very good i can remember watching the very first one and at the end i was crying because i was so grossed out and upset from the end and i didnt watch it for another 8 months but then i watched it again and it became my favorite movie i then bought the first and second ones and i loved them so much then i ended up waiting for the third one for forever it seemed so i finally got to see it and i loved it if you are a saw fan this one is a must must must,cruel
this movie in my personal opinion was amazing i mean it was a little unrealistic but you never know definitely tops the other 2 if you are looking for a movie with gore thrill and suspense this movie is for you this movie contains some nudity though which is different from the other two though the nudity isnt that long it is still their another thing is that this movie was hyped up to be the goriest movie in over 20 years they lied their were some gory parts i admit but anyone remember hannibal he fed someone their brain that is a tad gorier that some performing surgery this movie for the die hard fans will be amazing beyond belief but for those people who havent seen the first two your screwed it answers a lot of unsolved questions about the first 2 i loved it and i suggest you see it,cruel
wow the latest of the saw movies will there be any more and the goriest by far my fianc who is not normally bothered by gore proclaimed it to be the most gruesome film hes ever seen now thats praise indeed from him believe me if youve seen the previous instalments the plotdeath scenes will be nothing new to you whoever thinks up the death scenes for these movies must have a poorly head its not an intellectual film dont go expecting something highbrow it follows in the same format as the previous two a great film for a saturday night  thoroughly enjoyed it when it finished last night the packed out cinema gave a spontaneous round of applause,cruel
while they stepped up on the gore a bit its still the same saw we know and love this is one of my favorite trilogies ever with every entry being just as strong if not stronger as the one before it you get everything with the third installment gore story acting creativity and one hell of an ending every saw film had me covering my mouth my eyes wide with shock at the twists and this one delivers just as superbly as the other two fans of saw will love this one if youre not already a fan of the first two however i doubt this one will change your mind as its hardly a departure from the previous two movies if anything it embraces what it is even more,cruel
i waited for about 7 months and i finally watched it it was definitely gory as the creators said today i almost lost my reserved place which i was reserved two days ago about 88 of all watcher was reserved heir places because this movie is very very popular and all people are crazy about itthe beginning of this movie was too dark and i cant see anything but the creepiest thing was showed very good everyone in hall was freak out i was expected the chains scene first but the bathroom was okwhen they kidnapped a doctor lynn then begins the movie the rules was really smart and it was definitely entertaining i dont knew that jeff had to revenge for hes angriness thoes three traps was not that good that the original and first sequel but it was much torture that psychological nightmareactors acted the same wonderful like in the original there was more twists and it makes this movie to be one of the best in horror script was the same too because james wan is the same good as like in past three years if it will be a part iv i will go there sure if it will be a world premiere i give a 8 for the one of goriest movies of all time,cruel
same director as part 2 same writers and same production team what could they do to the franchise to keep you attracted bringing out different versions of the flick so i just watched the 113 minutes version more then imdb stated 108 minutes the story picks up exactly were part 2 ended but naturally they had to bring in back again the torture porn that was now on his heydays but they moved a bit away from the genre by going in much deeper into the relation between amanda and and i must say that it worked out fine they dared to put out some main actors from part 2 and brought in some new names dina meyer had to leave as did donnie wahlberg new names came in and the most important one to the franchise is costas mandylor but here he is only 2 minutes in it i was glad that they moved away from the story like in part 2 were we had a bunch of convicts being brought together here we do have some victims who are going to meet some devices and i must say that they were so far the gruesomest in the series the one in the beginning were troy jlaroseis full of chains going trough his body is also one that nobody will forget on the other hand the twisting of bone structure isnt for the faint hearted too what they also brought in was full frontal nudity doing so with another device it was something we hadnt seen so far in the seriesthe way it was filmed was the same as in the previous flicks a lot of flashbacks and the use of fast moving images the revealing at the end was again unpredictable and now i must admit that i was glad that i am watching them in a row because you pick up so much details if you watched them one at a year as they came out you have forgotten a lot i liked this version more then even as it has less blood in it but when it comes to the bloody parts its more gory then part 2 in fact you could see that the editing and use of score was done by the same editor kevin greutert he also will be becoming more and more important in the franchise after part 5 he will be the new directornow that i picked up the saw franchise and am beginning to like it more and more it do has a good storyline and you want to see what is going to happen next surely one to have in on your horror shelvesgore 45 nudity 25 effects 55 story 45 comedy 05,cruel
okay now i heard from my friends that this 1 sucked i looked online and they seemed to kinda agree but it was awesomefirst things first the plot its about a married couple with problems that has been captured by the socalled serial killer named and one has to keep alive at all times from cancer while the other is playing a series of deadly gamesin this saw they focus a lot about the character amanda who has a story quite interesting i am not going to spoil anything but i can tell you this do not watch without watching the other 2 the character jigs once again such an awesome villain and the acting from others was pretty good the complaint i might have for the film is that they went a little overdone with the gore it was not at all necessary but i wont slam the film hard for thatoverall is a clever and well done sequel so hopefully v does not ruin the franchise by the waythere are three twists in and they are pretty cool 8510,cruel
first of all i dont know why people find this disgusting its called everybody knows each sequel gets bloodier and bloodier what do they expect the only problem this film is that the nudity wasnt needed i still have not seen saw 4 but i intend to watch saw 456 and 7 this movie is indeed very gory and gruesome but it was still worth watching very worth it the rated r version may be less gorier because i got unrated version but i do highly recommend this saw movie to every hard horror fan like me i got the cleanest version that i could find on netflix they did not have the rated version the had the regular uncut version and the unrated directors cut version be warned there is a disgusting scene involving pig carcasses the ending is very bloody but if are looking for a good friday night fright this would be a great movie to rent i very highly recommend this film look for enjoy,cruel
masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years some movies are made to tell us why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies marvelously written and brilliantly filmed very interesting and intriguing the message of the saw series movies are clear  dont abuse yourself dont abuse others control your emotions and be fair do not take drugs do not smoke do not cheat or lie do not frame others try to forgive do not keep vengeance control the obsessions do not make profits on others death  follow the rules and you will win in the end do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome heinous there are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are tested but i think its a glimpse of hell what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues its not a game  make your choices cherish your lifewhen the legacy was handed over from john to detective hoffman it all started going in the wrong direction he tried to fulfill johns will but as he had lesser human side and was going himself against the rules he became a victim to be tested by himself the final chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now mostly innocent and police officers before it is game over,cruel
has surprises and twists galore but the best thing about it is they all have a point and a reason you have to pay strict attention throughout the movie because every detail counts every scene is precious because the twist at the end will knock you straight out of your seat at least it did with me for my tastes was too slick for its own good too glossy and brought back all the elements that i loved in the 1st one it really messes with your mind and digs deep into your emotions by giving you characters you can identify with the best had to be jeff by far i felt so bad for him i could feel the pain he was going through and despite his selfish motives you just wanna reach out and help him if you have a weak stomach youre best to avoid at all costs because this is one of the grisliest movies ive ever seen in my life has scares gore good storyline and great psychology its without a doubt the best sequel in the seriesperformances tobin bell is a frightening presence not because of his physical appearance but because of the games he plays hes at his best here and i was frightened by him on plenty of occasions shawnee smith goes all out here and gives an absolutely spell binding performance her vulnerability yet the psychotic side she displayed at the same time kept me on edge the whole way shes one of the many reasons this movie works so well shes great to look at too angus macfadyen is one tortured individual and for good reason his heart is broken after the loss of his son and him bordering on the brink of obsession was just heartbreaking to watch bahar soomekhs cold portrayal of lynn worked and also worked against her her character is shady and selfish but it worked for the part though i cant say i felt much sympathy for her donnie wahlberg doesnt have much to do this time around dina meyer is ok in her screen timebottom line this is what most sequels aspire to be it holds up against the original really well and in my opinion is the real sequel to saw they should have stopped here because this is as good as it gets910,cruel
the first two were fantastic and i had seen what the critics thought of this one and ignored them and it came out okay basically the film begins with det eric matthews ransoms donnie wahlberg from the second one escaping by breaking his foot to get out of his chains and then we move on to the cops finding another corpse after the investigation detective kerry dina meyer from the first two examines latest torture tape and then from discovering a camera in her closet ends up in her own trap then we get to the real story where dr lynn denlon bahar soomekh has been kidnapped by amanda shawnee smith apprentice and taken to or john tobin bell who may be breathing his last breath from his condition of cancer and a tumour lynn has a neck collar with explosive caps put around her and it is connected to heart rate so if his rate drops and he dies so does she from the explosions meanwhile lynns husband vengeful jeff bravehearts angus macfadyen has been told that he has the opportunity to get revenge for the man who killed his son but along the way of these tests he meets people who were linked to the murder that he could revenge on but these tests are mainly to test if he can forgive also starring leigh whannell returning as adam from the first one mpho koaho as tim barry flatman as judge halden lyriq bent as rigg j larose as troy debra lynne mccabe as danica and billy the puppet lol i can see why the critics gave it two out of five stars in terms of confusing flashbacks and i hardly understand the ending with amanda being tested but you cannot help but love the elaborate bloody gore which even more gruesome than the other two films particularly cutting head open to remove skull to relieve pressure traps include the guy with various chains in his body skin and he has to rip them out before the nearby bomb goes off the woman in the trap that will rip her ribcage out unless she gets the key out of the corrosive acid the freezer room with the hanging woman being sprayed by cold water with the key behind some bars the man chained to the floor while pigs fluids from being mashed up by saws are pouring in and favourite the rack with the guy having his arms legs and head twisted with the key on the trigger on a gun may be dead slid on the neck by an electric saw but there may be continuation because he was the only one who knows where jeffs daughter is not as good as the other two but worth a look okay,cruel
this movie is simply pure pleasure from start to finish watching it all and trying to work it all out before the twist is finally delivered is exhilarating and then when it finally is delivered it will leave you breathless basically in my books its the perfect movie  not a moment of dullness and then a twist i was in heaven and i can imagine a lot of other people feeling the exact same way throughout the 2 hours there was a scene at the start when even i felt a bit queasy but after that there werent too many really disturbing scenes for saws standards anyway this one definitely contains the best acting out of the trilogy and is quite possibly the best overall as wellnot for everyone that much is for sure my sister next to me all most passed out at the start but if you think youre one who can handle the jandal you wont be disappointed at all,cruel
i liked and 2 but there was something wrong with number 3 it was really confusing for me i was trying to understand it but something just did not click there was another problem with it it was extremely gory i mean way too too gory the foot thing and wow it was just gross usually i love gore but it was just way too gory for me and there was no shocking ending i wanted a surprise i mean was there a shocking ending because i didnt see it cause it was just too confusing but i did like the film in general it was entertaining but yet again way too gory for me i almost walked outi mean cheese who was the freaking killer people are probably getting angry with me for dissing this film but dont kill me because it was kind of good number one and two were good but the acting was horrible in number one the doctor was so fake and he was ugly as well,cruel
i have to confess that really got me i loved the plot the actors etcnow with the third part they just are going down to the drain more gore not believable plot story etcwhat a shame stop making movies about the torture ultra violence and tones of blood for free hostel 2 is comingtexas chaindo not see any positive ending with this new trend go for scary movies where evil is in your imagination etc take as example some japanese horror movies they do not show how pain is done on their victims they leave it up to you i came out of the movie theater sad my stomach upside down and saying another guts and blood movie like many other cheap movies had been release,cruel
first of all the gore and pain in this movie was very intense saw part 3 is pain personified the fact that came up with so many new ways to torture and torment is proof that there is indeeda god a horror masterpiece this is never gets out of bed the entire movie due to his illness and the man with the robe is very angry i have to admit that the grossest part of this entire movie was the sows being dropped into a blender and then the sow goop going all over the judge i almost puked also the black man who was being tortured was a little gross they actually showed part of his bone snapping out of the lower leg donnie walhbergs role in this was minimal but it did show his crushing and cutting his left foot i was grossed out all in all jigs the best villain of all time,cruel
okay  maybe this isnt a real spoiler but lets just say that the main thing that lacks is the element of surprise if youve seen the other two and youre paying attention youll be able to figure out where theyre going with it  which bothered me personally the gore factor in saw films has been part of their draw but the plot twists were another  and these seem sort of predictable and also imho forced right up in your face  for some reasonon the positive side its nice that  john is allowed a good amount of screen time to develop the character even more than in amandas character flaws come to the surface very clearly  i dont know if thats good or bad acting but everything about her performance felt over exaggeratedso aside from the plots theres the games to consider  theres plenty of gore and the usual saw fare going on the reason i gave this a 6 out of 10 is because in retrospect without spoiling anything it makes sense that certain elements were lacking again if youve been following the films you know about johnscondition and why things have changed a bitas for an obligatory plot summary jigs dying a doctor is kidnapped to keep john alive so he can play out one perhaps final game ill just leave it at thatone other comment  could movie theater owners please stop turning down the bulbs on their projectors to the point where you cant see a gdamn thing its a dark film and when the bulbs brightness has been reduced in an attempt to save money you cant see squat in films like this half the time bottom line its worth seeing in the theater but youll probably want to also see the dvd which will most likely be an unrated one  so you can actually see the film  or go complain to the theater manager,cruel
i can only give this movie a 5 because it lacks much the plot to the story doesnt have the kind of grab youd expect a movie like this to have to me the premise of the movie is good but it isnt executed no pun intended properly it was one gruesome or horrific experience after the other i will give credit to those who think up the torture devices they once again were able to terrify and amaze me at the creativity someone can possess maybe those in the art department could give the people on the other side of the camera a few pointers the acting actually wasnt too bad but there were some parts where it could have used some punching up now i wont pretend to be an expert when it comes to movies i mean im only 18 but i know what the cost of a movie ticket should include for what my money is worth just isnt worth it would you like to play a game its called who wasted an evening and the winner was me,cruel
for all you people that loved all i have to say is come on this movie was bad i didnt like the 1st one but it was tolerable the second one i did like because of character development and the twist at the end made senseso ok if you saw haha heres some things that i thought gave it a 4 warning spoilers 1 no guy that your cheating on your husband with would ever say i want a divorce the writer only added that to trick us so its shoved down our throat that they are married 2 when the judge gets shot by the shotgun he had to be standing in the exact right spot if he was standing 2 inches to the left or by the door or something i am pretty sure the end would have been ten times different as he would have helped angus mcfadden3 the dialogue was extremely lame come on you died inside and your a shell of a man thats so clich4 the apprentice to actress was terrible i didnt know what she was trying to be and she would always make her eyes really wide5 spoiler tells angus mcfadden to exact a pound of flesh any way he choses has killed lots of people so lets just cut him on the neck no torture i mean they had to end the movie right it was getting long6 there were lame scenes that were added to move the story along but in retrospect served no purpose like when thinks of his lover or when the detective got her ribcage ripped out lets not forget donnie walberg who had potential to be something great in this movie but i guess he walked off the set so they just mentioned what happened to him if you show an actor show what happens to him if he walks off the set and cant finish what he startedplease edit his scenes out7 the last tape recorder about his daughter being captured was rushed and out of placei am not some fat guy with a pony tail ranting about a movie cause i have nothing better to do or maybe i am what does it matter but when i saw the 7 out of 10 i didnt want people to get tricked like i didi guess the only real plot twist was that this movie was made by music video directors and not a hollywood movie crew,cruel
i really hate this series saw this is very very super very super very awfuli want to know did someone love saw  i really and very hate tobin bell hes an awful actor  horrible actor i hate hate hate hate this film so muchlion gate film is good  they made many good movies such as see no evil but is very terrible i watch saw and are ok but is the worst film ive seeni want to give 210 but the lowest point is 1 i resist to give 110 because it horrible than that,cruel
finally i saw i was scared id have to wait for the rental but my boyfriend finally got up the courage and we saw the film last night and man this movie was one heck of a film to get through it was so so so so much gorier than the first two i was flinching the whole way through this movie especially the brain operation scene gah nmgah i cant even describe an english word for that scene the contraptions are scarier and seeming more impossible to get out of in the third installment and while we do have a main story this saw seemed more focused on grossing people outthe killer is back but the first three games seem impossible to get out of and ends up killing everyone we find out that the killer is also very sick with a brain tumor and amanda kidnaps a doctor with a troubled marriage and family she has a contraption on her head in order for her to live she has to keep the killer alive in the mean time there is a game going on in the same building with a man who has sworn vengeance on anyone who hurts his family including the death of his son and to kill the man who ran him overthe story was an average contender considering how well put together the first saw was it was good just didnt thrill me as much as the first or second one did it just seemed like the sequels were more based on grossing people out though but i can guarantee you though that has more gore that was for sure but the ending is a good one as you figure out another puzzle i smell another sequel610,cruel
tobin bell is back but at this point he is slowly dying hes in a secret hiding place aided by his assistant amanda shawnee smith amanda kidnaps a brilliant doctor bahar soomekh to keep him alive so he can play one more game with a man angus macfayden who is seeking vengeance for his dead son but theres more here than meets the eyelike the first two this is grim brutal and very bloody including a graphic brain surgery sequence that almost made me bolt from the theatre again it questions right to kill people who dont respect their livesor others but it also ties up some loose ends left in and 2 it especially gives more information on amanda and who she is and why she helps jigt also provides a solid ending for part 2 i dont think theres ever been a case when two sequels to a movie are just as good as the original the godfather movies didnt do it and neither did scream this may be the first time everthe acting is just great bell as always is good and smith is just incredibleshe comes barreling off the screen and takes no prisoners her character goes through some incredible changes and smith pulls them off macfayden is also good but given little to do i was amused when his accent slipped a few times and the same with soomekhlike the first two this left me shakenit really grabs you by the throat and doesnt let go if you havent seen the first two dont bother with thisyou wont be able to follow it also avoid if graphic blood and gore bother you naturally most of the critics have been trashing thisdismissing it as sadistic and pointless there are a few out there though who can see its not just another sick horror filmit has a plot and a point the graphic violence is necessary for the integrity of the picture very disturbing but fascinating too an 8 all the wayi cant give it a 10 because i cant say i enjoyed the film,cruel
starts as burned out doctor lynn denlon bahar soomekh is abducted by amanda shawnee smith the assistant to the terminally ill killer john tobin bell lynn is forced to operate on john in order to prolong his life with the penalty of having her head blown off with shotgun shells attached to a collar around her neck if she fails meanwhile has set up yet another complex game involving a guy named jeff angus macfadyen whose son was killed in a road accident jeff is given the choice to save those he blames for his sons death from killer traps  in turn save his own lifedirected by darren lynn bousman i have to say i really rather liked even though i didnt like the original that much i admit right here  now that i havent seen 2005 but i dont think it particularly matters as i dont think directly follows on from it first of all is another one of those films where there are a couple of versions floating around a theatrical r rated cut  the obligatory unrated version which is the one i will be basing my comments on  is apparently a good 5 or 6 minutes longer the script by leigh whannell who plays adam in the film takes itself very seriously but moves along at a nice enough pace there are a few neat twits  turns in there with the ending being particularly effective in my humble opinion  thankfully it doesnt shortchange us in the exploitation department either with some serious gore  torture scenes which some may find disturbing or sick although from a personal point of view i cant get enough of this stuff  the gorier  more sadistic the better there are only a few characters in the film  their pretty well fleshed out the dialogue is ok  as a whole the story is very satisfying with some memorable scenes like the part where judge halden is buried alive under a river of minced up rotten pigs intestines  flesh i dont know how similar this is to if at all because i havent seen it but its different enough from the original 004 to not feel that familiar  while overall it may not be a better film i thought it was more entertainingreturning from director bousman does a fine job this has some nice colour schemes  has its fair share of stylish moments although some of them are a little mtvish for my liking this has some nice horror scenes in it with good tension theres a nice dark atmosphere running throughout the film  of course theres some top gore in the unrated version people have their heads shot off their rib cages pulled apart peoples limbs are twisted  broken complete with fractured bones bursting out of the skin someone has huge hooks driven into their skin so they resemble something out of hellraiser 1987 feet are bashed in  torn off there is plenty of blood splashed around the place theres one of the best slit throats i can remember seeing as someone uses a bandsaw to slice someones throat open someone is shot in the neck with much spurting of blood as a result  my favourite part when lynn graphically performs diy brain surgery on using a power drill  a bandn a scene pretty much as explicit as they come most of the special effects seemed like actual onset physical makeup effects rather than cgi which is another reason it looks so good definitely satisfies in the gore department  for that i salute it just make sure you see the unrated version although i think thats the version most commonly available pretty much everywherewith a supposed budget of a modest sounding 10000000 wasnt going to able to compete with the mega budget hollywood stuff but the filmmakers obviously used what they had well its well made throughout with impressive gore effects sets  high production values the acting is alright from a largely unknown cast unknown to me anywayis an excellent film in my opinion it has some great gore scenes it has some nice twists  turns  as a whole its pretty interesting  entertaining one of the better horror films of recent times id say  definitely well worth a watch for those with the stomach again directed by bousman v 2007 will apparently be released latter this year around halloween time,cruel
before you even go see make sure youve seen the first two if you havent it may not even be worth your time youll have more questions than answers if you dont come in prepared and i would have to say a vast majority of the plot will not make sensepeople who enjoyed where most likely intrigued by the mystery and shocking conclusion it was a slow deliberate story that amazed even the most apathetic of viewers with its originality lacked the mystery but established a legacy by thrilling its veterans with a face to face sit down with and his lair continues the story and unlike the previous films before the audience knows what is in store from the very startnothing can surprise the audience after and iis ending in fact its almost as if they know motives  they dont however know amandas amanda as apprentice brings a new direction into the movie but its nothing groundbreaking and her general character is laid out in the first twenty minutes besides her small screwball twists you know the plot already  doors being opened will trigger horrific violence and breaking the rules will cost a person dearly in fact this is the first of the saw films where you can actually piece together the proper ending before it happens some may call it a poor script myself i would say the movie accomplished its goalfrom start to finish the audience is engaged scene changes from one center of action happen seamlessly and almost any questions from the first two movies are answered unlike the other saws the ceremonial red drape covering plots is gone a simple symbolism of the audience being familiar with his works and knowing full well what is in store for them and that is what i would say the films goal was for you to fully understand what jigs doing and how he accomplishes itin short see to finish the story and to get a peak at what the fourth installment may be about but dont expect it to be better than although the amount of gore far surpasses the first two combined and you may find yourself at times hard pressed not to turn your head away ans as always if you expect ultrarealism youll find enough holes to ruin any movie including this one,cruel
beastly creative new storygamesreasons some could argue that its convoluted and argue possible plot holes but i didnt mind i loved this movie so many awesome parts and things that relate to the previous movies great continuation of the story less flawed than the first two with the exception of a terrible performance by the doctor actress she was horrendous about 3 viewings,cruel
now the previous two i loved but this one just cuts short at the end no pun intended now the story still well thought out with its twist and turn and had me wondering what would happen next but the main girl thats like the understudy of jigthought was a bit out there with how they portrayed her and at some parts she killed the vibe gore is really being cranked up in this one i do not know if thats a good thing but the traps are interesting and overall a good movie with flaws that earn a little over average,cruel
crisp violent and completely engaging darren lynn bousmans is a horror sequel at the top of its franchises game fitting like a puzzle piece into the scheme of the larger series this third chapter finds its protagonists clashing in a cat and mouse game of traps and morality while the games svengali lies dying bousman imbues the work with sickly glow that juxtaposes a near graceful intricacy of scene and story the work is pulpy and gruesome but it is gripping and cracklingly constructed,cruel
the 3rd film in the saw franchise is where a we get a more action packed and has some of saws best and its unique telling of the events from the prevous 2 movies we also see how amanda was trained in the art of and how she became crazy the cast is tobin bellshawnee smithangus macfadyenbahar soomekh donnie wahlbergdina meyerleigh whannellmpho koahoklyriq bent and costas mandylor by far they are the best cast of villians and those that are being tested by and the traps are more complex and cool and wether they are investgating or in the traps by far one of the best of the series you have to admit with off the twists and turns that happen they are always following along with the classic feel of saw movie this one has to be the best in the series and nothing can compare to this one in the series,cruel
the reason why this film is my favorite saw film so far was that it really focused on the characters instead of using an overabundance of gore or morbidity which is surprisingly minimal for a saw film the challenges that the game player jeff faces involve being able to learn to forgive granted one of these is beyond gross but at the same time jeff has to deal with emotional pain free from physical pain in order to advance in the game i found that to be very clever the plot also has plenty of surprises that are set up well throughout the film and result in some really great on screen revelations the characters interactions during these scenes are also great and have a lot of emotion and significance behind them i feel that the definition of tragedy in the shakespearean sense is put on display in this film in a textbook example the film has the characteristic bleak and grungy saw settings but they fit the story well if youve been watching the series this long and arent just jumping in then they are almost to be expected at this point the film was created very well and has pretty good cinematic quality most of all it has a decent moral message to it that most horror movies dont have or attempt but cant achieveyou can read this and other reviews on my blog at httpsajourneywithjakewordpresscom,cruel
here we go this is in my opinion the last good film in the saw franchise and to me is my second favorite in the seriesbasically john kramer the original killer is about to meet his fate from his brain tumors issue and amanda young his only assistant must search for help to cured his severe problem so she kidnaps an doctor who was originally an assistant of kramers exdoctor to figuredout an way to end it meanwhile an new victim who lost his son from an dui incident a few years prior and ever since then felt vengeful towards his killer must plays game to shows him that forgiveness exists by coming upon a few more victims in traps who are in any way connected to his sons death and it his choice of letting them live or die because of what they do with his personal incidentthe characters in this movie i got to admit is abit better than some of the ones in john kramer and amanda young are still interesting to watch the doctor is abit forgettable however but her relationship with amanda was kinda nice to see the vengeful father was in my opinion a very interesting character just having someone who is really vengeful about someone who he seems to loves alot is great to see and his search for he thinking will be his sons killer during the game have him participate in was enjoyable like a snack the traps in this movie are again good and once again i have a favorite this time is the rack which was pretty intense of a scene probably remained my second favorite trap in the whole series alongside the amanda youngs trap from the first one now i have said positive things about this film that does not means there arent any negative things to say there is unfortunately firstly is the kristys trap kristy byaway is a character from the previous film who is a former partner of the juvies father of an corrupt detective which is shown to be unnecessary in this film as they never mentioned it the rest of the film and they only continued its story in the following one it just seems like they just wants to show us a trap already but this is the third installment and according to the first two films we already know there going to be traps like that so what the point secondly this is what alot of people would kinda agree which is the ending now alot people complains by saying it was all an mistake but honestly it not really like that which i have an problem with it just the craze it shows to people who watches that then make them confused about how there will be sequels in which this started the downhill of the series with the followup v personally i thought this wouldve been an good way to end the series because there obviously no other way to continued but then they decide to do that anyways by releasing the ever godawful fourth filmnow i would recommend this if you only see the first saw movie if you didnt see it really doesnt matters because the whole twist they pull off with amanda turning out she was an assistant not an victim this time was pretty much almost spoiled by its trailer this movie along with the first saw film are like the only ones i would probably sit around and watch again i absolutely loves this one,cruel
sosaw obviously was not over when darren decided to create the final chapteri wish i could say that now follows a new group of guilty people whove done guilty things and nowhas captured them and is nowgiving them a chance to learn from their mistakes iwhen i heardobviouslyi was not excited reallyits just another dumb sequel i told my friends but oh nopeople like them just had to see it because they wanted to see itwhen i was watching ii was really boredi wasthats before when became the most coolestamazingest horror film everwellnot ever had brilliant writing and for some reasonthats actually something really good about the saw filmsthere really is not one that has weak writingwellexcept for saw viior course the acting in the film is probably why im giving this a ninelookim not going to say that it was awful but the acting could have been better but i guess thats sawnot really any of the filmsexcept for one and twohave great acting butis a very good well crafted horror film,cruel
and the gore and traps and plot twists keep going in the saw franchise with part iii tobin bell and shawnee smith reprise their roles as and his exjunkie understudy respectively bell is at deaths door so he enlists the help of smith to kidnap a doctor to help keep him alive as he plays his last game which presumably is the testing of an emotionally broken man played by angus macfadyen so here we have multiple themesstory lines happening adding layers of depth that makes this  and previous saw movies  a level up from the many ripoffs out therefirst we have the complex relationship between bell and smithteacherstudent fatherdaughter perhaps lovers depending on which side you focus on then there is the macfadyen story a husband blinded by rage to the point he has mentally abandoned his familywill he sacrifice everything to feed his rage and vengeance or can he forgive and start living again the doctorcan she snap out of her daze induced by drugs and an unhappy marriage to keep a maniac alive without proper medical equipment and of course there are the plot twists and surprise endingmy most memorable movie moment of is the scene when a mans head and limbs are held in independently twisting viselike devices the key to freedom is guarded by a shotgun and as the seconds tick by the mans limbs are slowly turned until bones ligaments and tendons break and snap ouch does have plot holes and inconsistencies which i refer to as shenanigans but the clever and gory trapspuzzles fast pace twists and surprises and some thoughtprovoking themes more than compensate for said shenanigans for fans of this horror subgenre prepare to cringe laugh feel queasy and have funmannysmemorablemoviemoments,cruel
while the saw series is often incorrectly i feel blamed for the goringup of horror films and credited with starting the torture porn genre something youll notice if you watch the first two installments in the series is that theyre fairly restrained and not as exploitive as some might expect on the other hand is where the films stopped restraining themselves with the violence and adopted a policy of keep showing show everything more blood this is not bad in and of itself but i do feel like people more critical of the film are distracted by that and cant see that this film has much more story and character than the give it credit for in this film a doctor played by bahar soomekh is told she has to keep a dying alive while a man played by angus macfadyen goes from room to room confronting people he believes responsible for his sons death and has to choose to either let the people in the traps die or to forgive them and set them free the films biggest strength is in its characters you really feel for and understand macfadyens character and the tragedy of his situation and its really hard to watch him go through his tests and face his own personal demons equally compelling is the amandarelationship which is very unique for a horror film like this and the scenes they have together are the type you dont expect from a saw film with reassuring amanda that he believes in her worthiness to carry on his work in a very fatherdaughter like manner with some very subtle characterization in summary the film has good characters a some compelling and interesting drama and character dynamics even going to far to explore the small difference between what does and what a straightup murderer does and the twists are just as compelling as you would expect from these movies at this point i really wish they hadnt felt the need to be as gory with it as they did since i think more people would be more open to the film as is the film is in my top 3 of the series along with part 6 and part 1,cruel
filmed on a bigger budget yet lacking the creativity that made the original click so well the third instalment in the saw series takes the usual elements of its predecessors and magnifies it by an extent but the end result is still the same old story as before and remains on par with the second entrycovers two story lines that merge in the end the first concerns an anguished man whos put through a series of tests each meant to bring him closer to the person responsible for the death of his son the second follows who has his apprentice kidnap a doctor and instructs her to keep him alive for one final testdirected by darren lynn bousman is virtually the same stuff all over again and even though there is an attempt to bring an emotional dimension into the story it doesnt really stick for long it does crank up the voltage though when it comes to violence n gore and is more stomachchurning than its predecessors but thats expectedthe flashbacks cover the backstories of  his apprentice as well as their time together but there are so many of them that it disrupts with the narrative flow and kills the tension more times than one performances stay on same level as before with tobin bell again doing a pretty neat job while the rest just chip in with fine supporting workon an overall scale features a plot thats more farfetched than the last time but still packs enough brutality to satisfy those who especially came looking for it the discrepancies caused by its constantly shifting focus  irregular pacing do result in a fractured narrative thats only effective in bits n pieces but in the end it suffices as a serviceable sequel if not a rewarding one,cruel
this movie has some flashbacks and explains how the 1st movie was setup amanda brings in female doctor lynn to help stay alive until the next guy jeff gets through his game a device is put on her to make her comply and is linked to heart monitor the main character jeff is trapped in game encounters people that let his son die the witness that ran judge and the killer himself he tries to free 1st one but she froze judge he saves but has to burn his sons things to get the key jeff taking his time through the ordeal even though he has limited time this movie is more gruesome than the other two and is the last of what i consider the classic saw trilogy dies at the end of the movie and you can pretty much not watch any of the others after this one ending was bitter sweet amanda betrays and she doesnt want them to live and refuses to take off the devise and jeff comes in and shoots her it is revealed that unknown to amanda and the viewers that jeff and lynn are husband and wife and that the man lynn was with at the beginning of the movie was just some guy she was cheating on him with when the viewers assume its her husband everyone dies at the end and reveals in a tape that jeffs little girl is trapped,cruel
kidnapped from her hospital routine a doctor is gathered by and his disciple to keep him alive as they run another man through their rigorous game and finds the situation more strenuous and challenging than she expectedthis was an incredibly flawed film with a couple crippling flaws and hardly anything to keep it afloat one of the really only good things about this is the fact that the first traps in the beginning are rather cool and impressivelooking which is pretty nice getting some solid moments to start this one off as one is forced into position with hooked chains on almost every joint in the body and from there must remove them before a bomb goes off is really nice while another that has a ribspreader device attached to the entire chest is also quite brutal coupled with the later ones which arent traps but have evolved to be simply scenarios which must be stopped before being played out to the gruesome end from the freezing room and the sludge pit while the big centerpiece sequence where the victim is trapped to a violent limb twister that slowly rips every limb around in unrealistic manners that makes for a messy and gory sequence and this one scores nicely on its traps as well this one also gets rather fun here in how it sells the logistics of the twist which showcases several roving plotthreads at once which signal a much more involved and complex story here that comes off really nicely showing the whole plan as a lot more complex than expected the only other thing that works which is the surgery scenes which are disturbing freaky and a little unsettling which are films good points since this has some big flaws the first is that theres plenty of time in here spent on useless moments this is most evident in the scenes of the three in the makeshift hospital arguing or yelling at each other and their conversations about the most useless facets of the situation go on so often that it just becomes so unbearable its hard to get into the scenes this also affects the scenes showing the backstory as theres no need to show the setups of how the traps were concocted from before in the series as its not that exciting and takes away from the film by going behindthescenes of whats already known it makes the nonevent of the torturing in here standout even more and thats two really big problems that come from this theres no need for them since theres too many of them to begin with and its time taken up with useless scenes in a situation where its unnecessary to be that way and here it stays so low and nonessential that having them in there is a detriment to the film as well as taking up valuable time from the film for such a useless part the traps are fun but theres hardly any in the film taking a backseat to the relationship and as a whole nothing in here seems important it just leaves a feel of disinterest in what has happened from the traps to the pacing to just about everything in here as well this one also comes across with the feeling of his own brand of punishment being too far selfcentered that theres little to gleam from the ethics and morality found here which tends to come away rather wholeheartedly here these here are the films flawsrated r extreme graphic violence graphic language and nudity,cruel
in 2004 a highly successful horror film was released entitled saw the writer of the film came together with a new director and co wrote the next film in the franchise after these two films had been released and the box office returns were a smash it was no surprise that for the third halloween running another sequel was to be made and released so after one of the producers of the series gregg hoffman died the next film was released how does it hold up against saw and lets find outfollows as he kidnaps a doctor to save him from dying while a man obsessed with the death of his child has to face several tests designed to try and get him to forgive those he deems responsiblethis is a really tough film to review on the one hand the story writing and everything similar is very clever but on the other hand the traps and the gore did end up getting a bit too much at times it got so bad i walked away from my computer a few times because of just how bad it was lets get to the actual reviewthe acting was just as good as ever especially between the three main characters tobin bell amanda shawnee smith and lynn denlon bahar soomekh they all played off each other very well considering about 13 of the film was spent in a warehouse like place where was being held shawnee smith was the highlight of these three in my opinion she turned out the best performance she has ever done in the role of amanda tobin bell did a great job especially in some of the scenes where hes just talking with some of the other characters he may be immobilized but hes still turning in a stellar performance bahar soomekh was kind of the outlier here but she still did a fantastic job the other actors all did a great job as wellthe story really took some dark turns in this one which i loved honestly i think this film series could be a bit more effective if most of the gore was cut out because the underlying story is so smart and its just really effective at times sadly a lot of the characters that appear in this film do die i wont tell you who but its kind of sad in some parts and really gross in others wait for the angel trap because god dmni enjoyed the music a hell of a lot more this time around than usual its not because it was a new composer or anything it was still the same charlie clouser but it just seemed to be more emotional this time around skip to around 230 on the song fix me and youll see what i mean the cinematography is just as ridiculous as it usually is its dark its gritty and it really does look about as much of a sithole in certain scenes as you would expectnow maybe its because i watched the unrated version i had no choice really but this film really does up the ante on gore while the first two films did have some it was not as bad as this one i mean meat hooks ripping people open a giant harness opening someone intestines honestly who the fck in this series comes up with this sit and like ive said before the traps are kind of stale and wooden this far into the series my advice to the saw series at this point would be to instead of focusing on the traps focus on the storyoverall is a pretty good film the story is still excellent as is the acting music and cinematography while jeffs tests didnt really interest me and the gore was really more disgusting than usual the saw series hasnt lost its steam yet as i continue with the series however im starting to wish that it had ended here710  grade b,cruel
it is telling of our culture that is the highest grossing film of the franchise it also possesses the largest quantities of blood until saw the final chapter if you are going into expecting a deep complex held back horror then this is surely not the film for younow on deaths door he has the help of his newly appointed apprentice amanda she will carry out his remaining traps and ensure that his lifes work goes on even without him this time he tasks amanda with kidnapping lynn denlon who works at the local hospital lynns objective is making survive long enough to see the outcome of another victim and his tests set before him next victim is jeff who is filled with vengeance after the death of his beloved son who was hit by a car the driver left as quickly as possible and jeff has no room in his heart for pity kindness or redemption figures that it is now jeffs time to be tested jeff has three tests tests of forgiveness for the witness judge and suspect jeff must complete his tests in the allotted time or be trapped in the abandoned factory to die incontains some of the franchises most vile traps and the only effective sentimental one its an odd mix but the filmmakers manage to pull it off people who have seen the film will know which traps i am referring to and they occur within the first fifteen minutes bring a bucket the classroom trap needs some description however brief in order to explain it the victim in this instance is a convict by the name of troy believes him to be more comfortable in chains than you are in freedom troy has chains linked to almost every body part he will need to rip them out of himself before the bomb detonates the thing is even if he did make it in time he would not escape the room alive the door was sealed shut and the police had to break it down through force detective kerry who has been on the case since the first killing decides this is not the work of but an imitatorthe same thing happens again the victim is harnessed into a device that is hooked into her ribcage she grabs the key out of a vat of acid it does not matter the device will not budge this is the work of perhaps the very same imitator earlierthese traps are not effective well in a sense they are you are sure to feel nauseous but they are devised for shock value they do not have half of the weight found in the original because they involve gallons of blood the only factor that makes them worthwhile is instructions to the victims his rasping voice is absorbing to listen to if only the same could be said of the trapsthere is one though that resonates throughout the series in one of jeffs tests the judge is in a huge metal container lying on his back it is slowly filling up with the guts of pigs the only way jeff can retrieve the key is by burning his sons toys the look of pain on jeffs face is palpable and highlights that you do not need to have a barrel full of blood to make an impact on the audiencethe acting here is shockingly the best of the series angus macfayden as jeff is the right amount of disturbing never under or overplaying to his horrifying predicament shawnee smith as amanda undoes her excruciating performance from and for sure is better served in her scenes with the deranged tobin bell brings his character to life and offers the only humanity that can be garnered from someone this psychoticoversteps the mark frequently the gore is often far too much to handle and the first couple of traps derivative at best but once jeffs game begins the film hits its bloody stride and delivers fans with a hardcore horror with welldefined characters for the main cast who would have thought it as well as a surprisingly thoughtful story and great acting for a horror film at least if only more horror sequels were this entertaining in a sadistic way,cruel
though theres little doubt that these films will keep getting made until they stop making money reportedly marks the last hurrah for the original filmmakers  including series creators james wan and leigh whannell with the latter penning the expectedly intricate screenplay it comes as no surprise then that generally has the feel of a final instalment  although of course the door is nevertheless left open for yet another sequeldirector darren lynn bousman has infused with precisely the same sort of dark fincheresque sensibility that has essentially come to define the series visual look a feeling thats been augmented with the distinctly gritty vibe the film is much much more brutal than either of its predecessors whannells script features several references to both saw and and occasionally paints certain events from those two films in an entirely new light that infamous bathroom set makes a welcome appearance albeit briefly theres little doubt that will have a far greater effect on viewers who are already well acquainted with the series as the filmmakers have included a whole host of little tidbits and shoutouts that will mean absolutely nothing to neophytes that being said the central storyline does seem accessible enough to hold the interest of newbies and if ever there was a movie that warranted a not for the squeamish advisory this is certainly it,cruel
is a good contributing part of the saw franchise since it keeps intertwining the previous films together like a puzzle itself the story lines and twist endings with is definitely the reason to watch this relatively subpar horror flick its quite remarkable how well each twist is even though the viewer might be able to sniff some of them out they keep on providing surprise after surprise the actors in the film are alright some really bad script dialog and overacting especially shawnee smith but not unbearable the saw films however are best viewed in sequential order in short periods of time to pick up past characters subplots and tidbit hints id have to say 610 didnt hold up to its previous successors but it manages to be a fun ride,cruel
there arent many movies that can make me squirm in my seat and make me look away this is one of those few movies that made me squirm the gruesome torture scenes are creative and original and the effects what they do to make us believe that all this might just be real because it looks like it is just brilliant if you think the director has run out of trap ideas believe me when i tell you that there are plenty of traps that caused horror movie fanatics to cringe when it comes into playit is has much gore more than the other saw movies if you cant see too graphical stuff than dont watch this movie if you like this kind of stuff than this movie could be something for you,cruel
it manages to explain events in and 2 that may have been considered plot holes its the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one its not perfect though the cinematography is stark and bare with only the soundtrack adding some effect some of the dialog could be better from an artistic standpoint there were some plot elements and character developments i didnt think were totally needed they do however drive the story which seemed to be their purpose so i can accept them this is probably the worst of the sequels with nothing to laugh at by the end of the movie the audience clapped we liked what we had seen,cruel
one thing i wanna say before i dive into the movie john kramer aka jigs a godthis is the best saw movie ive seen so far in terms of the first 3 there is so much i can say about this movie that makes it perfect but then id literally be spoiling everything this whole movie is a big spoilerthe traps have definitely been the best so far i read that leigh whannel who worked on the movie and also played adam in cannot watch this movie without feeling nauseous because of what the traps do to their victims i personally watched the whole movie without feeling anything except awe but thats just me hahawithout giving away too much of the plot jigs close to death and his new apprentice kidnaps a doctor for him to stay alive long enough for his new victim to go through his series of testswill definitely blow you away the ending is great and mind blowingps a thing ive learned about the saw series so far is everyone is connected in some wayeveryone is being tested keep that in mind as you watch this,cruel
ill be short this part made me so amazed of course i got sick as usual after seeing a lot of creepy tests and blood and things coming out of bodies but it was goodi feel so regretful for those who are tested by the that man is so f psycho good to see him shedding some of his blood that made my day and good to see the other whore got a shot in her nick that was so f goodthe first test was the nearlyfrozen woman she was so f hot though im the best one to make jokes it was so f hard to see her freezing to death i dont ever want to experience that thats so f up manthe next test was the man who chained down to the huge pipething i didnt expect to see rooted pigs at all that was so disgusting i was dying while watching oho good to see that he managed to get the key and free him before he got drownedthe third test was unbelievable i was screaming thats so horrible no one in the whole universe deserve to die like that if he was an animal he would be treated better than that all of them died and the died the wife died   sad and part for sadists just kidding youre the best,cruel

is still the best but corrected what did wrong more of the billy puppet was seen in this sequel and it showed us what happened to the characters at the end of and ii after the creditsthe gore has never been more brutal i admit i found myself looking away at some points but that was the fun part and that is how a saw movie is meant to be likebut what happened to laurence gordon unless i missed something in the previous saw movies the last i saw of him was when he went to get help at the end of and he never came back for adamall though this movie was amazing we still had some unanswered questions at the end of this one910,cruel
it seems after more then one sequel movies start to go stale this one did not necessarily have that effect because they managed to add new twists and turns to the story which actually led me to believe they were planning sequels from day 1 with the saw franchisethis movie takes place with the killer still on the lose he is sick and on his death bed so he kidnaps a doctor and makes her keep him alive if she fails she will die as she tries to keep him alive trains his hopeful predecessorthis movie was not as good as the first two but it was still pretty good the acting was not very good but it was very entertaining wih even more brutal kills,cruel
third entry in the popular lionsgate franchise of intense and graphic torture films catches us up to speed before soon diving into another insane mixture of heavy handed moralizing and brutal punishment this time we get two main concurrent story lines as protg amanda shawnee smith kidnaps a weary doctor lynn bahar soomekh whose purpose is to keep his sorry ass alive for as long as possible and the latest in the line of unwilling game players turns out to be jeff angus macfadyen jeff lost his son when the latter was killed by a drunken driver and hes been consumed with rage and a need for vengeance ever since so as we can see latest lesson to a slow learner is not to let hatred poison ones heart these story lines create a pretty compelling story that keeps one glued to the screen and things get just mean spirited enough to appeal to some tastes if not all of course the torture devices get more and more elaborate and sadistic which will absolutely delight gore fanatics as various extremely unpleasant things happen to a succession of victims theres a strikingly detailed brain operation a head that blows up real good a body being drowned in pig innards throats being sliced body parts being mangled bloody gunshot wounds etc the rack is particularly insidious especially as it twists body parts around one unfortunate thing is that assorted flashback scenes tend to bog the story down theyre good for establishing character but also slow the pace too much this is a noticeably long entry in the franchise the theatrical cut running 108 minutes and the uncut version running 13 minutes longer than that another thing that could trouble some viewers with this franchise is a lack of sympathetic characters although others may appreciate the fact  point that the people in these stories are markedly flawed and not perfect the crew including production designer david hackl and cinematographer david armstrong once again prove up to the challenge of shooting in some claustrophobic sets and things look as grim and grimy as they ever have the cast is deeply committed as per usual including tobin bell as the sickly hot 80s icon betsy russell in the first of her performances as wife and series regulars like dina meyer costas mandylor and lyriq bent series fans should like what they see while the faint of heart and weak of stomach should stay far away seven out of 10,cruel
the saw series continues to surprise me since they are churned out so quickly and written even faster youd expect these films to become more and more pathetic however they dont holds up along with the last two by keeping the same style and formula but furthering the story in terms of character it isnt often we see good development of killers in horror movies mostly because more development means they lose some of their mystery and menace however with feel understanding jigs part of the pleasure this time a man must set aside his vengeance and forgive those responsible for his sons death mainly these films are about gore and this film has plenty of that even some teeth grittingly painful moments brilliant gory entertainment for any night of the week,cruel
darren lynn bosman returns to direct his second saw movie continues killers games his accomplice amanda returns to assist him in his gruesome games this movies uncut version is 2 hours in duration but the cut version has around 12 minutes of graphic violence edited those who will search for more blood and gore will be satisfied all elements are present in the movie that were lacking in the original and sequel there is also an improvement to the plot in comparison to the sequel as the sufferer of cancer has become bed ridden but this does not prevent him from subjecting people to his torturous traps while watching him i was confused whether to have pity for his character or hate he enjoys testing peoples vulnerability and and patience through these means he intends to exert discipline spoilers suffering has worsened and he is in need of immediate brain surgery his accomplice amanda kidnaps a surgeon played by bahar soomekh to her neck is tied a electronic 360 rotating gun it is connected to his heart rate machine if he dies she too dies she is instructed to perform a brain operation to remove the tuma that is growing meanwhile a grieving fatherjeff who has lost his young son in a hit and run accident has fallen prey to games along his journey he meets a judge witness and killer of his son each individual is in a trap and it is his responsibility to choose whether to save the person or let them die tuma is removed and he instructs amanda to release the trap from the surgeons neck she refuses and kills the her at the same time the father enters and discovers his wife wounded he kills amanda and but later doing this he realises that his daughter is in a unknown location that only knew end of spoilersthis is a more enjoyable movie if compared to the sequel bahar soomekh makes it worth watching she is very convincing playing the role of the surgeon but the twist seemed very predictable i had figured out that she was the husband of jeff it was just a matter of time until we were notified but this does make the climax predictable only the element of surprising twists were less for those fans of saw who are looking for more ingenious traps will be pleased the first sequence is gut wrenching as a mans legs and arms are clinched by a steel ring it is also the first time in the franchise where there is some female nudity depicted this came as a surprise the strobe lighting and fast editing are becoming very annoying there are large amounts featured in the movie which make it difficult to concentrate on a few scenes i understand that it is an integral part of the movie and its style but there should be a limit to it dina meyer playing officer kelly is wasted in one murder scene her character is made extinct but she could have been an asset to the franchise i would have been more than happy to see her role continued,cruel
s back for another installment in the series as carries on from however is it any good the story is mediocre this time round and isnt very friendly to people who are watching the series for the first time youd have to watch the first two to actually make sense of the story the characters arent very well created except for doctor lynn and obviously john and amanda who were in the first two movies you didnt really feel connected much to the rest of the characters so you didnt really care much the character development was okay but it was mainly between amanda and john or as she starts to care for him like a daughter would care for her father trying desperately to cure and heal him the acting is average except for the talented shawnee smith as amanda and tobin bell as both of them were yet again brilliant and the relationship between them is great the direction isnt bad and the writing is great except for the fact that the story is more for the people who watched the first two movies than newcomers the special effects and the blood and gore were yet again realistic and the traps were inventive but there was one scene that i think could have pushed the blood and gore scenes a little too faroverall i enjoyed it its a good horror movie but its definitely the weakest at the moment another thing that was bad was the amount of blood and gore in this one even though im okay with blood and gore scenes in movies there was one scene in particular which made me feel uncomfortable watching because it went a little too far youll know which scene im talking about if you watch the movie and i felt that the movie didnt really need to cross that line as the story was very good anyway the twists and turns in the movie wont let you down however as there are plenty of them in the storyread more reviews at wwwdudedazzmoviereviewswordpresscom,cruel
the original saw was a horror film that received wider acclaim because it not only appealed to fans of gore but had a very clever twist ending so much so that a couple o years after seeing it for the one and only time i can clearly remember the twist though not much else  i vaguely remember the sequel which might have had a not so clever twist ending but can remember the way several characters were killed off  watching the third film in the franchise its becoming clearer that the producers that the producers are less interested in cerebral plotting and more interested in taking  torture porn  to new limits along with its mtv style editing which quickly becomes annoying  also im writing this in the summer of 2010 there is a saw 7 in the pipeline which means the impact of the ending where it looks like john kramer and his understudy amanda both die is negated knowing theres another 4  at least  films to come when you watch some of these video nasties that were banned in the early 1980s you might be shocked at how tame or cheesy they look compared to some mainstream horror films nowadays  torture porn works down to both its conviction and cruelty  pople plead  beg  cry and screech to be allowed to live but no one is listening or granting them mercy and its this callousness that disturbs the audience  does this very well  perhaps too well as people mutilate themselves vainly trying to escape the lair of the murderer  the problem is that its the storyline only exists to shock the audience  people turn up in the lair which leads you to acknowledge how contrived the story is  they all tie in with jeff and his wife whose son was killed in a hit and run  surely they must have all been kidnapped on the same day  i mean if someone is confined to  the rack  then they wouldnt have access to water and theyd die of thirst  likewise the victim in the freezer  if amanda is taking care of business in the ad hoc surgery then who is operating the water system  surely the victim would have frozen to death before jeff reached her  you see how the time frame doesnt stand up to scrutiny  of course you dont watch horror films expecting cerebral writing or profound subtext and in an exercise in shocking its audience does the job well with its gory death scenes  but after seeing it you wonder how far the franchise can go after this and even here theres a strong feeling that the rot is truly starting to set in,cruel
after watching the the first two i decided that i really want to see all of the saw moviesthis one one turned out to be possibly the most disgusting and painful onethe acting was still good especially from tobin bell and shawnee smith angus macfadyen did good as well as did bahar soomekh and dina meyer did good as welli really love the music that plays while everything unfolds at the endthough this movie is more disgusting it has a better story then the last movie didif your a fan of the last two movies then youll definitely love this oneand thats why i give 910,cruel
isnt that bad its just that after an amazing saw and a great it comes out as a disappointment the acting is decent like in most saw movies shawnee smith has a different approach to her character she acted well in this movie and i did feel sorry for amanda throughout this movie angus macfadyen is okay as jeff though i didnt really like his character he turned out to be plain dumb at the end of the movie tobin bell is excellent needless to say hes probably one of the only actors who will never disappoint in a saw movie and sadly to say some of the best acting moments come from lyric bent who has two minutes or so in the movie and donnie wahlberg who has close to five minutes in the movie the girl who played lynn was just plain awfulthe story is well written but it comes out as pure tortureporn with each test being an excuse to show as much blood gore and guts as possible it has a decent ending however but it just doesnt make up like the first two the traps themselves are cool but to me it takes more than just traps blood gore and guts to make a saw movie overall this is a disappointment though i probably wouldnt mind watching it again but its not the type of movie i would buy,cruel
with its bloody violence interesting characters and a solid script keeps the franchise sharp and going strongit picks off after where detective matthews was locked in the bathroom used in the very originalthis sequel opens with him trying to get out of his shackle and you probably know how he gets out if theres no key and all you see is a hacksaw and a big rocka nurse named lynn is captured by one of jiggsaws accomplices for a very important reasonthe killer aka john kramer has been having some really bad problems involving his head and now he puts his faith in lynn to save himyou probably think that lynn is just going to kill and his accomplice and just escapethat is where you are wrong if that was what you were thinkinglynn has a device strapped to her neck that is basically a bombthis neckbrace will detonate if john dies or she is out of range of johnso she has no choice and must help john if they both want to livemeanwhile john has a trick up his sleevehe kidnaps jeff a man who is still mourning the loss of his sonwhen he is captured he is given tasks by that involves the revenge that he has always wanted on his sons killerif he can get through his tasks in 2 hours and jigs still alive lynn and jeff can go freethats pretty much the premise of and i can say that it wasnt a bad one at alladd some gruesome death scenes to this movie and you have yourself a darn good horror film that has you begging for morebe sure to check out the unrated version,cruel
wow if you thought the first two saw movies were gory it gets even more gorier and just might please some hardcore saw fans the set up was well done and the torture devices are more hardcore this time around but the main aspect i didnt like about the 3rd installment is how it revealed to be more of a prick cause in the first two installments he was in the gray but now it reveals he is leaning more to the dark side but you feel a bit compassionate towards him in the end cause of amanda who is his accomplice she is one evil emo junkie who is very hypocritical and that just about sums her up so basically the only reason she survived game in the first place besides the fact that the game that is set up for her was way too easy compared to other torture devices set up for his other victims but actually plays fair and keeps his word if he didnt amandas head would be in smithereens and yet she sets up her own torture devices in a way where that is not winnable and doesnt learn her lesson she destroys 4 lives and one of them was a female police officer named kerry who really didnt do anything wrong and just lived a life where she was dead on the inside which isnt anything comparable to amanda who was a drug addict and gets a kick out of cutting herself so you want amandas death to be gruesome as possible but she just gets shot in the neck which was a big disappointment after amanda kidnaps lynn the surgeon to fix jigt makes the old fart look like he is just trying to save his own life while most of his victims die off but at least it led to a brain surgery on which was gruesome to watch and some gore fans may get a kick out of it i will admit that some of amandas quotes i had to agree on like when she says what you do is no different than murder and she hasnt changed cause nobody changes which proves to be true cause amanda is still a whinny girl that cuts herself while the scenario of amanda and lynn is going on it goes back and forth to the scenario of jeff jeff is a father that is semi psychotic after the loss of his son and doesnt show the amount of love to his daughter that he showed for his dead son anyways he got kidnapped as well and has to go through 3 test and each of the test it has a person who was involved in his sons death and through these test it is shown that jeff is no better than the people involved in his sons death first door leads to the witness that didnt do anything during the scene of the accident so she isnt that bad but jeff thinks she deserves to die and when he makes up his mind to save her she freezes to death the second door leads to the judge that gave the killer of jeffs son a light sentence of just six month in prison so jeff has a reason to be angry at the guy but he ends up saving him than it comes down to the final door that leads to the murderer but during the flashback scene it shows the guy accidentally ran over jeffs son and felt guilty about it also a lot of blame goes to jeff as well for not keeping a close eye on his son and basically its his sons stupidity that got him killed as a parent he didnt even bother to teach his son to look both ways before crossing the road besides the fact that jeff and lynn use to be husband and wife it really didnt show why he was chosen although it was a decent combination but if the origins of that is revealed in saw 4 was shown before part 3 or during it it would have given the idea of why chose him cause both there origins are somewhat similar although i doubt the creators of this film thought that much ahead the first 30 min wasnt that good and felt like it was an excuse to add more gore into the movie and also felt a bit repetitive also moral speech about vengeance made me roll my eyes its one thing when a villain knows they are evil and sadistic but jigs a man that convinces himself or thinks he is doing the right thing and it feels like the image of jigs getting destroyed and gets weaker as a new sequel comes out and not just literally jeff seems to be kinda slow but he makes a really dumb decision at the end but it was satisfying the twist near the end about how the game mostly revolved around amanda and how she was a contestant all along without her knowing was a nice touch as well my only major problem about that is the fact that although while the previous 2 saw movies had some hope for the victims it isnt the case for this one was all about teaching the victims a lesson about the value of life but most of the victims didnt have a chance for themselves but for someone else to make the decision for them if they should live or die this is a worthy sequel that connects some of part 1 and 2 together some by flashbacks and finishes off with a decent twist in the end its well worth a look for hardcore saw fans even if it isnt engaging as part 1 and 27310,cruel
i thought that was better than the first two films a 30 year old doctor called lynn denlon is kidnapped and locked in a room with no one other than amanda and the cancer ridden who is on the verge of death tells lynn that she must keep alive for as long as it takes jeff to complete one of his own games lynn must race against the clock of own heart after escaping the cops psychopathic killer turns an abandoned warehouse on the edge of town into a gruesome torture chamber new friend amanda kidnaps dr lynn denlon who is forced to keep him alive life begins to carry out his gruesome plans for the lady doctor and another victim against the ticking clock of lynn struggles to make it through each of their vicious tests unaware that and amanda have a much bigger plan for both of them the thought that this film was great in the end,cruel
let the games explode despite liking the direction took was actually an improvement over ii still the original saw was the best but this is second best the only unfortunate thing i can report after saying how much i liked this feature in the series is they didnt just take the gore to the next level the exploded it on the screen in some scenes literally i have seen a lot of horror movies a lot of the torture porn films slasher ones etc and this ranks 1 as the goriest movie i have ever seen and thats too bad the writing acting suspense mystery and dialogue make me want to watch it but at the same time its well torture to get through spoilers ahead but only for those who havent seen 12 the now established team of and amanda once again take on multiple people to prove a point appreciate life letting go moving on and understand forgiveness it would take an article seventeen times this size to go through all the plot points so to sum it up just read the previous sentence yet again they are now falling over their socalled twists and connectthedots and once more they are prepping the audience for more saw chapters unfortunately they shouldve ended it right here see the closing forget the cliffhangers and youll see why this wouldve been a wonderful closing i did really like this installment but sadly this will probably be the final viewing of 3 i will have of it the gore is really in excess here and the one test towards the end involving literal twists is the most gruesome of all five to date saw films and probably one of the most heartwrenching to see in any film,cruel
for some reason i liked the most in the series dont ask me why i am not one for blood and guts and the third one has the most i can only deal with blood and guts if its in a tarentino movie or a few others i guess giving it a 9 out of 10 is a bit ridiculous considering the fact that they are saw films but the twist in is genius the twist in all of the saw films are pretty clever but the one in is the best not that it ends on a good note but that it just surprised me is a bloody film and a bloody good time its a film that i can watch without covering my eyes but sometimes i have to there are some things i dont like to watch like when rorsach in watchmen starts clobbering the pedophile in the head with a machete i dont know if that actually happened because i knew it was coming and didnt watch i also dont like watching people get their stomachs ripped off which happens in i dont quite know why but i think that was the best in the series but be warned the next film will be a disappointment it sounds like im writing this from the past i saw v a few years ago and if you havent seen it and want to i advise you not to waste your time12 out of ,cruel
to me is more epic because its longer and has more soap opera elements to amanda and character tobin bell does another awesome job as who is now on his death bed has lynn kidnapped and brought to him so he can stay alive long enough to see if jeff makes it through his test jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named timothy young jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child my favorite trap in this one is the pig vat when jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines i love when lynn has to perform surgery on and removing some of his skull to relax his brain will jeff learn to forgive will live lets play a game and find out if you love and the saw movies youll love i,cruel
i believe the original saw to be one of the most influential creative horror films in recent years i kind of liked and upon further viewing it gains points with me for being different from i but having a solid story within itself but i think it was the fact that ii almost seemed ignore what happened in i and appeared like a totally different almost not even tied to i except for the return of the character of amanda and her role in the saw franchise now with part iii it all comes together i see where ii was going and is even more satisfying than ii because it forms a great conclusion to the trilogy i know there has been a iv and v since but they both go too far with the saw concept as far as im concerned it should have ended with iiipicking up about 6 months after the events of ii continues the story of john aka who was revealed as the villain at the end of saw and amanda revealed as apprentice at the end of johnagain is played superbly by tobin bell who now belongs in the pantheon of the likes of norman bates jason voorhies freddy krueger and michael myers what makes john unique is that unlike horrormovie killers of the last 30 years or so he is portrayed as a functioning sociopath with an actual purpose and a rather focused vision that people not take life for granted shawnee smith again comes through as amanda who i thought was the most memorable character from part i now we get to see her character fleshed out and see her and johns relationship in full focusjohn has amanda kidnap dr lynn denlon played impressively by sexy newcomer bahar soomekh lynn is a brilliant er surgeon but seems to have a terrible personal life and is highly depressed john needs lynn to operate on him as his brain tumor is worsening and he is now bedridden scared out of her mind now by this situation lynn must comply as amanda has placed a bulletriddled contraption around her neck that if john dies it goes off and she dies too in a parallel story john has taken jeff excellently portrayed by angus macfayden another emotional basketcase who has recently lost his son killed by a drunk driver who was let off with a light sentence john must navigate through his emotional trap of getting over his need for revenge on the people who are responsible for his rage the driver an eyewitness who said nothing and the judge who let the driver go freethe connection to iii and i is that 2 people are imprisoned in one way or another and take life for granted but here both lynn and jeff are much more psychologically damaged than our protagonists dr gordon and adam in i of course there is a twist actually there are 2 big twists one of them occurs smack dab in the middle of the film and i like this one even better than the final twist which is a doozy while part i focused a lot on style and was short on exposition this one digs deep into the psyche of its 4 characters and involves us deeply into the experiencealso like in i part iii uses flashback sequences as part of the storytelling but in i the flashbacks were used more stylistically and dominated the film whereas here in iii the flashbacks are told in a more traditional fashion and placed at just the right time for just the right amount of exposition but that is purposeful as each film has a different presentation i was intended to be stylish gimmicky and nonlinear whereas iii has a story to tell again the acting in iii is exceptional with a deeply involving story is a highly welcome addition to the saw franchise,cruel
and his apprentice amanda kidnap a doctor to keep alive while they play one last gruesome gamewell it seems like we have another classic menacing serial killer franchise in our midsts and frankly jigs a welcomed addition to the hall of fame up there with other horror franchise greats such as freddy jason michael myers leatherface norman bates and ghostface but unlike the others he doesnt actually kill his victims himself instead he sets up his victims in gruesome traps and teach them how to value life in which they dont as they mostly fail and end up dead in a truly gory fashion which is fantastic and original which i lovethe third movie in the franchise follows the successful and brilliant part 1 and 2 and part 3 which is just as fantastic as the first 2 where sequels usually jump shark round about this point this one im glad to say doesnt they just keep coming up with fresh and astounding ideas which is definitely the reason why each movie keeps on becoming more and more successful was akin to the more intimate and character driven approach of the original was more than an assault of revelations and expansion on the franchise it was also a vicious gory beating which im glad to say with each movie never loses the emotion and nerve racking of the previous efforts i mean these are the type of movies that make you think and value your life its as if jigs real i mean if i ended up in one of those traps i would well and truly crap myself crueler and gorier than part ii but yet fuller was the necksnap the franchise needed to go out on tobin bell plays john with such flair im glad he didnt change the effectivenessrange that he displayed in all of the jigncarnations within this film and with each film we see more and more of him and he never loses that menacing charm loved him shawnee smith amanda is again fantastic even better with each film showing more depth this time round i love her angus macfadyen jeff was on the ball as the conflicted and mourning father forced into game where he has to make impossible choices bahar soomekh lynn was on and off for me but she did okay overall and dina meyer did well with her limited screen timeall in all cleverly written packed with substance strong characters warped traps and hard to watch kills filled with gore which i loved and itwas incredibly ambitious sequel it addressed the whole franchise while having its own story to tell a well and truly brilliant movie that packs a punch,cruel
is a good example of how a second sequel can be equal or even better than the original im pleased to say that i wasnt very into the saw franchise but after giving it the chance i really believe it refreshed the horror genre in the new millenniumim an old school horror fanatic and i wasnt very happy with new additions to the genre trying to imitate the 70s exploitation or 80s heavy use of goreis a combination of heavy gore stylish direction suspense and very original plot twiststhe plot is similar to the previous films but this time the phrase breaking the rules takes a new meaningi would recommend this movie to any horror fan or for those who want to see quality overalli really liked shawnee smith and bahar soomekh on their roles delivered great performances and perfectly represented the two different sides of behavior evil and good through redemptiontobin bell owns the moviebut i wont spoil these movie that will be surely enjoyed by those who like me will give it a chance because its now part of horror culturealso i really think it shouldve ended here instead of making part iv and v,cruel
after the average i was kind of expecting the same for but how dreadfully wrong i was everything is unorthodox and completely unoriginal like you havent noticed already is a blatantly staggering misshaped concept of a failed saga apart from number 1 the acting and sustainability has speedily decreased from the 1st and 2nd saw movies the acting only resembles of a poor quality and sticks like that for the whole 1 hour 50 minutes the story remains horrible and absolutely stupid all that ever happens and in which you see is blood guts and gore throughout nothing with a twist or nerveshredding appears by the third you would have hoped lynn bousman would have toned different mixes and created something different but keeping within the contents of originalitysadly is a poor and absolute crap b movie that shouldnt even be legal and not for the graphic violent content,cruel
oh my godive made it my life goal to see every horror movie mainly every gory horror movies ever made by now ive seen about 70 of them i cant remember the last movie that made me cringe it was so long ago you could call me so desensitized that even the worst of the worst gore puts me to sleepliterallybut then there is iive seen all of the other saw movies including v but i never say this one until now because my ex wouldnt let me i already knew the story i already knew most of the gore scenes    and it still shocked meunlike the boring ungory hostel part ii this movie is made for the mtv generation it doesnt take time to characterize clich characters that could be copypasted from a hundred other movies it doesnt start out slow and build suspense that isnt suspenseful its pretty much pure intensity from opening to finishingthe gore is possibly some of the most intense gore ive seen in any movie to date its not as bloody as it could have been but its 1000x more brutal and creative than anything ive seen in any movie ever and the lack of blood isnt because of a pansy director its because in the real situations there wouldnt be that much blood not to mention this is one of the only movies ive ever seen where the camera does not blink once no cutoff scenes no pansy no show but grueling sound effects omg the camera simply does not blink away from the gore truly pornographic gore thank god someone has ballsgore aside this has to be the single most intense movie ive ever seen in my lifebloodydisgustingcom thinks the new the texas chainsaw massacre is intense but sorry this makes that look childish this makes both hostels look childish it makes the other saw movies including iv look tame the ending is intense i cried she didnt change because no one ever fing changes no one is reborn the dialog without any of the gore alone makes the entire hostel and texas chainsaw massacre series combined look unexciting i have simply yet to see a movie with more pure unholy intensityis possibly the most perfect movie ive ever seen im not sure if i like it more or less than but its certainly close everything reeks of polish and genius but still keeps the lowbudget feelforget the mist or the decent or whatever horror crap youre watching watch this movie1010,cruel
i not going to give anything away but i must say that i think that the ending is the biggest ending the build up to the twists is perfect if you liked the first two you will love the third installment in the series it is my favorite saw movie yet but i cant wait for saw v director darren bousman has done a awesome job with the traps this is the last saw movie leigh whannell wrote and he is a exalant writer and another thing that i like not just about but saw and as well you really get to know something about the people being tested so you can feel sorry for them and its not just some random person being put through a test game however i am a hardcore saw fan so use your own judgement,cruel
i liked as an horrorflick but not really necessarily as a saw movie is really more like it again and is featuring a great and original story despite using some old concept and ingredients of the previous movie entriesthis movie perhaps even connects better to the first movie than did also storywise this movie somewhat gives a new spin to the first movie saw since it also goes back to the events of the first movie without spoiling too much it makes a better sequel than wasbut besides being a sequel to the first movie the movie of course also still is a sequel to featuring some of the characters and concentrating on some of the events of the second sequel in the saw movie franchise nevertheless games are being played with some new characters again its also basically one of the reasons why so many saw got and still can get made new characters can constantly get introduced into the franchise and the concept alone is more than enough to provide a never ending supply of saw movies part five and six all already in production and it seems like one new saw movies get released every yearto be perfectly frank i thought that the story of this movie got brilliantly written of course everything comes together again at the end in a great way calling predictable just because its the third movie in the franchise and uses the same concept is just not fair the story is in no way predictable and its filled with some unexpected twists its a very well thought out script that again of course also futures some complicated life and death puzzles which the characters have to solve in a certain amount of time in order to surviveits also a movie more about emotions and some classical themes rather than just simply being a well written gory horror flick like perhaps the two first movies were the movie focuses more on the character than ever before as well the story cuts back and forth between the plot line and that of the character of jeff who is in the middle of playing latest cruel gameits made in the same style as the other saw movies meaning that its fast and has a typical unpleasant dark atmosphere its from the same director of and he also directed the fourth sequel in the series its also as gory and features just as ingenious well thought out and shocking deathtraps as was the case with the previous movies although it also needs to be said that the surgery sequence is perhaps more gory than anything else in the movie reallyi liked the movie better than i ever could had expected910httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,cruel
2006  out of 4 jigs on his death bed and kidnaps a nurse to help keep him alive if he dies so does she also on hand is another man who must play game to say anything else would pretty much ruin several surprises that happen towards the end of the film im not a fan of this series and while i found the first two film very well made i think they crossed the line that no horror film should cross in the fact that they were mean spirited and sadistic i was worried at the start of this film because we once again entered that sadistic violence but thankfully this ended after the first thirty minutes and when the game started we actually got a pretty good little thriller the torture scenes are a lot tamer and take a back seat to the story which is why i think this is the best of the series the character of has always been an interesting one but we really didnt get to know anything about him in the first two movies hes on full display here and it was interesting to see him interact with the people playing the game i viewed the unrated dvd and im not sure how much is different from the rrated theatrical cut but the brain operation scene is certainly well done,cruel
this was incredible from start to finish not only is this scarier than the past two films but youll be on the edge of your seat for the remainder of the film almost as soon as the films starts off the traps are more intense and starts to seem like james wan of the original film had intended him to be all the characters are tense and never keep the movie dry as it unravels more and more to what i consider to be one of the greatest horror movie endings ever developed come the end youll be amazed appalled and probably wanting to see it again because if you liked the last two youre going to go crazy for my only wise word of warning if youre a little queasy dont go see this movie its just that gory it makes the past two films look like grated disney films but for everyone else who saw the past two films thats another big thing you cannot watch the saw films out of order they contain so many references to past films youre just going to be lost so make sure youve seen the past two before you watch i promise youre in for a frightfullygood time,cruel
this movie took a perfectly good thriller franchise and ruined it the first saw film was a slick chilling thriller in which the majority of the violence was off camera was a slick chilling thriller with to much gore was a mindless blood fest the plot was admittedly clever but i was unable to enjoy it due to the constant presence of gratuitous torture the people who decided to change the franchise this way have sick minds do yourself a favor and avoid this movie it is not the intelligent thriller that was the first one it is a sick movie made by sick peopleoverall grade d f had it not been for good acting,cruel
first of all i would like to set things straight about the so called gore in this moviethis is actually a sweet story about a nice guy who teaches a bunch of not so nice people to live their lives bettersure his methods might seem a bit harsh for a sensitive viewer but hi love for mankind rivals that of mother theresa and it all works out fine in the endthis is the kind of educational movie you want to bring your kids to or even train them using the same methods as so they can make you proud when they grow up,cruel
rated r for strong grisly violence and gore sequences of terror and torture nudity and languagei think of the saw series as the greatest horror series of this generationi think is the greatest horror film of all timethe films are very interesting and suspenseful and have a good amount of goreand 2 were excellent but was not as greati just didnt find it as interesting as the first two saw filmshowever is the goriest one in the seriesi dont usually cringe during horror movies but watching the very long surgery scene on made me cringethis film has a man going through obstacles to get revenge on the drunk driver who killed his son and the juror who acquitted himits his choice to save or kill the peoplemeanwhile his wife who is a doctor is kidnapped and is forced by apprentice amandawho was the heroin addict who survived trap in the first film to save is a good horror film just not as good as the first two,cruel
this movie was pretty darn good in my opinion it was quite gory suspenseful and surprising it definitely suffered a few flaws yet you didnt notice them as the movie is going on storyline was pretty intense and the traps were much harsher not a classic but a wonderful horror movie and worthy sequelplot a doctor learns to keep her wits as she is thrown into one of latest games someone else is playing game of their ownor is everyone connected and playing one huge game of live or die watch and be amazed by what the saw movies are all abouti am giving this 9 stars really i threw one on for personally being part of my favorite franchise ,cruel
2006 its halloween so it must be saw the makers of the saw series have figured out that their low budget films are making decent money at the box office so why not make more and more and more new traps are set more violence and gore are available to satisfy the expectations of the audience and surprisingly once more this is an entertaining film dont expect espionage by cia agents or a great courtroom drama nor an intellectually draining masterpiece aims to purely entertain to be fair theres not much plot except that punishes people who dont appreciate life he is testing the human fabric on that account saw films can be continued to be made with not much worry on how to continue the storyline when one thinks of saw heshe probably thinks trapspainviolencegore thats iti am not here to tell you that this is a great film only to tell you that if you the kind of person who like such films then is for you 310,cruel
is a sequel that probably would have been better left unfilmed tobin bell is back an improbability based on his condition at the end of along with his loyal minion shawnee smith looking sexier than ever while smith is putting new victims through the wringer jigs having brain surgery this brain surgery the high or low point of the film depending on your point of view is done in loving closeup the film is just gross but not a good type of gross as in which leaned toward grossout comedy nope this one is all business and quite serious the ridiculous ending suggests another sequel would be impossible but guess what just opened v anyone give it time and this series will go to stv land,cruel
the first saw movie was interesting because there was not a lot of movies where some killer tortures his victims and you can see all bloody details of that process also there was a try to made the movie that is deep and full of surprises the was not only stupid maniac that kills his victims with an axe or chainsaw he tries to make a point why one or another people gets adequate punishment or test and this psychological contest were supposed to make the film enjoyable for all audiencesnow when everybody had seen hostel house of wax and other similar stuff the psychological side of this movie has to be very sharp to make this film deeper than other bloody movies this makes probably the stupidest one from all sawsthe continues his game even he is already one leg in the coffin he is like from another world with his magical capability to see all steps that his players will make he even can to record his voice in dictaphones while he lies with brain tumor and can hardly talk with people around him his game with amanda was very stupid because the same reasonso this excessive amount of intelligence is the biggest problem in this movie the role of amanda in his final game are also very stupid it does not make any sense at all except that it is an unexpected ending of the movie the final game for jeff was not a surprise for me there are a lot of stupidity in other places of this movie but you can see it yourself oh by the way the editing are very annoying these short shots of blood instruments of torture and similar stuff sucks more than in other parts of sawwell i liked that in this movie you can see the preparing process for games from previous movies the scene where puts on some makeup and then lies in the puddle of blood was good thas was a good flashback to first saw other preparations for games was also goodwell if you have seen previous saw movies you will probably watch this one as well it entertains but exaggerated attempt to make this film very clever strikes in a logical side of it it develops a lot of strange and idiotic events that is the biggest problem of all intense moviesthank yousorry about my english,cruel
after the events of the second movie amanda shawnee smith has joined tobin bell for another round of gruesome torturous murder sprees they kidnap a female doctor named lynn bahar soomek so they can use her help to cure his cancerous problem a new victim named jeff angus macfayden must do important tasks to save the lives of victims ready to be tortured for test purposes for he must find out the one that killed his sonoverthetop and extremely violent entry of the saw series with good acting and plenty of brutality such as the acid test freezing twisting body parts and that sort of stuff the story is quite good and the ending is quite twisted that you wouldnt believe its the end of the trilogy its great bloody fun for every horror fan out therecant wait for the 4th installment,cruel

after the first two films the first being amazing and the second lacking the decision was made to create another saw movie what a disaster from the very start i was immediately turned off by the film and i couldnt see how anybody who could read that screenplay say to themselves yes lets make this into a movie after starting off in complete darkness and hearing constant profanity which i really have nothing against it just seemed to be completely unnecessary who needs to start a film with somebody screaming the f word 100 times but after suffering through the beginning there was more horror to endure and im not talking about the fact that its a scary movie there was utter and completely unnecessary gore why do you need to show such graphic gore who wants to see it i admit i like to see a guy get himself blown up in an explosion or tortured like in the movie casino but this movie was terriblenever go see it it was a waste of time i wanted my money back and i was appalled to hear that a fourth movie was in the worksi havent seen such a terrible movie since catwoman or solaris,cruel
i have been watching saw series from the start the first time when i  was its immediate fan what a story what a drama and above all what a suspense here is a story which was for most part of it confided to this one room with three people in it it was so awesome that i was literally on the edge of my seat till the end and the ending just threw me off amazing experience but here is the third installment of the movie and no fizz i mean the guy who is going through the test is actually feeling no pain it is not because there is no gore in the movie in fact this movie has more gore than any of the previous ones it is not because the games are not good it is because the actors are so bad it is like they are right out of school of something the guy jeff is expression less john is talking about the guys vengeance and this guy is so chilled really bad acting by everyone other than johnand secondly the games you want me to believe that a guy who is dying with brain tumor with an apprentice amanda who is so weak have actually made these machines like the arm twister etc together really i mean these are industrial size heavy machine which will require so much hard work  man hours and this guy on the death bed actually made these i mean where are they getting all the money and food from at one minute he is dying the other minute he is planting game equipment at least make it believable i mean there was not even a single moment of suspense and thrill it is like you are making a movie just for the sake of it after watching such shoddy story acting production and direction i want my money back,cruel
i went from seeing and enjoying saw to this one now im not sure if i even want to bother with as stated in previous comments this film was the typical gore for gores sake type movie the scene where the cop has her chest ripped open seemed so totally random and unnecessary it was like the director said hey lets throw this in therei was severely disappointed in this movie the ending was so typical of bad horror movies i know that horror nuts would have been disappointed if there was a happy ending but come on if it were me id forgive the guy save my wife and kid and then leave to rot alone after all the games the guy was put through why didnt he think that the crazy  would have a backup stupid just plain stupid,cruel
when the first saw came out it was a revelation although low budget it brimmed full of suspenseful ideas and is a modern day horror classic tightly scripted with just one main set the claustrophobic horror overwhelmed the viewer the second saw lost momentum because of the multiple sets this one just squeezes the juice out of an already overworked ideasadly the new vogue is tortureflicks as practised by hostels 1 2 no way out vacancy and now this the bastard progeny of the first sawthe new scenario for the torture of hapless innocents is pretty unconvincing once again the claustrophobia of the original is lost and with it dramatic tension as a consequence the gore is just that no real context you dont really care about the individuals or find their predicament convincinghence the only way to ratchet up the thrills is to devise ever more sick torture scenesthe actors dont act they just perform horror poses it is desperately disappointing to see this franchise so bankrupt of inspiration because lurking in there there is still another original film to be shot ironic isnt it that the low budget first instalment delivered so much and the high budget third instalment delivers so littlegive it a miss for gore junkies and sadists only,cruel
the first two movies were more than enough to surface what people really expect from the movie violence plenty of it and not much more than it aside from good dosages of cruelty and morals  as in yes its justifiable and cool to kill people who dont appreciate life and miss the perverse irony though id call it stupidity that the person who wants to teach others to appreciate life does little to appreciate life himself of course intelligence is not exactly in the movies plans as many fans of the second movie were unable to understand what over the rainbow stood for so we have to keep it simple and dumb and thats what you get hereinterestingly enough this is the movie that pulls all stops in making the most mindbendingly repetitive and inane sequences in the series with a dozen edits per second and annoying background music as well as bunches of flashbacks that dont really explain much and are probably there to earn a few more minutes of running time they really need it because the plot can barely contribute with any entertainment value the characters are rough caricatures trying to pass themselves off as real tortured humans and the story itself well the first two movies already displayed what kinds of tricks the writers are willing to pull off and brings absolutely no surprises you already expect the super plot twist at the end as well as the annoying dark ambient theme tune and everything is there at least this time around the unfolding of the events is a considerably more believable  keeping in mind that saw looked like it had no respect for its viewers intelligence and was an open insult against reason but when there isnt a trap scene going on the pacing is awfully slow and constantly interrupted by senseless flashbacks really what is the point of going back to the set up of the first movie just to counter the criticism of its contrived impossible ending filling up the plot holes are we leaving very little flow to the movie its a poorly hacked together horror piece of trash but it improves somewhat on the second movie  which really isnt saying muchthe torture scenes though are an unnecessary strain to sit through yes they are very explicitly violent and gross but if thats what you want youre better off with george a romero this stuff takes itself too seriously its violence for a reason and yes its granted to convert many people to the church of  if you doubt me check out the forums at imdb but unless youre very very curious leave alone really,cruel
okay today i saw as well as the first sequel lowered my expectations for the second one quite a bit and even so managed to disappoint me completelywas pretty clever and the plot twist was great the second film amplified the sadistic streak from the first film too much so that it just became bad but at least it still had some finesse and the twist was okayin the third film however there is absolutely no finesse at all the sadism and gore ventures well beyond whats acceptable to make a clever horror film clever and into the world of pure gore flicks for the braindead audience pun intendedworst of all anyone with half a wit sees the twist in this film coming miles away and despite that the filmmakers felt they needed to insult the thinking audience by spending a ridiculous amount of time explaining all the details of the lame excuse for a plot you know  like the first film did only that time they did it in ten seconds allowed you to do some thinking on your own and the twist was actually pretty cool this time around its all lame lame lameas a matter of fact it is surprising how thoroughly this movie sucks trying to find the slightest thing that might redeem it some i observed that they have somehow even managed to make the physical appearance of the characters worse than in previous films john kramer had an absolutely brilliant look in he looked so cute and cuddly and helpless and you just wanted to hug him and he was somehow charismatic and it achieved an excellent effect because we all knew that everything horrible that happened in that house was still his doing in he looks like the bastard child of yoda and eric cartman likewise amanda was so cute in and now she looks so different for the worse that you can barely tell its the same actorfinal thoughts this movie might have been decent if its target audience had been fans of gory mindless massacre films but they should bloody not be the target audience the target audience should be people who liked and that audience isnt mindless that audience likes clever thrillersi want my two hours back and v aint getting into my wallet when it comes out,cruel
ok this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen and i have watched hitchhikers guide to the galaxyseriously this movie brings down the overall awesomeness of the saw series the twists at the ends of the first two made this movie seem even worseomg it was his wifewhat a twistthe storyline was also very lamecouldve just spoken it all good morning jeff ok get out of that box i need you to go into this freezer thing and decide whether this chick dies or not ok now go burn some stuff and save this guy in this next roomoh by the way lynn keep me alive ok now go into this final room and choose whether this guy lives or dies now do you wanna kill me or not oh syou did that above is basically the entire storyline they werent challenges they were simple life or death decisions that he had to makeand finally to the gore of itpeople rave about the gore from this movie some people apparently vomiting and fainting at the cinemashonestly how this happened i do not know there is no gore whatsoever in the movie you can see how fake it isoverall this movie was a disappointmenti went in with high hopes and came out wondering why i wasted 2 hours of my life210 it gets a 2 because the part where det matthews crushes his foot and bashes amanda was funny,cruel
is a very horrible movie that i have ever seen in my life but it depends on the viewer who is watching the movie its purely my opinion about the movie and no one can blame me for that those who want see this movie shehe must have strong heart i think the director was great he did a great work but i think the story writer is just a fking mad it is really a 100 horror film but horror movie have got some meaning or it highlight some thing or thought but here it is not like that i am voting 3 just for the director and the actor who had did a great work bye friends it my opinion and no one should blame me,cruel
and its called watch this movieactually isnt so bad stranger than the last two saw films this installment deals with a man whose son was killed by a drunk driver this man has to go through a variety of tests dealing with forgiveness in order to survive  with a major test at the endknowledge of the last two saw films is a must in order to understand what goes on in this one several unanswered questions are finally answered in this one revealing more would give everything awaymany cast members from the first two installments appear in this one including cocreatorscreenwriter leigh whannell as adam donnie wahlberg as det eric matthews shawnee smith as amanda and tobin bell as sadistic serial killer a quick piece of trivia  the producers of this film asked the producers of scary movie 4 if they could use their bathroom set because of how similar it looked to the bathroom set in the first two saw films,cruel
in this 3rd edition of saw movies most of the work is done by apprentice amanda as spends whole of the movie on the bed counting last hours of his life i would like to say that anyone who has not watched the earlier editions of this series should watch them first before watching this one otherwise you wont have a clue as to what is going on amanda kidnaps a lady doctor and her challenge is to keep alive till a guy who is located in some other place passes his tests that guy is jeff who had lost his young son a few years ago and since then he has been looking for revenge in his tests he will come up against people who were in one way or another responsible for the death of his son and he will be the one to decide their fate whether to let them die or to forgive and save them watch out for some unexpected twists at the climax there is lots of blood gore and innovative traps there is some amount of nudity as well this may be because the filmmakers were not so sure about whether they will be able to draw audience to the theaters one more time some of the questions that had remained unanswered in the 1st and 2nd edition which most people including myself thought were the flaws in the script have been answered in this edition in the form of flashbacksin the end if you liked the two earlier editions then youll like this one too,cruel
after seeing i had to seriously ask myself one question why do i continue to see these absolutely horrible movies everything about this movie is garbage the torture is too much to take the characters are as thin as tracing paper and the plot runs like water if this movie had anything remotely substantial as a storyline it might be more tolerable but piling such horrid acting upon a plot thinner than skim milk makes the torture scenes worth as much as a torn dollar bill this movie does nothing more than ruin the mood while churning the fluid in your stomachsomeone needs to tell the producers to either hire better actors or somehow attempt to write a credible story every saw movie ends the same exact way in a ridiculous twist which of course leads to a sequel if anyone keeps their wits about them saw 4 will be received in the same manner of the producers latest film in dead silence,cruel

have seen the the first 2 movies and enjoying them i was awaiting the third instalment with a sense of excitement i have no problem with crap films  i own crocodile 1  2  but this just stinks of a rush jobfor a start why all the flash backs it slows the film down to point where i started to lose interest if youre a fan of the series you will know whats happening  you dont need it spelt out every 10 minutes yes  every 10 minutes we get basically a bit of filler and it just goes to show how thin the plot isanother problem is shawnee smith shes simply doesnt have the shoulders to carry this film she was good in the first two because she had bit parts  her character is not strong enough to base a trilogy on  which is what ultimately happensand the lack of  he is reduced to an old man in a bed dying thats about as scary as cute kitten you can see his point of view in the first 2 films but in this is just comes across as bitter and a loser perhaps thats the point i dont know anyhow was wasted shameas for the twist which lets face it is what we all want was a major let down even i got it before the end which is unheard of it feels as though the writers just stumbled into an ending  then didnt have any plan or any idea how to tie up the lose ends i felt very let down by the ending it was weak and frankly unbelievableon the plus side the gore was great perhaps the most brutal mainstream film ive seen but it was gore for the sake of it it wasnt needed it was there to flesh out the running time  but im not complaining imo this was a weak ending to the series a lack of decent script no real scares and a crappy lead actress make this a rental only i wont be adding this to my collection,cruel
contains spoilers as a young man this motion picture is very violent and gory its not family friendly it has some pretty nasty death scenes i cant say what they are but if you are a gore fan happy birthday this ones on me its not a masterpiece but there are good pieces to this jig saw puzzle enjoy well for spoilers there was a main character guy named jeff who just stared at a woman getting frozen that was stupid also he couldve killed the man who did something to driver whoi cant say but you got to watch the movie to see it also a valuable life lesson is learned dont take advantage of people and dont get take revenge its not worth it as jeff learned,cruel
the definition of suffering and macabre is explained going into detail and with irresistible flair the torture apparently torturing the victims for their own good is this time much more perverse than in the first two movies so no fan of the series will be disappointed this instalment is probably the most impressive as for gore violence and sequences of terrible tortures thats why is a mustsee film for those who love the gory versions of horror a forth one would be too much though there will be for sure due to its ending anyway the third one is still gripping and interesting the best of the trilogy started in 2004,cruel
the saw franchise is one of those guilty pleasures that you dont necessarily have to keep secret the first film was a refreshing horror film with an innovative script and enough chills to keep you wanting more the second was more a bythebook suspense film with more gore than frightssits in the same arena as the second film in that it bases its shock value on gore not suspense there are very few moments that actually jump out and scare you actually i cant remember even one which is unfortunate since that is what true horror films need as well the cinematography is so dark for most of the film that it is difficult to know exactly what is being shownhowever the audience is treated to more of the innovative torture devices and twist endings that made the first film work i ended up figuring the ultimate twist of the story well before it was presented but it was still a worthy payoff and the slight openend to the film is a little but of a cruel way of leaving things hanging though in a good wayall in all like the second film is a fun little gore fest thats not incredibly unique in that it certainly wont stand out as one of the better horror films of all times but it will certainly entertain for an evening and sometimes thats all you need,cruel
that s it the only sequel that i like normally the best is the number one and then nothing good or less good then the 1st title but the 3rd chapter of this saga win the prize obviously u have to be a fan of saw saga or a fan of serial killer genre cause is too strong for a light mouth if u understand me a few scene are very ugly so close to be unlookable i don t know if is it a correct word but i think could explain what i meant blood death strong emotions  good editing very fast maybe too fast but i like it me gusta frenetic the camera never stop its rhythm dance with the fear with the thrilling i m not a fun of this saga or genre but this is a very good attempt to explain a kind of world a serial killer world but which kind of serial killer  a strange type cause the killer is a deep thinker  he saw a reality in his mode chat with his victim explain the mean of his attempt a psychological analysis deep thinks about everything cool i suggest this view to all the people that ve obviously a strong heart good view see yap s sorry for my english,cruel
dont get me wrong i really liked the third installment of saw but i am just wondering how they can make another they killed off both of the main characters and left only a weirdo guy stuck in a room of dead people sure donnie wahlbergs character is most likely still alive but do you really think they would have him become the next jigthink they just need to stop were they did and leave it at that a cliffhanging ending is always good when left alone even though i might check out a psycho officer trying to follow in a genius crazy mans footsteps i just dont think it would make for a good movie and one more thing how is it that died so fast i mean didnt he only have colon cancer when he first found out how did it spread to his brain that fast,cruel
yes they have done it again but this time it has become much more of a terrifying ride than a curious one using of course the best of graphics when it comes to blood and gore they didnt cheap us short for anything less than a thriller there are so many things in this movie that made me want to hate the entire series but there is always that slight bit of being pushed off the edge that ties me back into being a completely obsessed fan i think this movie is different from anything i have ever seen in a saw film and im extremely ecstatic for that in this movie i was so happy to see amandas true side for once i dont think the movie before gave her any credit for being so different than any of us has pictured before you probably could not even imagine the clarity and enjoyment of this film unless you have seen it and fell in love with it much like i did i highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not only watched a saw movie previously and loved it but if you hated it as well this movie is complete and utter genius and could not have been made any better,cruel
this film kept my eyes glued to the screen and my bum glued to my seat what is there to say about god where do i start for starters i do think you need to have seen the previous saw movies to understand the background of this filmto understand who is who and what is what but that doesnt let the film down one bit i am a huge fan of gore horror movies suspense in movies and just anything that will keep you glued and shocked and believe methis film does just thatmost horror films nowadays tend to keep the gore at a sort of minor levelmeaning there isnt much of it that makes you cringe this film puts gore on a major level i wouldnt say its gorefilled from start to finish but it certainly does have its fair share of extreme blood guts and torturei had heard that here in england several people passed out in the cinema when watching this film and had to be taken to hospitalto give these people the benefit of the doubti can understand why some weak stomachs would be disturbed by more than afew scenes in this movieim not going to let you in on any part of the story as its always best to leave it as a surprise for you but please i would suggest you watch and so it would just help you understand certain parts in this movieif you wanna be hardcorewatch it alone quietly in the dark ,cruel
i am not a fan of scary movies i know it is not real yet i cannot avoid my unforgiving vivid imagination so obviously i surprised myself when became one of my favorite movies then i t only fitting to see which was not bad but it was no to me seems miles away from s captivating storyline and appropriate violence was gratuitous with its torture scenes and inhumane treatment it is by far the goriest movie in the trilogy there are no new and surprising turns in it is simply 108 minutes of superfluous violence and torture it never stops there is hardly a moment to rest in between each bloody sequenceif you like seeing blood gush flesh rip and bones break then here is your new favorite flick if you are not a fan of torture films run if you are at all squeamish then this is not the movie for you i watched this movie with my current boyfriend who had never before even winced during the other horror films we have watched texas chainsaw the beginning silent hill the omen however the scene that involves an up close and personal brain surgery drilling open the skull and all had him squirmingfive minutes into this movie i was already drained i will admit to having spent the majority of the 108 minutes hiding behind a blanket shielding myself from cruel cruel mind the final scene is less than brilliant but leaves everyone wondering will there be a v you cannot say you have not been warned,cruel
i honestly didnt think the saw series would be able to hold ground past the first sequel as amazing and terrific as was even better than the original i could see the inevitable pratfalls that would cause the downward spiral of this series imagine my shock when they took and made it even more spectacular fixed all those plot holes and made the series even more intelligent more gory more creepy and gritty and riveting and made us all wet our appetites for more that makes the saw series an absolute phenomenon among horror films and horror series left behind the premise of a group of people being tortured by the deranged madman and brought back the terror of one person being alone in his game to escape each victim is brought together for a reason and a purpose and heir and student which i thought was a poor addition to the second installment was downright brilliant in the third the story gets more complex with each turn and it has an intelligent well based and terrifying plottobin bell is absolutely brilliant he is now considered the man who has brought forth one of the most terrifying and brilliantly horrific horror movie monsters of the modern dayor john kramer as hes known bell has been a long time character actor been on tv for years and years and usually does play the bad guy because hes just got the ominous flavor to his performance but jigs so versatile i mean jigs more than just depraved and completely sick hes brilliant a genius even he believes he has justification for her murders stating constantly how he hates murderers his soft spoken tone quiet eyes and disturbing voice makes him absolutely phenomenal for this role i admit i wasnt a fan of the addition of a sidekick in but actress shawnee smith certainly changed my mind in this third installment now granted i think the screen writer did something far more phenomenal with her character making her a victim to as much as anyone despite being his heir apparent smith shows a versatility and as deranged as she is there is some pathos felt for her character this time around she comes across as more of the villain than we get a far more in depth look into her character arc and how she got to this point with john in flashbacks and moments between each film up until now angus macfadyen plays latest victim and he will run him through a barrage of tests to teach him forgiveness each test terrifying and disturbing in its own right macfadyen is brilliant as the tortured father who lost his son in a car accident and now faces the opportunity to exact revenge on those he feels are responsible macfadyen makes for a great male lead taking over from cary elwes and donnie wahlberg bahar soomekh plays lynn the brilliant surgeon who is kidnapped by jign order to keep him alive long enough to play one last game soomekh is very good and a strong female lead and shows an equal amount of strength and sincerity as well as appropriate fear and weakness also returning in smaller roles this time around is donnie wahlberg and dina meyer the detectives who have tracked since the original and its sequelwhat else can be said is downright brilliant you cant watch it on its own right to see its true brilliance but rather part of one of the greatest horror trilogys ever made they are laying down a foundation for what could be an incredible series director darren lynn bousman took the helm again after doing the second one and since the two sequels exceeded the original and they seem to be discovering better ways to do things with each one i hope bousman continues to direct what more can they do with the series i say this after every nstallment but i can only hope that they manage to continue down the brilliant path they are on perhaps we will start to see an unraveling of historywe saw tiny moments of it in this film but more could be done so far they have done an incredible job of continuity and bringing everything together is gone i hope noti think hes too smart for that lord knows i wanna play another game incredible film 910,cruel
the main difference point of saw from any other thriller is the ethical dilemmas that victims discussable are put and also the cunning setups the setups are so cunning that the ethical dilemma to give life to take life also put the audience into a position what would i do if i were there the saw series in that sense have already been a classic on its own can go iv or v  this s different than the others in that sense who is the victim what can you sacrifice in favor of your work is answered it leaves you into a wander that the stunning and cunning scenario leaves you just there there really remains the sense that what will be in the next much more than any other must warn you that it is more bloody than any other saw as wellthe ethical dilemmas of saw making you silent in the sense that if we were the judge and the rule that people always face eye to eye the missing part of s the repetition of our main characterwhat is missing is the details of the philosophy as a philosopher i can easily say that the main philosophy is worth considering but the deals are visualized these are all ok but the ethical dilemmas can be detailed as philosophy it could be greatoverall if you watch the two please do not miss this 3rd part if not the others do not watch it first watch the other two enjoy your dilemma,cruel
i rate the original saw as an 8 as a 7 and this one as a 6 held my interest but i doubt id ever watch it again i think it is the best acted of the three  robert the bruce is definitely a step up but it lacked the cleverness of the first two  the twists are minor and easy to see coming also it promises much more than it delivers suffering you havent seen anything yet the first saw had acting problems and a few too many jump cuts  other than that it was solid the second saw had better acting but the script was somewhat implausible  i mean plan relied on everyone doing exactly as he planned but the final twist was brilliant this one has far too many implausibilities you live with the master game player and never suspect he may be playing you you come across people in deadly peril and you stop to lecture them on how they didnt help when your son was killed i think i would save them first then administer the lecture also it was unclear whether he was allowed to continue regardless of whether he passed the test or not he didnt seem to pass all of them the most annoying part was near the end when they started playing back stuff that happened in prior movies so you could understand the master plan but then they started showing scenes that had just happened three minutes ago we really didnt need those flashbacks thank you and the whole movie is a setup for a sequel presumably the last possible film in the sequence unless they do prequels as well another poster commented that early traps were unfair  i believe this is explained near the end of the movie but the victims in this one do seem a lot more innocent than in the first two films,cruel
yet another slasher film is the latest in the saw series about a dying man turned serial killer trying to teach people the meaning of life one man is challenged to save the people who killed his son and the judge who let the killer off on a technicality a brain surgeon is tasked with a brain operation on the master mind knowing that if his heart stops she get blown to bits the ending may be a surprise to most worth watching if you liked the others ratings bad1 average5 one of the best10 acting05 plot06 scenery07 character believability07 continuity08 dialog05 directing08 casting07 special effects07 overall rating07,cruel
lately dr lynn denoln bahar soomekh has been going through some marital problems and the anxiety is beginning to affect her work late one night after finishing her shift at the hospital she is kidnapped and taken to an abandoned warehouse shortly after waking up she soon meets the notorious tobin bell he is currently dying slowly as the minutes pass and amanda shawnne smith sidekick tells lynn she has been kidnapped in order to keep him alive alive long enough for someone else thats also been kidnapped named jeff angus macfadyen to complete his very own game while telling lynn this amanda places a collar around lynns neck that is connected to heart rate if his heart rate drops below zero before jeff completes his game the shotgun shells on the collar will all simultaneously go off at the same time amanda then preps lynn as explains its a test of will its a test to see just how willing you are to keep someone alive lynn realizes she has no choice and so the game begins jeff must now navigate through a series of tasks where he is promised his chance to get revenge on the man responsible for his sons death something he has wanted every day for the last three years both lynn and jeff are now each tangled in a horrid game of survival what they dont know is their games are merely stepping stones to the true reason they are involved with latest puzzlefirst off i have to admit i was a little turned off to earlier this week after months of having much anticipation when i heard it was guaranteed that there would be a saw 4 if iii did well opening weekend i feared then and still do slightly that the saw franchise will become what friday the 13th did a series of films where only the first few were considered good once i was sitting in my seat at the theater though and the film began i was vastly interested far more than i imagined i would be this saw has so much story in it than the previous two had and really more than most horror films today do much of it is told generally with various flashbacks even by following the story closely the final twist probably wont be known to you until its unveiling its in the twist that a tiny smidgen of a problem existsits obvious that the twist was meant to shock the audience in a big way maybe it does catch most people by surprise but for me didnt not that it isnt good it just didnt come across the way it should have it gave me a ohokay feeling rather than a holy sht reaction this minor flaw doesnt hinder the films poise at all though it still remains interesting to the very last minutethe only real letdown in the film are some of the traps in all there is a total of six physical ones these devices of torture and terror are what many of people who love the saw series look forward to most out of the six only two were what id say good yes all of them can kill but four of them seemed boring and livid im not sure what happened here although this doesnt destroy the movie in a small way it does take away from it even so the two good traps almost make up for the othersso basically is somewhat better than i expected it borders very closely to the feel of the first which is a definite plus most satisfying though is that it wasnt the least bit dismal never was there a dull moment even with the few shoddy traps now that is done and over with though it only makes me question what 4 have in store for us yes tobin bell was contracted for five films permitting each is considered a success but now that director bousman and writer whannell have decided to step aside and leave the series alone i can only wonder two things will saw become a victim of its own game just how long can the series go on before it suffers the fate jason voorhees did,cruel
i fell in love with the series much like many of the horror buffs that have latched on to these movies not particularly interested in spending 900 to see the movie once i just bought it on dvd yesterday and sat in my room for a good watch i was disappointedthe traps are extremely elaborate which the dvd does a good job of showing in the extra features a junkie that cuts herself to me anyway doesnt have the mental capacity to design such a tremendously complex device as the rack or even the angel trapjeffs character is completely uninteresting if they had shown more than just snapshot flashbacks about why he is being tested it might have given the audience more compassion and empathy for his character as it is he just seems like a madman that should really care less about what happens to the victims of the trapsthe relationship between amanda and jigs at best disturbing youd think that amanda was love toy by the way she gets angered at his connection with lynn she seems more like a disgruntled wife than a student of his intelligent mindhaving really enjoyed the first two the third was a huge letdown the ending was predictable and i hope for the sake of the directors and leigh whannell that v can capture the pieces that were missing in this film,cruel
i really enjoyed the first two saw movies and looked forward to more of the same in the third installment what i got more of though was just the violence and senseless mutilation the whole thing seemed kind of pointless to me as if they crew were just trying to fit as much violence and gore into it as they couldto me the progression of the storyline in the movie seemed very choppy as well with a lot of flashbacks and side scenes such that it made it hard to concentrate on the storyline i also felt that there were too many unanswered questions remaining for the movie to appear to be the final part of the seriesall in all if youve seen the other two and enjoyed watching the movie for the plot twists and the dramatic irony in the big reveals at the ends this movie does not equal its predecessors if you just want to watch a movie for the violent content this movie is a great way to waste the time,cruel
i am a huge fan of the saw movies but i will admit i was so scared to watch this one i personally think this one was harder to watch simply because of the gore the previous saw movies dont have a lot of gore but this one was very painful to watch also it reached the puke factor i about lost it during the pig scene also the victims arent in a whole lot of pain while they try to get out of the trap in the previous films but these victims are in excruciating pain which we find out why towards the end this movie was very clever also like the first 2 i really feel for shawnee smiths character in this movie before she never had a huge speaking role in the movies but in this one she becomes angry and raged and bossy as well i love her sarcasm too and when you watch this movie and find out things you realize how weird and crazy it is that she has been involved in this whole thing longer then anyone expected this movie was very emotional too definitely touches a nerve or two i loved this movie and all the other ones i dont know if a saw 4 is in the making or not but im interested in finding out what it will be like also if you need more info and are confused about this movie listen to the commentary done by the director and leigh whannell it definitely clears things up,cruel
what an amazing halloween party movie okay people let me start by saying that i watched and fell in love when i rushed to the theatres eagerly awaiting the 2nd installment i was severely disappointed it seemed like was just a big money grab however  my brother had recently picked up so i decided to pop it in and kill 2 hours what harm could be donethe result this movie satisfied in many ways most people who didnt like it were either upset with the concept of the plot havent seen the previous saw films or were too focused on the depth of realism within the movieyeah its not the worlds most realistic movie its got plenty of flaws but for what it was this movie is absolutely amazingkeep in mind this movie is not for everyone hence the bad reviews but if youre looking for a good time and youve seen both prequels i would highly recommend this movie to any saw fans,cruel
this third entry in the saw series amps up the gore over the other two entries and dumbs down the plot a bit seems like this series is having a bit of an internal conflict with itself as it cant seem to decide whether it wants to be a thriller or a ballsout gorefest i like the way that the deaths are getting more graphic but its definitely at the expense of a solid storylinethis one has on his deathbed and he and his apprentice kidnap a surgeon to sustain life until his final guineapig either succeeds or fails in his trapchallenge the competitor is a father whose son was killed by a driver who got off after only six months of jailtime and game is to promise vengeance for the father  if he makes it through a series of obstaclesstarted off great  two rough scenes in the first 15 minutes or so then it starts to slow down a bit the story about jeff the father while providing some decent goregags didnt do much for me storywise i honestly felt no kind of connection to him his plight and really didnt care whether he lived or died i think if it werent for the elaborate death setups i probably wouldnt have cared for this one at all luckily the kills and traps are inventive enough to be entertaining and there are some tense moments as you wait to find out the fate of each person who comes into the picture the ending was a bit uninspired and i found it a bit confusing and implausible of the three  i enjoyed this the original the least two slow not enough payoff the second the best good mix of decent storyline and cool traps and this third one is in the middle i really dug the gore but the storyline just didnt work for me either way id recommend it for gore fans or fans of the series the uncut version of shows that there may be hope for gory hollywoodmade horror afterall7510,cruel
of the 3 i enjoyed this one the most it didnt waste any time making you squirm in agony watching it if you are looking for an award winning film dont bother with this one it is what it is a horror film the special effects are top notch and the direction is incredible i loved it the acting is fine and the story line although predictable is entertaining it did leave the ending open for saw part 4 but i hope if they do it they can keep the energy and creativeness that this one had its not really a scary film but more of just a gory bloodfest that i found entertaining if you saw part 2 and were somewhat disappointed as i was check out part 3 it really ramps it up a bit,cruel
i am usually not a fan of horror b movies although i have seen the previous saws the first one was said to be breathtaking and i was very disappointed the second was much better but still to be improved so i decided to go for the third hoping nothing more than a popcorn movie it was more than that the third was great and not only great as a saw or horror movie it was clever twisted and you really wonder what the end is gonna be like in the 80s90s there was freddy kruger now there is jingsaw but contrary to freddy kruger the saw franchise has the potential to be remembered as a a movie category because the third is not only good by himself but also justifies and complete the puzzles of the previous ones i am actually surprised to see that has a lower rating than go for it myself i cant surprisingly wait to see the fourth,cruel
builds on the foundations of the two previous installments of the series and to that it should take credit it follows almost flawlessly from the story of the previous movie seamlessly integrating the unique themes storyline and motives writers leigh whannell and james wan who cowrote the first two installments create a fresh new atmosphere heavily influenced with the token horror mystery thriller genre that leaves audiences suspended on the edge of their seats although not for the fainthearted and admittedly a little disturbing the visual effects provide an appealing complement to the plot,cruel
after watching both and i was definitely anticipating what had to show for and it brought down the whole house this movie was so bloody and so gory that i loved every minute of it the plot is mediocre at best but it really develops a lot better than the plot in the first and second saw the actors in this movie were pretty good and tobin bell does a great job playing jign this movie this movie isnt that scary but expect lots of blood and gore especially if you get the unrated dvd version of it overall its definitely worth renting and possibly buying if you love gory movies is definitely the best of the three,cruel
seems like it may suck at first but picks up huge momentum the beginning is stupid wipe out all unawnsered questions kill off two people randomly in near the exact same way and finally start the movie now that im done with the beginning this movie really picks up the traps from here on all great and gruesom as ever amanda is sick and emotional john is on the edge of death and a doctor and a revenge driven father are in the middlei was worried after that saw was the next final destination great idea  reused to hell this isnt the case saw three has its own idea its a prequel and a sequel at the same timeif your a saw fan you need to see this if your not i recommend seeing the films in order but this still wont disappoint,cruel
first that everything this movie in the genre of horror this one well besides the message that has is very important for all the persons the revenge does not go nowheresecond the edition unrated is super better than the theatrical version since the best parts they are not observed correctlysuffering you havent seen anything yet is really truethose who like it the movies of horror i recommend to them this one instead of  the texas chainsaw massacre the beginning  with which there is great blood but the history is almost equal to that of 2003if they do not like them the strong at the time scenes see the theatrical versionbye 610,cruel
johntobin belland his protg amandashawnee smithare up to their old tricks but in this third filmand my favorite of the seriesthere are some surprises i didnt see coming on trial is jeffangus macfadyen who is blessed with a face and talent that can express all sorts of emotion an emotionally unstable man full of booze wrath  pain consumingly overwhelmed by the loss of his son in a car crash the driver responsible was released shortly after thanks to a hasty trial with pretty much a slap on the wrist that might change a many of us who might have this same type of bitterness and rage if it happened to usor at least i put myself in his shoes the other important character in and amandas new game is a female doctor named lynnbahar soomekh another really great choice for the filmthis film is a success in my eyes because the casting excelswho might be able to prolong his life among other thingsjeff must complete a series of games in less than two hours or face being shut inside the building each game consists of those certain people who played intricate roles in or around his sons demisethe woman who instead of assisting jeff as he held his dying son drove offthe judge who gave the murderer a slap on the wristthe killer himself jeff has their lives in his hands he can forgive or let them perish in and amandas crafted killing apparatuses meanwhile lynn has a metal collar with chambered bullets that is linked to heartrate her duty is to not let him die or else the bullets will fire right into her face also important is amandas rolewhat she does know and doesnt knowhas prepared this whole game for a major purpose to be determinedin the grand scheme of things she will determine the outcome just as much as jeffand not even know it the film does lots of things this goaround delving into how amanda formed her partnership with the loose ends untied from the second film regarding ericdonnie wahlbergwill be finalized and we actually see how prepared the test of the two male characters in the first film these flashbacks regarding amanda are crucial to the development of the film and its climax like the previous two films this one works off of some coincidences provided by a screenplay that needs certain characters to dieor sufferat the right moment before they can be saved or a certain character saved who just happens to be in a specific place to be shot by a shotgun im not convinced anyone could put together such elaborately designed games without something going awry but this like the other two is orchestrated by a screenplay writer with devious intentions for his created characters we see that amanda has created games that give those tested no way to survive which is not method this film is also the most grisly and gruesome of the three showing one unfortunate victimcaught in favorite contraption the twister having his arms legs and head completely twisted around as bones snap out of the skin like broken wood the ultimate goal of jigs choices and forgiveness can jeff make the right choice and forgive those who have caused him so much agony there are many who might be able to pick this apart with a fined tooth comb but i just enjoyed it despite acknowledging that no one is that skillful enough to get away with what the films deathgeniuses do,cruel

no spoilers i really enjoy the saw films has the most beautiful killings i couldnt wait to see and now i have seen it it was very good i dont think it was quite as good as the first saw simply because the first was such a one of a kind for its time and had a mind blowing ending but however it did top the 2nd saw movieas you can expect from the saw movies has a great plot extremely gory scenes some great deaths and i fantastic ending i think is the goriest so far out of the 3conclusion has enough up it sleeve to impress any saw fan its not for the squeamish again brilliant plot gore and ending  810 cant wait for v,cruel
film review cast tobin bell shawnee smith and bahar soomekhthe terminally ill psychopath jigs agonizing through his final moments as he lays there on his deathbed he has one final trick up his sleeve his dutiful apprentice amanda played by shawnee smith has already proved herself to the master tactician she acts as his hands eyes and ears in procuring his new test subjectsthe sadistic amanda leaves her victims little chance of survival setting impossible situations for them from which to escape with only one certain outcome each of her distraught subjects writhes in agonyin his final hour upon the stage enlists the help of a nurse to perform a lifesaving operation on him their lives are dependent on one another and upon the success of a third person within the elaborate maze of deathnaturally there is a plot within the mangled plot and it is there that has the last laughthis is a harrowing macabre and sinister tale of unimaginable proportions the moral depravity of the characters is beyond belief especially when one considers that at the films conclusion the audience tends to side with vile conductwith a modest budget of 10 million this film has raked in hundreds of millions worldwide  another huge success for twisted pictures,cruel
jigs back and this time hes kidnapped a doctor to keep him alive but all is not as it seems and things soon start hotting up wow what a final piece to the saw trilogy same excellent mix of suspense and gore from the first two films but wow what an ending this is one of the better endings to a film trilogy that i have seen if you have seen the first two films and enjoyed them this will be the cherry on the cake you learn more about the first two films and more great film this installment picks right up from the end of the second film and is none stop fun from the outset killer is back with a bang with even better death scenarios to make you cringe with horror and sometimes with pain as the death scene endings are nicely graphic and the plot grips you with the will he wont he scenario,cruel
was very good its sequel didnt really live up to the general expectations  was my idea for it was kinda short on the panic and gore perhaps but iii makes up for everythingman what a sick movie great effects and pretty realistic mutilations for as far as i think i can compareheard that the makers had to adjust some scenes in order to get rated r wonder what they changed  and if an uncut version is also availableanyway like gore like to be disgusted like very detailed closed up shots of all things bloody go see it youll not be disappointedjules,cruel
i had high hopes for saw3 and it does get better towards then endhowever the 1st part was just gore for the sake of having gore and somewhat unrealistic for 1 person to have set up since jigs i presume incapable of doing muchi think it would have been better if they had cut out the 1st part of the film and concentrated on the rest of it especially since knowing how unfair new assistant is you know things are never going to go well for the doctor who has to keep jiggy alivestill there is a nice plot twist at the endworth watching but i wouldnt buy it,cruel
probably the most obvious thing a viewer will notice about is that it follows the formula of the first two films thats not always bad of course it worked for last crusade and die hard with a vengeance for instance unfortunately the third film of a trilogy can often end up noticeably inferior to its predecessors this is far more common apparent in films such as jurassic park iii final destination 3 tiii and many others sadly falls into this last categorydont despair however for there are benefits to a formula too namely that you can count on a movie providing an entertaining if not spectacular experienceassuming you enjoyed the first two of course and thats where works if you want gory traps daring escapes and a mysterious master plan thats not revealed until the very end then will deliver also keep in mind its not completely formulaic the relationship between amanda and john has been developing for some time now and continues to do so in this new film which adds a different dynamic the point of view is increasingly focused on john which also gives a unique flavor to this sequelthe problem though preventing me from giving a completely positive review is twofold firstly the character development of the new faces is very lacking secondly for a formula based on plot twists this film is a little too predictable given the pros and cons of the final product id give it a six out of ten in my rating scheme that basically means its worth watching but id wait till its out of the theater,cruel
first of all we all though was dead at the end of when detective matthews beat the living sht out of him and he wasnt so i have a theory about and amandas death rememebr when gave amanda that envelope and i think it said the gun is really a cap gun or it was that shot the same 1 used when they showed how they did so i think amanda is alive cause was all bloody and stuff in but it was cause of the shot 2nd jigs alive u see him move at the end of i downloaded after i t at the movies also how could the tape move and stuff amanda wasnt aware of that or was she theres a 3rd party involved with his and it could be dr gordonwe think he was seen in as the doctor who put the key in michaels eye or it could be daniel matthews ericks son who knows will see,cruel

it is so easy to just flat out talk crap about but if you really take a good look and analyze this film you will realize that it is a fine piece of work the way they put together the whole story the way they answer a few of the questions from and 2 and if you willi could not sleep at night wondering what happened to the nkotbs donny from this movie has some gruesome stuff and i really liked it i wont talk about the movie cuz what can i say that you havent heard from the real previews and reviews but i will say this and only this the cliffhanger ending is great it is just greatits a great movie i cannot wait until saw 4 910 easy go see it,cruel
i thought the saw trilogies were mad good im a horror and gore fanatic but i have to say blew the first 2 away but a saw 4 why and its way too early to even tell if there is gonna be one do you really think they have came up with the idea and spread it around already doubt it the producers may have thought about it but im sure they havent put a word out on it yet after 3 i think they should call it quits and if there is rumors and news about a 4 thats ridiculous cuz we wouldnt know yet its probably people just like me and you starting that and i think if there is a 4th its gonna suck cuz what more can they do i admit ill go see it but ill be shocked if its good i say just leave it alone we dont need anymore marathons like freddy jason or halloween cuz after the 1st few it sucked thats my opinion im not saying there aint gonna be a 4 but i highly doubt it i aint doubtin or creating an argument with nobody its just an opinion,cruel
well im a week late  a few dollars short but ive finally seen buddy 316 you owe me a cookie nowchocolate chip if you please  anyway is better than  almost as good as part 1 in this particular installment the director  the writers both prove they are some really twisted bastards as they go on a grisly torture  death rampage there is one scene in particular involving dead pigs thats sure to turn stomachs  another giving the viewer an updated version of the medieval torture device the rack in fact thats all this film really is is gore  torture oh sure there is the obligatory end of the film plot twists but outside of that the film remains like its predecessors unscary grisly  of course shocking jigs now on his deathbed protg near his side with a kidnapped female doctor who is given really no choice but to help prolong life or literally die trying now for the customary saw snafus 1 how does a dying bedridden man with rookie in tow find the time to discover these human lab rats 2 how does           find the time or strength to concoct these elaborate death traps 3 why are all these potential victims so damn stupid the blindly open doors with writing on them  dont think to stick something in the door jam like a shoe to keep it from locking behind them 4 it took me 5 seconds to figure out how someone could find  capture have a electronic bug implanted in your body  then let jiggy  protg capture you cops trace it find the hideout  end the game mild spoiler i cant see any way that the producers can make a v especially one with jigsay end it now on a realitively high note bloodstones recommendation is decent movie going fare  worth wasting a couple hours  bucks on is it great or classicoh hell no bloodstones rating 75 out of 10,cruel
anyone whos familiar with the saw franchise will know what the other two are about and so im not going to bother giving a synopsis of the first two part three of the franchise reunites us with a now bed ridden and a borderline psychotic amandain newest game a doctor is kidnapped and forced to keep him alive and play his twisted game as a man named jeff trails through the path of those responsible for the murder of his sonthe film is entertaining gory and more of a thriller this particular installment is very emotional intense and loaded with plot twists unfortunately those plot twists happen all at the same time and so the audience gets hit with what feels like a ton of bricksi dont want to give away very many spoilers but the film has too many flaws in it for starters most of the traps seem too complicated to be set up by one person alone its not believable that amanda could have set up these traps all by herselfsecond why is now bedridden he was fine in the first two films notwithstanding his cancer but in this film hes on his deathbed and anyone as ill as jigs wouldnt spend their last few moments planning a way to torture people and play gamesanother problem is the character of amanda herself in part two we learn that shes the apprentice and damn good too but in this one we learn that she sucks and deserves to die the transition from respecting amanda in the second film to die amanda die in the third is rushed we would expect that such a transition wouldnt occur until after a few later filmswe hadnt even begun to see her develop into this role of being the apprentice and shes already killed off too fast too soon and throughout the film poor amanda is confused she kills hardcore but as she does it she weeps her weeping is in contrast to the other times where she takes pleasure in threatening to kill othersone of the most recognizable quotes from the film is sufferingyou havent seen anything yet shortly after the bed ridden delivers these lines his throat gets cut what horrible injustice to words  he lied the film has more problems than not but for the sake of time and not nitpicking ill just say that with v the crew should take a little more time to reexamine their choices be a little creative take risks and produce something new maybe even divulge into that back story with jign love with that sexy beauty he was dreaming about the script of part iii was too similar in form to the previous two installmentsto conclude was the film good yes great not really the best film out there currently no the most fulfilling of the trilogy i dont think so but still worthy of a high rating 710,cruel
saw was outstanding and original was interesting and effective was gory but too messy saw as a whole is a good series of films that a nerve wracking and written with ingenuity except for this latest addition set the tone that it would be a gory film and it delivered but its fault is that the storyline became too messy and at times convoluted i feel that the scriptwriter try to add in so many add ons from the previous two films that it lost focusalthough as i stated earlier this film was gory and it did make me squirm at times in the cinema eg donnie wahlberg breaking his own foot ouch it is a fair film and is watchable do enjoy i thought that this would be the last on the series and ended well but they have just announced a fourth check it out,cruel
i just went and watched and i still am not sure what i think and honestly i dont know if that is a good or bad thingnow if anyone has read my other posts they might remember that i wasnt a huge saw fan the first saw was very original and was very creative but the acting ruined the movie for me then came saw2 i really liked this one better acting still a good storyline and more tension probably my favorite in the current trilogynow its the acting in my own opinion was some where between the 1st and 2nd there really wasnt as much suspense or tension in the third installment and some of the storyline makes sense but at the same time kind of contradicts other parts of the story and the ending really kind of pisses me offspoilersthe ending although kind of interesting really pointless they leave the story wide open kind of like an ending for but than the beginning of a new saw movie tacked on the end however there is no one left to carry on the game in a saw 4 no and no apprentice i am sure that they can make a saw 4 but i think that it wouldnt not be worthy of the saw franchise without end spoilersand if they never make a saw4 that makes the ending to totally pointless,cruel
thinking about it when i went into the cinemas the other day i thought that the gore would be full on and it was but at the same time incredibly fake that seen when the female cop had those things grabbing her rib cage that just looked like a painted hot water bottle i should also mention the part were that doctor was doing that procedure that was just an insult theres no way that your skull is that big and your brain moving like a jelly fish  oh please give me a breakyeah right oh and the cliffhanger was pointless but worst of all thoughtless to the good side and the only one in this movies was the plot that was a lot better set out than but overall some good crap fake effects and gore and loss of common sense but go to see it you might just like it,cruel
there were several things i enjoyed about the previous saw films that were all but abandoned in this installment one as someone mentioned earlier in people can no longer save themselves says he is still trying to teach the same lessons yet people cannot choose to live or die anymore they are subject to other peoples choices this in itself seems to contradict the purpose of the game second overkill overkill overkill overkill on the violence overkill on the acting im sorry but amanda just whined nonstop and overkill on the final montage really the ending wasnt that clever theres no need to spend three minutes flashing it all back for us up to literally seconds before the montage began plus besides the fact that people could not leave the traps without assistance the traps themselves were overkill where the hell did they find an unattended slaughterhouse with about 100 dead rotting pigs waiting to be shredded finally when i exited the theater i was thinking of the little girl and why it bothered me that he took her then it kind of hit me even when the detectives son was abducted he had a criminal record he was not innocent i believe this is the first truly innocent person took and once again she has no way to free herself she was left subjected to whether or not her father could save her all in all the man who played did some very good acting but the script did not allow for the character to truly act his part,cruel
and amanda kidnap a doctor to keep alive while a man who lost his son to a drunk driver must survive a handful of teststhis film was not the greatest horror film ive seen it certainly didnt leave me the way saw left me but as the third film in the series hastily written it was actually pretty good the traps were decent though less creative than before and the story takes an interesting new direction best of all flashbacks that help fill in the gaps from the first two films many of us figured out how remained motionless so long in the first film but now its no longer a debatesome critics said the film had gadgets that were too hightech or too reliant on medical knowledge i disagree they showed how devoted amanda was and i find it plausible she spent countless hours perfecting the devices and studying anatomy one scene makes it clear she has a solid knowledge of pharmaceuticalsothers have said the film was gory i say it was not gory enough for me the most disturbing scene was in the first five minutes later scenes that could have been incredibly bloody a womans rib cage being pulled forcibly open for example took the camera off the action or made the scene too dark to really enjoy the generation of horror fans today grew up with mortal kombat they can handle body parts getting ripped off give them what they want not to mention the growing influence of asian horror film grossouts like imprintthe pigs in the grinder delightfully perfecti also thought the plot was incredibly contingent for it to work out perfectly everything would have to happen exactly as it did with the right people living and dying and certain people being out of their homes long enough to rig things the mysties are saying its just a show you should really just relax and theyre right but it saddens me to see such intelligent film makers leave these danglersim not sure why the father of the drunk driver was targeted unlike past victims his crime wanting revenge on his sons killer wasnt even really that bad very natural in factthe visuals as usual are good and the film is both dark and filmed through a blue tint to give a more sterile feel sterile as in isolated i feel theres so much more to say but im drawing a blank but really if you liked the first two films you have no excuse to miss this one it really clamps down the series,cruel
the original saw was gruesome but did occasionally leave things to the imagination it had genuine tension and a pretty intriguing mystery was at least inventive and fun to watch is easily the most gory twisted and nasty entry in the series making it solid gold for the gore hounds out there unfortunately the sense of mystery from the first two films is completely gone you wont give a crap about the characters and the pacing is clumsy the film drags in many scenes and just plain goes on for too long if youre hardcore sawgore fan youll enjoy it but theres only so much left the filmmakers can do with the premise this is the kind of movie youre probably best off catching on scifi one night rather than going to the theaterand seriously how many ridiculously elaborate setups could a serial killer even an inventive one come up with how big is the size of this warehousea city how many billions of dollars were spent on these schemes where did the money come from and how did a highlywanted serial killer come up with it just a few questions to ponder,cruel
 slight spoilers for anyone who watched and was pulled into the story but felt a lack of the real scare that comes out of horror movies you now have to watch throws in a in my opinion great story line about a man named jeff whose son is killed in a car accident jeff and his wife are separated and jiff dreams of the day he can come face to face with those involved his wish comes true when puts him to the test can he forgive and let them live or forget and let them die meanwhile a doctor is captured after her shift at the hospital where she is greatly stressed she wakes up and finds that she must keep alive as long as jeff takes to complete his tasks jigs close to death and its a suspenseful battle against death throughout the moviealso kicks you in the balls with violence some times unnecessary but definitely cool traps theres 6 in all and i thought 2 were kinda lame but the 4 other ones priceless if i were to explain some of the gore scenes it would ruin the movie because some characters make their return when they said they would not overall do not see this movie if you are squeamish but if you are a hardcore saw fan or mildly interested an have seen the first two movies then go see this one too besides if you dont like it its only a movie right,cruel
the plot is about people in traps made by and his assistant amanda and they must get out of them to live thats obvious but there are two victims the first victim trapped under game is the dr lynn denlon who must keep alive if he dies she dies she must keep him alive as long as it takes this other victim jeff to complete a game of his own which is trying to find a way out of this house mazeapart from the very bad was a very good film its not a great one not better than saw but a lot better than now there are a little bit of characters which leaves room for character development unlike which had many characters probably just for the kills theres a lot more gore and it makes the first two films look like disney films and theres the extreme again where the second left off and in which saw hadthere are a lot of more traps in this film and they are very creative this film also connects to the first two films very well so thats another good thing in this film we actually care for the villains in my opinion and in the end you expected it theres another twist this is not the greatest twist of them all probably the weakest but i didnt care i didnt really get the ending because the ending feels a little bit rushed which was a problemsome other problems called cliffhangers or left for a sequel are unexplained sub plots not all things were explained in but we all know itll be in v which there will be one apparently next october this film is suspenseful and some parts are thrilling and there are scenes that wants to make you throw up or cover your eyesthis film is a great recovery from its not the best one in the trilogy but its worth the 8 dollars in the theater or a buy on the dvd this wont disappoint the saw fans so go see it,cruel
i have to say im not a lover of the really gory movies to be honest i thought i was going to get sick when i seen i couldnt look at certain parts but dont be afraid i still loved iti loved the whole trilogythe 3 story lines were fantasticand all the twists are so brilliant they must have an amazing script writeri loved the twist at the end of the 1st one it was sooooooooooooo unexpected  i just really enjoyed the 2nd one  the 3rd just topped it off for me thoughi dont know how they will make a 4th movie but if they do il definitely go see it you have to see this onebest horror ive seen in a long time,cruel
was cool dont get me wrong the whole idea of how people can save themselves by hurting themselves or others is just as interesting in the third as the first two and the people still died in interesting way just like the first two and there is the problem the third was just like the first two had the gore but no death trap that make you think o my god and it had an alright plot but no twist i didnt see coming halfway through the movie and the antihappy endings that made the first two make you feel as though you yourself were caught in some sort of trap made the third one feel like a sick joke that just wasnt as funny the more you hear it,cruel
on the whole i enjoyed the movie but there were certain things i did not understand and now may have to go back and rent 1 and 2 again to see what i missed when jigs in and out of consciousness he has visions of a blonde womanwho is this is this his wife when he is saying i love youi love youand he is directing this at lynn the doctor is amanda jealous what was in the envelop that gave amanda i thought maybe it was his will in the end did or amanda kill det matthews the info on this say that the guy who played the judge was also in the 2nd onewhere i dont understand what the guy with the chains had to do with it i understand everyone else related to the killing of jeffs son and his need for forgivenessvengeance testingbut some of it i dont understand,cruel
no spoilerthere was a time when hitchcock shook the theatre with janet leighs scream in psycho 1960 people were unaware of the gore and gritty atmosphere of hitchcoks creation perhaps this was the movie that created a new trend in the horrorthriller genre then it was the exorcist 1973 when linda blair walked down the stairs on her hand and feet while lifting her body in a backward arch this was the beginning of yet another trend i believe then came 003 to create something you have never sen before a serial killer with a gift of forgiveness only when his victims escape the traps he sets up saw has created a whole new meaning to horrorthriller this movie fed to the new generations needs of pure gore stands to its expectations of blood gore cracking of bones hacking of flesh peeling of skin and crushing of skulls i seriously do not believe how this movie escaped nc17 rating the last nc17 movie i saw was haute tension by alexandra aja another member of the splat pack along with darre lynn bousman the opening scene in this movie has similarity to one of the scenes from but it has a little more outcome than it had in with that little more i mean a sound effect and when it happened everybody in the auditorium went awwww it was a ladies and gentlemen your attention pleasethe acting department i would be highly insensitive to comment on acting nobody expects acting from saw franchise what i can do is perhaps compare with there is a flaw in the direction darren may not make you glued to your seat the traps are new but they are designed for something else other than just for the victims to try and escape i would say darren has managed to make those 1hr 40 minutes interesting enough for a thriller with a nonlinear screenplay by leigh whannell and the gore contentthe twist is little unexpected but it is something that only a few people would care for at least saw franchise has no ghost stories ufos or witches that create something supernatural this is a movie that could come up with some explanations to stand for thats why i would choose this one over the grudge or silent hill any day of the weekso if you are having a bad day and want to go and scream your guts out then i suggest go watch this this will feed your emotions,cruel
picking up where left off this the final part of the trilogy is both the most disappointing and the most nihilistic sadistic and gory of the three films there are just far too many superfluous scenes the first fifteen minutes of the movie could be cut out and it would have no impact whatsoever on the storyline of the movie and come across as gratuitous that was one of the things i liked so much about saw and everything you saw whether it was exposition or scenes of carnage it all had a point in terms of the story as a whole whereas with this film there are some bits that make you think the writers came up with admittedly superb scenes but then had no real way to work them into the plot and make them a part of it unfortunately as good albeit gruesome as these scenes are they do feel rather tacked on and slow the film down indeed this is the slowest paced of the trilogythe acting quality varies in this film tobin bell is fine as although he doesnt really have much to do shawnee smith is superb as the unhinged amanda and provides the films real energy angus macfadyens jeff is full of rage but fairly one dimensional and is such an unlikable hero that to be honest you never really care for him at all the weakest link in the acting stakes is bahar soomekh i just never found her convincing and unlike macfadyen whose character worked as a one note performance hers needed to be stronger seeing as she was sharing some quite charged scenes with the two killersthe games in this film are by far the most elaborate and i think the most sadistic they are also by far the most graphic when they destroy the participant showing a very visceral disembowelment and with my personal favourite and too turning a human beings limbs around 360 degrees in one of the most horrible scenes think lots of snapping sounds and bones ripping through flesh and you get the idea it was called the rack there is also some quite graphic diy brain surgery which is quite nauseatingso is the film any good yes it is it does continue the story of and amanda and brings it to a decent conclusion still managing to pack in enough twists and turns and gore for fans of this sort of film however given the high standard set by saw and the surprisingly good sequel i was expecting more from this film and have to say that although good it didnt really enthral me as much as the first two films it didnt really show me anything new so from that point of view it was a very disappointing film all in all this is very much the return of the jedi of the saw trilogy its good its entertaining and it ends the story nicely but you cant help thinking that it should and maybe could have been better,cruel
warning dont read this review if you havent seen the first two sawswith any movie that turns into a franchise there is usually a distinct taste on the palette that the characters are getting a bit old the story is becoming less novel and more traditional special effects take the place of solid story and tension there are always exceptions that prove these rules but is not one of them in tobin bells third outing playing the mastermind of there is a distinctly stale taste in the air a taste that works against the movie from the first frame to its last though does have plenty of good moments it sacrifices story for gore characters for gore and good story for gore gore gore gorei dont want to give away too much of the story but the basic plot is that and his new apprentice amanda have kidnapped an expert in the field of brain surgery for the purpose of keeping alive as he plays one final game the story intercuts between scenes with and this doctor and a man named jeff who must go through a series of puzzlesgames as he tries to find the man who killed his daughterthe films biggest strength is the character of amanda  whom we see briefly in the first one and more of in the second in this outing we see through a series of flashbacks and how she is reacting to imminent death her character in much more depth obviously its nothing oscar worthy but it does add a little bit of spice to the franchise as a whole we see scenes that extend all the way back to the first movie which ends up working out pretty welljeff the guy who must find the man who has killed his daughter is played by a lessthanstellar actor but thats okay he goes through all the motions of grief pain blah blah blah but theres nothing really special there donnie wahlberg playing the cop who had his son kidnapped in the second film was much better jeffs character is just basically a shallow revenge driven man there are a couple of powerful moments in the film that emphasize mercy forgiveness and compassion but these are eclipsed by the mountain of gore that is always sure to followthat is another of the films weaknesses all the gore of course in a slasher flick one wants a lot of gore  and if that is all you are looking for it will not leave you disappointed but the first two saws managed to be creative in their gore not giving us too much giving us just enough so that we were never overdosed though there is a fair amount of creative gore in the movie the traps that and amanda design are some of the most creative in the series some of the gore just seems excessive at one point must undergo brain surgery and the film shows us every last bit of that by the time the outer layer of skin had come off i was going through the motions of being disgusted but in all reality it had worn off completely  the gore desensitizes in this filmwho has always been the creative mastermind in the first two films now lies completely incapacitated on a bed throughout the entire thing he loses a lot of his fire a lot of his mystery the second one managed to show us jign a vulnerable position yet by doing that in the way they did he only seemed that much more twistedly clever in this one hes just a body in a bed though the ending does redeem him a little bit this is a character who has definitely seen better daysthe score of the film is fairly good it has liberal doses of the original ending theme hello zepp done in new and different ways the rest of the music is traditional gore fest music nothing too exceptional the ending piece of music fell a little bit flat too it didnt really soar like the piece in the first or second one and the fact that the ending fell flatter than the first two as well didnt work too well for me either the tension in the film is lacking too  because of the excessive gore but also because of all the focus on amanda  i did say that was one of the films strengths but a more effective balance would have helped the tension tremendouslyas much as i may be ragging on this movie i did enjoy it the new focus on amanda was enjoyable creepy voice was once again very well done the gore was creative in many places and there were many more traps than the first two combined and angus macfadyen the man who plays jeff did a reasonably well job under the circumstances the worst part about all this is that because it has shown to be so successful earning 34 million over the weekend beating the halloween weekend record lionsgate has announced plans to make a v please people this may have been a good series but the saw franchise has definitely breathed its last it was good while it lasted  one of the few slasher flicks that i actually respected and looked forward to but towards the end of the film plot possibilities could definitely be seen to be wearing thin was a good and enjoyable film but v no thanks ah well i suppose ill just sit back and enjoy this most recent installment while it still remains a reasonably satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy,cruel
when you go to see any of the saw saga you go for the intense plot twists the eerie environment and lets not forget the cringing gore well delivers on all of these the plot twists more that you can count the environment is one of the freakiest ive seen and the gore is second to none in fact is seems like the team focused all their attention on this gore factor because honestly that is what draws saw fans makes hostel look like a disney flick showing the audience everything youre hoping not to see however with all the hard work these guys put into the details and violence they happened to make one of the slowest moving movies i have ever seen when the lights in the theater came on i was certain that i had just watched a 3 12 hour movie this is definitely not a date movie this is the movie you go to when you have nothing else to do because as i said earlier it moves slower that return of the king on a good day serious saw fans and gore lovers will definitely get their yearly fix with this one i give it a hard earned 710,cruel
forget the blood and the gore thats to be expected with the saw series and of course iii doesnt disappoint but this time around the movie actually explains the other two and does it well while winding a twisted plot around the current story we learn the true details about amanda shawnee smith in her best acting to date the setup for the first saw and even a little lesson about what is definition of a murderer which he claims not to beexcellent acting throughout with many plot twists and turns which will keep you interested in the current story while appreciating knowing how the other stories came about flashback scenes do not take away from the current story and do not interrupt the continuity of the filmand oh yes there is still even more blood s truly shaping up to be the best true horror movie franchise of our times jason michael myers and even freddy cant touch this series while jason  myers were basic creature wont die flicks and even though the freddy series took it to another level with style humor and interesting story lines all three of those deal with the supernatural saw deals with true human interaction without resorting to fantasyeven leaves you anticipating next years halloween weekend for when iv hopefully will come out,cruel
this third sequel closed a lot of gaps in the first two which left a lot of open doors and possibilities there are so many things in this one that leaves the viewer wondering but still gives a little here and there to keep you in your seat the ending has a subtle hint of a possible fourth but it would be very difficult to create it this was a good closer for the saw fans a lot of new traps were presented in this one and really tested human character and ability to move on so many people were tested in this one and few of the machines and tests left you a little queasy enjoy the gore makes you wonder what yours would be if you were in their situation,cruel
the third and final  installment of the saw movies lead me again through a rollercoaster of plots subplots and red herrings my assumptions based upon were proved wrong in a matter of moments and i found myself itching and occasionally squirming in my seat this was partly due to the length of the film but mainly due to the visual and audio battering my senses took during some of the painfully and stomach churning gamesindeed in the cinema 2 couples left never to return and several more left and returned looking worse for weari wanted more but also wanted less i wanted more torture more blood and guts and more dialoguei wanted less stop  start photography and xfile style movement this is my only gripe without this cinematic style it might have been nice to see just how big the warren of rooms and traps ranthe ending surprised me after three films you would think that i would know better however final piece might be a clever 4th episode from beyond the grave the magic now of these films is that so many recipients of his style of crime and punishment could be locked away in the belly of the city that the floodgates could be wide open for an ever expanding franchise of filmsi hope so has left me annoyed frustrated impressed and ever so slightly nauseousi like it i want more i want to play a final final game,cruel
i loved saw was a disappointment minus the needles anyone who has seen it knows what i am talking about so my expectations for where lowered i just saw hehe it last night and was pleasantly surprised actually made better in fact i found that it rounded both its predecessors the acting was very pretty good over all and tobin was awesome as always only problems i had were some of the traps seemed unpolished like the traps from 1 or 2 all brutal but slightly restrained perhaps im just becoming more numb to violence but some seemed tamed dont get me wrong you will cringe but i never felt like i was in their shoes i was observing these peoples torment but not experiencing it myselfi highly recommend to anyone who loves horror hell im going to see it again this week ,cruel
assuming you have a strong stomach this is a worthy addition to the saw franchise almost all the survivors from the last one are back for another go the death scenes are spectacular if gruesome and just like the first two you have a killer surprise twist ending no pun intended only reason i didnt rate it higher is due to the volume and over the top nature of the violence which might turn off some people what performances there are are workable within the context of the storyline as presented if have a reasonable constitution and no real problems with blood gore and grisly death scenes you should have no problem here,cruel
i went in with high hopes hoping it would be a return to the first movie after seeing the second and being utterly let down i didnt think they could do worse especially since it was an original idea and not just reformatted from another script like the second definitely not let down although i really enjoyed the first for the atmosphere and sense of creepiness it can never really be achieved again since weve pretty much been revealed to everythingsome scenes were gory for gorys sake but will satiate anyones need for that kind of stuff so many hooks and chains i have to say i saw the twist coming from a while away but still enjoyed it and the way they did it was surprising also marring it was suspension of belief with things having to go exactly right and a few too many flashback scenes actually way too manyall in all a gripping ride with a few pointless flashback scenes and god awful dialogue in the beginning i recommend it,cruel
i would highly recommend that anyone who hasnt seen the first two saw films and want to see them not to go and see this one just because your friends are and you want a night out to the cinema it will ruin the first two for you and it will be pointless watching them after this this is what two of my friends did and now they know the endings to both films it gives away so much from them not so much the plots more the endings and the twists which is exactly what you wont want to know if your planning on borrowing your friends dvds after seeing the 3rd onefor saw fans who liked the first two then this will explain a lot of things which you didnt even think too much about after the first 2 it wraps up a lot and links together a lot of the story making it a very complete trilogyas to be expected there are twists and turns at the end and the ones in this film made me want to go back and watch it again this time from a different angle even more than the first two didoverall a great film as to be expected but not so gruesome or scary as the first two which was a bit of a let down as its what s known for this one focused more on a stronger and more complicated story,cruel
this movie to say the least was awesome as horrifyingly sick and twisted as i hoped it would be the traps were new improved and sickening and thats what makes it saw not to see if you are easily disturbed squeamishetc if you have a certain fear that has to do with a certain body partits going to happen in this movie like i have a thing with peoples feet getting hurt both of these guys achilles tendons were run through with rings that he had to rip off as well as his wrists calves forearms shoulder blades etcnone of these bugged me so much as the feet did another guy had his feet bolted to the ground the story ties together well and the plot turns dont end howeveryou must absolutely must see and 2 before watching this or the plot line will leave you completely lost as to the final test and who amanda is this is definitely a go see again film if anyone would like to go see it with me then please make the date8 out of 10 traps deaths plots horrifyingly sadistic and loved every bit of it tagline pain its part of the puzzle blood its the price of freedom death its not that easy suffering you havent seen anything yet,cruel
the third movie in the saw series we knew it was going to be made and the hype would be high for the movie i came into this movie with very high expectations seeing how it was rated r but then got dropped down to 18a since the rating dropped so did my expectations seeming it to be not as good and gory as i first presumed it to be but i still expected a lot from itfirst of all the plot was pretty nice and interesting the subplot onto this movie made it better and more thoughtful the way it was directed was pretty interesting and well done but i have to say the gamestraps were pretty lame like in comparison to the last two these traps were bad and i was really disappointed in themsaw movies supposed to be filled with gore the first one held its word the second one kind of the third one not at all i was extremely disappointed in the amount of gore or blood was in this movie there really wasnt that much i dont see how it could have deserved the r rating where i live there was a bit of blood but nothing that made me go wow this is awesomeand 2 started off quickly and kept me entertained did this one do that no not at all i got extremely bored in this movie there were large chunks that were boring nothing happened the only good parts were the beginning and the endin conclusion i was horribly disappointed in this movie and if i go see it again i will only go to see the beginning and the end which is the only reason why i gave this movie a 7,cruel
i am a hardcore saw fan but this one just didnt cut it for me theres a lot of explanations but at the same time some of the twist you can figure it out overall its a good movie but if you havent watched the first or second one dont go see this one because it would make no sense the actors themselves did a really good job and i was very pleased with that but as some one else says a lot of this film doesnt seem as real as the other ones i could see some of the things happening to others from one and two but this one is not as real but then they could be i hope a 4th one is not made because this movie was a good one to end the saw series but if a 4th one came out i would be one of the 1st ones in line to watch it,cruel
theres enough going on to keep you entertained the biggest problem is that much of the story seems to be backstory for the 2 previous films i would have been confused if i thought about previous victims or shawnee smiths involvement in the murders but as i said the strength of the film is how it keeps you interested in whats happening to the characters now since we have a terminally ill we get to see how hes dealing with his illness we also have the tests given to the latest victims and as with any good puzzler like these we shouldnt be able to guess how all the victims are related until the final piece is revealed and this is why this movie succeeds we have four characters to follow through their ordeals we get several mini tortures to enjoy and we are filled in on details from the previous films under any level of analysis these stories are silly this recent film had me wondering whether buys tape recorders in bulk as he uses about 7 in this movie im not sure if the saw franchise has anything left to tell us but its fairly obvious that will be back again since hes been given a minireprieve from his terminal illness,cruel
ok so on friday opening day and saturday i saw this movie it was an awesome movie no doubt it was packed with loads of gore i am talking like more than hostel but the story was not as good as the other two saw films this one relied on making the movie good based on gore and violence instead of cleverness like the other two which is understandable because that is what teenagers these days like to see is gore when the first film was made it was extremely low budget so they could do what they wanted with it but once that got great ratings and the second one as well i think they got a bit pressured to make this one extra gory just so the film would do extra well my personal favorite thing about saw was the twists that it provided this ones twist was a bit weak but still clever so dont get me wrong the movie still kicked but it was not as clever and as well put together as the other ones still a must see,cruel
its halloween and its time for another and apparently final saw movie the cast is in place with the crafty tobin bell and the sexy psycho shawnee smith and the game is beginning but is this a good closure or another cursed part 3 in a long line of bad part 3s throws us right in the mix picking up right after the end of we get to see former new kid donnie walburg and what really happened to him after the credits rolled its fun after this the movie goes on to its new story about a female doctor that has been having marital issues and seems to be a bit drained with her job and life as she has resorted to pill popping what better a person than and amanda to come in and help with that problema proposition is made as jigs needed to be kept alive for one final game that will put every character in the movie in situations that will require them to make the right choice or the usual repercussion will follow this leads to our other test subject that has had issues with releasing his anger and depression over his son being hit by a car leave it to to put all the possible pieces in place for the man to make choices for those involved to live or diein the end both stories intertwine which leads into a double wam bam ending that should end the franchise in a good way to say anymore would be spoiling it but also to add anymore movies to this trilogy would be an injustice these movies should be remembered as being a solid example of 3 good movies and proof that if handled correctly you can make 3 solid movies similar in nature yet each with its own characteristics that allow them to stand on there ownalso this movie will shed light on the first 2 movies adding elements that allows us to see things from and amandas point of view the only question for me still is what happened to drgordon anyway thats besides the point in the end we get a good horror and gore film oh yes there will be gruel with some sadistic torture and mayhem just in time for the halloween weekendin closure i give 710 good closure hopefully to the saw legacy fans of the first 2 will really get something out of this new fans may want to watch the first 2 before entering in to the series to do so will shed light on a lot of the foreshadowing that takes place in the film lastly i leave you with a nice mathematical equation keystringshotgun deathim outupdate saw 4 coming i guess there goes the trilogy here some the quadrilogyfor now,cruel
when i went into this movie i was expecting an amazing finale to saw that would answer all the questions from the first 2 needless to say i didnt get my fill although a lot of questions were answered the one i truly wanted to know was not the traps in this one are more gruesome then the first 2 well not exactly the traps as some involve no blood at all but when there is blood it pours the main premise in this movie is not as interesting as the first 2 and the twist is not as clever as the first 2 but you still have a movie that will keep you interested this movie does have a nice ending though that i did think was good this movie is worth seeing at lest once but dont expect anything as impressive as the first 2,cruel
well not being a huge fan of the first saw but enjoying it showed up and sucked i thought it was just a mess of a film acting above all well thankfully has taken a step forward is better than the first two it doesnt have the mysterious charm of the first but its story is deeper and the deaths are bloodier gorier and overall just betterstory is about the bedridden needing help due to the tumor growing on his brain his accomplice the chick from the 2nd is helping out and she manages to get kidnap a doctor to help save obviously a deadly game is involved the storygame in this flick is on a much larger scale than the previous two films there is also a couple throw in games and a side story my favorite part of the film which is thrown into the mixi kind of thought was a little long they kept showing you what you were supposed to be thinking through short clipsi would say this is the most predictable yet so these clips werent really needed but they are helpful i also didnt like the accomplice to hes a little too good at what she does for being an amateur i can complain about stuff till the cows come home but id rather just say that this movie will most likely be a huge hit for saw fans and saw haters wont hate so much anymoremaybe not its not a bad moviei wouldnt say its a great movie but it was pretty unique and gory pretty good flick 7 outta 10,cruel
i would be lying if i said i didnt enjoy the film but as most sequels provethe original remains the best i didnt find the end twist to be as exciting as the first two films this installment does however win the award for the most gore i have a pretty high tolerance to blood and guts but i even found myself looking away at times it didnt take away from my enjoyment of the film though i would like to pose a question for my fellow saw fans for those of you who have seen it do you think there will be more or does it end with it would appear that both john and amanda have met their demise but who ever really knows especially since john reveals that hes hiding jeffs daughter it also looked like he was doing something with one of his audio tapespouring wax on it or something did i see this correctly your thoughts,cruel
the first thing i have to say is that this final installment of the saw series shouldnt be considered a horror flick its more like suspensegore i didnt scare once and i didnt hear anyone else in the theater jump either although one girl did jump for a preview of sarah michelle gellars the return just didnt deliver with the thrills but it did bring the gore in spades and if you enjoyed the previous installments you shouldnt walk away disappointedwhat i enjoyed the most is the writing i feel like the writers really examined the previous two films and set out to wrap up all the loose ends that had been made with every question that was raised in regards to the motives of and his rules was answered which in this genre is often the first thing that is tossed out the window in an effort to focus on the killing they delivered a great twist with the relationship between and amanda and the subplot was a fantastic test of the human psyche and moralityi cant say i enjoyed the movie because after seeing hostel texas chainsaw massacre and now this well i dont like shockgore movies but i was pleased with the effort and seriousness the writers and producers had to deliver a movie that would really honor the intelligence of the community that enjoys these flicks,cruel
on returning home from cinema this afternoon i decided that i would post for the first timeafter seeing both of the previous movies in the saw series i have to say that this one outshines them all i am not going to put too much information in so as not to spoil it for otherswithin the first 5 minutes you are squirming in your seat first time i have ever seen my husband cringe at a movie extremely gruesome in placeslove the twists and turns and the intertwining of threads from the first two movies especially the second one where it tie up a few of the loose threadsi can highly recommend this movie for horror movie lovers,cruel
how do you rate a film like saw good or bad if i say good the academy crowd will snub my comment and if i say bad the fans of the series will get my headquestion becomes does it fill its promises on that i have to agree that it hits the nail on the head it certainly bring to the screen a series of torturelike traps and a cool ending that are now synonymous with saw and halloween for some of usdefinitely took its cues from the first one the third one seems to look at the first 2 and build around what made them work for example in my opinion fewer characters and intrigue made the first saw better but a story that digs deeper in the mind of the killer gave an edge on the second one so in the intrigue revolves around one guy that has to go through a series of tests certainly there are other characters for the killing quotathe first couple of deaths while they were cool were virtually pointless but the film also takes you behind the scene of some of the more famous traps how set the scene painted the puppet etc for that i say was a good sequel and delivers gore for those who want it the first saw was a big punch in the face that almost chocked me but since weve had 3 hostel 2in the making texas chainsaw live feed and then some perhaps here lays my main bad criticism for these films are less and less about complex intrigue but more about what will be the next shocker that people will talk about for a while its becoming a little too gory for me and maybe i wont even go to the 4th t there will be such a thingthanks,cruel
this is a saw movie which equals a lot of gore a lot of blood and a lot of sick traps you can expect that from this movie but thats about it this movie was good but it wasnt or 2 good the traps were definitely some of the best in the whole series rib cage and crucifix trap and some werent as good pig juice trap freezer trap even if you have a strong stomach i guarantee you will squirm at a few parts in this movie the other major problem i had about this movie was the twists towards the end the saw movies are known for their surprising twists but in this one it was just twist after twist and simply it was just plain confusing when the credits rolled my friend asked me what just happened and im not going to lie i had no idea this movie is good but its definitely not the best in the series as ive been hearing from people good gore good traps thats about it,cruel
ok now  yesterday i was at this movie and i thought that this would be a great and scary movie  well it was great but it wasnt scary  well when i watched this movie first we watched second part then third  second part was more exiting than 3  well didnt see 1 part of it  but i need to see  the very good thing was that i really liked it was that the 3 part beginning was the 2 ending you know what i mean   there was only one part when i got scared it was when sound was very loud   lame part was when the doctor drilled his scull  that was really stupid for me  and that women witch was saws well like student  wore mask like pigs thats was kinda funny  and when the judge was in the pit wit pig guts  ok thats all i want to say about this movie sorry for bad english,cruel
 directed by darren lynn bousman rated r for strong grisly violence and gore sequences of terror and torture nudity and languageif its halloween it must be saw pretty big words linking a horror movie franchise with a national holiday yet for the past two years saw has proved to be an unadulterated success that in my opinion has saved the exploitationslasher genre but is worthy to hold the titleas with the previous two saw films the plot of is surprisingly deep and dependent on its surprise ending because of this to avoid the risk of spoilers i will try to review it as a whole without delving too deep into specifics basically picks up right where the second one left off with tobin bell nearing death his assistant amanda shawnee smith continues his legacyfirst off this movie is relentless with a pace akin to that of a 50yard sprint by the first few minutes alone youve already come close to seeing more death than in the entire first film if you preferred s more methodical pacing you may not enjoy to the same extent more similar to in this regard its good for what it is but definitely not for everyoneas part of the hypemachine leading up to is release the creators boasted that it would put the other two to shame in terms of gore without a doubt they did just that this movie is just plain rude even a gorehound like myself cringed at the seriousness of the brutality if youre looking for campy dont look to though and without spoiling it i found it ironic that the most difficult scene to watch wasnt an inventive torture trap but rather a real medical procedure if you feel the need to prepare yourself for i recommend watching a few surgery shows on cable firstfast brutal and questionably entertaining delivers what it promised and then some this movie no matter how popular the franchise is getting continues to stick to the roots of its niche genre and for that i award it with an ending that should feel satisfying to fans of the previous two films breaks all expectations and continues to make this franchise the epitome of the hardcore halloween moviegoing experience,cruel
fans of the first rejoice the third installment in this series ensures that those of us whove hung on for the hellish ride were not disappointedthe movies opening sets the stage for a gorier more inyourface adventure than the previous twois successes are many it manages to twist as the others have done so well several emotional stories together around the iron rod of grisly death it succeeds yet again in tossing the viewer around the canvas of the film leaving them up to the closing quarter of an hour mostly clueless thoroughly disturbed and oddly satisfied its biggest accomplishment may be that very end however once everything has come to the surface the movie turns itself upside down leads into some shocking discoveries and leaves the viewer with a pleasant haunting sensation for those members of the audience who pride themselves on being able to figure things out stop trying so hard will slip around your defenses and deliver an unexpected twistthe amount of gore and violence is unnecessary and draws away from the film at points the operation comes to mind understanding that this is a violent film going in i found myself disturbed and removed from the plot in places a few of the challenges were more trivial than in the past the scene with the vat stands out a final more mild disappointment was the acting macfaydens portrayal of jeff was bland lifeless and unrealistic at times the films dialogue was predictable and dry at times but regained its footing in key places to keep the viewer mostly immersedthat being said fans of the first two will enjoy themselves immensely with this one those not too eager to continue on after saws i or ii may find themselves uncomfortable and out of place and may want to wait for a video releasefeelings aside is an enjoyable way to spend an evening 7410,cruel
we all know that every continuation of the movie is a lot worse than its prequels its time to forget about that traps are so well considered and thoughtover even more than they were in the first two saws and blood oh yes its everywhere i guess that leigh whannell wasnt lying after all but some scenes are so brutal and disturbing that they make a person wonder if they forgot about the meaning of the story it would be completely impossible to save oneself from some of those traps just like if the chosen ones didnt even get a chance to survive and this smells like a murder but also mentions that he despises murderers hmm maybe hes got a bigger plan some plan of whom we didnt even dream of see and youll find outi recommend this movie only to those who are hard core fans of saw and others can simply forget about it you just wont handle the tempo910 excellent,cruel
the signature for the saw series is to kill off characters in creative agonizing ways and to mix it all up with sharp wit and dark contrasting atmosphere delivers just that and goes out of the way to please fans of its predecessorswhile entertaining bloody and gory as a good horror film should it does move rather slowly almost like a television episode extended for a feature film it doesnt help that while its a saw movie and the red stuff is in nearly every shot it includes several clichsdull moments that being in comparison in what the movie could be it fails in that department mainly because the film focuses on the continuity of tobin bell and amanda shawnee smith the former not at 100 for storyline reasons and not performance and latter though does a great job at filling the screen with an aura of desperation and hate which more than anything else in the film makes you believe youre watching sawbut buying the ticket for iii i know the intelligence of the film was second on my mind how these people were going to bite the dust was top priority the cameraediting may have been too jumpy for some to see anything but its there in full force hands down more violent and hardhitting than the first two entries it constantly garners that god im glad im not himher or sucks to be you feelingfor storyline purposes it barely passes but does pass for a gap between 12 and the inevitable 4 if youre wondering whether or not to see it go and see it its a cool film if nothing else and it might prove inspiration into choosing a career in surgery,cruel
my summary pretty much speaks for itself the movie is good enough for horror fare but its not great the main flaw is that it tries too hardthe first saw had a great twist ending  so great that even if you t coming it still worked the sequel while decent seemed to have only two goals be more sadistic than the first and try to have an even more shocking twist the third installment was obviously made with similar goals in mind unfortunately the big twist just isnt sure the games are more sadistic this time around but they are just more of the same that we have seen in recent films saw hostel chainsaw the beginning etci enjoyed the movie but i felt there was too much time spent revisiting the first two films not just revisiting but rewriting i wont give specific details here because i dont want to spoil it for anyone but when you see it youll understand the revisiting and rewriting of the earlier films works as far as the storyline goes  that is nothing shown in this film is unbelievable or inconsistent with the first two films  it just seemed unnecessary to methe film as a whole worked well and it was a fitting chapter for the series but i dont think it benefited from the approach the screenwriters took however if you just want to see some great sadistic scenes in the saw style and are willing to take it at face value i think youll enjoy it,cruel
ive been waiting to see this movie since i left the theatre of the second saw weve all waited patiently for this and its finally here you could say i got my moneys worth but i wanted moreyes it lived up to the original expectations of the first two saws and im happy with that you will get most of what you expect or want from this movie if you compare it to the first two after seeing it i now wonder what they could do more if they continue production of this series all those ideas of how to torture people must be hard to think of to make the audience cringe and creep as they watch so it cant be that easy what i truly wanted was a return of dr gordon that would be a good highlight but unfortunately they left him out and put other twists into iti mainly expected a twist and yes we got it it was a good one in fact the characters blended to the style of writing and screenplay so that helped the movie a lot i was also glad that there was more games in this movie than where it was basically one big game this one had a few random ones and then one big one that set the mood for another it went back to basics by telling unfinished business in the first two saws and we all needed that a refresher can help us get into the movie better they had a few of those and that helped set the moodi was really happy to finally watch this movie and i will buy it to complete my collection of saws someday no sequel of saw will live up to it and we shouldnt expect it to since it was new at that time anything from here on out will be like the original and thats fine i will still watch them but i wont love them as much as the first,cruel
started out with a great scene it was gory and it made me flinch from there it went uphill until the endthis movie was the most gruesome gory and gross of all three of them i didnt like the twist ending i thought that it was unnecessarymany times during the movie you flinched squirmed screamed or covered your eyes it was one of the most gory movies that have ever been madeso overall it was a good movie if you are fans of the first two you will most likely like this movie if you didnt like the first two i would definitely say to not see this,cruel
relies highly on the games played in numbers one and two with killer stationed in a bed throughout the entire movie speaking words of wisdom to his sidekick amandatakes to kidnapping a doctor who once treated him her mission to keep him alive as long as it takes jeff angus macfayden to complete a game of his own the only problem is if doctor lyn bahar soomekh fails to keep jign the land of the living a device around her neck will explode ending her life as well racing against the clock and with the ever watchful eye of amanda baring on her every action life couldnt be more horrid for the poor doctor during this the audience are shown many delightful new traps conjured by designed on inflicting painthe acting from the tobin bell jigs sound and very professional shawnee smith amanda annoyed me throughout but you begin to settle with her towards the end missing the acting ability of donnie whalberg as a back up apart from in a small number of flashbacks isnt one for the best actor in a leading role award but thats not really why we watch saw moviesin terms of twists there is one big twist at the end which will make you think and consider for some time after however the absence of the saw theme tune which worked brilliantly in one and two is missed however you can hear it in the new denzel movie deja vua must watch for any saw fan but if you want a taste of saw go with saw one 610,cruel
managed to check out a free screening of tonight with some friends to tell u the truth it made me dry heave at least 2 or 3 times it was really really disgusting im probably as big a gorehound as the next horror fan but i really havent seen a horror movie thats made me want to actually puke in quite awhile so i was quite impressed im not a huge fan of the saw series by any means in fact i thought was garbage to tell u the truth and the fact that theyd keep pumping out sequels like that in such a short time frame showed they were incredibly eager to cash off on the basic conceptpremise that made the first one so successful however at least they did it in a very excessive over the top manner that pretty much pays off this was definitely the most brutal and intense of the seriesand while they sort of have to push the envelope in that regard since its probably the last it also ties in a lot characterwise with new protg we learn of in whose methodsdeath traps contrast theyre much more brutal and harder to escape with that of her teachers in a very important way thatwell i dont want to give too much awaya few flaws in the film of course one downright terrible actress who plays a lead role as this doctor but the stylistic low grade tool music videoesquire look of the film masks most of the bad acting although i guess the most important aspect of acting in a film like s selling the pain and torture thats being delivered and at least that much is achieved the pacing was a bit unbalanced at timesthey go from like death trap to death trap to death trap without anything juxtaposed between those scenes until about midway through the movie when they slowly set up the roster of characters and back story etca pretty effective horror film if something like hostel disappointed you as it did me and youre looking for something that pushes the bar in mainstream american horror at least a tad bit more than u thought that film would you might get what youre looking for here,cruel

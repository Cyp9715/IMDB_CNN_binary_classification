i was lucky enough to see this masterpiece at frightfest this yearpascale laugiers worried about this movie he was apologising to people who despised it he was profusely thanking the people who liked it he is the modern day equivalent of victor frankenstein he knows that he has created a monster and doesnt really know how to deal with it now that its being released upon the worldtruly is a monster its a ground breaking brave stunning brutal  moving piece of work that is guaranteed to divide audiences everywhere it gets the chance to play even at a genre event like frightfest the audience reaction ranged from loved it to hated it to people actually going outside of the cinema to be physically sick really for me it was the highlight of the festival and i absolutely loved it but i dont believe its a movie that anybody will truly enjoyas others have already given away too much of the story i wont bother with a synopsis as is definitely a dish best served cold not knowing what to expect makes this a refreshingly shocking piece of celluloid that will hopefully astound you with its gutsy originality written by the director during a fit of depression that he did not elaborate on in the qa it is an almost schizophrenic movie with two distinct halves and coda of such ambiguity that it is possible to view it as nihilistic or strangely hopeful its beautifully shot really well paced and contains outstanding performances from the two female leadsthis movie is inevitably going to be compared to hostel and other movies in the horribly monickered tortureporn genre and that is a genuine mistake bears more resemblance to movies like nacho cerdas aftermath as there is nothing here that is designed to be titillating the true horror lies in the the clinical detachment of the antagonists in the end despite all the on screen violence and there are some truly brutal scenes on display here in the movies second act the prevaling reaction that this movie elicited in me was not one of revulsion but one of true sadness really is a truly brilliant surprisingly moving film and one that will remain in my mind jostling for attention with my other thoughts for a very long time to come thankyou pascale laugier for creating a monster that i love,cruel
what an experience im a big horror fan and am happy watching and enjoying popcorn slasher movies for what they are but really the genre is crying out for more pictures that truly assault the sensesthe french are particularly adept at painting bleak unforgiving landscapes as well as thrusting you right into the action but rarely have i experienced anything quite so memorable as comparisons will and have been drawn with hostel saw hellraiser and others but this is really rather misleading further comparisons have been drawn with inside frontiers funny games etc and while slightly more credible in that atmosphere and psychology play a far greater part none come close to id challenge anyone not to be affected by this movie its gory but you wont laugh its shocking but you wont be able to look away 24 hours later its still running through my mind and if i see a better horror movie than this this year ill be truly amazedas much as id love to write more this is most certainly a film you should watch knowing as little as possible suffice to say the acting cinematography score atmosphere and unbridled tension combine to create one of the most engaging films in this genre of the last two decadeswatch it recommend it it wont be easy and lets hope gets the credit it deserves,cruel
french horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now first there was haute tension then a lintrieur and newest in line is hyped up to take it all a little further and it did it definitely did its just that it doesnt belong in the same list as the films mentioned before goes way beyondthose expecting another fun bloody gory insane horror flick can just up and leave because isnt like that while it borrows the horror from films like a lintrieur and haute tension the tone and effect of the film is much closer to irrversible or better yet grandrieuxs la vie nouvelleall these films belong to the french extreme wave a rather broad line of films of different backgrounds and themes but all bearing an unrelentless level of extremity and stands proudly at the top of that list even though laugier himself seems a little hesitant to claim all credits for his filmstarts off like youd expect a bleak raw and pitch black horror flick to start off only minutes into the film bodies start flying and guts is spilled royally strangely though theres no joy limbs are flying enjoyment to be found the presentation is cold the characters are emotionally wrangled the tension is harsh lucie the main characters and victim of a year long torture plan evokes the sympathy of the viewer and plays it out incredibly wellthe first half of the film keeps balancing on borderline horror keeping its crude and dark exterior but never crossing any boundaries a grudgelike ghost in added to the film but laugier stays close to the drama and never allows the film to become a mere horror flick things take a turn for the worse around halfway through where the torture theme of the film is given even more power as anna lucies guardian discovers the truth about the torturekidnap story of the pastfrom that moment on the film becomes really uncomfortable to watch and crosses over to the realm of no and grandrieux we are witness of cold and painful torture scenes driven to very unpleasant extremes nearing the end the film follows the methods of the people who torture which are based on repetition and endurance making it all the harder to sit throughin a rather surprising move this film was released in theaters in belgium by one of the most prestigious labels here the reason for that is laid bare in the second half of the film rather that simply serve a story of horror and torture laugier digs deeper into the human mind the idea behind is not futile nor easily forgotten theres a whole point to the film elevating is above all its reference points saw and hostel  sadly enoughis in a whole different league and is everything a film like funny games should have been a definite assault to the gut extremely graphic and to the point without ever flinching or resolving to silly tricks to get a point across its a film only a director with love for the genre could make remember that mr haneke after two pointless attempts and laugier doesnt let downvisually the film is well shot though nothing out of the ordinary the makeup on the other hand deserves some praise same as the leading ladies who play their parts with conviction and depth at one point anna even shows a creepy resemblance to falconetti in jeanne darc  essential to the film and certainly not an easy taskdont watch to get a little horror kick or to indulge in silly gorefests this film will not deliver the fun thrills of regular horror movies on the contrary its a bleak depressive but all the more impressive look in the darker depths of the human condition it will leave you cringing in your seat and it will make you want to look away and it does so without ever numbing you downone of the most impressive films ive seen this year a definite favorite and one thatll receive my further support through a dvd purchase though i have no idea when or if ill watch it again laugier uses every bit of skill he has to make as painful as possible and reaches further than any other has a very solid 4550 though no recommendation from my side definitely not a film for everyone,cruel
dont listen to the poor reviews on here  this is actually a masterpiece in horror but its very difficult to watch its dark bleak and incredibly disturbing and despite this being one of the best films ive seen i could never watch it again,cruel
this film is as terrifying as anything ever released it takes events from modern headlines and carries them to horrible but utterly believable extremes performances photography editing score sound design direction are all spot on i live in a neighborhood where people literally get stabbed in the street and this film scared the hell out of me it creates a tension that is almost unbearable and then it breaks your heart the genius of this film is the degree to which you empathize and grow to love the protagonists i was skeptical when i was told about how people supposedly fainted in the theater when they saw it after watching this film i absolutely believe it there is one scene in particular that made me dizzydont watch it alone and dont watch it if you think horror films are supposed to make you laugh this film will make you cry,cruel
the film was introduced by the films writer director pascal laugier at this years frightfest in london the organisers referred to the film as the film they most wanted of the 28 shown at the festival it was easy to see why of all the films i saw at this years frightfest was not my favourite but without a doubt it is the one that plays on my mind the most the film has been compared to both hostel and hellraiser but i think it has a lot more substance than both of those films the central performances are top notch and jessie pham as the young lucie is very convincing completely holding your attention so why only 7 out of 10 as well made as this film is the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing i wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did it is not a film that is to be enjoyed it is not the escapism that you may be looking for the first act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously it is the second act though that is the more disturbing the viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end this is a mustsee movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle,cruel
having missed the opportunity to catch this at the midnight madness showing in tiff08 i decided to go against all stated horror movie rules and watched this today around midday at a complex in downtown toronto its difficult to know what to say about this movie really like a birth or a death you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions what i will say is that as a committed horror freak rare is the occasion when i tense up and watch a film contorted somehow trying to protect myself from what im putting myself through it contains enough tough to see horrorgore to satisfy the bloodhounds though it doesnt feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it thankfully and then  if you can watch it and many couldnt  transcends the genre totally with a jawdropping final act which if youre interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully the result can be breathtaking absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an xcertificate in france kicking up an almighty stink in the process  well you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear with that in mind i would recommend as a film of incredible tension harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery unsurprisingly the director namechecked dario argento during the qa as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two filmmakers i loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good bad or indifferent and i really cant imagine a neutral response i hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time,cruel
i wonder why so many compare this to movies like hostel there was only one movie coming up my mind after having seen this one clive barkers hellraiser and other works from himother comparisons ok lets compare this to high tension yes we get realism but then there are too many movies recently that do nothing but hide their lack of spirit and story in the end the audience is left alone without a believable motivation for what happenedis different its scary and disturbing its painful to watch and still there is some kind of relief you may separate that movie into three segments and the first two would make a whole movie on their own what happens then takes the story to whole new level and the audience to a whole new perspective with a cynical bang in the endi liked it,cruel
is one of the creepiest violent and disturbing movies ive seen in a good while it may just be that it plays on several fears of mine but i found to be one of the hardest movies for me to sit throughi think one of the most important aspects of the movie is its abundance of violence and gore obviously its not the only thing that makes the movie terrifying but seeing such realistic depictions of cutting beating and mutilation really leave one hell of an impactthe plot of may not be the best but the way its told is enough that while watching the movie it feels like a much better story than if someone were to sit down and explain it more than half the movie has no dialogue whatsoever for up to 10 minutes at a time which allows the viewer to interpret most of it however they wanti cant really comment on the acting as its a foreign film but i can say that the music and sound design are absolutely perfect even if some of the cinematography leaves something to be desired at timesfans of horror are probably going to enjoy but i would have a really hard time recommending it to anyone outside of that demographic,cruel
not knowing what to expect and prejudice towards french films had me wondering if this was worth my precious time well it delivered for me movies have to meet 3 criteria1 dont let figure out the endingthis movie had me fooled but never confused 2 do something to keep me watchingthere were times when i was repulsed and disgusted by this movie but couldnt stop watching it 3 evoke a emotional responsethere wasnt a moment in this movie where i wasnt feeling anxious or disturbedthis was a great movie and i would recommend everyone watches it but it should come with an extreme warning this movie was not scary it was disturbing and at time youll feel ashamed of yourself for watching it but in the end youll be glad you did,cruel
i too saw this at frightfest with an audience full of horror fans unlike all the other films of the festival there were no cheers when characters were bloodily dispatched equally there was no unintentionally funny dialogue to snigger at jack bauer vs the exorcist anyonewhat did have was a suggestion of the emotional horrors rather than simply the physical endured by someone who has been tortured that was the first half of the film the second half shifted plotwise and also provided us with a motivation however twisted for the abuse  far more creepy than simply entertainment for the sick as with hosteldespite its bleakness i came out feeling uplifted and evidently this was the directors intention it could have been purely because this was the only film over the course of the weekend that had any intellectual aspirations but it did succeed in eliciting strong reactions from the hardened horror audience both positive and negativethe nearest i can compare this too is irreversible but unlike gasper nos film i do feel that i can stomach another viewing of and the sooner the better,cruel
making its stateside debut pascal laugiers was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films however is not like a saw or hostel in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity its demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research it reminded me of a brochure that i received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption if that is a brochure youd rather not digest before dinner is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental pascal laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel the last stop to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals predators or prey it a place so dark you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid all the saw or hostel or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on why because they french know their cinema business like no other they leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in america filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay  lesbian festival alike it covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing i would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs,cruel
i just got back from the midnight screening at tiff with a typical midnight madness audience that i would characterize as easy to please but difficult to impress this film impressed us as it was clearly a cut above so to speak the average genre film the first act takes recent french horror films like high tension inside and frontieres and shoves them into a hyperviolent blender so far so good the second far more emotionally grisly act elevates the cinematic experience to almost artfilm heights with sadly realistic parallels to our current insane world situation oh there was a vomiting patron here toothe director was there along with the two lead actresses who are looking much better now im glad to say he told us that the film has secured distribution in 40 frenchspeaking countries but that he hopes it will be viewed elsewhere on dvd only to ensure that we see it uncut someone asked a question that referenced michael hanekes funny games i didnt quite hear the whole question as the person was well back in the theater but it really set m laugier off  he denounced fg as shit and proclaimed his film the antifunny games he was fine with the hour and a half brutalization of an innocent family but felt strongly that it didnt have a sufficient point to make or justification for the violence  it just ends im not sure i feel that way about fg but it was interesting to hear his opinion its hard to discuss how backs up its pretension to be superior without spoiling it however to echo another comment youll have to see for yourself enjoy not,cruel
first of all this movie is sick really sick it is disgusting to watch it from the disturbing beginning to the relieving ending was painful and i think the writerdirector needs some serious counseling but its also a stunning piece of art the fundamental questions are what does the writerdirector want to express with this movie what are his intentions and does anyone need a movie that shows us every detail of ruthless slaughter torture skinning beating and killingthe answer is i am still not sure but this is perhaps the reason why this movie is a piece of art not often watched in todays cinema this movie is thoughtprovoking it doesnt send you home with a few nice laughs a seethrough story and it isnt entertainmentthis movie only cares for the victims this is why i think that the violence depicted is necessary it doesnt make you numb it even sharpens your sensitivity and you suffer with the victims while watching ithere in germany last week a man was beaten to death in the subway by two teenagers he came to help some kids that were molested by the two teenagers i think a movie like could show those sickos what they do to their victims this is why i think that eg kill bill could be more dangerous than tarantinos movies which i also adore always follow the bad guys and show them as heroes while the victims die offscreen they show that violence is cool and funny shows that violence is disgusting and sick,cruel
it seems like every year you get a new french movie that the horror community talks anxious about mainly because of its boundary breaking shocks after last years direct hit to the head a linterior and the to me rather weak frontieres this year its which is supposed to raise the bar another bit and i start to wonder what makes the french go that berserk and over the top latelyforsure is different and delivers some memorable scenes punched in your memory so it sure is another sign of eurohorror taking the top the movie starts of with a child fleeing its prison and running frightened from years of abuse into freedom lucie is picked up her prison is found but she doesnt talk about what happened and her torturers are never found this is where the first part of the movie starts which is kind of divided into subplots lucie is shown growing up in a foster home making friends with anna another foster child lucie doesnt talk to anyone about what happened she is haunted by fears sees demons and only seems to connect to anna the second part is a harsh time jump to 15 years later a seemingly happy family is having a saturday breakfast the door rings and lucie takes them out with a shotgun she has identified her torturers from a newspaper photo and came for revenge and closure when cleaning up the mess with anna lucie sees a demon like girl following her through the house and cutting her with a knife after some creepy ghost scares it turns out its just her imagination of girl she left behind when fleeing as a child anna doesnt seem to believe all the story lucie told her because we soon see the cuttings are self inflicted and only lucie sees the girl as a manifestation of her schizophrenia which ends in her finally slicing her own throat part three begins where anna is left alone in the house with her dead friend not sure what happened and how to handle the situation by a pretty stupid turn of events she finds a secret door to an underground dungeon and it soon becomes evident that lucies depictions of her torture were true anna searches through the dungeons and soon finds the girl lucie left behind shackled and blindfolded she tries to help her and remove the blindfold which is bolted to her head but the girl like lucie soon tries to kill herself part four and the finale begins so there is some majors spoilers ahead the girl runs wild through the house and is suddenly shot by a group of strangers who reveal the story asick religious group believes that a suffering person can see beyond death in their final stage of martyrdom and reveal the secrets to life and death now anna relives what lucie suffered and is brought to the dungeon from here on a seemingly endless part shows her being fed being beaten having her hair shaved and all this in an endless repetition until she breaks apart this is not gory rather unpleasant in its repetitive inhumanity to make a long story short anna falls apart talking to her dead friend julie who tells her to give herself up to stop the suffering and when she does the final stage awaits in which anna is skinned until she finally enters martyrdom depicted as a trip hallucinogenic light at the end of the tunnel sequence she whispers her experience into the old ladys ear and the sick cult soon gathers to witness its martyr and the old ladies testimony unfortunately we never hear it but can rather imagine when the old lady puts a gun in her mouth the endi am very ambivalent with this movie it is a nice mixture of a drama especially the childhood part and lucies suicide with classic horrorghost scare and shock elements and big load of torture porn thrown in at the end blended in with some religious and metaphysical hints anna becomes a kind of jesus christ and the image of a skinned girl looking to heaven sure is a logical step in depicting a person in total suffering equal to the crucifixion and to my understanding equally sick just visually more direct the four parts are all told in a very different style  its like drama ghosthorror a little dungeon exploring and darkness some superficial explaining torture and some more drama sure is an interesting movie but it has some pretty stretched passage if people leave the cinema its because they cant take another five minutes of seeing a girl beaten either because its unsettling or just plain idiotic and voyeuristic i sure get the meaning in showing anna fall apart but i think this and the skinning which is not even shown is what people are shocked about the interweaving of the movie parts was kind of forced which put me off why the hell do they stay in the house how could the children of the family not know about a high tech torture dungeon under their living room or did they why does anna find the dungeon and go in there on her own and if the cult is so eager to find the answer why is there just one girl although the dungeon looks like an industrial complex and what about that cult anywayits hard to compare the movie to anything else most comparisons are about the movies being all french seeking for new boundaries and the main characters being girls but they are all different and where a linterior mixes thriller and splatterelements rather mixes horror and dramaelements maybe the tear squeezing mixing with horror scares is what shocks people strange thing is to me the scenes of lucie fleeing as a child was one of the most shocking and i even knew them from the trailer,cruel
to avoid fainting keep repeating  its only a moviebut this time it is for reali will start off by saying that is probably the most shocking horror film in a very long time the concept of a revengeflick upgraded to extremesthe french have been known for making extremely violent flicks over the past few years and this time it was pascal laugiers turn to provide us with a movie that is meant to be more shocking than entertaining the reason why horror movies were made back in the seventies and indeed is an unapologetic throwback to the seventieshorror flicks the likes of the last house on the left and the texas chainsaw massacre come to mind  but laugier uses the methods he can use and makes it even more shocking than these films areapart from being the most shocking and disturbing horror movie in this long time  were the aforementioned titles or cannibal holocaust were just very disturbingthis film is also very scary and creepy  i can stomach a lot but at some parts in this movie i really was creeped out and scared to death this is an extremely scary movie the script is absolutely fantastic  it manages to combine 34 different happenings into one movie and contains several nods to other recent horrorworks or to the classics without falling into plagiarism then we also have the direction of pascal laugier it isnt anything we havent seen before but he certainly is a man who knows how to build up and it shows during a lot of the scenes where he manages to keep the audience very tense and frightened he is a man who takes a very poetic approach to the visuals and really some of the visuals are very beautiful just like xavier gens did with frontires laugier manages to give his film a very polished look while still keeping it dirty the whole movie has some sort of atmosphere of dread just like hoopers tcm had yes you have read it is a very atmospheric movie the acting is very credible especially from the two main actresses i was sold and then theres the gore  laugier didnt want to make a bloodfestwell it turned out to be some sort of a gorepic but obvious it wasnt the directors main target the gore is not the kind of gore the audience likes to see this isnt a film where you really are waiting for the next victim to be bloodily dispatched the violence in this film is much worse than anything that is shown in movies like hostelwrong turn 2 it isnt as gory there are no geysers of blood and maybe this isnt real gore gore is supposed to be fun this is much worse  it is realistic violence graphic as all hell and incredibly difficult to stomach keep in mind that this isnt a happygoslashing slasherfilm but i will say there are some really disgusting scenes which are hard to stomach even for the real gorehounds like myself due to the way the violence is portrayed compliments for laugier to create a film that really does shock us with its explicit violence just like noes irreversible didthe soundtrack also is worth mentioning it is experimental but it really works it is at times a very melancholic type of soundtrack but very memorable i wont spoil anything for you but i will tell you something about the end of the movie making it through the last 20 minutes of is a tough task this part of the movie is extremely sad but ends up being very poetic and very beautiful the very end of the movie is almost cynical without becoming comedic the movies stays true to its dark roots and will leave you saddened that being said people looking for an entertaining slasherfilm will be very disappointed but people looking for a film that will be remembered for a very long time and that will be talked about like they still talk about some of the shocking classics should give this movie a try like somebody already mentioned this movie veers closer to irreversible than to lets say inside or haute tension to which it has been compared and i wonder what the mpaa would make of this again not for the faint of heart ,cruel
you just cant look away from this monstrosity of a film i wont go into full plot details because so many comments here already contain the full plot i can give a quick condensed version here there be spoilerslucie escapes from a cult that was torturing her as a child she has to leave behind another girl and becomes haunted by the vision of that girl fifteen years later lucie sees a newspaper photo of the couple who tortured her she goes to their house and kills the entire family she calls her best friend anna to come and help her anna gets there and has doubts as to whether this was the right family lucie kills herselfafter lucie dies anna discovers a hidden section of the house and she discovers the girl lucie left behind all those years ago and the girl is still alive but so badly tortured she is beyond real helpcult members arrive and kill the tortured girl they take anna and then subject her to the same tortures that lucie and the other girl suffered from mostly its scenes of this man beating her very badly and shes chained up a lot it gets really nasty there is no fun watching this its very much like torture scenes from hostelfinally they skin anna alive and she has what they think is a divine vision which is what they were after she tells the head of the cult the vision we never hear what anna says the head of the cult commits suicide end of movieit sucked first of all this is not a real horror film its a whole other genre it is torture porn no matter what fanboyz keep claiming theres a big difference between a horror film that has scary monsters and such that we have fun with and something like this which just goes to extremes and shows violence just to really show a lot of violencei really dont like this new trend in films and the french seem to be running with it now if you like regular horror movies i dont think you will like this movie if you are into hostel type films youll like itto me this film just promoted violence and torture of women and it was clearly stated in the film that only women did well as being victims i didnt like this movie at all,cruel
as some have said you either love this film or you hate it the films extremely disturbing torture and violence serves no purpose other than to make the viewer cringe for its victims while this may be the goal of a typical horror film this film takes large strides to make the torture something realistic something that could really happen and therefore all the more harrowing once the audience understands this it expects something more than just typical slasher fare  it expects something deeper and thought provoking it expects the film to use the torture to make a point unfortunately it never doesthe first half of the film culminates in an unoriginal reveal that the viewer expects long before it is made the first half sets up the second half which while making use of a truly terrifying basement torture chamber goes through torture scene after scene in effort to make the viewer feel the pain of its victim having seen that real life torture chambers like this exist the notion is truly frightening however the point of these scenes is made after three of them and the remainder become unenduringly repetitive pushing the film into overkill  to the point the viewer is so disturbed she no longer wants to watch i fast forwarded through the second 12 of these scenes and hung on through the remainder of the film only because i knew the end was near and i was expecting something huge to make sense of everything while the film succeeds in repulsing the viewer with the depravity of humanity and the horror the victims endure the film fails to use this to any admirable advantage one expects more from a film that goes to pains to make the suffering so realistic and that is the problem the film is not a popcorn slasher film one which the viewer goes to for a lighthearted scare but which is ultimately an unrealistic horror film rather the film conjures up feelings of discomfort and unease because what is happening could really happen i disagree that the film makers were doing this just to put depravity on the screen i think they had a real goal of conveying some deep concept or revealing something thoughtprovoking behind the debaucheryunfortunately we learn all the depravity and suffering were the result of an unclear scientific desire of the wealthy to learn what happens after death the audience is probably supposed to feel some sort of horror or discomfort at this but the ending is not clearly developed and fails to plant enough seeds for thought after the film is over thus all that came before the ending makes no sense and to put the torture on screen without making a good point causes the viewer to question its purpose,cruel
really this film adds nothing valuable the real philosophical issue could have been presented in less than ten minutes the rest of it is nothing but torturepron this means that torture suffering and confusion is the main point of the film the only thing in doubt is whether the philosophical issue has been added to pretend like its a real movie or if it was added intentionally to try and get away with itwatch it if you are one of those sickos who enjoy watching helpless suffering but you might spend your time and money better at a therapistsor watch it with some friends take note of who seems to enjoy watching it and never call them again,cruel
i write my reviews based on two factors how much i enjoyed watching the movie and how much i enjoy thinking back about it this movie i dont want to think back tothis was well produced well acted and the story is engaging but the content is just too horrific i sat though saw and hostel they were ok this i found really disturbing i fast forwarded at one point and was privy to watching some poor devil receive a year long kickin condensed into 6 minutes as i am not a sado masachist i found these protracted scenes not only disturbing but dulli like horror i like to be scared and when the lights come up think wow glad that wasnt me getting chopped up i feel like i am carrying this around with meif you like really gruesome stuff note the actual gore isnt that bad then go for it youll love this but if you want to keep a handle on your humanity then stay blissfully unaware of this movie,cruel
this is probably the worst thing ive ever seen i meanreally ok fine you put out a movie that is gratuitously violent and highly disturbing but thats really all it is not much real horror at all besides the slight horror i felt when i looked at the time of the movie and saw that i still had a half hour lefthalf the time this isnt even really gross so much as just impossibly annoying and unpleasant so what we get an hour of crap with this psychotic lesbian named lucie tormenting her caring nurturing friend who is quite visibly torn between her loyalty and the fact that i dont know lucie just murdered a whole house of people how stupid do you have to be to even think about this seriously ditch her now and run for your life then another half hour of the poor innocent best friend girl locked in a basement being beaten forcefed and finally fcking skinned alive before an uninspired and uncreative ending that left me feeling empty and impartial to any of the characters or meanings that were attempted to be conveyed here i guess the best part of the movie is the first part because it is genuinely pretty suspenseful and tense but it drags on for waaaay too long and loses whatever suspense it was building up to replacing it instead withwell annoyance at the lucie character reallythe rest is just dung can anyone explain how that family went so long without the kids finding out about the huge underground torture chamber their parents had in the basement surely there must have been at least one day where one of them was home sick from school and must have gotten the gist that something was awry thats a plot hole that needs tending to immediatelythe religious and nazi implications here as vague and offkilter as they may be are disturbing and highly objectionable and bring down any enjoyment one could ever derive from this mediocre piece of crap not only do they shave the girls head in the third act during her torture they also bury the bodies of the dead unceremoniously in a giant holegee does that sound familiar at all to youits really one thing to watch a movie about a teenage girl holding a rapist and pedophile hostage and threatening to castrate him and its one thing to watch a movie where a psychotic rejected lesbian wreaks havoc on her unsuspecting lovers family with a chainsaw but a movie like thisit goes too far to the point where it doesnt matter its like this movie had to have a neon light over its head flashing look at me im sick and twisted you know as if the director didnt have any ideas of his own so he had to resort to the most stock and clichd offensive things in the book the other stuff is there for a reason for some purpose that is general and unbiased but this doesnt work it inspires nothing in the viewer but the question of whether or not he or she should really be watching the movie thus depriving and desensitizing said viewer of the ultimate horror at the ending  not a very good ployand lets talk about meanings here too why not this movie is supposedly deep and meaningful but really its just retarded the ending sucks completely contrived and hollow ooh lets be all philosophical and spiritual that justifies the hour and a half of ridiculous torture pornography terrible directing and the unbornrejected ghost scenes we stuck in there before i also really love how they call this movie because a martyr was always a poor screaming skinny french girl who was forced to be where she was rather than choosing it rightgod this sucks just forget this trash ever existed it isnt scary it isnt meaningful and it isnt compelling even one bit no disgust no horror just a quiet disapproving shake of the head and a move of the hand towards the remote to turn it off it doesnt inspire horror or disgust it just inspires anger and annoyance and if thats what this director wanted to do offend then he succeeded i hate this movie i hate the director i hate the studio that produced it i hate anyone who would find pleasure in watching it it is the lowest form of cinematic dung possible there is nothing worse there has never been anything worse unspeakably wholly unwatchable,cruel
just another lame excuse for makeup artist to show off their skills in showing the human body ripped to shreds movie plot  lol give me a breakuhlets see to torture girls to the brink of death to find out whats on the other side  if that was the intent why not just ask anyone with cancer on their death bed you morons movies like this continue to give true horror movies a bad name and i will go out of my way to slam them every chance i can the french seem to think the more blood and gore you show the more horror fans will appreciate it and just like last years movie inside 90 percent of real horror movie fans in the world will never even want to see this piece of dribble  just fanboys on the internet will squeal in their immature delight i fought in a war where i saw bloody sites so thats not what i find offensive here its the fact that some people think seeing senseless human bloody carnage is actually entertainment,cruel
i attended the midnight madness screening of at the 33rd toronto international film festival tiffthe first hour and a bit of was quite effective in delivering unsettling imagery and sounds elements of child abuse is something that is certainly unnerving so its subtext in the film added to the creepiness factor the gore had its place it wasnt presented just for the sake of gore in of itself special makeup effects artist benot lestang who passed away several weeks ago as noted by director pascal laugier during the qa session after the screening did a remarkable job to showing the brutal effects of violent physical injuries the audience reaction is typical mm stuff audible gasps rolls of nervous laughter loud and appreciative applause to truly gruesome scenes and other good stuffthe last thirty minutes of the film held the audience in almost complete silence the lack of any crowd reaction aside from the revelation of what happened to anna in her final stage was due to the harrowing endurance test they and anna played by morjana alaoui went through the film turned from a highly engaging gore flick into a sad and rather depressing reflection of human sufferingi had a strong reaction to the film that lead me to appreciate it on its dramatic and production levels the filmmakers and actresses obviously had a lot of trust among themselves to deliver this film after the screening pascal laugier morjana alaoui and mylne jamano went up onstage to answer questions from mm programme director colin geddes and several members of the audience pascal fielded most of the questions while morjana and mylne nervously chimed in with their responses mainly because neither of them speak english natively nor are they accustomed being infront of such a massive crowd of people the qa session did get a bit awkward because some killjoy decided to challenge pascal on why he made as to the context in which was first conceived pascal mentioned he is going through deeply personal issues which unsurprisingly translated themselves quite graphically into im pretty sure is too intense for the general public so dont expect a wide theatrical release of the film i could go on much further but that would necessitate revealing plot points and specific scenes,cruel
as many reviews have pointed out before me this is a polarising movie you either absorb its messages as high art and embrace its philosophies with a willing mind or if youre like me it will leave you hollow from a lack of resolution at which point all thats left is an exercise in gratuitousnessid like to preface my damning opinion with a comment on what this film did well its vastly superior in production quality and acting than most horror films you could watch thinking of the vast stock of directtodvd cashins it never felt tacky or poorly delivered the twist at the 50 mark was unexpected and felt originalas for what i didnt like well pretty much everything else i felt like this movie was a plodding nihilistic beast something you had to endure rather than enjoy the story was set up well at the beginning but fizzled out as soon as any rationale was attempted to explain the torture im a fan of horrible bleak things but if youre going to put a 30 minute torture scene in a movie you better have a damn good way to put it into some sort of context i got that sinking feeling while i was watching it there was no way this was leading to anything good and i was vindicated when i given some second rate bataillesque philosophy to try and explain away maddening cruelty and try and elevate above all those other movies that delight in gory excessthinking about it this movie made no sense there was no satisfying motive for the acts committed this is really the cusp of the problem i had with the movie why why would the characters torture people for 20 years based on such a flimsy motive and when the head honcho finally found what she was looking for she kills herself why waste the 20 years you believed in it enough to commit horrendous atrocities for 2 decades but you needed confirmation from a delirious dying women to act on your belief this is really what i cant wrap my head around the film gives us an incredibly silly reason to explain why this all happened so the result feels absolutely hollow the explanation the film delivers was completely meaningless to me a philosophy so vague and devoid of logic that you would never care enough to think of it yourself like an idea someone invents while off their breasts on drugs because theyve grossly misinterpreted the real world again what this movie desperately needed was something clever to rationalise its depravity yet all it delivers is a 5 minute afterthought composed of senseless mysticismugh running out of space here ill try to be more succinct other problems i hadit isnt a horror movie horror movies are about atmosphere mystery and tension all the tension dissipates when the movie devolves into a relentless torture fest its misogynistic who honestly wants to watch a fat bald man beat a young women for ages with no context apart from some vague martyr nonsense im misogynistic but this was too much make up and gore effects are pretty bad apart from the flayed effect at the end cellar woman really didnt look convincing enough compared to the stomach churning effects in the saw moviesin summation this isnt just a torture porn movie it is the ultimate torture porn movie i believe someone commented that is isnt like saw because the characters perpetrating these acts were emotionally detached which ironically i think is a problem with the story if youre going to torture someone have the decency to enjoy it however the emotional state of the characters is irrelevant all that matters is the stimulus that provides the titillation and the interpretation of the viewer and of course the stimulus is torture and gore and this film has it in sickening nihilistic abundance saw and hostel take a back seat the gorno king has arrived in all his pointless pretentious gory glory,cruel
is written and directed by pascal laugier it stars morjana alaoui and mylene jampanoithe new french extremity movement had its bar raised considerably by pascal laugiers brutal but thought provoking horror its a film as uncompromising as it is confrontational a picture guaranteed to get a response for better or worse once viewed it simply will not be forgotten the images the twisty narrative thematics and the bloodshed that flows consistently throughout the story laugier and his two brilliant lead actresses assault the senses magnificently sostory is unfurled as a three tiered structure each one devastating but its with the final third where the picture goes up through the stratosphere stopping briefly at the caf weird just to further tickle our craniums some of the violence here is tough to watch and its no surprise to find it was met with the inevitable charges of misogyny yet the culmination of it all puts some perspective on the violence witnessed leading to a strangely profound and moving climaxthe less you know about it going in for the first time the better a strong stomach is required as is an open mind if you have these things then awaiting you is a visceral masterwork one of the finest horror films to have ever come out of france yes its that astonishing 1010,cruel
ive seen a lot of horror movies ones that are real ones that are supernatural old new gory intelligent but usually you cant get that mix in a horror film and have it come out as a masterpiece broke the mold and took all my doubts away no film since the exorcist and jaws has had such intelligence style great script relatable characters and shock value that had all that and worked weve had a few that come close but nothing as to what i just witnessed with i heard a little bit about this film in 2010 and read about it in an article the plot seemed kind of confusing from the way the author wrote about it so i decided to wait on seeing it i have never been so disappointed with myself when it came to deciding to wait on a film i saw this film 4 days ago and still im shaking and cant get it out of my head not to say that everyone will have this experience but is a masterpiece of horror cinema that ive been waiting fora young girl lucie escapes from a factory where she has been imprisoned and physically abused for a lengthy period of time lucie is placed in an orphanage where she is befriended by a young girl named anna anna soon discovers that lucie believes that she is constantly being terrorized by a ghoulish creature a horrible disfigured emaciated woman fifteen years later lucie bursts into a seemingly normal familys home and kills them all with a shotgun lucie calls anna to tell her that she has finally found and killed the people responsible for her childhood abuse upon arriving anna is horrified at the carnage and worries that lucie may have murdered the wrong people but after a vicious attack on lucie from her ghost who turns out was a victim who she left before she escaped the factory when she was a child anna finds out that maybe lucie wasnt wrong and things take a turn from worse to the ultimate hellwhen the films saw and hostel were released they were dubbed as too hard to handle and given the new genre of torture porn i hate that term by way those films are a walk in the park compared to a lot of movies that ive seen to be honest a lot of people are categorizing in the torture porn genre and its ticking me off saw and hostel use the gore and violence as the plot devices doesnt use the violence as a way to just make the audience squirm but instead youre taken into this dark world that you dont want to ever be apart of the performances are just magnificent especially to mylne jampano who plays lucie morjana alaoui plays anna and pulls in a heart wrenching performance the direction the lighting the sets the script i couldnt find any flaws that are not nitpickingi literally feel like ive been strangled with this film it actually made me cry it was so much deeper than what i was expecting im about to give away the ending so please dont read on because no one should know what is going to happen if they havent seen this film yet first off when anna is tortured its unbearable to watch her go through this for days shes force fed some weird unknown food that looks like gruel then some giant man comes in and just beats her nearly to death when shes reached the final stage which is surprising to the people who are doing this to her they skin her alive she lets go and comes back and you find out that the people who did this to her and the others do this because they want to know what happens after death so anna dies but comes back and tells the leader mademoiselle what she saw but in a whisper so the audience cant hear the society comes to the house excited to hear what is beyond death and when asked by a member outside mademoiselles locked door she simply replies keep doubting and shoots herself couldnt have been a more perfect ending because what happens after death should remain a mystery as everyone has their own interpretation is much deeper than i expected i underestimated this film and now its one of the best horror movies i have ever seen in my life as to the remake that is now supposedly in the green light now please see this movie first because i give a lot of remakes a chance but this one already is looking really bad since it was bought by the producers of twilight should be respected and is a true masterpiece1010,cruel
is probably the most extreme movie ever made in france and cannot be compared with any other flick i have seen beforeit was a unique and traumatic experiment to watch it in a theater where half of the audience left before the end while the other half was feeling very uncomfortable it is not for everybody and you can really be upset at times even if you are a basic horror fan as i amthis movie is not made to please the audience especially the second part except if you are seriously disturbed i couldnt help thinking about the screwfly solution that joe dante made in reaction of all the gratuitous violence made to women in horror moviesfortunately the end of the movie gives enough meaning to what you have been through watch the whole thing if you cani gave a 7 because its not a movie that you can really like or recommend to your friends but i think its a real milestone in horror like texas chainsaw massacre was in his time,cruel
before i watched  i was in an extremely good mood  i finished cemetery man and pick this movie  praised highly but i approached with prejudice as imdb reviewers had let me down beforeno country for old men  and they did it again the movie left me disappointed and mad to the point i registered on imdb just to write this review  truly this movie was worthy of its praises  the movie starts off good  with average amount of horror  blood and action  it was exciting and the rescue of a tortured survivor was a nice touch  it was good seeing anna  the mc care for the survivor but things went fubar  the survivor dies  the 2nd mc dies  after that  everything is predictable  youll know what happens to mc but what you wont know is how tedious the movie gets 2nd half kicks in and youll be treated with torture scenes  not violent  i watched hostel and cannibal holoucast  arent that violent  but these scenes are longwinded  repetitive  they become tedious and boring  suddenly you felt  whats the point  just stop  certain quarters believe that all this is to instil hope  by the viewer  towards the mcanna  yet the mc was unsympathetic  little background and backstory  she was just another teen trapped in horror movie quantity over quality  equals large dropped in entertainment and good amount of boringness  the torture scenes shouldnt have been that long  time should be allocated for more character development repulsive  because the movie simply glorifies torture  torture will free you  give you the sight of afterlife  the messages are obvious in the torture scenes  im not a masochist  so the scenes simply becomes repulsive  i fast forwaded the slapping and punching scenes  but never did that in cannibal holoucast because they didnt glorify torture in terms of religion and spiritual at the end  the ending was left ambiguous  the film had a weak story  its basically women tortured by group consist of elites so that the women reached a point of insanity and see a vision of afterlife  the blame falls on the writeryes  not  not if you provide an ambiguous ending  viewers will have to form an interpretation  and thus the blame shifts to the viewers  dividing the audience into 2  those who dislike simply because they saw the core of this hollow trash  those who like it because the ambiguous plot becomes a cotton wool that blinds their judgment indubitably  the ambiguity was a nice touch but when you see past that  the movie was terrible and disappointing  the high ratings of this movie unveils more masks  showing how viewers are easily swayed by ambiguous plot  or is it because of the glorified torture  coming from a movie said to be of new era highly philosophical disturbing  utterly repulsive  what has our society become ,cruel
martyr  witnessin an era of horror films in which graphic violence and depravity and the highest levels of human evil are dominated by the likes of the saw movies and the hostel movies french director pascal laugiers has proved itself to be a twofold juggernaut on the one hand its the most artistically depraved and frightening new piece of torture porn ive ever seen and on the other hand is not just a film  its an experience this is where many of the new splat pack filmmakers  the new era of horror movies that are notorious for their extreme levels of violence and gore  such as james wan eli roth darren lynn bousman and rob zombie have failedi must admit i am guilty of having a fondness for the saw movies even though the extreme levels of violence and gore in those films in my opinion is there for shock value not to actually enhance the films or draw you in any deeper american filmmaker james cameron once said that with gore you create disgust rather than fear and with disgust theres a completely different set of emotional investments is both disgusting and horrifying but in ways that are unimaginably repulsive and beneficial to the films entertainment and artistic meritsthe film opens in 1971 when a young girl has managed to escape a dungeon where she had been beaten starved dehydrated and tortured almost to the point of death however there is no sign of sexual abuse the girl is traumatized nearly catatonic and is then taken into an orphanage where she befriends another girl who is also a victim of child abuse 15 years later both girls are young women in their early 20s and the victimized girl lucie mylene jampanoi walks into a house and slaughters the family living there lucie believes that these were the people responsible for torturing her 15 years earlierthe other girl anna morjana alaoui soon arrives and the two try to clean up the scene of the crime before the police arrive lucie is haunted by visions of another young victim that she had shared her experiences with 15 years later and this victim is prone to committing unspeakable acts of violence and mutilation against her however after a while it soon becomes clear that anna and lucie have just stumbled upon something far worse than either one of them could have imagined as they find themselves doomed to endure the vary fate that so many others have gone through and did not live to tell abouti had heard recently that this film was banned in france and its not hard to see why this is clearly not a film for children nor is it wise to watch it on a full stomach because i guarantee you that some of the grotesque sights and sounds you see and hear here will not soon be forgotten i have no idea what possessed pascal laugier to write and direct this feature and im not sure i want to know all im sure of is that whatever possessed him he created a film that is not to be messed with and cannot in any way be compared to the juvenile gorefests were becoming so accustomed to here in the united states he has said that is a film that he loathes himself for making but at the same time is happy he made it due to the level of creative freedom given to him in making iti like gore as much as the next person  i already admitted to being guilty of liking the saw movies  but pushes the envelope in sheer extreme filmmaking most horror filmmakers are interested in making their movies as realistic as possible  certainly moreso than their predecessors this time 20 years ago  but pascal laugier has succeeded in creating a film experience that transcends much of what ive seen in recent years in the horror genre hes created a real horror movie experience thats actually an experience something that is seen heard and felt something lacking from most horror movies coming out of the united states now that are more interested in grossingout the audience rather than actually scaring them is in essence a horror film for mature horror movie fans the ones not yet accustomed to saw or hostelboth morjana alaoui and mylene jampanoi turn in careermaking performances they were both extremely brave for going into this picture and becoming the willing of the torture porn era i dont want to know what these two talented young actresses went through in the making of this film but their suffering shows in their daring acting performances whatever awards they receive for their work here they will surely deserve themis not a film i walked away from feeling good about im actually quite positive that is not its intention i felt drained after it and somewhat unhappy but nonetheless i felt satisfied with what id seen a horror movie that went beyond what the genre has typically offered us in recent years it is a truly terrifying experience american author stephen king once called sam raimis 1982 gorefest the evil dead the ultimate experience in grueling horrorhed never seen 1010,cruel
the bad acting tries to hide behind offending pictures and violence this production could be a guideline for pervert person who really like to hurt others or watch them suffer the plot is cheep and meaningless maybe i dont have a clue about thrilling movies but in my eyes this is just another sick film for kids who vote this movie 10 forget it within 2 weeks and care about acne and coolness again the quality of the camerawork the set the makeup and set is pretty good some supporting actors did a nice job as well but after all this movie bored me and i am disappointed from the director you will have more fun in watching the exorcist and se7en again,cruel
lore two scared little girls desperate trying to find their way back home after being lost literature the concept of catharsis the emotional scarring of the observer artistry expression according to aesthetic principles of what is beautiful then somehow   reality genuine emotion realistic events something so far removed from a fictional environment it strikes you on a level beyond something happening on a screen and feels as if its a memory an experienceof all the qualities of perfection in storytelling that has its that last quality that sets it apart from the crowd while hundreds maybe thousands of films before it reached a level of art house perfection in both storytelling and aesthetic i can count the films that achieve both those and are still a genuine portrayal of reality on one handthe story of point blank is the most original horror stories in decades in the second opening sequence alone youre hit over the head with so much original plotting it will throw you into a state of disbelief i wont ruin the opening twist but i will say this im someone who sits in a movie and literally counts the number of clichs because im so bored of the predictable story i watch over 800 movies a year read over 250 books a year write negative reviews on nearly everything i just mentioned and simply put i have never once in my life seen the unpredictable directions the plot takes things that would be major plot twists in any other movie are just scene transitions here because the story is so unpredictable and originaltaking that last paragraph further id like to also add this the reason the story is as original as it is is because its fully grounded in reality it doesnt play off literary clichs also called literary rules the story follows the same narrative that real life would the characters do the same things real people would there is no beginning middle and an end there is no defended goodbad conflict there is no foreshadowing no doomsday atmosphere no perfectly contrasted shock value is too real and too honest to formfit to the clichd storytelling methods they teach in middle school and that is why its so emotionally powerfulbut as pretentious as all this may sound its not is one of the few movies where they could literally not cut out of a minute of runtime without affecting the story the pacing is fast and something interesting happens every minute of that pace im personally sick of the recent outbreak of slowburn boring  good horror movies because while they sometimes are good they seem to be the only thing anyone makes anymore with the exception of saw and inside i cant remember a recent horror movies pacing being this satisfyingly relentless while id be hard pressed to call this movie entertaining in the traditional sense it never once lost my interest even for a few seconds yet it retained more intelligence and quality than any slowburn film ive ever seenthe onscreen gore contrary to anything youve heard is minimal if youre a squeamish middleaged woman with a background in a violent home then yes this will be unbearable to watch but if youre just an average seasoned horror fan i doubt youll even notice the gore level im shocked to see so many horror sites being so squeamish as to say this is actually a gory film it isnt the onscreen gore never once reaches the level of the average saw film not even close and honestly the brutality isnt anything to brag to your friends about either i see reviews saying this is harder to watch than inside and thats purely ludicrous inside has to be one of the absolute bloodiest movies of all time just has a couple spurts of it here and there but that isnt criticism in any way doesnt need to be gory to have the emotional impact that it does it shows true blackandwhite desperation to a degree no film before it has ever accomplished and i find that more significant than bloodshed when telling this storysome people complain about the second half of the film and i can somewhat understand why when i first finished at 3am two days ago i couldnt contemplate what i had just seen my initial reaction was the entire movie was absolute stupid because the ending went in a direction i wasnt expecting as you can see by my positive score 48 hours and a second viewing later ive given enough thought into the ending to fully grasp the intelligence behind itspoilers the film is not saying that humans can see the other world through extensive pain its simply saying that there are a group of people the cult portrayed in the film that believe that the last line of dialoguekeep doubtingheavily implies that anna saw nothing on the other side and that her suffering and the cults purpose was utterly meaningless end spoilers when viewing the ending this way its far from cheesy or pseudointellectualredefines what the horror genre and cinema in general can accomplish it goes beyond literary rules and shows honest reality at its most menacing its a far cry from the unrealistic persevere try your best and youll reach your goals message that we all tell our kids but never really believe ourselves it shows strong people who despite their absolute greatest efforts became victims and then goes even further with a truly original story what all of this amounts to is an emotional journey that some people such as myself and hopefully you will never forget what more is there to ask for from cinema1010,cruel
all humans will die so you dont have a chance to choose for dying or living eternal if the girl said something bad about the other life could they choose living eternal no this film means nothing it is only gore blood torture and other disgusting things so you get only angry after watching this filmand the other question why dont we hear the words which was talked by the tortured girl to old woman hmm maybe they didnt find interesting and special words about other life if you make a scene like this you have to fill it special words without words this scene is meaninglessand the final everybody are old in this cult they dont need to torture a girl to find what is going on in the other life if they wait enough they can see the other life so this cult this movie and torturing are meaningless,cruel
this movie expects the audience to be retarded like lucie to believe whats going on spoiler alerts i do agree that the lucie is mentally challenged however her friend anna seems to act very adult and responsible apparently that is quite opposite of what is portrayed by her actions 1 the first thing she does on finding the bodies is try to hide them why it would take cops only 5 more minutes to find the bodies if they are hidden in washroom instead of living room then she does not seem to be satisfied with her hiding spot so she begins to bury them in a pit wow now cops wont even waste 5 minutes seeing a freshly dug pit in front of the house with blood all over instead of fleeing the house and cross country in few hours she utilizes the time to drag bodies from one spot to another in the house wow just burn the house and leave2 when lucie calls anna from the crime scene to a telephone booth she panics because it would give cops evidence to trace them however she calls her mother from the same house so cops can trace anna from telephone booth call and not her home phone wow3 when anna finds the tortured woman in the basement it was the perfect time to call 911 or even her mom to report everything report that her friend found the people who run this torture business and she found a woman who needs medical help anna didnt kill anyone and the one who killedlucie is dead anyways but no instead she decides to take care her while still in the house to make matter worse instead of treating her wounds like she did for lucie several times she decides to give her a spa bath and crack open her skull it was pretty clear she needed medical help from a certified doctor and not pretend nurse and still does not call 911 or flee the crime scene with her throw her in front of er and scoot away4 sleeping beauty the girl anna is definitely a sleeping beauty no matter how much blood crime goes around her she does not think twice before taking a nice refreshing nap she can sleep with her dead friend and 4 other dead bodies in pit on couch of very people killed she can even found sleeping between torture sessions it is quite boring with no entertainment but still several scenes start with her waking from a nap she surely is laid back girl5 fight back anna is shown to be quite determined and strong she can bust open a door with her shoulder drag heavy bodies across the house but she cannot kick a guy in between the legs to escape several instances of her being in the room alone with one guy and plenty of chances to seriously injure him like grabbing the very chains she is tied to and tying around his neck leg or smashing his bald head with chains pinching his eyes out bite his ear for fun but all she does is spit bitch slap and show a tantrum its like she does like bondage and torture she could have at least tried for the sake of her freedommoral of the story if you commit a crime flee if you find proof that the person killed was criminal call 911 the worst thing you can do is try and have a 2day vacation in the house of people you just murdered dozing off and eating from their fridge,cruel
a young girl escapes from someone who was abusing her while in the hospital she meets a girl who will become her friend years later the two girls track down the people responsible for the abuse and well thats the movie what starts off as a simple revenge tale quickly becomes something else something different something more disturbingi had heard a good number of stories about how twisted horrible and horrifying this french film was i was prepared for something that fell into the category of torture porn but i wasnt prepared for what i actually got this lived up to its billing where say the equally praised high tension did not this is a slowly building tale that is unnerving from the get go and only gets worse it starts of as one thing then changes and changes again it then plays out each new twist for as far as it can go before changing again its a pattern thats repeated several times over the course of the film it keeps you on your toes and makes it impossible to steel yourself for the next thingwhat makes difficult to dismiss as just another torture porn film and trust me this is as close to one as one can get is that the film has more on its mind than just torture this is not just the cruelty of saw or hostel or any of the other films that is essentially a mad man carving some one up laid to rest anyone there is a weird rationale to it you may argue that im splitting hairs but trust me ive seen enough to know what is what and where to draw the line between frivolous violence and violence for the plot i really want to say more id love to discuss this film in greater detail but to do so might take the edge off the film not knowing where its going is what makes the film so powerful having your expectations confounded and destroyed is what disturbs the hell out of you we in the audience are left shaking and stunned and wondering what the hell we sawthe film works because of how its filmed the cinematography is polished as are the locations these are not run down depraved placesthe story construction is clever its a series of ever expanding boxes that take us as far as we can go with out things collapsing on themselvesthe performances are real these are real people they are not just figures behaving according to movie laws rather they are behaving in ways that people might certainly the blind rage that fuels the revenge is palpable the behavior for all of its cruelty is understandable we have the girl who wants revenge and was pushed to the point of animistic violence and the people who are looking for answers are the sort of academic nimrods who dont think and dont feel that scientific niceties apply to them nazi germany and imperial japan anyone im not condoning the violence im just explaining it in context that it does work strangely other than the gashes and the final bit of nastiness much of the gore is fleeting with the level of blood relatively low its our minds that inflict the pain and suffering way beyond the levels of what we seeim almost 24 hour on and i cant shake the film its frightening and disturbing more so in that the film actually seems to be about something its not some nut job running about like texas chainsaw or friday the 13th or halloween there is something there i really do feel that way i dont think the film would be as disturbing as it is if it was just a shape killing cattle there is some kernel of truth in there that will not let me let the film go nor will it let me even consider dismissing the filmcertainly i cant dismiss this any more than i could the work of gaspar noe whose films like irreversible or i stand alone are equally brutal but less fantastical i dont know what the director might think of my take on the film he seems to want to distance himself from the film nor do i know if he meant anything beyond a calling card or horror film but even if he didnt i think hes fashioned a film that does have something more than violence and uncomfortableness i do think this film has a reason to exist beyond the profit motiveyou will probably be repulsed by the film i am on many levels and yet at the same time im fascinated by it this is a film that is a trip on the dark side that is more than just torture porn it is not just a catalog of pain and suffering there is a twisted reasoning behind it and in a weird way a historical precedent which makes it even more bothersome speaking in a video introduction the director admits to not being comfortable for having made the film and invites the audience to hate him for doing it im not comfortable admiring the filmnot for the squeamish this is a head trip for those who think they can take it i thought i could and yet it still messed me up most amazingly one of the final images one of the least graphic is one of the things that disturbed me the most a bloody blood soaked masterpiece only for those who want to stare into the abyss reluctantly it maybe one of the best films ive seen this year,cruel
meets the purest definition of horror and left me a little numb two young girls exact revenge on the people who abused them but their plan doesnt succeed entirely the first twothirds are brutal cruel bloody and grotesque as violent retribution shares the screen with disturbing hallucinogenic imagery the last third is an attempt at meaning that falls dramatically short but it is courageous nonetheless borrowing elements from saw hostel irreversible hellraiser and salo this is a film deserving of attention unfortunately it does outstay its welcome with its torrent of torture becoming endless and boring director pascal laugier uses a deft hand to provide background for the characters but his clinical approach to the material robs it of any contrast  the film is all crucifixion and no resurrection certainly i found it engaging for most of the time and i felt sympathy for the abused centerpiece female who wouldnt but her ordeal felt distant too and nothing was engaged but my sympathy the final revelation feels right and explains most of what weve just seen but it has little dramatic impact the films special makeup effects are brilliant as is the sound design and harrowing score a flawed treasure,cruel
first of all let me say  i am a grown up experienced person who is able to enjoy a good horror and can appreciate violence if it serves a purpose for the sake of the film however this film is not horror it represents a classic example of the type of film that is beginning to be labelled torture porn so called because it is difficult for any reasonable human being to understand how anyone could gain enjoymment from it unless they are of the jeffrey dahmer ilk who actually get off on such subjects  films whose sole purpose is to gorge on graphic and deranged pain and sufferingthere is a thin plot to the film which pretends to have some sort of deeper meaning however dont be fooled by this or try to use it as an excuse to say i enjoyed it for its depth and the way it brings spiritual meaning to the  no its filth simple as the type of filth that exists for the sole purpose of being filthywhat upsets me the most is that horrors of old used to have victims of both sexes who may have died in gruesome ways but the deaths were normally short and left a fair degree to the imagination or alternatively the special effects were so over the top that it actually sanitised the film by removing all reality such that you could enjoy the horror aspect but were not left feeling like youd watched some sort of snuff movie however is of the style of recent voyeuristic dirt which involves slow tortuous realistic bloody scenes  all of women all with no reprieve all involving long slow close ups and whimpering and wailing that goes on for ever  and ever the scenes that decides to specialise in here are either involving knives being pulled deeply through flesh or  even worse involve long agonising beating of a girl one section of the film showed nothing but the methodical physical demolition of a girl it went on for about fifteen minutes during this time there was no dialogue no changes to scenery just a large emotionless man who throws endless punches into the facestomach of a young girl even picking her up when she is unconscious only to throw ravaging punches into her as she flops down to the ground occasional bit of slow mo occasional long gaze at her face in between each set of beatings in order to show that this is in fact quarter of an hour of montage and to make sure we see the effect it has on her will and sanity as it all unfolds  then back for some more savage beatings this is a young girl in fact all of the victims are young girls they have done nothing to deserve their torture they are just young innocent girlswhat the fk is good about this i mean for gods sake people there is no humour no horror no intrigue no mystery no nothing of any kind other than the sort of sick filth that makes me worry about anyone who can watch this and say that they enjoyed it one can only imagine that the title and the excuse for a reason for this torture were thought up later on in the development process since the reasonning makes no sense and at the one point where you think perhaps there may be something imaginative about to happen the hope is destroyed by a simple youll never know style endingnot that this matters but my reason for watching it was due to the film arriving as part of a film club package and i did no research before sticking it into the dvd player i fastforwarded through most of the torture scenes but was still left with a nasty feeling even a long time after having watched itif films like this can make it past film boards and not get banned or at least severely edited then what the hell are those associations there for in the first place if you have read this and still think that it sounds like a good film then i pity you and i pity society for having people like you who call this sort of voyeurism entertainment,cruel
seriously im not kidding about this one something must have gone right straight wrong with the world that people think that all this depraved senseless gore and torment and intelligence deprived garbage is anything that adds value to the legacy that we as mankind leave to those who will call us their ancestorsand what is up with the selfidolizing lunatics who go on at great length in mind numbing posts analyzing and praising these pieces of excrement ever so obviously in covert attempts to toot their own horn at their selfdeluded level of intellect and proficiency in artistic appreciationi can understand if some amateur movie makers want to throw their moral values out the window or put something like this together to get some quick and dirty exposure but please spare us the praise110 and im deducting that last 1 point from the next movie laugier makes although obviously i hope that never happens,cruel
i think the best way to watch is to go into the movie cold i purposely avoided any reviews that appeared to contain spoilers and read very little about the film before viewing it say what you will about the movie but it takes several truly wild plot turns and part of what i enjoyed about the film is the unpredictability in the end though i felt like the narrative was disjointed the themes werent fully fleshed out and ultimately the ideas behind struck me as the armature on which to support several scenes of cartoon horror violence followed by sadistic tortureon the plus side the movie is extremely stylish and i thought the gore effects were very good there are several familiar elements in the film but theyre combined in such a disjointed way that it never becomes stale is certainly one of the more original horror films ive seen in recent years the direction and acting were excellent for this kind of movie even though i felt manipulated at the end of the movie i couldnt help but find the last 15 minutes or so to be strangely moving ill never want to watch this movie again but i havent stopped thinking about it since viewing it last weeknow the bad part really does feel like two different films that both go on for too long and dont mesh together tonally the first half of the film at first seems to have a supernatural element and the violence is cartoonish and somewhat overthetop after the initial shooting though i thought the film stopped dead in its tracks for a good 1015 minutes while we watch marie wailing around and cutting herself this got a bit dullthe second half of the film is potentially more interesting but far less entertaining the cult shows up and anna is imprisoned and tortured watching a seemingly typical nuclear family get blasted across the room by a shotgun is fun watching a woman forced to sit in her own waste take periodic beatings to the face and have her skin surgically removed isnt fun the torture scenes went on for too long and way too grim and distasteful to be enjoyableim not a prude i loved and own high tension sheitan frontiers inside the ordeal etc ive seen and enjoyed a lot of movies with some seriously rough content i just personally think a horror film either needs to be harmless escapism or if the idea is to strike a realistic tone the ideas supporting the film need to somewhat justify the graphic violence onscreenfor this viewer missed the mark maybe its because the madmoiselle only appears on screen for a few brief scenes but the cult aspects of the film didnt come across to me at all so i had a hard time reading this movie as a critique on religious cultism actually seemed to justify their worldview since the film clearly implies that anna did have a vision and one of her tormentors treats her with compassion near the end which suggests to me that theyre not pure evil and somewhat justified what they were doing to the poor girlreally it just seemed to me that was banking on scenes of young attractive women in agony and all the religious mumbojumbo was an afterthefact attempt at depth to let the audience off the hook i found this insulting just like the flimsy philosophical ideas in irreversible time destroys everything  ooh thats deepi also think opened itself wide open to charges of sexism at least hostel had the good sense to have both male and female victims makes the weakest attempt to justify the fact that all its victims are young and suspiciously goodlooking women i could practically hear the screenwriter arguing see just because consists of about 90 minutes of female selfmutilation degradation and torture that doesnt mean its sexist sorry folks but im just not buying it i expect garden variety misogyny in friday the thirteen but those movies dont ask me to take them seriously if you want to make a deep philosophical point youre going to have to ditch the cartoon violence and other horror tropesoverall is wellmade and intriguing but the ideology is a total mess and its not a movie i ever want to see again that said i know horror geeks are going to love this one so id recommend it to the extreme movie crowd without reservation just dont expect a masterpiece  is far from it,cruel
early critics advised that you are best placed knowing as little about as possible before viewing unfortunately all the surrounding buzz focused on the unprecedented level of physical and emotional violence in this movie prompting many like me to read as much about the film in order to determine if they could stomach itknow this  is a phenomenal horror film but is not the gruelling ordeal many would have you believe its hard to understand reports of people fainting throwing up or even leaving the theatre before the end of the first half yes the movie is violent but not to the point where all you focus on is a series of stomachturning setpieces which is where the saw franchise fell foulso why all the fuss two reasons firstly a lot of horror lovers have never been exposed to some of the most cuttingedge genre pics out there  audition old boy switchblade romance and even the muchmaligned funny games most horror films have a satisfying closure at the end enabling the viewer to emerge in one piece as they follow the main protagonist who usually survives the aforementioned films are either devastatingly brutal or punishingly tragic secondly hits hard because of its emotional resonance this is not the most graphically violent film ever made  not by a long shot nor is it 95 minutes of walltowall torture it does however deliver a series of tragic blows that leave you feeling hollow and haunted as you follow two thoroughly engaging lead characters on their path to devastationto me a truly great horror film should leave you just that  horrified dazed a little shaky and unsettled movies that succeed in this way show that we are sensitised to violence not desensitised in conclusion watch cold and be amazed at what you see uncomfortable uncompromising and a mighty addition to the horror hall of fame,cruel
i was amazed by this horror movie americans would not have made better no lead character no super female hero who finally punishes destroys all the bad guys before getting away the movie begins with characters who rapidly die and continues with other ones who also disappear in an orgy of violence sadism and unbearable sequences of brutality and torture for the actor and the spectatoryouve understood thats not for the sissies many people will consider it as too muchbut as i told about frontires when you go to see a horror film its not necessarily for laughing it can also be for feeling dizzy,cruel
ive read some of the comments about this movie and im shocked both sides either loving or hating this movie seem sick to me why cause not one comment told that this movie is just plain evil it not funny its not entertaining and i must say a have a weakness for gore  its not brilliant and truthrevealingit just evil i wonder how many sick bastards can now jerk off to this piece of crap its every torture porn lover dreamcometrue the creators of are god damn psychos so  if youre a torture porn lover  be my guest get some tissues and a bottle of lotion and have fun but even if youre a gore movies fan but you have some humanity left inside you dont watch this i regret i watched this piece of crap and id do anything at this point to turn back time and not watch it you have been warned now its your choice,cruel
many commentators on imdb have claimed this film to be some kind of art this of course is ridiculous the philosophical background to the film as previously pointed out by noone can be found with bataille he acquired some photographs of a young chinese rebel who was executed for attempting to assassinate the emperor the photos were of the execution itself which was the death by 1000 cuts the agony of the ordeal causes the mans hair to stand on end and a look of  what bataille took to be  a kind of ecstasy is seen on his face bataille would stare at his photos for hours on end looking for inspiration thinking his mystical thoughts and plotting his rather bizarre pornographic novels this was in the days when such images were hard to come by if youd like to see the pictures yourself simply type bataille into google imagesbataille considered his greatest book to be the tears of eros in which he looks at violence and eroticism in art from prehistoric cave paintings onwards it is fully illustrated with pictures of cavemen sporting erections next to split open bison dangling their bloody entrails woodcuts of unborn children bursting out of protestant wombs and through the flames and they burn alive at the stake and so onart is full of death torture suffering eroticism mysticism and so forth in almost all cases the tortured and the dead are real people or based on real events in films like hostel saw and now the characters and events are artificial the suffering being pornography and titillation not eroticism and art we are not getting close to understanding the relationship between eroticism and death or any other philosophical aspiration nothing new or original is being raised by the filmas pornography looks for boundaries to cross in order to satisfy its audience desire for sexual release it turns increasingly to degradation viewers watch it to get off on the lack of humanity and then get off a second time afterwards at their own lack of humanity socall horror porn does the same filmmakers look to make films that satisfy their audiences desire to see people degraded tortured and killed so they can get off watching it and then get off feeling degraded themselves afterwards but as with the porn viewers can take comfort in the fact that the scenes they watched were staged the actors playing roles and noone really got hurt just a little psychologically sore it is little more than an emotional game not art but a gameisnt art films dont have to be art but they shouldnt be a game,cruel
a young girl named lucie escapes from a hellish nightmare of torture and depravity she meets a friend anna who stands by her as the two grow up but lucies scars are mental as well as physical and 15 years after her escape she seeks revenge on her captors anna is soon dragged into the situation and what she finds makes her own abusive childhood seem like a walk in the parki love horror movies i like many movies that have been lumped into the torture porn category even though i hate that term and i like horror movies that can disturb me and make me think with barely an ounce of gore but i felt more manipulated than moved by the story of lucie getting revenge on her abusers and dealing with the scars of her past while unraveling the mystery of her capture could have made for an interesting movie but the lucie part is over fairly quickly and i dont really want to give too much away but the anna part of the story seems to go out of its way to be needlessly unpleasant for a motive that just didnt work on me i appreciate the movie for trying to be different and succeeding at that but in the end i was bored frustrated and disappointedff,cruel
contains a little spoiler i am horrified the most gruesome movie i have ever seen not to be proud of if its all the french can produce they better stop it the end when one finally knows what its all about ecstasy or near death experience is only added to save appearances just an excuse for masking what the movie really is about a freeway to present pornotorture as a deep philosophical given i dont know how anybody can only think its good let alone say it i do not talk about the technical qualities the colors the camera angles or whatever technically good movies still dont make good moviesi thought it over for about two weeks if i should react or not and for moralitys sake i found i had to points to be given technicality maybe 9 morality 0 cheap story also 0 my vote finally is 1,cruel
the first half was an effective horrormovie brutal and loathsome but still rewarding for the wellstomached horrorfan the second half is a repetitive exercise in torture and degradation which can only serve to make you sick and depressed this can be justified if there is a strong messagemotive behind and addressing for example a social problem but in this case there is no such motive obviously only the filmmakers urge to wallow in his twisted human degradation fantasies the fact that it is extremely well made only accentuates the revolting effect one can argue that the the filmmaker in this has achieved his goal and therefore should be rewarded howeverin that respect dr mengele also achieved a lot of his goals if you are horror fan like me who likes to be shocked drenched in gore and at the same time wants to have fun watching horror movies avoid this film or if you are desensitized sadist be my guest youll love it,cruel
french cinema is proving an unstoppable force when it comes to groundbreaking horror after the graphic and gripping grisly delights of haute tension and  lintrieur this latest film takes the viewer on a totally unpredictable path to new and shocking horrorswith realistic and gripping performances is uncompromising viewing that pushes the envelope for what is at the end of the day a theatrical release seeing the film uncut on bluray in the uk it really makes you realise how times have changed from the scapegoat days of the video nasties back in the early 80shighly recommended but uncomfortable viewing  this is one of the best genre movies ive had the experience of watching unforgettable10 out of 10,cruel
those guys missed the whole point of gore movies gore movies are suppose to entertain this is just plain depressing and i see no reason why anybody would want to sit through the whole thing given that i hope the movie has no artistic ambitionsthe movie is articulated around a bunch of really rich old folks the bunch of around 30 old folks somehow got together at one point of their life and decided it was necessary to put young girls through excruciating torture in order for them to witness life after death yeah rightthen at another point they hired a really big engineering firm in order to build a futuristic dungeon along with a really cool device to skin people alive more efficientlyman those old folks can get their act together they can even manage to drive all the way from their respective places with their mercedes i guess they got a group discount on those and to get to the dungeon within an interval of 45 secondsi mean the storyline here is perhaps enough for a short movie but certainly not enough for a full movie where you have plenty of time to think of dumb the whole thing is i could forgive the movie if it was somehow entertaining but its not its not entertaining its not clever  as a french canadian im pssed that some of my tax money went financing this,cruel
i have just seen tonight after wanting to see it since hearing about it when it was in production i must admit i was not sure what to expect from this movie but i have been quite stunned and hugely impressed by what i have seen  i am by no means a master of reviews like some of the previous well worded well informed reviews i have read just now before attempting this so please bare with my novice opinion on the movie to which there may be some spoilers however although i normally dont mind spoilers i really think this may be the very 1st movie ive ever seen  where spoilers are unacceptable and the movie really has to be seen while knowing very little about it if nothing at all so with that in mind i will be vigilant to keep them at a minimumopens with a scene to set the mood of the movie a child escaping capture from something surely horrible  this sets thoughts in your mind of what may followthere is then a family breakfast scene quite long but brilliantly paced nothing prepares you for the way this is about to be disruptedwe are then given via flashbacks the story of this little girls nightmare before escaping and why she is seeking brutal retribution 15 years laterthis is to set the mood for the movie or so you think as the brilliant pace of it throws you completely off course and does not properly prepare you for what is to comei give these examples as the movie is clearly in 2 stages and i must admit i did not know the reason for the movie its plot until it was approaching its climax right at the end for a movie to not give itself away until the very end and genuinely keep you guessing for this long is a true testamant to the brilliance of this piece of cinema  i will not mention anything about the rest of the movie as this would be robbing the people who have not seen it of the experience i am feeling now and would not be fair to anyone  you simply need to see it i love horror movies a lot of my movie taste does contain violence and disturbing imagery  but this film is something else altogether i have not felt so many emotions during a movie of any genre ever and saying this i would not even put in the horror genre  as it is not a horror movie it is simply a very disturbing very thought provoking masterpiece of modern day cinemalike i mentioned before i am no expert i am not very good at writing and i do find it difficult to get my point across  i am just someone who loves cinema and have so many thoughts jumping through my head after literally just watching this i felt i had to put them down here because i know my fiance would never watch this movie with me so cant exactly talk to her about itthis is the best movie i have seen for quite sometime and if you have the stomach for it  i really suggest you watch this as it will pose many questions afterwards and anything that creates thought must be a positive thing in my book,cruel
spoilers alert ahead im an addict of scary movies although i did have to avert my eyes through much of the hostel gore filmswith it was like watching what a snuff film must look like a relentless flow of images where a young girl is sadistically tortured over every part of her bodywhy they used a human being for the victim is baffling since the actress often looked like a bag of bones she lay still as the bald headed sadist kicked her viciously from her head to her feet then he used his fists to punch her endlesslyand then with the end near the sadist unlocks her manacles and carries her to the operating room where he moves around briskly putting on surgical attire and then he proceeds to skin her alive you see all this in glistening detail from a young girl she resembles a slab of raw beef youd find in a butchers shop but the sadist still hasnt finished putting her carved up body on a hospital bed he and other members of the sadistic cult demand to know what she sees in her fast approaching death when she fails to answer right away shes slapped and tortured more until she croaks out her words could nazi death camp masters have conjured up a more thrilling entertainment at the end all the sadists involved in the demise of the victim go along on their merry wayhopefully to find another victimwriterdirector pascal laughier created this extreme exercise in sadistic torture and in interviews seems quite proud of what he created his movie is so intense that the chief makeup man benoit lestang slashed his throat and died a week after the film was finished,cruel
is undoubtedly a wellmade film the acting is poignant honest and grounded and sucks you right into the screen the practical effects and use of sound are visceral and nail biting through the lens we see a world that is very refined elegant affluent modern enriched in the most modern luxuries the best way i would describe this world is an ice cold chandelier thats not to say that its an emotionally nihilistic world similar to what we see in the shining because the film is shown through the eyes of the 2 female leads anna and lucie highly sensitive emotional human beings that you invest in from the beginning and that is what makes this film so challenging to sit throughevery act of violence is displayed and shown is horrendously ugly if you are looking for a campy trip to the splatterhouse like peter jacksons dead alive then turn away from and run in the other direction it hurts to watch and its sad to watch it makes you sick if the exorcist is the scariest movie of all time then this is the most disheartening movie of all time i do know that pascal is not a sadist because he would not be filming from this approach which i had to learn over time a sadists version of the same film would not emotionally involve you but because it is seen mostly through the eyes of anna a very caring and selfless young woman every moment of battery is seen as it should be cruel ugly and terrible like funny games its not a film i would dare watch again i would honestly rather get a hard elbow jab in the stomach as it would be more palatable i dont recommend anybody to see it as i would advise anyone else to do even planting the idea of talking about it to people that are unaware of is kind of irresponsible in my opinion the one plus side is that if you were saddened revolted etc then you have a heart and thats a terrific quality,cruel
this film is without a doubt the most horrific disgusting kick to the senses ive ever seen if you can sit and watch the whole film from beginning to end you will feel like youve been in an accident this shouldnt be even classed as just a horror film it should have an entirely new classification i seriously doubt that any film maker could ever surpass this film for pure nastiness without showing real life carnage for 2 hours if you want to be able sleep after watching a film dont watch this i honestly wish i never watched it not that it ist well made or well written i just think that it goes to far down a vicious path,cruel
suggestive spoilers itd be all too easy to say that once youve seen one torture porn movie youve seen them all  while the passion of the christ made a lot of money other ones did not  a film like wolf creek is genuinely disturbing not because of what we see but down to the cast acting with absolute conviction  compared to that aussie horror movie something like hostel with its fake make up effects is rather campy in comparison   the only connection between these movies apart from the violence is that they all sacrificed narrative for brutality  feeling humiliated that the anglosaxon race has outdone them in some aspect of the cinema market the french launched a massive counter attack and in the process ended up with which no doubt french critics would have described as an unsurpassed achievement  an unsurpassed achievement in much the same way as the battle of dien bien phu was a complete success  for the vietnamese ill give pascal laugier some credit and say this is possibly the most violent film i have ever seen in my life  its amazing to think that when i was a teenager several dozen films were banned and yet i saw on a satellite channel  this doesnt so much push the boat out where violence is concerned but more accurately launches a fleet of battleships with all guns blazing  soon however you very quickly stop following the plot because there is no plot and just seems to be one long sequence of mutilations  maimings and murders there has to be a reason why this is taking place and so in the final third of the film laugier doesnt give us a clever plot turn but gives us a massive info dump  something about an existentialist cult of some such which is never adequately explained  they harp on about religion having but now they want to own of their own   right so they want to prove god is dead so anything is permitted  hmmm  interesting thought but not one that is followed through in any logical manner especially when its heavily suggested in the end that that this cult do believe in an after life  i think i might have to brush up on some dostoyevsky  nietzsche and sartre but im fairly certain existentialists dont believe in an afterlife so laugier might have thrown a massive spanner in the works  he also throws another one when a character mentions the phone is off the hook  right so the antiheroine had access to a phone and could have called the police if she bothered to think instead of getting involved all sorts of violent depravity  she could have also walked out of the location at any time when you stop to think about it  but if she had then there wouldnt have been much of a film  that said theres not much of a film here anyway unless youre interested in gore and graphic violence,cruel
anyone intending to watch this movie dont save yourself an hour and a half of your life just think what you could do with that time blowtorch your nipples off stick your nose into a ceiling fan drink draino anything but watch i understand that for a review to be worthwhile it should probably be over 5 lines so here goes was and probably still is an appalling terrible wretched utterly pointless pathetic piece of poorlyscripted torture porn dribbleallow me explain myself at no stage during this movie was there even a hint of character generation its like am i meant to feel pity for this character no wait she is blatantly obviously selfharming im not very intuitive but i figured that out after about 2 minutes into the movie then perhaps we are meant to like her friend no wait she ends up dead at the hands of some old farts who fear death or some rubbish was there any point to this film other than for some torture porn lovers to get their rocks off what a dreadful piece of garbage if there was any kind of saving grace for this film it would be the acting across the board the acting was very good and very believable  its just a pity that the script was such a load of manure,cruel
i am a great fan of the horror genre and have seen hundreds and hundreds of films many very bloody violent and graphic and this is without a doubt the worst there were parts i had to skip past  the violence is gratuitous ie does not advance the plot and is so brutal it is literally impossible to watch if you have any degree of human empathyliterary theory says that you can tell how a writer feels about the types of people in his stories by the fates those characters suffer if that is true  and i maintain it is  then mr laugier has some serious issues with women that need deep therapy to correctthis is a deeply unpleasant and disturbing movie that disturbing quality is not a redeeming factor that is it doesnt elicit questions for the viewer or teach anything intellectually or morally valuable nor is there the catharsis of shedding negative emotions this is a movie that really did not need to be made i would avoid it you have been warned,cruel
nota bene unlike most other reviewers which rate 1 star i am not criticising the movie for its violence so please read my whole review before you vote no  the saddest thing in life is wasted talent 2008 is a perfect illustration of this saying since the potential this movie had had was huge sadly what could have been a masterpiece got shot to hell by an abysmal screenplaysetting a tortured girl takes revenge sadly after 50 minutes the original story is dropped completely and the film magically changes into a stupid and absurd hostel clone so the businessmen are replaced with religious nuts its still the same angle actors i think mylene jampanoi and morjana alaoui do fantastic jobs in this movie their dialogue performance and facial expressions are shining lights in this catastrophe of a movie which makes the waste of their talent even sadder i honestly dont care about the rest of the cast my perception of is focused on the two women who are adorning the dvd cover i am not exaggerating when i say when lucie dies the movie dies story lucie takes revenge on the people who tortured her 15 years ago and thus destroyed her whole life it is shown explicitly that she hit the right people in the last flashback enter anna anna is supposed to be her very very close friend after all the two have been staying together for 15 years this is basically proved by a the phone conversation anna has with her mother and b annas undisputable huge affection for lucie that she had already shown as a child and c the fact that lucie is extremely dependent on her friend lucie hurts herself sometimes or even often she bears scars also anna is very experienced in dressing wounds which tells a lot and might not have even survived without anna what the two do for a living is sadly never even hinted in the movie mainly because the screenplay writer didnt think the story through thoroughly enough even though annas mother cruelly suggests lucie was a whore there is no chance in hell this could be remotely true so anna seems to be in unrequited love with lucie remember 15 years   and they havent worked out any definite solution for that matter the scene where lucie smiles for a second  the first and only time in the whole picture  and anna just has to kiss her only to be rejected obviously a kiss on the neck and cheek is fine but the mouth is taboo with her afterwards struggling in utter desperation not to try and kiss her again is very well acted lucie pushes her away again later when they hide from the beast upstairs and anna attempts to embrace her to calm her down lucies true feelings remain unexplored since at this very point in her life she obviously is drowning in emotional and physical chaos not to mention her violent delusions and overwhelming sense of guilt so the few scenes we get might not be actually expressing the whole range of feelings she has for anna either way the fact that anna loves lucie is undisputable lucies behaviour can be explained with the great deal of distress and pain she is under however annas contradictory behaviour is the knife that slits this movies skin of internal consistency wide open and ruins the film even before everything goes straight to hell after 50 minutes more on that belowanna loves lucie yet she doesnt trust her fully or at all i dont know but to me that makes no sense whatsoever at no moment in the first 40 minutes which is the instant of time of lucies suicide anna believes that lucie has indeed killed the correct targets why it seems anna does even doubt the whole torture story even though she clearly must have seen that lucie was hurt and gravely disturbed when the two girls got to know each other in the orphanage first flashback how logical so since i have to choose one path in these paradoxical crossroads i assume that anna is indeed repulsed by the sudden reality of the murders shocked out of her mind by the corpses and blood she realizes that it was an unforgivable mistake not having accompanied lucie on her fateful trip anna might not be the smartest person on earth which is still no excuse for her random behaviourdue to the 1000 wordrestriction this review is continued in part 2 under the name jcdenton666,cruel
may contain spoilersempire said this was a work of rare raw brutal brilliance  i beg to differ and who ever reviewed this film on behalf of empire should be ashamed of themselvesthis film is simply not very gooddress it up however you like and smother it with as much pretence as you can manage it wouldnt change the fact this film is simply not very goodthis was nothing more than yet another excuse for goreporn  there was no artistic merit in this film its just about the blood  violencetagging on the transfiguration cult was a cheap attempt at pretending this is something other than goreporn  but the attempt fails miserablydo not be fooled by the hype this film is not groundbreaking it did nothing newi was not offended by the violence in this film what offended me was the lack of imagination displayed by its directorwriterproducerfor this to have been truly powerful it should have focused on the psychological rather than the physical  but then it wouldnt have appealed to the goreporn contingent which is who this film is really forirreversible was fierce and had some truly horrific scenes really truly horrific  im talking about the tunnel scene in particular  but at least that film did something originalif you want to make goreporn thats fine but dont dress it up as something its not,cruel
i felt so strongly about this movie for all the bad reasons that i decided to create an account on imdb don t get me wrong i love movies and open to lots of controversial films like irreversible saw the vanishing13even if in some casei didnt t like it i respected the work in it but this thing makes me hate cinema for an hour and a half i could have stopped it at any time but it is the kind of movie you will watch until the endit is so bad you expect a big twist to come before the final picture as a reward it never came it is not particularly well acted either as typical i hated losing 90 mins of my precious timei had to watch a sure value film just after to be back in love with cinema this review will maybe tease your curiositydon t be,cruel
i cant remember the last time i wrote here but man this is something i just need to saythis movie is beyond ridiculous is way past the line of being stupid just for the sake of it i mean and im trying to be polite here this is the epitome of suckiness this is a lousy story directed by the most unexperienced person everthe movie starts nicely youve got a japaneselike ghost there a frightened child and a couple of blood stains in the titleok you got me there im paying attention then it builds up into something quite decent you know with a teen wearing a hoodie thats blowing people off with a shotgunpromising reallythen everything breaks into little pieces of stupidityyes the spoilers are ahead i respect french cinema i actually love french horror but to see a woman after being skinned alive talking to an old lady about how the afterlife is bliss or something that mildly passes as awery and to watch a bunch of really old people throwing a midafternoon party all dressed in black waiting for the aforementioned old lady to give a deep speech about how torturing people is cool because they end up looking like the characters of the latest tool videoman thats just blatantly plain and makes me feel like going out there to plant a tree or somethingthis movie is ridiculous just like my last paragraph its not horror its not tortureporn its not terror or any of those genresits just a movie about how a girl can be dumb enough to stick around after her girlfriend who just committed suicide btw blew the hell out of two adults and two young childreni mean if you stick around to watch the corpses decompose i promise something weird will happen to you why dont you just run the bleep away girl anyway dont watch thiswatch inside or frontiers instead those are bad but at least the gore and horror bits will make you sick and happy i rather see a naked hairy and very fat old man jumping in the grass than seeing this movie again,cruel
this is a love it or hate it movie obviously from the rating i hated iti must admit that it kept me from the begging till the end just to let me down so much by its end this movie starts good keeps going really good and after 60 minutes it goes way out of logic and sensesome rich people torture young females just to find out what exactly is on the other world they beat the hell out of them  even put their skin out in order to make the young female see the other side i mean come on and when a woman learns it at the end of the movie she kills herself without informing the others i mean what she says keep wondering yeah right you kill people for the last 20 years you finally know whats going on the other side and your best decision is suicide well that makes sense not to mention where the girls kill a whole family but yet they sleep on their beds like nothing happened or when a girl finds a prisoner instead of getting her to the hospital or call the police she just sleeps by the side of her dead girlfriend letting the poor prisoner suffer by its wounds well all of these make absolute sense i also dont know how some of you guys compared it with hellraiser or hostel this movie has nothing to do with any of these films3 out of 10 just because despite its flaws it kept me till the end 7 out of 10 because the end disappointed me very very much,cruel
i manage to catch this at the annual horrorthon here in dublin this year everyone was talking about it as the film to see out of all that were being shown in my humble opinion it wasnt the first half of the film plays out like a poor imitation of switchblade romance then in the second half it takes a turn towards the saw and hostel type of movies with a montage of physical abuse and torture inflicted on the main character culminating with her having all of her skin cut off apart from her face in order for her to reach some higher level of consciousness ie martyrdom  it just couldnt decide what it wanted to be there were elements of numerous different films all jumbled together to create this one it wasnt original or thought provoking it was just colour by numbers plagiarism everything from the grudge japanese original to as ive already mentioned switchblade romance and hostel,cruel
the beginning of the film was interesting then suddenly it became very disgusting the violence increased with time ive watched till the end just because i want to know how it ends and i must confess that i am not satisfied at all all this torture was done just for that i think it was so meaningless i dont recommend this movie to the horror fans i can only recommend it for the people who likes violence whatever if you like to be disturbed i think you should watch this movie but if you want to watch a horror movie a normal one d  find something else and dont watch it,cruel
 warning may contain spoilers i will admit there that manyatime highbrow french films and french cuisine go over the top of my head so i wont pretend that i fully understood this work of art but still i found very many premises quite unclear here goes so a girl escapes from an orphanage somewhere and runs screaming down the streets there is an investigation but the girl never tells anything why so the perpetrators are never brought to justice the girl grows up in the company of another girl similarly abused not clear having frequent nightmares and a lesbian relationship not clearfastforward fifteen years to the present the first girl lucie now grownup but still quite hysterical breaks into the home of a family and shoots everyone dead apparently this family including the kids not clear had been torturing her so many years ago the second girl anna helps the first girl in getting rid of the bodies why not clear but something grotesque appears was it a vision not clear and there is mayhem all around instead of running for their lives both girls choose to stick around in the house of horror and even sleep there hmmmapparently there is a group govtfunded not clear which believes that extreme torture can result in neardeath experience extreme pain can make a person delirious can his hallucinations be called neardeath experiences not clear so this group has a facility to torture girls why girls only not clear lucie commits suicide and anna is captured by the coven and taken through the same steps of torture and humiliation apparently she has a neardeath experience murmurs something and goes into coma the group is elated till the ring leader madam commits suicide hmmmso this paperthin plot is an excuse for prolonged torture sequences murders bloodshed nudity and mayhem since the lawenforcing agencies are nowhere in the picture it may be assumed that it was a govtfunded exercise but for what to hear the rantings of a person under extreme stress torture starvation and humiliation surely then the wwii nazi camps inmates would have had much better neardeath experiences than these two poor creatures forced to become for no good reason pretty awful stuff imho,cruel
seriously i just cant believe how much this movie is a crap and how good it is rated herethe scenario is such a crp almost none you can sum up the movie with details in a sentence the end is an escape the only thing that could have been interesting would have been the end the first girl is such a bad actor the model family is so laughable and the amount of impossible and nonsense in the movie is huge the movie makes you cry if you are french because you must be ashamed of the quality of acting and the make up is pitiful i dont understand how this movie can be rated 7 here and have won an award for make up after having seen rec it is so bad it looks a bit like hostel but hostel is worth something,cruel
i watched this recently tired attempt to shock and really only for those susceptible to hypeim saying this as someone who went to texas chainsaw massacre way back when with a headful of lsd and found it to be the same sort of experience a lot of fake suspense thats where the hype comes in and then some curiously detached formal torturing of uncomprehending victim is it pretentious is it transcendent thats in the eye of the beholderif you have a taste for sadism this might be right up your alley if you are interested in other kinds of cinematic experiences you should probably skip this one i guess im immured against this sort of thing since its basically the product of a debased material culture,cruel
im amazed that people have given this film such a high rating much of the gore effects and makeup are makefortv quality at best the cinematographylightingetc are very bland which contributes a great deal to the lackluster appearance of the effects the high concept explanation is laughable as is the ending the pacing is awful as the film burns itself out before the 45 minute mark it begins being somewhat atmospheric with some spooky moments in the first 30 minutes but that fizzles out as well basically even if you just want a gore film youre wasting your time reminds me a lot of the saw series in the sense that it was just quickly thrown together and every aspect from the story to the effects to the photography really suffer as a result unlike the saw series however this film takes itself far too seriously which only serves to foreground what an amateurish mess it truly is,cruel
i dont know where to start on how atrocious this is and in the interests of avoiding repetition many other reviewers have already hit the nail on the head about why this film doesnt need to exist i will just say dont bother with this film i think to say it made me despise the director is an understatement also i read that he dismissed hanekes funny games as sht which makes me even more certain that hes an idiot worthless futile punishing and sadistic i guess the only thing this film is good for is providing an example of how to make a sadistic punishing worthless etc etc film which rides on graphic and emotionally disturbing imagery and dressing it up as something profound which it isnt what a cnt,cruel
okay i created an imdb account for the sole purpose of rating this moviefirst the good the actors were amazing all of them and the directing was spot on every shotscene was beautifully woven together also i remained engaged i was engulfed in the despair that is from the beginning i was enthralled so why the low ratingthe bad the first half of this movie is packed with mystery revenge emotion and grit then the second half starts and we are forced to endure a looong abusive montage again looong but i stuck with it i thought there has to be a payoff there has to be a climax there has to be answers then comes the ending what a disappointment the reason for the violenceabuse the reason for the movie its idiotic the reason for everything is based on a guess or superstition okay fine lets hear this superstition the reason for this whole movie nope the movie ends without any answers or climax i imagine anyone that likes this movie just enjoys human suffering however i need an actual story or at least an ending for the record i love horror movies hellraiser the exorcist high tension youre next the shining 28 days lateri spit on your grave the thing etc i love horror movies but this movie should be erased from history i only hope my review saves one person from wasting 99 minutes of their life,cruel
now that i think about it i dont know what i imagined to be but certainly not this with a rating of 7 on imdb from over 32000 voters i expected something decent at least and it failed my expectations is a splatter film but i prefer the term tortureporn that starts by presenting us the story of lucie a girl who has been kidnapped for unknown reasons and tortured by some blond lady but lucie escapes and then we see her at an orphanage where police officers are trying to make her talk so they would catch the perpetrators but shes haunted by the spirit of some girl left behind which later will prove that its been all in her imagination not the torture but the ghost 15 years later lucie murders brutally a family of four and calls anna her girl friend from the orphanage to come and help her because the spirit is tormenting her well anna arrives and for more than half of the film gore scenes everywhere gore here gore there gore gore everywhere right and then lucie kills herself with a little help from her special little friend and anna stays behind not really knowing what shes got herself into but soon she discovers a secret chamber in that special special house where not long ago lived a perfect perfect family with happy happy lives well we soon discover that the family was not so perfect in fact they were some twisted motherfersanna is captured by some evil persons all dressed in black i hoped they were from another planet really and then she gets tortured for the rest of the film really and then we get the explanation of why those men and women in black were doing this nasty stuff they wanted a martyr to see whats the afterlife like and surprise surprise the ones that really wanted to know were rich and old like that is going to help themas far as i know martyr is a person willing to be tortured and persecuted for hisher own belief so thats why i find this movie so wrong if i were to be tortured for someone elses beliefs would i have visions to answer their questions and if so would i tell them fk no they fing tortured me for a thing i dont believe in im already past fear and terror why would i help them first of all a person in terrible pain will become delirious and hallucinate but not the spiritual crap all they is fragments from their life randomly chosen by the brain and showed in a differentdreamy manner so yes is a tortureporn just like saw just like hostel but at least in saw he wants to change people and in hostel they do it for pleasure and money in they do it for nothingi give 210 for the effort,cruel
im a huge horror fan and while i enjoy seeing women get the living daylights beat out of them and families blown away with a shotgun this movie was complete garbage it gets progressively worse and its amazing how a movie with such gore and brutality could be so boring and meaningless right up until the end hostel and saw may have been more gory but the pace of those movies were as not mindnumbingly slow and lingering saw was also a much more clever movie martyr is overly pretentious and filled with cheap rhetoric to mask its weak shallow plot and terrible editing guys just because its a foreign film does not mean its a good movie,cruel
well as i find myself in the unfortunate position of living in or rather through a decade where depicting torture and only torture seems to be the epitome of being horror i was literally forced by some socalled friends to watch this moviewell its got all youd expect from a torture film its marketed as horror but as all torture flicks so far all the horror stems from disgusting acts of violence against helpless people so yea i can watch people getting tortured stoned burned killed on youtube for the next two days if i want does the same thing to you it makes you angry sick and helpless in the sense of being forced to watch i can see how these movies are popular toughnesstests for youngsters trying to be cold as ice but as a horror movie it fails why  because a horror movie is supposed to be fun to watch getting scared creeped out and laughing about it afterwards in this movie theres nothing to laugh about even worse its depressingit has no scares no real suspense only one basic twist it has no demons no ghosts no zombies no insects no real killer no one running from anything it tries to deliver a philosophical message though and a pretty basic one at that let me deliver a philosophical message to you from me if you enjoy watching torture check youtubecom and save a lot of money oh and go see a therapist,cruel
pretentious that is the keyword of this film and it is full of spoilersreading through the reviews it feels that the movie is celebrated because no one understands it so it must be great i didnt think soas everyone comments this is several movies in one but unfortunately they dont really fit together the new french horror cinema has shown to deliver some great flicks with actually refreshed the entire euro horror genrepart one is the revenge movie here we see 2 girls kick ass during a vengeance  murder rampage a sickly ghost and a lot of self mutilation with a razor that ends with a suicide mylne jampano plays lucie with excellence and her madness really comes out that is the only character that has any really life in this crapthen it feels like pascal laugier came up with an idea omg i may perhaps have to share why these two girls have gone completely medieval so now we find catherine bgin playing mademoiselle an old hag who wants to create jesus we learn that there is a group who kidnaps women because they are the only strong ones who can endure the torture in order to create their jesus figure who goes back to papa and learns about an afterlife and they have tried for 17 years and are still ongoinginitially i though she was an old nazidoc who wanted to continue perverted sexual experiments but we didnt even get to see a nipple until the end but i was wrong she was just another cultist of rich old people who wanted to know what afterlife wasso what do you get during these 99 minutes first part gruesome murders intermission when stupid girl anna roams the torture chambers finding another victim she is then taken by the baddies and now second part startsshe is force fed has her hair cut of she gets a sponge bath a big blond french nazi no not a nazi just an ahole beats the crap out of her a few timesthen comes the scary doctor who skins her alive  whoa now she meets god tells her secret to the old hag all the old rich people gathers waiting for the word of god but fool them twice the old hag kills herself and it ends with anna in a tank skinned and oh so holy and because the hag killed herself after anna whispered the truth  the rest of the world is lostfrak  yes the director should apologize for this there is a quasi religious message that perhaps a catholic understands but not the rest of us fx was on par with what you would expect of a torture porn movie but nothing more it is just that last part of the second half i get the feeling that people love this movie because you need 4 years of religious schooling a deep understanding in philosophy to understand it but hey an artsy movie from france  it must be greatwhen in the end it is just some people dying on the screen some abuse of a young girl and then emptiness high on the chock value due to the violence against young girls but low on plot or message,cruel
first of all im not a moviemaking student nor interested in that area i just watching movies to be entertained regardless the country it came from how it made who made it and the actorsactress play in itand martyr doesnt entertained mei dont know what it is all about i cant categorized it is it a thriller horror or a mystery all i got is a lot of bloods and noises without any reasonnaturally im baffling why it calls bloods or beaten will sounds more sensical for me,cruel
im pretty sure a film like is sure to polarize a large majority who finds the actions of this secret society desiring to know without doubt that theres an afterlife to an extent that a chosen victim will serve as a martyr to prove so rather appalling and disturbing i have read many find the endingwhat the martyr sees and the actions of the mastermind behind the project who is told the answer so sought afterrather disappointing certainly theres a negative vibe i have derived from what ultimately transpires but i found it so sick and daring that all i could do was laugh quite an odd reaction after watching some poor girl tortured for 30 long minutes just so that elderly wealthy types could learn of the truth behind what lies on the other side but i just couldnt help but bury my face in my hands and laugh the film is just brutal almost from start to finish without little time to breathe or sigh just violence heaped upon violence director pascal laugierhouse of voicesestablishes right from the getgo that the film would feature victims abused and the results of such horrorsmylne jampano in an astonishing heartbreaking performance is lucie a young woman who massacres an entire family with a shot gun at first you believe shes bonkers but we soon realize that the parents killed werent whom they appearfar far worse but lucie hallucinates believing that a mistreated victim she didnt rescue as a child after escaping from a place of torture is always coming for her along with lucie is her friend from an orphanage annamorjana alaoui also delivered a terrific haunting performancewho witnesses the aftermath of the slaughter attempting to clean up the mess while mortified at such a grisly crime scene later though after lucie makes a tragic decision due to a complete psychological breakdown anna discovers a secret area hidden containing a torture chamber with a chained and badly ravaged victim bound by shackles her eyes covered by a steel plate hammered into her skull anna removes the poor woman from the prison attempting to help her but the woman finds a large knife tearing away at her wrist until shot through the forehead this is when anna meets those responsible for what has traumatized her friend lucie an organization ran by a woman referred to as mademoisellecatherine bgin wishes to uncover the ageold mystery desired down through the ages by those with religious doubtis there an afterlife and is there a way at discovering such a truth using an unwilling participant as their martyr anna could be their link to the truth so shes brutalized for the remainder of the movie nearly practically dead when she does experience somethingwe are led to believecould she provide an answer they so desperately covet i warn those who take the leap and rent this film because its incredibly violent lucie blows cratersized holes into the bodies of an entire family obviously leaving you breathless before the thing she sees even enters the picture that created being is scary as hell and you can understand why poor lucie is so tormented then you are shown a horrifying discovery and witness a person whose been kept in the dark her skin cut throughout the body knees practically broken little sanity left remaining then after all that you have to sit through what these cretins do to anna each chapter goes one step further the one who got away the one almost dead and anna the one they may finally have to provide the answer they seek this is not for the faint of heart what ultimately happens to anna left me rather unnerved i must admit and the experience we witness through her eyes couldnt impact me because i was so shaken by the damage she had suffered i cant say i was entertained by this one and truth be told i felt very little after it was over to be honest i was glad once it was over because i just grew tired of seeing anna pummeled and left to rot before the final despicable act was completed towards her person,cruel
i dont really want to say very much about this film in some ways its a film i wish i could forget its a film i will most likely never watch again i will say that most of the scenes in the film at least in the first two thirds are sickening and horrible and full of extreme human cruelty violence and gore however the film turns into something far worse than that in the last act the film depicts pure evil and the true deterioration of the human soul and body about as bluntly as it possibly could i will admit this im not exactly sure what it was that i watched i know that i will most likely never watch it again i know that it was well made and had an effect on me and i know that it was definitely extreme the film is full of screaming shrieking mutilation and torture and there was a story and people did things however this is a film that is entirely inaccessible for most audiences in terms of extreme french horror films i thought it was very good inside to me is still the crowning champion of extreme french horror films but definitely works however its far more than just a horror film its a celebration of extreme human suffering cruelty and evil,cruel
to me this movie was clearly the most repulsive yet globally acceptable movie ive watched since yearsafter watching this movie youre no longer debate on acting skills screen play script storyline or anything else that might happen once a good movie ends by all means all these elements id rate above average without a doubt after seeing this movie youll have an internal debate about lifedeath and the way you perceive the world and yourself as human beingi bought the movie directly after seeing it to never watch it again i still dont know exactly why that is in my opinion one of the best movies ever made and i would recommend this one as being one of the most impressive movies ever made,cruel
well made and effective 810voyeuristic pointless and and morally empty 110im guessing that the scriptwriter and director of this movie are the sort of people whod happily collect ivory or invest the loot theyve made from this film in a bangladeshi sweatshopits a snuff film for eunuchs because it scrapes the bottom of the same dreckish barrel for as far as i can make outthe same sullenly nihilistic reasons but is devoid of any sexual element whatsoever i wouldnt be surprised to learn that the actresses were treated with appalling brutalityit made me angry,cruel
this was the third worst movie i have ever watched horrid screenplay a completely nonsense plot and no background messages at allwas it supposed to be an horror movie because it didnt scare me at all all it did was screw up my mind with some gruesome gore and human torturedont watch this if you have a sane and healthy mind because it will break your mind so badly you wont even sleep right they take the skin out of a womans body and keep showing it for no reason other than to disgust youthis movie is for psychos who want to see people sufferbest regardssomeone very enraged because of this movie,cruel
wow this is a fullon movie i needed to turn it off for 10 minutes about midway and take a restwhich is more than poor anna could expect im not a fan of gorefests  feast was watchable because it was funny whereas feast ii was remarkably unfunny and repulsive while films like captivity dont usually last more than about 20 minutes before the stop button gets pushedbut is a good film with good actors and a good story the thesis is that if a person can survive extremes of pain and deprivation new vistas may be opened to them its been longheld that the right side of the brain the imaginative creative side receives its flashes of insight or inspiration under extremes of stress its why the jains whose senior members live in a permanently deprived state close to starvation are renowned for performing significant deeds eg bringing people back from the deadit may be that theres some truth in the theory whatever the case its a topic worth exploring and does a pretty good job of it while the brutality was hard to watch the underlying theme rendered it all fascinating unlike so many pointless torture pics that probably do untold harm to impressionable mindsan 810,cruel
i agree with the previous reviewermaybe the best movie i have seen in awhile that i may not watch againwell maybeso i can get more people to witness this unknown masterpiecei fell upon this movie by ordering the dvd inside from amazon and this one was featured along with it as people who buy this movie usually buy this movie at first i thought was some french word for another titlebut then i realizedahhhmartyrnow i understand so i went into the movie knowing nothing and came out knowing too muchbut in a satisfying way thats how you must see this movie without any trailer previews or reviews that just might take away some of the hard effect that this movie will endure on youi will not say anything about the movie at all but i will say it is terrifically acted that is if u watch with subtitles  do not have english dubbing playing it will ruin it watch it the way it should be watched and you will be able to take in all of the effect and at the end you will like me say i love anna,cruel
i saw this yesterday picture the scene i had been recording all day with my band mates it had gone well and we were all in a good mood had cracked a couple of bottles of wine had some pasta and decided to watch a film the film we wanted to see didnt work fanboys so i put on instead we had heard comparisons to hostel which we all found very silly and even slapstick in places all good evil fun the first act of the film passed with us genially chuckling at the english dub and the somewhat odd performancesspoilers ahead skip the next 2 paragraphsas soon as anna was captured nobody was laughing any more it was disturbing brutal and graphic the fact that you actually saw this woman who had been trying to help people through the whole film and had not done anything to deserve this go through the dehumanisation and horror she experienced was just beyond anything id seen outside of certain japanese titles i was actually happy to hear one of the torturers telling her it would be over soon showing some humanity to the poor girlwell they really shat all over that one by the time she was skinned nobody was making any jokes anymore the odd nervous laugh had ceased and my girlfriend had actually walked out no more spoilersafter the film had finished we were discussing the ending for a good hour or so my friends and i all love horror films but the opinions of us five people all differed wildly and ive never had that happen before this morning i really still dont know what to make of the ending i like that i like that the film wasnt just a cut and paste slasher where you can pick a survivor within 5 minutes and the bad guy is some shadowy figure its not entertainment its an ordeal in a good way i honestly thought it was a great piece of filmmaking 810,cruel
imdb was right to put this in the same category as high tension like its counterpart it relied heavily on atmosphere and cinematography and misses the mark on the follow through this movie viewed as though it had three separate directors the first part of the movie is suspenseful and actionpacked following lucie through the bloodspattered execution of her torturers it is intense and compelling as lucie faces the demons of her past while dragging her unsuspecting friend anna and the audience along for the ridethen the movie tapers off lucie unable to cope with her trauma commits a brutal suicide and anna becomes the focus of the film as she tries discover the secrets of lucies past it is a rocky switch of pace and after the shocking first half hour anna fumbling seems to drag on even her inevitable capture and subsequent torture seems feebly dullthe last part of the movie centers on the concept of martyrdom and annas martyrdom from here we see yet another directorial change as the film seems to be stumbling blindly for something poignant it leaves the audience grasping at straws while trying to make them believe theyve seen a philosophical masterpieceif the film had been consistent in following the trail left by the first part it could very easily have been a great movie lucies story was compelling and intense the film hinted at other horror mediums such as ghosts demons and my personal favorite the psychological thriller but in the end it was nothing but a common torture porn,cruel
well since lots of people recommend this film for being notyourusualtortureporn and worth watching i have to object in my opinion the only genre that could be any more pervert is snuff an idea which i despise with all my heart the level of violence displayed in the second half of the film is far beyond obscenewhy would i want to watch some girl in underpants tied to a chair being force fed and then beaten senseless by some guy a scene which is repeated over and over for twenty minutes before same guy skins her alive to be able to report from a possible afterlife which is why people are held captive in the first place in this story seriously  this film is about martyrdom at least thats the message the director wants to rub in your face in a statement by a prop actor shortly before its over at last a moment i had been longing for the biggest torture involved is watching it hostel and saw head off in the same direction but do so grossly oversubscribed this film is nothing but repulsivegood critics dont make a good movie  as antichrist and dogtooth have taught me but nevertheless they were at least a gazillion times as good as this one with incidents of abducted minors who are held captive for years and are tortured in a variety of sickening ways it would have been nice if a competent director had tackled this subject in a movie worth watching that wouldnt leave you angry for wasting your time with it instead this film seems to focus on the direct display of violence which is displayed in a way that only this films playwright seems to be capable of coming up with its absolutely unrealisticthe revenge bit of the film creates high hopes of a vendetta film but then again unanticipated and unoriginal twists wreck this whole idea and then the obscene display of repulsive violence startsi seriously cant recommend watching it,cruel
im all for big ideas and grand finales but this one had absolutely nothing profound to say at the end a sad silly and misogynistic little movie made for boys who love to think big but dont have the capacity to hold their own train of thought up to the light in interviews the director has said he did not want to make a tongue in cheek movie and wrote this script from an honest and emotional place if he truly understood any of the points he was trying to convey and if he had any sense of what those ideas actually mean to humanity he surely would not have copped out at each and every turn either this man is an idiot or merely an idiot savant regardless hes not nearly as cut throat or deep as he clearly wants us to believefor a far superior example of what this movie was trying to portray please see dreyers the passion of joan of ark its available for free on youtube and for a movie which actually stimulates the mind while making you squirm see noes enter the void just avoid this utter crap,cruel
the first 45 minutes of this movie is as good as anything i have ever seen on the harsh scale this film is right up there at the top with cannibal holocaust untold story flower of flesh and blood forgive me if i left anyone elses favorite out this film actually galvanizes my hope in the film industry and the level of creativity that can still be achieved in this era of remakes clichs and tediously predictable action i love a movie that is hard to watch and this one is whoa wow its brutal i really liked it the acting in it is superb the make up fx are unreal it is very gory you may or may not hate the direction the film goes in i thought it was great be sure to see the unrated version and not the castrated version,cruel
the only way i can see that this film has so many positive reviews is that everyone who was involved in making it wrote one to hype it up and utterly pretentious people who bought into the awful martyr side of this gorefest this is awfulif you like films where the same thing happens throughout hostel style torture an then it ends abruptly with no explanation then this is the film for youonly pretentious people can see some deeper meaning or hidden message in this film the whole idea of martyrdom is so poorly done and means nothing here it wasnt clever its just no story with a lot of gore and a lazy attempt to attach some meaning in the last 5 minutes that makes no sense a complete waste of time,cruel
i usually dont do reviews for movies and actually this is the first one i ever wrote on imdb the reason being this movie was horrendously awful i knew from the beginning that this movie had no interesting plots and was downright boring i only kept watching because of one review i read by toe tommy that said this was a great movie and i would recommend everyone watches it but it should come with an extreme warning this movie was not scary it was disturbing and at time youll feel ashamed of yourself for watching it but in the end youll be glad you did ok i was not glad mostly furious at the end that i watched it seriously this has been the biggest waste of time ever i sure hope french cinema isnt all like this because if so i will never watch one again only movie that has made me this angry i beat myself up now and ask again and again why did i watch it i give you my warning i dont know who would find this sadistically gruesome movie that makes no sense entertaining but im pretty sure if you are ready my review you wont beware,cruel
as pointless a movie as i have ever viewed a 65 million budget that paid for some fine actors and as pretentious a plot as can be imagined plumbing for depth i kept searching until the credits finally rolled and i realized there was noneto be fair the film is riveting it is the multi car accident one just cant take ones eyes from tragedy transporting the viewer from one scene to the next in the forlorn hope that some sort of redemption awaits the viewer for succumbing to such torture willinglyhate is not too strong a word for this exercise in narcissistic creation,cruel
this movie is different than most horror movies it is gory and brutal but it also is very deep and mysterious without being confusing you never really know what direction it is going in which is something i love it has great acting and an amazing story the makeup and effects are so good that me and my friend actually could feel the characters pain not literally is the only movie that i have watched that has been able to do that if you liked inside you will love this they are similar in ways but has a deeper plot and more mystery watch this before hollywood remakes it 15 out of 10,cruel
film review being the highly subjective and personal thing it is i shall not expend great amounts of words heresuffice to say this film is in some ways the most shocking film i have seen in twenty years of watching some truly hard and driven cinemaif you enjoy being challenged and like a film that leaves it to you to draw the conclusions i really really cannot recommend this highly enoughif you are of a sensitive nature are easily offended or are a torture porn junkie give it a wide berthaccomplished audacious and so affecting i am not yet sure if i even liked it i just know any serious cinephile should watch it this is the film gasper noe has been trying to make for fifteen years,cruel
after all the hype and months of waiting for the french dvd release i got to watch this masterpiece last night as a french guy based in london i could not wait 2 more months until the uk dvd release so forgetting the credit crunch i bought it from france with next day delivery and im glad i did first of all while the movie is indeed very violent and quite disturbing i was expecting much worse after reading so many crazy reactions for one its not that gory compared to insidea linterieur for instance  that one really went over the top i would say that haute tensionswitchblade romance was just a bit more suspenseful toobut is the sum of all its many parts and turns in retrospect im glad that didnt turn up to be as gory as inside on top of being as suspenseful and violent as it is each element is there and will be turned up or down during the whole movie but never to maximum effect were it would become unbearable to watch  just walking a very fine line however while the physical violence is tough to watch its ideas hit you even deeper which makes it quite unique i never felt that while watching the abovementioned flicks or any recent horror filmmy reaction at the end was that it was a great film not just a horror movie its actually a bit restrictive to label it this way  and i love the genre as it is much more in my opinion i keep thinking about the ending which is really open to interpretation but at the same time it was the perfect way to end the film i would describe the film as a gory metaphysic revenge drama  darker than your worst nightmaresi really dont want to spoil it for anyone  i wish i had gone into it without reading anything about the plot so i wont add any spoilers herestill hesitating my advice dont be put off by the warnings this movie delivers and then some just see it and go through this very special and intense experience its unlike anything youve ever seen and youre unlikely to forget it anytime soon,cruel
anna and lucie morjana alaoui and mylene jampanoi are friends on a mission they are out to face and destroy the demons from lucies childhood of abduction and unbelievable trauma unfortunately the pair have unwittingly embarked on a journey into an unknown world of terror torture and utter despair appears to be straightforward enough especially during the first half then secrets are revealed  unveiled plunging everything into a hideous nightmare of hopelessness and agony sound like entertainment if so you may want to seek professional help is a bleakbleakerbleakest descent that never lets up once its aperture begins closing it chokes out all light still the underlying idea is ingenious the title comes into play in an unexpected and astonishing way is this film disturbing certainly but in a different way than movies like cannibal holocaust or philosophy of a knife might be though there is violence and gore it is not gratuitous and is arguably essential to the story the truly unsettling aspects of are more psychological  pathological mixed w philosophy and even profound spirituality far deeper than most horror films this transcends the genre is it grim oh yes but for good reason anna and lucie do not deserve their fates they are caught up in something beyond understanding and so are we this is horror at its extremity a masterpiece in blood,cruel
few horror films are as thought provoking and disturbing as this one french horror lands a knockout punch with that must been seen to be believed watch it,cruel
i watched this movie last night and im still trying to get my head around what i seen it really is an experience sitting through it and for that i respect what the director has done but i just cant see myself sitting through it again or purchasing the dvd as a horror it definitely works it has some truly horrific scenes throughout and it definitely is not one for the faint hearted so much takes place its hard to believe that its only just over 90 minutesim a big fan of foreign films and i was sold immediately by the great reviews received but this film goes in so many directions and at times is really hard to watch the torture scenes towards the end are really tough viewing and the twist at the end will have you floored a very weird movie that some will love and some will hate im just not sure what i think of it,cruel
the nastiest piece of demented crap i have ever seen this movie actually made me vomit it was so disgusting whoever wrote this is either a twisted sicko or worse when someone writes or directs this depiction of sadism against people and more to the point children i feel there is something very wrong with the persons morals and code of ethics never in all my life have i seen anything come close to a snuff movie but barring the fact that this had no sexual abuse you might as well had because this was nothing short of pure unadulterated evil there is nothing artistic about the script has no plot and worse than that it actually had nothing to say at all just a mere sadistic fetish should be banned,cruel
first of all before i start this comment i got to say that im a huge horror movie fan so my dislike for this movie has nothing to do it ive seen horror movies from every corner of the world and ive got to say this was one of the worst horror movie have ever seen in my lifedont get me wrong visually this movie is great and i love every special effect use in this movie the main actress were also very good and im sure they will have a long career in this genre but the thing is the story isnt that greatthe film starts alright with the scene of lucie escape and here upbringing in the orphanage then again great home invasion sequence you really felt the anger of lucie during that segment then the film start dying of a slow death until we get to the last 30 minutes of pure torture and not just for anna but for the entire audience in the theater because seeing the same thing over and over again for 30 minutes is boring as hell and the reasoning behind the torture is really lamei saw this movie last sunday at the fnc in montreal and when the movie started the theater i was in was full 30 minutes into the movie 10 peoples left then 20 minutes pass and another 5 people left by the end of the movie half the theater has left the theater before the movie ended so for me thats a sign of a bad movie when peoples pay 10 a tickets to see a movie and they dont even stay until they end it says that this was a bad movie and all i got to say is dont fall for the hype on this movie its not worth it,cruel
easily the most terrifying experience ive ever had in any movie and i understand the movie is really messed up and not everyone can sit through itit feels so cruel and dark for the most part yet there is something beautiful about it that i cant describe the first half of it is probably the most horrifying thing you can ever watch the sound effects really hits you and after that the movie completely turns on itself and it gets really hard to watch when it end you really feel nothing complete emptiness and thats what this movie tries to do to you and it absolutely succeeds in that so love it or hate it you cant deny how it can effect you,cruel
why the hell did i watch this oh well now i can recommend it to someone i dont like and that way hell suffer the pain i had to go through while watching thisis about torture porn plain and simple its pretty well made for a film in that specific genre but thats not saying much when its competing with movies like the human centipede and saw 3djust by writing this review im getting another headache the movie itself is pretty nauseating its not fun to watch as a matter a fact its actually one of the hardest movies to watch any scene in it can be painful to keep your eyes on the acting was pretty good and all specially french actress mylene jampanoi but after a while i kept on asking myself what was the point in making such an awfully disturbing film or maybe that was the point if it was theyve succeeded but i have no satisfaction in watching films like theseoverall is a disgusting film how could anyone recommend this i guess if youre looking for something really sick this is the kind of movie youre looking forid recommend it to anyone who liked films similar to sal o le 120 giornate di sodoma,cruel
i had to register so i could write this reviewi use imdb religiously before thinking of watching a movie as with everyones elseour time is precious in our busy schedulesi hate watching a movie that received high scores only to be a total crap art pieceive seen lots of horrorgore types but this was a waste of timeif youre into gore give it a try but this is a movie that goes nowhere fastthose who gave it such a high scorei guess you want to write a great reviewscore because if everyone else is it must have been a good movie even though i didnt get it or like itgo with the herdget some balls and call it what it wasgarbage with a garbage direction throughout the movierather watch saw over and over again or while im at it through in hosteldo yourself a favour and something elseanything elseyouve been warned,cruel
there is nothing behind all the violence with is by the way of the worst kind that imho only people with psychopatic tendencies can enjoy the movie contains very graphic pictures of children or young women being imprisoned and tortured in a very sadistic way and there is nothing behind it no bright ideas no interesting questions nothing just sick violence and sadism until the endthere are plenty other slashers that do not pretend to be anything more this movie unfortunately does and it is a pity that i felt for it this was without a doubt the worst movie ive ever seen,cruel
im beginning to wonder when socalled respected film critics will grow out of this infantile fascination with obscenely graphic and profanely morbid torture flicks that have almost no storyline whatsoeverwhat starts out as a potentially promising film descends very quickly into the absurd it uses the merest imagining of a plot to unfurl yet another showcase of gratuitous sadism before finally manifesting into the worst kind of selfmasturbatory climax of embarrassing pseudointellectualismthe film wastes no time on things such as character development or any tangible sense of a backstory instead it hangs itself on the flimsiest of pretexts they experimentally torture people to try and make them see heaventhe other side and stretches it out for 90 minutes as a fulllength feature film it really doesnt have enough gravity to sustain itself the initial idea was solid but it just evaporates into what is otherwise a pretty hollow experience with uncomfortably pretentious leanings,cruel
i was somewhat hesitant to watch this at first  i frown at cinematic gynotorture and i absolutely hated linterieur a movie often cited alongside this one in reviews basically my stance is if im going to see people women especially get horribly effed up there better be a great reason for it succeeds in that respect on multiple levelsits a sober and focused work unambiguous and mostly free from the kind of selfaggrandizement and indulgence some extreme french films fall prey to the first half or so is prime horror ribeye  sound design timing blood and a certain amount of ambiguity keep the adrenaline pumping and the brain wiggling to figure out whats coming next the second halfis somewhat different but thats already saying too much yes the whole thing is torturey but its not excessive to the point of being almost unwatchable think rape scene in irreversible and poundforpound mpaa ratings sheetstyle its not nearly as graphic as say antichrist or even cannibal ferox nothing but praise for technical execution  acting makeup lighting etc and most importantly theres a common and rather lofty idea at work across multiple levels one youll ruminate upon after seeing the film much more than upon any single bloodsplattered scenethe only downside is that its rather unpleasant to watch which remains a downside even though this film cannot possibly be any other way the story arc is also a strange rollercoaster with all the boo moments over and done with way before the movie actually endsdefinitely worth seeing if only once,cruel
the farthest from me is to bloat about my education but here it is relevant i indeed was a student at a hungarian art college the farthest from me to bloat about this is also because actually an art degree is worthless in todays society i should have learned economics or law or somethingwhich is actually respected somewhere and are not the butt of jokes and this movie and its kind is part of the reason why saying in a social environment i graduated from art is something that will only be followed up by raised eyebrows or laughter and jokesthis is garbage the worst kind the kind that is the creation of a sick mind who just wanted to see his sick fetish realized without going to jail and had the smarts to opt to faintly disguise it as artand the flock gathered and applauded because its oooh so dark and edgy and meaningful newsflash its notthe subject matter of dealing with torture and abuse the questions about afterlife and how far people are willing to go to fill the void of uncertainty in their heart was observed and expanded upon in manymany movies beforeand much more intelligently even if i agree that this movie had some themes and thoughts it was 10 minutes out of almost 100if 90 of your film is nothing but torture and gross out stuff which also in this day and age is pointless after sooo many torture porn flicks you can not use the joker card of it being art anymore anybody with a brain gets the point after 2 minutes than it gets repetitive and you realize you see what i described someones sick fantasy 2 minutes its enough after that you are not deep and profound and whatever fans of this garbage think this isyou are empty and meaningless and repetitive and boringto put it in contrast imagine a cooking show where out of 10 minutes 9 is devoted to showing you washing the ingredients one after another and 1 minute showing the actual process of making the foodis it a good cooking show anyone can wash a tomato just as anyone can show violence show the meaning for 90 and the torture for 10 than i will agree it is meaningfulthis is nothing but a glorified and even more over the top hostel and has two type of fans gore hounds which group i can understand and pseudointellectuals who will say to everybody who doesnt like this movie that they just dont get it and should watch michel bay movies insteadironically michael bay and this director has a lot in commonthey are both good at shooting excessive and meaningless violence although even the island has more meaning and human emotion than thismost likely half of the above mentioned pseudointellectuals condemn hostel for being a mindless hollywood piece of trashfunny thing this movie even has the same antagonists rich white people hunting innocents for their means since this is sooo originali am really sad i can not give 0 starsand the saddest part is this movie is available at the most known video sharing site in full length the uncut version without age restrictioni hope no 510 year old will stumble upon it because from that point on the director will be not better from his antagonists one tiny bit because for a young mind this is really torture and dangerous and i extremely rarely say thisand dont anybody dare to say to this its the responsibility of parents and all thatwe are on the internetwe know how it worksand we know most kids know more about the net than their parents,cruel
the most disturbing film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot i didnt expect it i thought i was going to see some revengesplatterhaute tension a linterieur movieand this was much more than that the director seems that he wanted not only to provoke the audience but to torture the audience to make us who watched the movie feel sad and unpleasant this is a torture porn film for the audience not only for the main characters if you watch this movie you will get tortured psychologically in ways you can never imagine i am not a sensitive guy and i dont like movies like mary poppins i have seen a lot of horror films but this was beyond my limits dont see this disgusting movie the world is enough ugly we dont need to shroud and darken our souls by watching this,cruel
first off i will comment on the purely visceral parts of as in the horrifying images the brutal torture and so on let me say this the first 45 minutes are one intense hellride the next twenty five minutes are even worse because major spoiler the ghost is actually alive then we have the last twenty minutes which seem at first to be duller and slower than the rest of the movie they are but do not despair there is still one ohmygodmotherfingsht howthefdidtheydothat moment waiting it was absolutely horrifying and the ending unlike so many hollywood endings or halfbaked endings by amateur auteurs not only fits the entire film but is the perfect ending it is not happyon the more psychological and thematic elementsis about the search for truth both that of the victim and that of the torturers is any truth revealed no that is the point of the film in my opinion that the truth requires great sacrifice and pain and without that it will forever be elusivemyself i can do without truth if it means i get to skip the torture in short this is a fine visceral horror film that both shocked me and made me think definitely something you should see 8510,cruel

a huge disappointment not because i was expecting one of the best movies ever or anything but because the first twothirds of it promise that at least in the horror genre ive almost never been more frightened definitely the kind of film you watch between your fingers the story involves two 20something girls one of whom lucie mylne jampano was kidnapped and tortured when she was a child now she believes she has found her torturers and plans her revenge anna morjana alaoui goes along with it because she is secretly in love with her friend but shes not quite sure lucie is entirely sane this movie creates a tense situation and then solves it surprisingly quick it seems like the storys ending but then theres a shocking twist this happens two or three times during the movie and it keeps upping its game that is unfortunately until it reaches its final twist its slightly ridiculous and wholly pretentious the worst thing is that the tension is gone at this point it turns from a cracking horror film to cheap torture porn hell even for that nasty subgenre its extremely unimaginative the torture consists of a very large man punching the victim over and over again the pretension comes when the film thinks its saying something it never really does i think laugier might consider this the 2001 a space odyssey of torture porn its so depressing considering just how damn good it was earlier i was absolutely sure this was worthy of my top 10 list at the end of the year still worth watching for that first 23 not for the faint of heart though,cruel
you can disregard any review that tells you that this is a clever movie or that it somehow deals with the mysterious big questions all that is just a pretense to justify the production of what in reality is nothing but torturepornhonestly whatever story this film has or whatever questions it asks those take up less than five minutes of the film the rest of it is more or less extended scenes of tortureif that gets you off fine go ahead and watch it but please at least have the decency to not pretend that this is somehow a cultural masterpiece the only real reason someone enjoys watching this film is that they secretly enjoy seeing people getting tortured,cruel
yeah its got some spoilersgotta give it up to the frogs for making some nice horror lately and with they keep the ball rolling well this ball is again like some recent other frog horror in that it bounces high in brutality bloodshed and violence its all realitybased horror humans being the monsters which im kinda getting bored with but this was a pretty nice surprisethe story itself is where its biggest problems lie but at the same time it brings a fresh take on the torture subgenre i had no clue how long was but during the movie there was a point where i thought the movie was going to end then it seemed a whole new horror story started and then another the first was some revengehorror flick then there was a little mysteryhorror theme going on then torture and supernatural ideas came into play while watching it i didnt really like how they kept introducing these new paths but thinking back its not that bad and for the most part it worked i especially enjoyed the idea of reaching martyrdom made me think of doing the hardwork to becoming a cenobiteone of my biggest gripes with horror these days is having characters that i dont care about and with a torture movie the whole point of the horror is to feel for the victim again i didnt care at all for these characters they were just dumb characters maybe you were persuaded into caring for them from all the tears they were shedding but that wasnt enough for this guy uph im tough arent i actually a couple instances from stupid decision making i was hoping for them to kick the bucketis a bright spot in the ohsoweak and played out subgenre of torture flicks the flick suffered from predictability and lack of good writing hence the carefree characters but it also looked fantastic the actors were gungho the violence excessive and the concluding idea was interesting 75 outta 10rounded up,cruel
i have just finished watching martyr about 3 minutes ago and have been compelled to voice my opinion to ensure that people dont have to be devastated like me to have lost 1 hour and 35 minutes of their lives to such a pile of unnecessary self indulgent bullsht now i love ultra violence as much as the next guy but the constant violence and gornography is a pathetic weak attempt to gain some kind of credibility in a shtty sht boring pointless story line that leaves the viewer completely dissatisfied not to mention total violent feelings coursing through my body toward the ass hole that recommended it to them my little sister i have to go now and wallow in my misery for loosing that precious 1 hour 35 minutes of my life and for listening to the girl who recommended eden lake a few months ago dead to me,cruel
stupidest movie i have ever seen sorry to say that but its true always thought that french should resume to what they do better cheese and wine and paintingsometimes d but not movies come on i could say a thousand smart things about this movie but id rather not discuss any more aboutalmost nothingby the way only a sick mind could write such a script and the writer is of course pascal laugier also the director of this masterpieceah and by the way i graduated the academy of fine arts and i got my master degree in visual arts so i am a visual artist and i can assure you that this movie is not even by far a masterpiece nor a good horror movie or anything its not even clear in ideas and got no solid structure either it only made me ask myself and others i have watched the movie with if his mother hurt him a lot when she used to cut his nails too deep when he was a child ,cruel
this is the continuation of my review under the name lepermessiahtr due to the 1000 wordrestrictionanna knows that lucie cannot be trusted to be on her own yet she abandons her at every chance she is given 3 or 4 times in the movie which combined with the unreasonable distrust mentioned above fuels lucies selfdestructive behaviourafter 15 years anna must know that lucie needs an ample amount of attention and affection which is an arduous assignment as her amicable companion is obviously a difficult and rather uncontrollable subject lucie is shown to constantly drift into despair more and more with every time lucie leaves her behind and when this behaviour culminates in the betrayaltm it is not a surprise anymore that she breaks apart filled with hopelessness and the feel of being betrayed by her very likely only friend and kills herself  and this time it is herself not the monster who raises the knife why dont you believe me lucie makes perfectly clear how she feels yet is unheardso to tackle the ultimate failure of annas betrayal it is annas nature to save and what can change the nature of a man lucie the mother and the imprisoned woman make an intelligence check who of those three is different from the rest if it had been the child who survived lucies initial onslaught and not the unbelievably unsympathetic bitch of a mother which visually reminds me of the equally despicable mother in the seventh heaven series this flick would have been so much better pity for the innocent child  reasonable sympathy for the slut who tortured the beloved person  behaviour absolutely not justifiable under any circumstances and therefore a screenplay mistakebecause im running out of space im not going into detail on all the other shortcomings like the fact the monster that is lucies personified guilt is shown too explicitly dont show the shark various plot holes and the absolutely dreadful second half of the film which can be summarized by quoting the famous two word review of spinal taps shark sandwich albumso this movie which was intended to be disturbing left me but feeling so unbelievably cheated the only other time i felt disappointed that bad was nikita  usually i would rate the movie 1 star and have my peace of mind but this story had so huge potential to become an emotionally grappling masterpiece and was raped so violently by the hack screenplay writer i can only shake my head in disgust and disbelief sure even the way it is this project has some remarkable qualities  the two protagonists excellent performances some good direction some of the soundtrack and the torture scenes especially lucie hurting herself is very gripping  but those are distorted eclipsed and raped by the horror that is the rest of 2008if you dont care about believable characters and just want to see pseudomeaningful torture porn this is the movie for you if you want to see an emotional involving and actually disturbing movie featuring mylene jampanoi watch the chinese gardeners daughters,cruel
this started promisingly enough in the first five minutes i was reminded of some japanese horror flicks all this changed after the initial brief credits where mood made way for blood n guts and attempts to throw the audience off the trailin fact this movie changed so much at about the half way point that it almost was like three extremes or grindhouse where multiple directors contribute to make a collective work if cinemas still had an interval they could have marketed this as a double bill because if the lead actress wasnt the same you could be forgiven for thinking that you were watching another movieso ill review the film twice first 45 minutesa bit similar to hard candy you cant tell what is real and what is imagined who is sane and who is nutso you know something bad is happening that is painfully obvious from the first shotgun blast to the gut but you dont really know why the victims are being victimised nor if the perpetrator is an avenging angel or a skitzo bitch and really youre not meant toi actually thought the first half was leading somewhere good the precredits sequence shows why the two lead actresses are so close and sort of justifies each of their actions and why lucie the aggressor does what she does with anna as the protector it appears that lucies actions are designed as payback for both a personal wronging and to avenge another victim that lucie met only fleetingly and who appears as a personal reminder to lucie in high stress situations something the first half has a lot ofi liked the first half was confused by it until near the end but was willing to go with the flow until it unfolded only the director had other plans go grab some popcorn and an 8 watered down drink well be back in a moment the second 45 minutesdont worry if you missed the last 45 minutes it doesnt really matter but the front end of our double bill was a nice little example of misdirection with some brutal violence and pretty reasonable actingthe only carryover from that is the lead actress anna who finds herself in a position where she must endure what noone should for reasons that simply dont provide anything resembling justification for both the punishment and arguably the making of this filmone reason that movie lovers look overseas for alternatives is to experience something new and different asian horror until recently showed better imagination for where horror can be found i am now positive that in general europe has a willingness to go further more extreme if you will for longer and basically carry situations far beyond what america might find as a logical conclusionthere is a 25 minute period in  part 2 where dialogue is minimal and the experience is so unrelenting and linear that they lost me i gave up i knew what they were doing and where they were going but i really didnt care anymorei have no doubt that if the film was in english it would be held up as the poster child for pushing the boundaries of taste putting the subtitles at the bottom of the screen automatically ensures you get some slack as a film maker as critics fear the reprisals of a bad review as not getting iti cant explain what happens as even a basic outline gives the plot away because it really is that simple that one note the director tries to explain and justify the sequence through a 2 minute scene but the explanation is that flimsy that i found the ensuing action only worthy of contempt rather than the wide eyed revulsion and shock that i guess the director intendedthere was no twist nothing to lighten proceedings or even to break up the periods of tension and although what happens to the victim is indeed shocking and the actions deplorable once you no longer are emotionally involved in what is happening it is simply going through the motions which is exactly what i did until the credits rolledfinal rating  45  10 yeah its extreme whatever that means anymore but with a lightweight plot conceived only to justify what follows only gore lovers will find solace and there isnt really much goreif you liked this or even if you didnt try oneguyramblingcom,cruel

is the latest in a long line of gory french horror films that have included the likes of switchblade romance sheitan and inside certainly aims high and tries its best at getting there but unfortunately the film fails in spite of the heavy gore and several attempts to shock the viewer the central theme is retribution and the film goes about this in the most violent way possible i really have no problem with this in theory but unlike the violence in say inside the violence here constantly feels like its over the top just for sake of cashing in on the new french wave of horror the plot focuses on lucie a woman who as a child disappeared for over a year and was later found traumatised and with numerous injuries over time lucie began to recover and formed a strong bond with a girl named anna during her rehabilitation although she is still haunted by a strange female figure fifteen years later lucie has resolved to get revenge on her abusers and sets out with anna to do just thatthe film feels very cold throughout and this extends to the characters ensuring that the audience has no real reason to care for any of them which is not good when you consider that the plight of the characters is often the main focus of the film its obvious that director pascal laugier wanted the film to make an impact and the violence is carried off with a pumping pace from almost the word go however a lot of it is done with flashy photography and quick edits which lessens the effect as well as the fact that many things such as the idea of the leads tormentor are just thrown in there seemingly at random really is a film of two halves and the two are joined together by a twist halfway through the film this is intriguing at first and left me wanting to find out where the film would gobut unfortunately the film soon sinks back into the cold atmosphere that carried it up to the twist and i found it hard to care about anything that happened in the second half of the film which is a shame really as the twist is actually quite inventive and original overall i have to say that im highly disappointed by this effort especially considering the great horror films to come out of france in the last few years,cruel
i got to catch the midnight screening at tiff08 last night and yes this film can be added to the onslaught of french horror that has emerged in the last few yearsfirst off the film succeeds in violence and has an excellent cast unfortunately the movie goes on just a little bit too long for me and doesnt hold up i dont need to go on about the premise of this film as you can read that on other reviews what i will tell you that is the violence is truly graphic and leaves little to the imaginationit totally seems just a little to excessive especially in the last 2030 mins of the movie i truly believe that less is more and if it had ended just 20 30 mins earlier my rating would have changed to an 8 or 9 out of 10it had a great pace and was quite disturbing and has some nightmarish visions to say the least but it pales in comparison to inside as far as intensity goesto me it seems that the director had a vision and somehow lost it toward the end of the film and maybe thought that he had to explain in greater detail i think if he had left it to us to ponder of what did happenit would have been a much more effective filmthats why i gave it only a 6 out of 10,cruel
a tad emperors new clothes i thought a weak story with a weak end to showcase gratuitous pointless and ott perverted violence people who say otherwise must have really thought the emperor was wearing clothesit has nothing i could fathom to make it more than the 1 star if someone recommends this to you  take a deeper look into their psycheand run a mile i chose to watch it being a child of the video snuff generation and still found it to be both bizarre and vomit inducingthere again if you are into bdsm big time you could love iti love horrorpsychological thrillers this is neither yeuck,cruel
whoever watched guinea pig hostel aftermath and so on know what type of films torture porns are there is little room for additional explanation here however here we get something really interesting first half or so of the film we have an intense horrorthriller movie great direction and editing it is so intense and wellpaced one can only hope for an awesome resolution at the end then things go the other way you get your more or less torture porn where we watch a girl who is getting tortured but there is more than pure sadistic satisfaction by people in black suits or so we are told now why this film doesnt deserve more than a 1 star because we get the setup that there is something great beyond all the tortures even jesus christ or other saint references can be seen here we know that at the end of the film we will be the witnesses of the great truth an author of the film will tell us what his vision of that truth is and what we get nothing thats right folks we get  nothing all that brilliant setup all that great acting horror scenes and nice back story all for the cheapest of the cheap resolution i wouldnt recommend this to anyone except if youre the fan of torture porn as it is nothing beyond surface hereif you ever read from hell by alan moore then you will get the glimpse of what im saying a movie which is so well produced cant have an open ending it mustnt i want to see the vision of the directorwriter however banal or unimportant it may be i want to see it this however proves to me that he didnt had anything upon his sleeve he didnt had any vision just an opportunity to film naked girls which he presented as if its something deep and thoughtful it isnt and thus i conclude my 99 minutes of life completely wasted,cruel
first off i know i checked the contains spoiler box but just to be clear this review definitely does contain large spoilerslet me start by saying this is not a horror movie its practically a snuff film in fact the only difference i can see between and a snuff film is that a snuff film is supposedly realfor one thing it seems unable to decide which genre it is which is fine when such a blending of genres is done well this isnt its so choppy that it made me almost feel like i was watching two or three separate films in fact the reason this isnt getting one star from me is because at least one of the films i felt like i was watching was actually pretty goodthe film does have a lot of good ideasbut none of them pay off the pseudophilosophical bits had potential but it didnt make sense that they would make one of the torture victims completely unable to communicate if they wanted the to report back on what they saw beyond the point of deathas for the last 30 minutes of torture pornwell it is what it is and if youre into that sort of thing this review wont stop you personally the unrated version of hostel is pretty much my limithowever whats the point of watching a movie where you know from the second they have her in custody that theres no hope left i knew as soon as they cuffed her that she was going to be brutally tortured for the rest of the movie so the only reason to keep watching is in the vain hope that there will be some sort of payoff which there never isbasically i have no real issues with the idea of torture porn so long as the movie is honest and straightforward about what it is ill use hostel as an example again because its the best example of this genre ive seen hostel tells the viewer even in the preview that it is a movie about people torturing other people it doesnt hide from that it revels in it and presents that fact proudly so only people interested in that sort of thing would bother watching presents itself as being about the lengths people will go to for friendship and the depths of depravity some would sink to in pursuit of knowledge id like it a whole lot better if it were actually about those things and not just about watching the complete destruction of a human being,cruel
there arent many films that ive seen recently that make me sorry to have wasted the time doing so but this is one of them its not deep its not clever its just got lots and lots of violence against women and children and is packaged so that we can satisfy our blood lust while pretending to watch an art movie that said i was also extremely disappointed by hostel and the whole grind house genre my view is that if you take the violence out of these films you are left with nothing these directors know what people want to see and are simply packaging a product sadistic violence into a form that people can watch without feeling like a pervert so if you are a grind house fan you may well like but please dont expect it to change your life in any meaningful way,cruel
its more then just a horror and its more than just a gore movie it have that background that stays in your head after seeing it gore scenes dont make you laugh like in other gore movies they are fierce ferocious and mostlycredible yes this movie is credible as a whole there are no moments where you say to yourself oh my god u stupid woman do something because characters act like it was really happening and i was actually surprised with the plot usually movies end where this one is just halfway i wont write more just watch it this movie jumped on my top 100 as number 2 just after fight club worth watching  highly recommended,cruel
its rare that a horror film shocks me beyond all belief but this was one of them not for everyone but an incredible ride nonetheless i hated almost every second of it yet found it to be peculiarly enticing a great story that keeps you guessing and thoroughly disturbs throughout im still in shock the idea of martyrdom expressed here is to the furthest most extreme and something i wouldnt wish on anyone im appalled absolutely disgusted but in a good way much credit must go to the makers and their originality and to the cast who must have endured so much just during the filming let alone the living with their experiences there afteri know this aint real but it sure does a good job making it feel so and not since switchblade romance have i felt so uncomfortable and in need of a sick bucket but also had a satisfactory ending that delivers along the lines of the narrative set before it an awful idea great film,cruel
some spoilers aheadthis film seems to be getting a very divided reaction some call it torture porn an overused term but do remember that porn doesnt necessarily have to relate to sex or sexual acts a movie of people solely getting their heads chopped off would be pornographic just it would be of violence instead of sex others call it a deep masterpiece of blah blah blah in reality for me the film doesnt really hit either extreme its got some story problems and arguable plot holes the direction is at times uneven and it tries to break clichs while falling into others its also just a bit too dullingly depressing which hurts the rewatchability factor for meone of the bigger problems i had was that the film tries to explain why the victims always have to be young women and by young women i mean young pretty women but its not a very good explanation and modern day horror films of women being beat up by strong burly men are getting a little tiresome hostel though that movie sucked beyond all belief at least was equal opportunity in its victims not that political correctness matters to a film like this but when it uses such a tired clich like that it for me takes me out of the film just a bit its like oh look i can imagine the casting session for thishowever with all this said i think this film is still in a lot of ways a good example of a modern day psycho in the sense that it does a pretty good job of horrifying and shocking  which is a much harder feat today than it was in 1960now heres where some of the real spoilers come into me the reason this movie works on a basic horror level ie trying to horrify its audience through an idea rather than just pure blood and guts is because we see someone go through intense suffering just because of someones personal ideology  a person who of course is at a safe distance from the suffering ie not torturing themselves physically and mentally but rather another person for an answer they seek its a play on an audiences fears dealing with abusive religious or cult leaders look at what corrupt religious leaders have done in the past ie burning people alive to send them to jesus crucifying heathens to save them etc etcor look at something like jonestown with groups of people dying for a cause or look at the suicide bombers in the middleeast convinced by people standing safe and sound that they need to kill themselves to become for their cause if bin laden really believed in that cause why hasnt he blown himself up for martyrdom exactly its an abuse i see this film as one about the fear of horrible things being done for reasons that are based on faith alone  specifically religious or cultbased faithfaith when abused does awful things to people and humans sometimes justify horrible things being done to others because it satisfies their belief systemnow why some fans of this film seem so adamant about defending the fake evil actions of a fictional character is beyond me a bunch of good points have been made from various sources that pretty much put big holes into mademoiselles idea of expecting martyrdom ie witnessing the afterlife because of immense suffering to actually reveal anything of use god help us if anyone here thinks that what the cult does in this movie actually would be a good thing to do in real life of course theres a lot of bad people out there and im sure they use the internet just like everyone elseso yes to me in a lot of ways this seemed like a 21st century psycho in the way it built up tension took false turns to make us think it was about one thing and not another and ultimately ended with the face of one tortured individual reaction is even similar psycho in its day was called both sensational and deep by different people it was hated and loved not that im saying this film is on the level of psycho but it hits the same kinda nerve that psycho did back thenalso even though im so tired of terrible horror remakes and im sure this has a crappy one already in the works if you were to give it to a good director like a scorsese he has done horror look at cape fear also a remake you probably could have a future horror classic like psycho the parts that work work very well especially the setup and the last 10 or 15 minutesbut at other times this film does wallow a bit too much in the hate and like many films  ie the passion  when you have some realistic violence it needs to all be realistic or else it borders on becoming gratuitous and yes pornographic as an example look at the massacre on the house in the first act  people dont get blown back from shotgun blasts i know death becomes her did it to a great effect in 1992 but unless the bullets have something to grip onto theyll just tear through you you cant have silly violence like that and then have a woman skinned alive to chilling accuracy without a little bit of the ol wtf imagine watching kill bills house of blue leaves scene followed by saving private ryans ddayso i guess id give this a 510 as a horror film it does just that it horrifies  and on a psychological level too  and thats worth something but in my estimation it also has a lot of problems that keep it from being a true classic,cruel
i finally got round to seeing the other night after reading so much about this film i was just itching to see iti read mixed reviews about this i am a die hard horror fan and let me tell youthis was awesome not going into the plot because to be honest you can get that info at the home page on imdb but to watch this and not know to much really is the best way to see itthis film just doesnt have a boring second in it and the 95 minutes just fly by but the real treat here is the endinga sucker punch bullet of an endingacting is superb by allthe gore makeup effects also superbbeing a foreign film i hope this gets the push in uk and america that it truly deservesmy only concern is that i will never be able to see it again for the first time 10 out of 10,cruel
just isnt that good maybe i missed something but the sadistic approach of this movie doesnt work ive seen hundreds of horrors and gory thrillers but i just left the cinema almost ashamed i had to walk past patrons claiming that was so scary and i feel sick the violence in this film was so ridiculously played out that i simply couldnt give this a higher rating the opening scene was promising and reminiscent of the swedish classic thriller but just little sense from there on also it really didnt make you care oh well i guess my point being that im sure another torture horror film will be out to out do this in a few months time what happened to decent scares without humiliation it wasnt even uncomfortablejust predictable and stupid i know people will be reading this thinking oh but it was so beautiful and original well ok but just stop thinking arty nonsense like this is the future all it take these days is some idiot from the daily telegraph to claim a film will terrorise you and you have a supposed masterpiece shame as i was really looking forward to something fresh,cruel
its ok  first three quarters was alright  quite a tight little film  but nothing special unless you are just looking for a brutal gory new film  then there is 20 minutes of torture porn i fast forwarded through that cos its boring and just nasty  anyone could do that its not clever  then there is the ending which tries to bee im not sure what  but it certainly isnt the revelation that some people seem to think it is  it does sort of create a unique world of suffering  but is that of any particular use to anyone  in the end the fact is it isnt that special i wont watch it again not because i found it disturbing but because it just isnt particularly clever or interesting  and exciting this film isnt  its a film you have to see once i suppose because its talked about so much but its the hype thats the reason you see it  not the film which is really only a 35 out of 10,cruel
is a perfect example of the term tortureporn the first hour of the film begins with the typical story of revenge quite interesting especially by the hallucinations of lucie but the last 30 minutes are so violent so cruel so beasts so inhumane that all the plot becomes unpleasant and not only that despite being one of the films more violent than i have seen also account with a final more pessimistic and ridiculous that i have seenit is not a film for the general public too violent both that falls into the ridiculous,cruel
ive never been so disappointed by a horror film the story is really dull and dumb the actors are bad the only good part is near the beginning where the family gets blowed apart apart from that the whole film is pure garbage do not waste your time on this piece of fecal matter there is nothing really interesting very few jump scares the whole plot of the movie is really dumb and boring when you understand what they are trying to achieve its just so dumb we dont understand why the main actress uses a shotgun in the first place then why she kills herself it really makes no sense and this movie in my opinion and like lots of people its absolute trash im very disappointed to have lost 2h of my life,cruel
the opening of the movie presents a very compelling promise for the film within a girl escapes what seems to be an empty building that held her captive the little girl lucy is being helped at a nunnery and befriended by another girl anna she has a secret that she wont share except that she screams out that monsters are coming for her that only she seems to be able to see sounds good but after the first scene which takes you 10 years later the movies goes downhill from there in a big way and becomes a bad excuse for torture porn with a wicked silly reasonspoiler aheadso you want to know why the lucy shoots this family dead whom she claims to be her captors in short the entire town is a cult that believes that if they torture people who have a will to live that is higher than most they will hang on to the end and share the secrets of what lies beyond death in their final moments whispering it to the preacher and by brutalizing people to within an inch of their lives they are able to see through the cracks the angels and demons and afterlife details that we cannot on the cross have died this way tortured to the extent that pain will allow them to stay alive and in that state they see the beyond thats itso you can guess what follows girl calls 911 to help her friend but the entire town is in on this torture show so they capture her drag her to their dungeon to commit atrocities for the pleasure of the torture porn audience repeatedly lucy is tortured to the point where she is about to die anna sticks around to be tortured and told all of what is happening because if she wasnt the audience would think that this is just badly acted torture porn with bad dialogue straight out of bad bmoviesanna hangs on enough to get a gun and try to save lucy during the ceremony before her death crucified on the cross she tells the priests of the cult to cut lucy down they refuse lucy tries to speak something and anna and a priest hears the head woman of the cult demands anna tell her what was spoken the priest said he heard and he takes a gun and kills himself anna shoots the head woman everyone runs and in her wounded state anna lies down with the martyr lucy and we assume they die together thats it im guessing what lucy says is what a bunch of suckers you are for watching this whole movie the dialogue is pretty bad and the adult girl who plays lucy is not convincing at all part of this has to be the wooden dialogue which is at its worst during the meet the cult part of the movie watch this if you must be prepared to fast forward to the end and be surprised when you see how poorly this is acted dont say you werent warned,cruel
ive been revisiting horror films of late and eventually came across this the problem has been that the majority of these so called horror films ive been watching have been fairly terrible and i thought that eventually i would finally come across something half decent i stumbled across this film and checked the score out here which at the time was 7110 so decided to give it a go i wont bother with what its about as there are plenty of reviews here which pretty much will tell you all you need to know what i will tell you though is that this is one pretentious arty steaming pile of turd of a film i dunno but when you get past the gore violence etc and realise there is no decent storyline or characters you could care less about the boredom quickly sets in and thats where ill leave this review  just do yourself a favour and read the bad reviews on here  all these people are correct and the rest must be just trying to trick you into losing 15 hours of your life like they did,cruel
spoileralert if you know what were talking about thanks to the socialmedia buzz and well known yet unfamiliar with horror critics makes a neat entry into the socommonly over rated french cinema a hostel wannabe reckon only saw fans would consider it arty it switches to rec and turns truly french in chapter three quite probably planned after a twodays course on horrormovieunexpected switchmaking after a nicelycrafted intro hollywoodfriendlyly flashbacked when deemed necessary the movie goes over two flips on the story if you dont know by the 5th minute of each chapter what is all about youll probably like it,cruel
is this a good film its not a good thing in the sense that a good poison is not a good thing its quite effective at making you feel very bad but not for a good enough reasonon reflection i have to agree with those reviewers who found the philosophical premise flimsy this is an ambitious film that attempts to transcend its genre in a way that even the most disturbing japanese horror films do not setting its aim so high means that it stands or falls on the theoretical premise and i dont think it does stand its just not worth iti was spellbound during the experience shocked into receptivity by the sheer nastiness of the events but the ending did not quite do the trick the victims final vision was clichd and having her whisper something incomprehensible was a copout in the end i felt that i had gone through a painful experience for no good reason i would not repeat that experience and i do not recommend itthere is a macho attitude among certain directors who value cynicism inhumanity and transgression for its own sake actually those values are quite easy to attain and rather immature most of us get it out of our system in our early 20s this affectedly cold attitude betrays a kind of spiritual impotence emotional smallness and misapprehension of life in those who express it the existential analogue of a porninduced hardon for an adolescent culture,cruel
after reading so much about the shocking rawness and violence from the film i have to confess i almost had fear to watch itwhen i finally saw iti was left amazed by this brilliant moviewhich has solid performancesa very ingenious screenplay and a disturbing intensity which makes it hugely superior to a lot hollywood movies belonging to the subgenus of torture cinema like hostelsaw 5 or captivitythe best element from this movie is definitely the screenplayit is perfectly structuredand a little bit after half an hourthere is an absolutely surprising twist which puts the movie on a different contextat the same time it shows mental and physical torture to brutal levels which produced a lot of shock on methe work of pascal laugier whose previous movie saint ange had not left me very satisfied was not only great on the screen writing fieldbut also on the directing fieldbecause the cold and at the same time relentless tone of the movie makes everything to feel very realisticmylne jampono and morjana alaoui bring extraordinary performancesbecause they are 100 credible and intense on every scene they appearthe only fail i found on this movie is that near the endingthe screenplay has a few forced elementsbutin spite of some minor failsis a film which is completely worthy of admirationi definitely recommend it to the fans of the horror cinema who are tired of all the remakesrehashes and imitations the north american cinema usually offers on this genrecomparing it with other extreme french horror moviesi would consider to be very superior to the overrated frontieresmarginally better than the brilliant haute tension and at the same level of a linterieuris an undoubtedly difficult experienceand i dare to say it may result intolerable to some casual spectatorssoi recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm but not without that warningin my casewas a devastating but unforgettable experience,cruel
one good horrifying experiencenever seen such a meaningful as well as a bloody horror moviestoryline is perfectdirection by pascal laugier is remarkable acting is flawless and everything elsei dont want to dwell into what the movie is about because that might just spoil the movie watching experiencebut i like add one thing about why i call this horror movie meaningful its because just look around whats happening on this planet people fight and kill others on account of each others religioncolor or even just for no reason or just make up some reason and go on a warpeople have lost control on themselves  and have no patience to just sit and think what this life is all about and appreciate it as its truly magnificentpeople follow religion to know the truth behind all this some want astrology to predict their future some want to know what really happens after death and leave science only to the poor scientists goodnesswhat a catastrophe is being made by humans in this worldgo watch this movie and add this movie to your dvd collection,cruel
wow   it takes a lot to provoke the wow factor from me i can go years  between seeing a movie and sitting glued to me seat long after the  lights have come back on where i am still in absolute astonishment of  what i have just witnessed  having just sat through i have a wow  is a french horror film that will remind north american  audiences of all the great goreporntorture films that have graced our  screens in the past decade it starts off with a bang literally  lucie is a young girl who was abducted and savagely abused she  escapes and fifteen years later she shows up at the door of an  unsuspecting family and blows them away with a shotgun it was the  first of many wow moments during the viewing the shotgun blasts as  they penetrate through the subwoofer were chair rattling and as the  blood gushes from each of the victims you will find yourself sitting  with your jaw on the floor wondering what is yet to come  enter annie lucies friend whom she met at the institution 15 years  ago annie arrives and tries to help lucie clean up the mess by mess  i mean blood and guts annie is a good friend and she has long been  compassionate to what lucie experienced at the hands of her captors and  to lucies skin ripping nightmares that she has had since her escape   we soon learn that the gunned down family may be those that were  responsible for lucies incarceration the actions from this point  forward in the lives of lucie and annie bring dire consequences and a  few twists that i didnt anticipate coming   no change that the dire consequences and few twists i really didnt  see coming in fact the story goes down a path that was engrossing  gross and had surprises for me at every turn  when it comes to goreporn there have been too many movies that would  have us gasp or look away from the screen without actually providing us  with any story or relevance hills have eyes anyone  separates itself from the pack and provides the viewer with a wicked  story that is backed up with enough violence and gore to do two films   oh and its scary too a couple of scenes that include the girl that  haunts lucie were downright frightening a bathroom scene with the two  got my legs off the floor and onto the seat to which i was sitting  by the time a group of aristocrats types show their interest in a  martyred annie you will be exhausted i was but in a good way a  bloody good way it will be no surprise to anyone that watches this  film what director pascal laugier has been given the keys to the remake  of the clive barker classic hellraiser  so there you have it has all the great elements of good horror  film it is gory scary at times terrifying and and disturbing every  year there is one great horror film that stands out from the rest in  2009 is my one to beat,cruel
this current french wave of horror is a real treat i find it much much more intriguing than the japanese ghost movies from the late 90s movies like haute tension ils frontires and especially  lintrieur manage to do what almost no horror movie can anymore they disturb me and i find myself thinking about these gruesome stories for days afterwards its not just the explicit violence but the way it is depicted and the fact that these movies go where as a watcher you instinctively wish they wouldnt and that is probably the essence of the horror genre what little borders there still are those french movie makers tear them down pascal laugier is no exceptionwhen i sat down to watch his movie i was in a really bad mood i had just missed a train i was looking for something to take my mind off my anger about the fact that i had to wait another day until i could finally get back home to my family did a pretty good job at taking my mind off that problem it starts off with a blast so many things happen within the first 30 minutes they suck you right into the moviethen things slow down and this is where some flaws become apparent firstly relies too much on violence im not offended by it or anything but in the middle of the movie all we get is people hurting themselves or others while the story doesnt move forward at all this is also where the movie loses its focus what are we supposed to worry about the most here the mystery around the main characters abduction or the weird monstrous woman that is haunting her then near the end of the movie all of a sudden a whole new spiritual angle is introduced to the story you could say that starts off at one point and ends in a completely different place the end credits draw the bow back to our main characters childhood but at that point their individual fates arent really what concern us anymoreits weird and difficult to put into words but the way unfolds makes you dizzy and thats part of what makes the movie so intriguing when at some point you start to think that this isnt more than a variation of hostel then the mindboggling uturn at the end will disabuse youin its worst moments is predictable and too violent for its own good however the whole experience of watching this is so disturbing and creepy that its hard to call laugiers movie anything but exceptional and thoroughly recommendable to any horror fan,cruel
i decided to watch this movie after reading a list of must see horror movies well i absolutely regret watching this terrible movie if you are looking for a real horror movie this is not what you are looking for this is a terribly boring movie about some girl wanting revenge but i never saw her act out this so called revenge the only thing remotely scary in this stupid movie was the weird ending i hate this movie the story line is not exciting at all and this whole movie doesnt make any sense at all i do not understand why this terrible movie has such a high rating it doesnt deserve it it is really a big disappointment,cruel
this film is so bad i want to harm someone like seriously its unnecessarily gory the plot is just stupid i really struggle to see how people like the film worst conclusion ever just very very bad dont watch it  dont waste the time seriously go pluck your pubes for 2 hours its more fun its just about a girl who got tortured and her family think shes insane cause she sees a dead girl who attacks her in the end of her life she kills herself her sister who was following her through her life manages to also end up getting abused by people her end up skinning her and she apparently sees the other world she tells the person who tortured her about the other world and the women kills herself other knowing just dont watch it its freakin spit there are some good horror scene but they are mainly early in the film the rest is very disappointing so my advice is dont watch it but if you must watch roughly the first 13  after the first sister kills herself,cruel
the movie is very bad so not worth it i watched 10 minutes of the movie and i gave up watching the rest because it is horrible and it has nothing to do do not waste time watching it because a film is very weak style of those monsters unfortunately the people here on imdb is taking note 10 for a movie that sucks good movies are those that fear giving frights and not the ones that look like monsters  this is fime for children who like the style of monsters but for an adult is a film that is too weak poorly made has nothing to do with the synopsis of the movie and unfortunately i lost a good time of my life watching this crapnote 110,cruel
this movie is really bad in fact its the worst ive ever seeni guess ill start with the only positive aspect i can find about it the directing isnt that bad its all downhill from therethe acting is absolutely deplorable i honestly cant believe itthe script is mindblowing i mean it is this even about anything its like they were making some kind of college experiment and then decided to make it into a movie so 34 through they decided to give it a point i would believe that explanation if someone told me it was true because i honestly believe a creative 12 year old could write a more coherent story heres the timeline we have the beginning of the movie where theres a short backstory and the girl busts in and kills that whole familynext is just filler literally they talk about leaving but instead they stay there for no explainable reason for days the original girl starts being chased by some monster of course its just a hallucination the movie teases you with this possibility before its revealed as if its some kind of original idea cough fight club and every other movie after it cough naturally this has nothing to do with the plot we find out one of the family members is still alive and the girls disagree on whether or not they should kill her does this have a purpose of course not its just more time wasting it doesnt develop character it doesnt develop the plot its just filler until the big torture sceneafter that one of the girls dies which is good because i dont think i could take that acting anymore now her friend stays there even longer some other filler stuff happens and then she gets tortured by a group whos trying to understand what happens after you die now the movie rips off every other tortureporn movie youve ever seen theres this one original part where they feed the girl some kind of slop i guess thats the disturbing momentshe does reach the afterlife i guess and then the woman in charge of the organization kills herself what happened i guess the afterlife must be good right well i have a better theory its called who cares obviously a movie like this isnt gonna have a coherent ending so just be happy the credits are rolling,cruel
this is a tough one because this was made extremely well and underneath it all there is an interesting story revealed in a very interesting way but as the story is this is actually a 20 minute short film filling the other 80 minutes in with torture and human suffering that doesnt push along the story out of principle i cant recommend this film and gets 1 stars this one could have been a stellar movie but the creators have somehow misunderstood the meaning of horror when did horror cinema become horrible cinema horror is about exploring the dark side of human nature the things that scare us through entertainment these stories define what is good and evil not forcing the viewer to go through every little gruesome detail that would happen if the event were really to occur but just enough to frighten us and gross us out so that we know that this is evil something to be frightened of but in films like this there is no distinction between the good and evil there is no statement about reality there is only mimicking of the worst parts of reality things like this remind me of experimentation nazis did thinking its cool in what way is human suffering cool no one should actually have to endure such a horrible experience in real life so then why would i want to see it and all its minute details as a form of pleasure baffling,cruel
i guess i will never understand people who like the horror genre does watching this make them feel tough do they find some meaning in this artificial pain and suffering this is nothing compared to what happens in real life and screenwriters and directors who make this sort of films seem to be bored overgrown kids with no life experience and imagination and then people say how it is an exploration of psyche and blah blah everyone who is not too prudish can make up three stories like this before breakfast and if you think you cant i can only say that the evolution god or whatever you believe in hasnt been too kind to you every once in a while i think to myself  maybe im missing out on something not watching horror films so i watch something and every time i regret it luckily i was able to fast forward through the meaningless scenes of torture and violence only to find that theres no excuse for it in the end there never is with horror movies i have watched almost the whole film to witness the whole 5 minutes or so of something that was supposed to be a story a bunch of old people who are eager to know about afterlife so they torture young girls hahahahaha what a joke if you like seeing torture gore and violence thats fine by me as long as nobodys really hurt against their will i enjoy watching pornography from time to time but i dont go around calling it an art,cruel
if you arent aware of the brutal high art horror films that have been pumped out left and right from the genius minds of the french then you must have been living in a cave for the past two decades especially this last one is yet another vicious dementedly violent masterpiece that the french can call their own and possibly the most brutal one yet the highly original premise starts with 2 women one of which who has never quite recovered from being chained and tortured in a dark room for most of her childhood who set out for revenge to the people who were responsible dont fret this is not your average torture porn type movie unlike the american films who touch similar subjects enlightens us with a what how and why as the plot moves forward after brutally murdering an entire family in their home the girls find that the family is not the only ones responsible for the unspeakable acts forced upon lucie as a child again just to clarify goes far beyond the violence of a typical horror film and transcends the very idea of the horror genre fans of horror and high art cannot go to the grave without seeing this film those who have a weak stomach or who do not like high art cinema need to stay very far away form the film those in the middle need to proceed with caution will change the way you look at life and death,cruel
has to be one of the most brutal and mindshattering horror films i have ever seenit is awashed with extreme crueltyhuman suffering and despairlucie is found running halfnaked down a country road after having been missing for over a yearduring this time she had been held captive and subjected to mental and physical torture before she was able to make her escapeshe was imprisoned in the abandoned slaughterhousebut the building had been evacuated and her abusers were never apprehendedlucie is placed in an orphanage where she eventually forms a bond with another young girl named annawho resides therethe first half deals mostly with lucieanna and the events that lead up to finding the people lucie feels are her past abusersthe film pulls no punches when it comes to delivering extreme violence and crueltyit leaves the lasting impression on the viewer when its overthe acting by both young ladies is exceptional and their bond is believablepascal laugier seems to seek the meaning in the human pain through repetitive acts of violence and transgressiondespite being vile and misanthropic there is philosophical meaning in all this suffering galoreis the film that makes the viewer uncomfortable and i applaud it for thatan opus magnum of extreme horror10 out of 10,cruel
i finally watched on dvd im french live in paris but i chose not to see laugiers film on theater i didnt feel ready now its done watched it in my darkened living room is in my mind it will be for a long time i assume is it a masterpiece god who cares its just amazingly brilliant i cant believe so many people are insulting the guy who made this piece of work i feel relieved so many people love it the way i do itll take time to fully understand how miraculous this film is im not exaggerating since when a film has done such an effect to the audience has created that kind of passionated controversy are you all so arrogant or asleep or both of it that you dont even realise when real important art is coming to the screen more than a film is a real experience the kind of experience that changes you deeply affection emotion contamination thats what art is all about i watch movies to live real moments whatever is the nature of this moment is just unforgettable a lovable film of course not much more than that im sick of lovable films art is not lovable thanks mister laugier im sure youll still be in the place in a few decades still doing unique stuff while your detractors will still be dreaming nothing more about writing and directing such a powerful film thank you and may you have a long and inspiring life,cruel
practically speaking has no redeeming qualities other than the intensity which the two principal actresses invest in their agonies as they are emotionally and physically violated again and againfrankly speaking i am not one to support censorship of the cinema in any real way however one has to ask why was this movie ever made  whatever it cost to make was wasted money as there is not one shred of redemption packed into this horrible horror movie the mean bad and evil witch character kills herself at the  almost  end of what can only be described as the most loathsome and venal film ever lensed if this is the epitome of french cinema because the cinematography is so good which it is then it is time for the french to examine themselves and seek the corruption in their own souls it is a revolting fictionit is antihuman in the most explicit of ways it is without merits other than the aforementioned cinematography it is pornography with blood and much suffering and meaningless violence one supposes that the crew was simply happy to get their paychecks but this disgusting film will likely leave a stain on their bank accounts forever and everthis is a horror movie it is a horrible movie it is depraved with a near total indifference to any of the values that civilized people hold dear the director the staff the company are all guilty of crimes against humanity and deserve the opprobrium of any and all film buffs who have even one shred of decency left in themselves it was worse than mere words can convey and speaks only to the depravity and the paucity of imagination of all the principals involved in it,cruel
this movie is not suitable for all viewers most of the scenes are disturbingbeating a woman again and again skinned alive are most brutal scenesthis movie is only for who love violent and realitic brutalitynot recommended for womens,cruel
only for torture movie fansit says horror mystery drama but it would be insult for horror and mystery genre drama yea it is and extremely sick one toomy personal opinion is that movie crew should be hospitalized in mental institution starting with writer and director together with those who honestly and deeply enjoyed watching this crap310it would be 1 but main actress is good and end has a trace of sense and brains,cruel
okay firstly i would like to say that visually is amazing i love the design of it it looks very nice i love the sublevel set ups and the overall design if i were going off that id be giving it a 610 rating because honestly it was a very visually interesting movie to watch but im not going off that im going off the film in generalbut on the real nature and story of the film it really wasnt that interesting and you know maybe im just a closed minded piece of crap with no taste for true cinematic masterpieces but was not the religious experience that people make it out to be the movie really only depicted 90 minutes of glorified abuse and torture and ended with spoilerthe flaying of a young woman who then reveals what exists after death to a woman who then kills herself for having heard what lies beyondend spoilerso really it just didnt do that much other than just be a torture porn movie also i love the addition of women playing a role in the abuse so it makes it not as bad that apparently women are the only people who can be abused and tortured into enlightenment like please i know that was a cheap way to try and lessen the sexism in this film and it didnt work,cruel
i dont know where to start with this review no credible motive for the bad guys in this movie the ending was cheap and shoved a lacking of imagination from the screen writers dont get me wrong i love to not get every answer served to me on a plate like most american movies do but it must be done in an intelligent way i love french film and the horror genre but this is just crap okay it had its moments in the start when she were attacked by this spiritor her imagination but every god quality were soon forgotten wen the rest of the movie was like a badly written saw moviei just want to say that the acting is god and this is not their fault,cruel
oh my god this is one of the few films i seen that made me feel sick to my stomach i mean senseless violence against women i can not fathom how this film got approved to be released or why anybody would make a film like this in the first place it should never have been made this movie is way beyond despicable disgusting and depraved i also found it extremely misogynistic if there is anything that makes me furious it would be violence against women and people getting tortured for no good reason which is definitely what happens in this film in my book is one of those films i consider to be the lowest of the low and that makes me want to puke my guts out this movie should be banned,cruel
here there be spoilersive read reviews that called this film transcendental and meaningful and other things to that effect but in the end is torture porn  la franaise thats really all this islet me preface this by saying that i am not easily disturbed and not generally averse to violence and gore in film whether it serves a meaningful purpose or not gore for gores sake is just as fine with me as is gore for meanings sake what irks me however is when a deeper meaning is merely affected to hide the fact that really its all about the gore is a shining example of this the last act of the film makes the attempt to philosophise everything that went on beforehand and it fails on a spectacular level this might have to do with the somewhat patchwork structure of the film even while watching the film it seemed as if it consisted of three very different ideas stitched together the beginning takes its cues from classic horror movie tropes then it makes a sharp turn toward a thriller and finally plunges headlong into the world of torture porn this leaves us with three pieces of a film that feel very different most of all because of a sudden change of protagonist that comes with this the first part makes out lucie to be the main character not least because we bear witness to her hallucinations then anna takes her place and in the last part she becomes justifiably mute and inactive this leads to a real difficulty at least for me to identify with any of these characters and ultimately takes a whole lot of punch out of the torture sequences later on if i am not invested in a character seeing that character be tortured for the better part of half an hour is not going to affect me emotionally what im seeing is an actress and an actor performing a scripted sequence some have said that this was hard to sit through and having heard those sentiments before i wondered if something was wrong with me when i felt rather bored during the last part of the film instead of being properly horrified at the human propensity for violence but it wasnt violence i was seeing it was acting and it served no purpose other than to horrify and disgust the viewer having failed to be horrified by the goingson i hoped for a great revelation of any kind whatsoever a justification for the hour and a half that went beforehand and then the film ends there is no explanation there is no twist there is not even the explanation that there is no explanation so even as a statement on nihilism it fails bang the end thats it even tripe such as hostel had a flimsy explanation for its ludicrous plot no such luck with so lacking any emotional investment in the characters a coherent plot motivation and sense this is just violence and gore for its own sake which would be fine if there wasnt the constant sensation of the director tapping the viewer on the shoulder saying see what i did there clever isnt it see those pictures see how ive made annas revelation silent to keep everyone guessing see that home video footage with the end credits its all terribly clever but you probably dont get it its art you know this is definitely not violent for violences sake no its definitely notyes yes it definitely istwo stars for the good performance by mylne jampano the movie itself was anything but good,cruel
i watched this movie because i enjoyed the directors tall man someone reviewing that film mentioned this one saying that it contained social comment as did tall man the first part of this movie seemed gritty and quite realistic and i could empathize with the characters who were abused children the second part of the movie it has three distinct parts begins with a shocking scene which i felt totally morally bankrupted the film as the abused girl kills children the children of her abusers maybe its just me but i have a hard time believing someone tortured as a child and still in great pain from it would coldly murder other children in any case this second section is more standard horror movie fare and i lost my empathy for the main character as an abused child the second main character alone survives until the third section here she is accosted and tortured graphically for a long period of time at this point as i did with funny games im asking myself why are the filmmakers showing me this i am not entertained by watching people suffer unless there is some redeeming meaningful reason for showing this unfortunately i could not find one here a gang of insane old rich white people babbling some quasimetaphysical nonsense aint a reason crazy people will commit any manner of atrocity but it wont make any sense and i dont need to watch it thank god this director got a little more realistic for his next feature if you want to show children being tortured you better have a hell of a good reason for it the last two thirds of this film just left me empty amazingly i didnt even feel for the girl who gets tortured in the last third thats how meaningless this scene was i saw a reason why hanaeke was showing me pain in funny games that i as an audience member was a voyeur and noes irreversible showed me the truly sickening nature of real outofcontrol violence i felt the violence in those films was justified here i could find no justification,cruel
if the past few years have taught us anything its that you can never underestimate the french when it comes to delivering topnotch horror movies like high tension and inside before it is the latest film to be subjected to a wealth of internet hype and to gain significant notoriety in the states especially for a foreign film but as director pascal laugier states in his introduction on the dvd the film was merely an experiment in cinema and subsequently will evoke a reaction in any viewer whether its a positive or a negative onethats pretty much the story of a tricky film that is part revenge part cerebral thriller while it lacks the visceral punch of other films its been compared to the film is perhaps one of the most ambitious in recent years in his film laugier shows many influences ranging from the works of stanley kubrick to even hellraiser a film which the director was briefly attached to remake recently but integrates them all into a film that is unmistakably his own blatantly going out of his way to avoid typical film clichs and overdone visualeffects laugiers film presents itself as bluntly and realistically as possible the way the film is shot is very matteroffact showing the extreme violence exactly as it is the lack of stylization is a style all its own giving the film its own unmistakable and dreadful atmosphere all of this is driven home with intense performances from its two leads  morjana alaoui and mylene jampanoi  who go a long way to invoke sympathy in the audience and establish a very human factor that is important to the films credibility especially when it reaches ridiculous heights in the third actwhere is heavy on the violence and dread its problems stem from its severe lack of focus the film shifts gears very sharply in its final act and the buildup that precedes it is nearly destroyed the very visceral first twothirds of the film seem to have been forsaken for an ending that will leave many scratching their heads wondering what kind of film they just saw the ending itself is bold and will incite conversation long after the credits have rolled but doesnt really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie to put it simply is two movies in one and unfortunately its final act doesnt do the film justice having said that however is still a bold and very unique experience in film one that any horror fan or anyone in general should see for themselves in order to develop their own opinion this is truly one film that will be interpreted differently by everyone and in spite of its obvious flaws wont soon be forgotten,cruel
this extremely gory horror film from france is obviously not for all tastes but it is very well done and interesting for those with a strong stomach it starts as a somewhat run of the mill  if extremely bloody  example of the torture porn film genre  a seemingly deranged woman enters a home and kills all the members of its seemingly nice family but as the movie progresses it turns into something else  the woman was kept by this family when she was a child in a dungeon  and it has a stunning and very original twist in the final and brutal last half hour  not going to reveal too much here but this family was part of a sect seemingly trying to decipher some of lifes existential mysteries overall one of the best horror films released in the last few years,cruel
i think that about covers it but while were on the subject if you want martyrdom of a female heroine watch breaking the waves if you want a sense of visceral horror watch the texas chainsaw massacre in fact watch anything in between both films show you can move or shock an audience without needing to endlessly oh so very endlessly brutalize women like steaks under a braising hammer or even shave their skin off in search of whats on the other sidebut hey maybe im just old fashioned its a shame because the film starts promisingly and looks like it might bring a sensitivity to the subject matter of abuse and build character relationships in a paced and involving manner nope in the same way that the film appears to first be one thing then another then anotherbut not in a good way  any early seeds of promise are trampled underfoot and boy do the joins showhow do we change it into something other than standard torture porn fare cue weird strange lady from shady organisation with sinister aims yaaawn with creaky bond villainesque dialogue we were you might sayless organised in the past yup so was indiecar but at least they go round in circles to an ultimate end sadly this just putters up its own self importance until i was left with nothing but a feeling of two hours wasted and the need for a shower yeck for the stale torture porn and double yeck for the attempts to dress it up as a metaphysical meditation bad doggy,cruel
is averageit is not a philosophical masterpiece searching for answers about the human condition the central premise is interesting but the payoff is so so feeble  if youve ever watched the excellent video for the song just by radiohead then that is the sum total of the payoff its fine for a music video which only has to justify 3 minutes of action but when your movie has been responsible for the previous half hour of relentless violence you really need to come up with something better the movie is also far too predictablethe film can be split into two definite halves and the first half is considerably better than the second the visceral reality of someone haunted by childhood demons is beautifully visualised  although i find it hard to believe anyone believed that the demon was anywhere but within lucies head the second half brutal and near bereft of dialogue is a real drag the fact that the payoff is so poor renders it all worthlessincidentally i dont buy all these reviewers who criticise the film for the fact that anna doesnt call the police instead going to sleep next to her dead friend she is exhausted grieving traumatised and doesnt want to be implicated in mass murder she doesnt call the police when she discovers a mistreated girl in the basement because she knows they are in a remote and isolated house she goes to sleep next to her lost love who is lying in state its really not that hard to followall in all no masterpiece it has some good ideas but the writerdirector chooses a copout ending when the whole point of the central premise is that there can be no resolution,cruel
going into this movie which was and still is called many things i wasnt sure what to expect by choice i refuse to read many things about the movies i watch which also is apparent by my comments on the movies themselvesso going into the movie i was kinda afraid what would come they made a big deal about the past of a girl that is found at the beginning of the movie so i was constantly on the edge of my seat expecting a flashback with gruesome stuff  lets just say i was in for a surpriseespecially because the movie itself despite all the violence has a philosophical touch to it i cant put my finger on it but you cant compare it to inside or frontiers one being a fun slasher the other a bizarre slasher that is kinda funny but both without anything to say reallythere are a few things that i didnt like one concerning one of the main characters but that didnt affect my overall feeling for this movie its not fun to watch but it might get you thinking about a few things ,cruel
this is if not the worst one of the ugliest horror movies ever madethere are several reasons to say thisfirst in any suspensehorror movie tension is suppose to escalate through the film or at least be kept at a constant level here they show you the best during the first 30 minutes of the movie and then they go down in flames the torture scenes from the friend of the main character didnt meant a thing to me almost fell asleepsecond the plot is ridiculous some idiotpeople cult is trying to find god by torturing people and watching their faces so it doesnt matter whether you were hitler in your life if tortured painfully enough you may see god and become a martyr stupid concept filled with fallaciesthird the ending is pathetic it doesnt add up to the movie neither represents an open ending which is they were trying to make i guessi guess that after watching this one frontieres and eden lake a frenchenglish production french people suck fat dicks when making horror movies,cruel
i began watching director pascal laugiers with much anticipation after what id read about it so far lots was said about how this film belonged to a new era of french horror films the film began on an extremely promising note with a scene of a physically abused and tortured little girl escaping to freedom the next few minutes that followed sort of spoke about the dark shape of things to come i continued watching spellbound as the movie unfolded i watched in shock and amazement as the blood spilled the flesh ripped bodies piled up and surprises were delivered at breakneck speed add to that a claustrophobic atmosphere and some brilliant acting from the two lead performers mylne jampano and morjana alaoui nothing much is said or explained during this timeand there is almost no explanation or meaning to the bizarre gory drama that unfolds this imho was an added advantage that made this one hell of a moviewatching experiencethe runtime ticked to about 58 minutes and then something happenedthe proceedings were turned over their head and a fullfledged explanation was finally given about the why what how etc and i must confess that i was extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this sudden change of events it all seemed so lame and absurd to me that i almost thought that this wasnt really it thered got to be morethe entire last half hour then endlessly rambled onand believe it or not i was still waiting for a satisfying convincing finish to the filmhoping for more i wasnt particularly expecting a happy ending or allneatlywrappeduppackagebut at least something that wouldnt be entirely futile but i never experienced that satisfaction as the ending credits rolledthe whole thing turned out to be just a pointless exercise in gore torture porn if you must with an absolutely weak central plot a huge letdowni am not averse to watching excessive gore on screen i have enjoyed other movies in the genre earlier but most of them had plots with lots of meat to go along with all the bloodbathwatch for a welldirected brilliant first hour and for the terrific performances of the two lead performers but do not expect an equally great story and perhaps you wont be as disappointedrating 410,cruel
this much vaunted french horror movie turns out to be a total mess suitable only for those who are ashamed of liking gore movies and so want very juvenile intellectualism thrown into the mix to justify watching them not exactly ground breaking for instance the objects of our gaze are scantily clad nubile young women having bad things done to themthere is an attempted justification for this later on  it is like much else of the plot infantile the film has a strange structure  the first part is haute tension without the tension this is done reasonably well but is full of clichs do bodies really fly yards through the air when being hit by bullets the law of conservation of momentum holds the answer and it aint whats on view here still it will appeal to fans of the colour red who dont mind watching killers cry endlessly interminably is much the more accurate word here rather than laugh demoniacally or eat their victims at half way there is a sudden change of pace and tone all of a sudden the maker is attempting to make hellraiser as it would have been made by the great danish filmmaker dreyer of course it lacks the kinky fun of hellraiser to say nothing of the spiritual charge of the great dane in fact the second part comes out much closer to hostel than any of its lofty aims hostel that is without the cheap laughs or bad acting which all means it is a lot less fun than hostel but takes itself so seriously that the immature will think it a work of art btw the level of gore in this movie was not as high as inside  still the best of recent french horror,cruel
i will never forget this movie the best horror movie and it crawls under your skin so well played and so evil,cruel
dont want to say anything about this filmif your a horror fan its horror in its purest form,cruel
it is a real horror movie that you actually feel sorry about the victim and imagine the pain i love it when you actually see a monsters face this is true thriller not just jump scares the two halfs of the movie is too separated otherwise id give it a ten also i am pretty sure about the end is inspired from official video of radioheadjust amazingsorry for english,cruel
well lots of reviews so i dont write too much about the story imo the best part of is the first half but after revealing of the truth behind all the torturing this movie got in my eyes some kind of comical i mean the whole purposepremise of torturing someone to transcendent him any neurologist or doctor could tell u what will happen after someone has to endure too much physicallypsychological paintrauma and it certainly has nothing to do with the afterlife or other dimensions or whatever you get a good shot of endorphines and maybe some dissociation etc so watching the beatings etc i was the whole time asking myself in the 2nd part of that movie how so many people a cult or whatever looked like rich old ppl afraid of death and their servants or whatever can be so dumb to believe they could get a insight of the life after death by torturing someone the solution of this movie really sucks so whats left a good slasher in the first half with some drama after that we see something like mel gibsons the passion of christ if i compare the torture scenes i got to say that the passion of christ is far far better  it got me far more emotionally involved the pain of the mother watching her son being whipped etc the torture scenes of are in the given context some kind of a misskick  the motivation behind it is so unbelievable that i didnt get in any kind of sense emotionally involved what i also dont understand is why the girl didnt try to strangle one of the captors with the chains  long enough they are so whats left the actors did well ofc a minus for me is all the french emotional tantrum the camera works also fine verdict not really bad but in no way a cinematic triumph or mustsee,cruel
as a 7 stars rated at the time i was expecting a good horror movie but in my opinion it could hardly called averageunlike lucie anna is not performing her best in this movie specially the way she acts on the horrific and terrifying sequences she was way too calm and quiet some times speechless tooi personally like the lucies character which it was very straight forward as a horror movies characters who are after a bloody revenge someone who has been seriously suffered the pain and torture her eyes tells you everythingin overall still i could call it way better than many horror movies such as inside which is absolutely waste of time however it is way beyond something like 1408 ring shutter saw13 or undoubtedly others,cruel
after all the hype about i was expecting some really nasty torture scenes which is why i put off watching this film for so long however i neednt have worried as for at least a third of the running time it is a bloke punching and slapping a girl in the face not a good thing or something i enjoyed watching but certainly i didnt find myself averting my gaze from the screen as i did when i watched another french film the really rather gruesome frontiers perhaps im being a little disingenuous there are nasty moments to be found in but is it torture porn as some seem to be suggesting not for me if anything sexuality is played down for example mylne jampano possibly one of the most beautiful women in the world spends most of this film dressed in a beanie hat and long overcoat as if she has come to collect your weekly rubbish on the few occasions there is nudity the camera certainly doesnt linger on the androgynous looking bodies on offer there are certainly no bigboobed chicks running around with their cleavage on display a la most horror films and non of the torture had a sexual element or motive so i dont see that the torture porn accusation is meriteddid i enjoy this film not really i dont think it is a film meant to be enjoyed it was well acted and directed with an unusual premise but ultimately  not a film i will watch again or recommend to anyone,cruel
and what were ultimately allowed to witness is at its core some pretty emptyheaded although visceral existentially sadistic nonsense nonetheless i cant deny that packs a punch several of them in fact to the face and gut repeatedly to its protagonist after fooling us about who the real protagonist is its ultraviolence that alex and his droogies would lap up like synthemesc milkplus presumably the audience is meant to as well aha but auteur pascal the tall man laugier isnt through with us yet after rubbing our collective noses in viscous pools of vengeance and hallucinatory blood guilt he dials up the sadism a few more notches with a tiresome third act that trucks in absurdist fantasies of an elite cabal searching for proof of an afterlife through the inducement of a tortured vision of what can only be feebly represented by a coruscating white lightwhat tripeneither the acting chops of the two leads which are considerable nor the overall production values including some very convincing grand guignol splatter and grue can conceal the vacuous conceit of the films plot nor the soulless nihilism of its theme leaves its audience numbed by its brutality but with precious little else and ultimately comes off as mere tortureporn with a glib pretension of meaning i wont say its not worth watching but be prepared to be unsatisfied mayhaps that was laugiers intent if so his intentions were shallow and venal,cruel
a martyr voluntarily accepts death and they understand their belief in a cause will lead to death but post death they will inspire others to an admirable causethis is not a horror film an entity throughout the first 40 minutes is kinda spookyit is brilliantly actedafter the first 70 minutes which we thought was ok and building the plot it took a turn for sadistic torture and unrelenting abuse the young woman did not have a belief in a cause for which she was being tortured for hence not about martydom very disappointed we finished the movie,cruel
ive always been a big horror fan but i just couldnt handle this movie the plot itself was decent the premise made sense the whole lets torture people till they let go thing but the level of torture and what was actually shown was just too much the removal of annas skin was what did it it really disturbed me that someone would survive that that someone did that to her on purpose ive been paranoid of getting kidnapped since watching this movie but what i did really like was how believable it was that the girl lucie was seeing was real until right before her death i think thats why i gave this a 3 instead of a 2 or 1,cruel
wow did i have high hopes after reading some of the fawning reviewsim a little angry with myself after being lured into another stylish but noplot movie from europe its as if they are so desperate for a good movie they will give bs reviews to push the movie along the whole time i was watching this i kept thinking dont worry something good will happen all of those reviews couldnt be wrong the main flaw of the movie is the story i watched the movie like a staving man eager for any crumb of a plotso they torture girls to death hoping to get an eyewitness account from some of them then they get a good account but the person who heard it kills herself before she reveals itthe 2 girls are pretty and give very good performances it is a well produced professional movie but the story is something id expect from 10th grade creative writing class avoid this one,cruel
i have seen every hardcore film there is to see and every frightening ghost story and psychological horror there is to see and to be honest even films like inside irreversible the august underground series murder set pieces although brutal in nature have imo nothing on this film and that goes for just about any other film out therethe latest new wave of extreme french torture horror call it what you will reaches its pinnacle here and its not just about blood and guts either its much more than thatanybody who has never seen a horror film in their life and someone who even has no interest in the horror genre should watch this film its more than than just sheer brutal graphic horror here and if you can see past that you will feel the long lasting emotional impact this film will leave on you foreverone of the most powerful films of all time,cruel
i was really enjoying the movie but along the way the director misled me several times its an insane movie that doesnt know what it is its like the movie was made by a film student who took elements from several horror movies and used them all at once in the wrong way the movie shoots in every possible direction without hitting a single target the main problem here in my view is that the movie takes itself too seriously and just goes everywhere its like the director wanted to combine the exorcist the hostel and funny games in a single picture and it just didnt work its not appealing to me its just cheap senseless violence,cruel
as any follower of the genre by now knows the most original and audacious horror films of the past decade have been receiving a hasty theatrical release in america at best before finding their audiences on dvd whether this is because of the outpouring of the amount of subtitled horror endeavors the effect that the flood of pg13 rated widerelease horror movies have had or the um emerging awareness that horror fans are a lucrative although rather decisively distinct niche the truths of the marketplace have guaranteed that people who are just seeing mainstream horror films are missing opportunities for the genres most electrifying recent harvests it may be no shock then that pascal lugiers which is almost certainly the most ferocious unwavering horror film of the decade has found itself premiering on dvd in americawhat most singles out from other recent horror films is its degree of determination to talk about its plot is to deprive the film of its huge gut blow maybe its best simply to observe that its keen to delve totally into its themes chancing audience infidelity as it incessantly redefines what breed of movie its seeking to be as this warped excursion into shame vengeance and evil unfurls we find ourselves aligned with two institutionalized girls one after another an ordinary nuclear family a woman assailed by some sort of demon her besieged friend and unreciprocated lover and the members of an underground organization as intentions become clearer audience pities are made to modify coercing us to suspect our function as viewers once the complete intensity of lugiers depravity is unraveled the film divulges itself as a contemplation of being preytells a story that is not only gashed into distinct acts but also is prepared to transfer into altogether separate subgenres of the horror film to realize its purpose which unquestionably concerns nurturing audience awareness about their bond with the pandemonium it depicts its alternatively a psychological thriller a slasher movie a monster movie and a torture porn endurance trial while the story is intended to keep viewers guessing its also resolved to defy our notions about what altitudes of onscreen torment and agony we can find tolerable in both length and concept the brutality continually tests us throughout the sequence of the film gore is used to traumatize repulse gratify visually make us writhe and make us feel for the victimwhen a thirdact development begins to portray such cruelty as something cyclical and numbing ends up rising above any audience bloodlust posing the query of whether radical delineations of screen violence can take audiences any closer to common realities about our nature in its numerous contortions it appears to suspect why we treat ourselves to watching horror movies at all editing follows a number of frames centered on the animal temperament of time cutting to the next shot despite what is occurring within the image so our most primitive and emotional responses play a part in the lack of being able to predict what could possibly come next but cutting rooted in time using the visual structure of the shots along with the varying momentum of the cadenced cuts persuades more difficult connotations than thatit upsets exactly because it sabotages expectations of the torture film genre and gives a motive beyond sheer sadism at the same time giving some insight into lugiers own posturing the unmitigated final sequence is monotonous deliberately but it summarizes the same despair that the rest of the movie seeks as moves toward its end it gets tantalizingly close to gusting the subtextual reverberations of the horror genre into the open compelling us to tackle some revolting realities it closes with an ultimate absolute substantiation of despair a vital loss of hope that sends viewers out of its diagetic world with a jolt harder than any show of blood and guts could administer possibly more than any other horror film displays the scope of the genres resources to come across ways to stimulate goad and alarm us it attempts and achieves so much that it makes most contemporary movies despite genre look complacent,cruel
those crazy french have done it again not contented to leave well enough alone after plumbing the gritty dirtstrewn depths of bloody sadistic romance alexandre ajas high tension the metaphoric and actual traumas of pregnancy julien maury and alexander bustillos inside and the shamelessness of gory homage xavier gens frontiers along comes pascal laugier who is slated to helm the upcoming hellraiser redux with a film that takes a relentless deadlyserious approach to child abuse vengeance and the psychological scar tissue that remains years later as with the aforementioned films this is a heavily stylized and deliberately structured tale and as pervasively discomforting as these films are they are bringing a socially conscious coat of legitimacy to the horror genre as a whole that never quite settles on a consistent tone always keeping the viewer disconcerted and on edge the plot follows a young girl committed to a hospital after suffering horrific abuse seen mostly in dimlylit quick cuts 15 years later she hunts down those she thinks are responsible with the help of an uncertain accomplice bloodshed gives way to the manifestation of irrepressible memories and the introduction of a mysterious sect masking a sinister purpose laugiers tone remains slightly surreal throughoutindeed a film about such damagedderanged characters calls into question whether the world we see is solely informed by their own not to mention the directors distorted subjectivity and the performances are appropriately contradictory we sympathize with the plight of our antiheroes even in the midst of coldblooded murder and jawloosening abuse but their beyondrepair psychosis keeps us from truly condoning their actions from this an interesting complication emerges as with pasolinis salo has no real moral compass to keep us grounded in a sense of security and normalcy as a result we transpose our own ethical and emotional sensibilities on the tormented by its close has almost gone too far indulging overthetop violence that threatens to undo what has gone on beforeyet with an ending that delivers something contrary to the nihilism we have just experienced i cant help but applaud its audacity,cruel
first off just let me start by saying this i have seen a lot of movies but i never wanted to open an account on this page so bad this movie while yes gory and disturbing makes you think about just how sick some people are and for the people who didnt like it i feel sorry for you it shook me to the core i have been waiting for a movie like this im an american and i have to say im very ashamed of my countries quality of horror and psych like thrill rides we try with terrible movies like saw one of the worst horror series everthen this piece of art comes along and restores my faith in this very genre which has suffered do to bad titles i will refer this film to all my friends and you should see it as well,cruel
is amazing ive never seen another movie quite like it i waited a very long time to see this and i was not disappointed if you dont have a weak constitution see this immediately sacry,cruel
i wouldnt consider myself someone who dislike excessive goreviolencetorture i love hostile cannibal holocaust and i think green inferno was pretty goodbut to me a horror movie that has excessive gore has to be doing it for a purpose to scare to make social commentary or just to amuse in the case of green infernomartyr seems to be torture for repulsions sake which i am against like august mordum requiem i dont care for movie thats showing me realistic torture just to disturb meits not really scary and more just disgustingits just excessive with the torture and at the end all they throw on it is an ambiguous ending that doesnt really make the slog through the torture worth italthough i liked the ending and do think about it from time to time it was one of the only parts i liked about the movieif i were to rewatch it i would only watch the ending and that to me is a bad signi dont want to be the person who gives a movie a bad review because its too graphic but i will be the guy who gives it a bad review because the movie is just glorified torture porn with only a okay ending that offers very little in terms of commentarythought provoking but just enough to give it a 7the ending is the only thing that saves this movie for me and even than its just one of those half assed the writer couldnt think of a good enough answer to the questions he asked so he just left them unanswered copout endingwatch this movie if you want to see realistic torture if you expect more out of a film than just watch a youtube video explaining the plot isnt really much to explain because the writer clearly didnt have an answer so he left it a mystery,cruel
a film that shouldnt be missed seems like a generic story but hits you with so many twists and turns youll be surprised that it started where it did this definitely stands above what we see mostly from production companies like blumhouse who i think had a part in the stupid and uninspired american remake as its not afraid to take risks and go all out with everything it has to say hopefully one day this film will be treated with more respect in the future and maybe hollywood will someday decide to take interest in the more unconventional route until then go watch this movie,cruel
one thing that i have noticed about some of the reviews on this film is how bloody gorey violent etc it is and how its violent to just be violent i cannot agree with that statement at all the film tells a story of revenge at first and then shifts to a psychological thriller for the second half lucie is the first half and her story is to make you sympathize with the character while annas story is meant to provoke thought when luciesstory was being shown there was a moment where i thought maybe she had killed this family of four for no reason other than she mistook them for her captors 15 years earlier i was on the fence about it and so was anna when she tries to help the wife escape until lucie kills her with a hammer it isnt until lucie ends her own life and anna finds a woman that has been kept down in their torture room for at least 15 years did i realize that lucie wasnt crazy and really truly sympathized with her character after freeing the woman some people in all black come in and kill the girl and take anna prisoner as they subject her to horrible experiments designed to break her will and cause her to give up all hope after awhile she finally does this and upon letting go she is able to become a witness or martyr and see into the afterlife without having died this is what the cult like group wanted all along they wanted to have the knowledge of what was on the other side the head of the group a rather old women comes and asks anna what she saw anna whispers to her what it was but we as the audience never actually know what is said it is after this that the woman goes into the bathroom and takes her own life but before she does this she tells one of her servants to keep denying when talking about the afterlife this statement is what the entire film is about denial is what keeps us going and keeps us from doing certain things in the case of the writer it was stopping him from killing himself since he wrote the film while being horribly depressed not knowing what the afterlife holds helped him realize he didnt need to kill himself because if we know what lies behind death then life would be meaningless,cruel
agreeing to help a childhood friend exact revenge on those who she suspects abused her as a child has severe consequences for a young qubcoise woman in this unusual thriller the film has been described as everything from a horror movie to torture porn and to say too much of the plot may ruin a fresh experience but suffice it to say that the story features a raft of plot twists and turns designed to challenge ones perceptions the project runs a little too long with several of the gorier scenes towards the end growing repetitive hence the torture porn label however the way writerdirector pascal laugier deliberately drags out the proceedings makes it all the more intriguing with exposition only delivered in very small doses before a quite startling revelation in the final ten to fifteen minutes the film is furthermore topped off with a haunting and deliciously ambiguous ending and perhaps most remarkably the film avoids ending on a depressing note despite it refreshingly defying genre expectations with regards to revenge thrillers certainly the way the film concludes is hard to imagine based on its initial stretch by all means is a difficult film to watch but it brings to mind some potent notions while managing to elucidate some of the desperation that could lead to human beings doing unspeakable things to one another,cruel
unafraid of its own premise understands that if you want to make a polarising film you do it with full acknowledgement of your own disease blends elements of child abuse conspiracy religion and kidnapping is incredibly dark and provides fullfrontal exposure to a fictional world that doesnt release you from its clutches until its over unfortunately its not good enough to really want to watch again however it is far from artless and there is entertainment in the performances vague whiff of lesbian melodrama and unflinching ending definitely worth a watch and honestly it really isnt as terrifying as everyone makes out,cruel
the story is about a young girl lucy who suffers from delusion following captivity and torture with her childhood friend anna she goes back after the ones she believes are responsible for her miserythis movie is very graphic particularly disturbing and shocking there are some similarities with haute tension and hostel but far more disturbing especially from the second half of the movienow this is not a bad movie the acting is good and all but this is just not for everyone it was not for me and i give it a 510 because i really didnt enjoy the end if you feel that films such as hostel the woman deadgirl are about your limits do not watch this film since it goes beyond if you like extreme and disturbing movies then youll love it,cruel
there are certainly twists in this film i did not expect to see then again i dont think anything could have prepared me for the 2nd half it is brutal cruel sadistic and yet very real we hear about these kinds of things happening yet rarely have 1sthand experience thank goodness for that i guess it goes to show that in the lack of a soundly edified social structure keeping a close eye on ones actions or better yet when microsocieties possess the power to recreate their own set of rules the ideal excuse for releasing the primitive beast inside is rendered could we all be seeking silently for that one instance in which all repercussions are lost and sadistic impulses redefine our very course of action within the context of a very well encapsulated delusion envisioned by an obviously deranged person the breath of existence is reduced to satisfying the whims of ignorance now the most important thing to resonate no matter how utterly humiliated and physicallypsychologically fragmented one becomes the absurdity of reality will obviously take care of everyone but one can still muster up the power to have the last laugh as is evident in this film without giving anything away especially since this conclusion is highly subjective anyway it is a very difficult film to endure and i think that it allows one to see beyond their own taboos but then again isnt that the primordial objective of watching movies in the first place,cruel
well well well  i feel theres still lots of passion around this film to tell you the truth i knew this film would be a cult classic the first time i saw it   its an aura thing  you know something you feel in your gut  its just one of those film that can drive you crazy and make you question yourself  did i like it or not  hummmwell its very effective because when a movie gets mind bugling like this one did  obviously it is effective i personally liked this movie very much and i will tell you why  its all in the artistic direction  this movie is so draining in the energy it deploys  i mean if you look carefully at the intensity the actresses plays  its unbelievable  this movie as all the ingredients to be intense in a positive way  its got substance  the actors are very well directed  its not a complicated story to follow  its full of energy  its got climax and lots of violence so what can a horror fan ask for more and when i ear someone say that this film is over the top violent then there is something that i must not get arent people looking for lots of violence when they want to watch a horror film  i mean they must be something i dont get  i just dont understand some of the negative critics this movie is effective and very artistic so get a chance to see this film  its very worth it  my rating 9  10,cruel
just another dumb french film i looked at the quote on the cover which said one of the most ferocious films ever made fearnetcom and told myself i have to get it when i turned on the film it looked rather scary but as the movie progressed it became less and less scary and turned into more of a what the hell is going on i despised the ending of the film the film as a whole was disappointing and kept leaving everyone with questions whats the point of making a film if everyone has questions i hated it someone must really have no life to just sit and think of the plot once again r e t a r t e d dont waste your time on these kinds of movies stick to the american and japanese horror films,cruel
went to the movies without actually knowing what is all about i knew it was horror butthe story in short is about a little girl luciethat escapes from her torturer then 15 years later together with her friend anna she kills the guilty ones later lucie dies and her friend gets trapped by the bad guys now anna has to live through all that lucie had to suffer 15 years earlierafter a bad nights sleep i had moments close to falling asleep in the audience this was mostly because of getting so numb of all the violence the end saves a lot since it is really surprising but when rating a movie its hard to say how much a good end actually can save i give 4 out of 10 since the audience really feels numb most of the movie and remember  i like horror movies the movie was well done its mostly impossible to rate the acting since the actresses just swam in blood most of the time the script just sucked i myself didnt get any other feelings toward the main characters except hoping theyd die this was because the movie never built up any feelings towards the characters it was bloody and messy from the beginning to the end and especially lucie was so unstable to start with that i never saw any reason for her to live yet her friend anna all the time tried to keep her from hurting herself just to collect the problems with this movie violence without feelings toward the victim makes one feel numb the same sadistic acts were portrayed too many times made me laugh the fighting and screaming bored me can be recommended to very big horror and violence movie freaks but for others  dont bother,cruel
i often wonder how much further the horror genre can and will evolve in terms of sadism and the portrayal of ultraexplicit violence especially the youngest generation of french directors appear to be involved in some sort of sport competition where each one aspires to surpass the other when it comes to showing sheer brutality and stomachchurning sickness high tension released in 2003 was quite extreme already but since then there came them frontiers and inside and each separate film raised the bar every time now after experiencing the nearly indescribable intensity level of i sincerely hope that no other movie will ever go beyond the standards set in this film genuinely is an astonishing and jawdropping ordeal that is guaranteed to leave even the most hardened and trained horror buffs speechless from what i gathered reading reviews and listening to opinions left and right i already knew this wasnt going to be picnic but the truth is that absolutely nothing can prepare you for what you are about to see in it may sound a little fantastic but the infamous and supposedly nauseating torture porn titles such as saw hostel and murdersetpieces look like sophomoric episodes of sesame street in comparison with the recent stream of french shockfeatures and in particular with okay i realize ive been going on and on about the shocking impact and extreme violence of but still i havent even mentioned the most remarkable and praiseworthy aspect about the entire film the gore barbarity and mayhem arent at all gratuitous or exploitative but actually serve a purpose there were other and far more mundane extreme horror movies simply showcase a long series of torture sequences practically causes you to experience the pain and simultaneously raises a handful of socially engaging debates for once the title of a horror movie can be taken 100 literally by watching you expose yourself to martyrdom you voluntarily watch the film and youre free to look away or step out of the theater at any given moment but most likely you wont because subconsciously you are in readiness to endure a whole lot of visual suffering in order to know how the movie will end yes it all does sound very philosophical and pseudointellectual especially for a horror movie but honestly not a single word is exaggerated this movie honestly is the genre landmark of a new generation the synopsis on the back of the dvd appears to give away the content of the entire film but in fact it only covers the first ten minutes the short summary describes how a 12yearold girl narrowly escapes from an abandoned factory site where she was held captive and subjected to extreme torture she ends up in a psychiatric clinic and befriends another girl who slowly helps her processing the trauma 15 years later the girl appears on the doorstep of a seemingly happy family of four with a shotgun in her hands and raging fury in her eyes lucie is convinced she found her tormentors apart perhaps from the domestic household element this sounds like the plot of nearly every revengesploitation movie ever made but these are only the opening minutes what follows next is a literally perplexing and excruciating visual nightmare that is unpredictable and even unimaginable at first youll wonder where writerdirector pascal laugier can possibly be heading for with his screenplay and then youll probably wish you never asked it would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot so let me just reestablish that you will be unprepared and stupefied do you dare,cruel
so here i am late to the party having heard both good and very bad things about the movie decided to give it a try which was a mistake notice i say movie and not film since if you can stay awake through the whole witless enterprise youll discover the director has ambitions to create a film experience he the director is in way over his headis nothing more than an expensive grindhouse stinker despite the glowing reviews here that demand the viewer accept this tedious exercise in repellent imagery as art it simply isnt certainly the gore effects are shocking and disturbing when the movie begins to crank up the level of depravity but eventually if you dont turn it off in disgust you become jaded since every type of vicious death is visited ad nauseum in relentless spurts of blood cutting shooting beating pounding someones head into jelly with a hammer stabbing and so on the ugly parade of death vignettes have a thin plot that defies logic to stitch the separate elements togetherplot holes abound here leaving the viewer to wonder if anyone was really in charge of this bloody playacting the first half of the movie is marginally better than the second by the time the director springs his surprise you dont care very much the pretentious twist thrown at you fails to resonate in any way because it feels so random it exists merely to give credence to the torture the movie succumbs to the idea that we should be given our doses of death in short blackout sequences before tacking on a ridiculous spiritual idea that comes way too late to salvage anyones dignity its as if the director decided hed throw a bone of meaning into the ugly goingson and make everyone watching feel better about themselves see it really was about something everyone youre not a pervy creep for watching its art after allno its not art its stupid watch at the risk of soiling your soul the french are good at many things among them butter and ham sandwiches deep fried potatoes and the louvre they arent so good at horror movies,cruel
a bizarre film its saving graces being good acting a decent script and relatively high production values so why the bad score well the whole premise of the film as opposed to any flaws in its execution is complete nonsense a bunch of elites headed up by a wrinkly old madamoiselle have the time and resources to inflict capture contain and dehumanise human beings so that a they create and b the can talk to them about their state of ecstasy by describing visions of or contact with the other world the final stage of achieving said martyrdom before a thankful death what i found annoying and a little disturbing were the very graphic depictions violence and gore a woman minus her skin except for that on her face and a fair few violent beatings she receives throughout the second part of the film dont get me wrong i understand that depictions of violence are often necessary either as a way of moving plot forward as a feature of representation itself or even simply shockingentertaining the viewer in this case the violence i could live with but the completely nonsensical denouements  theologicalphilosophical in nature  simply didnt justify it as such i found the movie pretentious and over reaching in its attempt to legitimate its depictions of inhumanity through some banal reference to cheap naive and somewhat flawed doctrinal framework,cruel
i have submitted a review of this title before but i have to say on further watching i change my mind this is the kind of film which affects you every time no matter what i had watched it three times before my last review and indeed had been disturbed by it but i sat down with intention to write something you all could really understand a lot of the reviews i have read of the film say that it is sick i disagree with the most tenacity this film is beautiful it is art perhaps not the kind of art which we would wish to look on for a long time to remember and to bond with but still art it pulls at you it tears youre heartstrings and it breaks your resilience the sound capture and transfer do the film nothing but justice which i suppose helps but i honesty cannot say that this film has a flaw its not a part of the saw 2 3 4 and 5 generation of torture this film focuses on something deeper ill let you find that something for yourself,cruel
this this film i can only describe as perfect poetic philosophical i watched this film in hope of some gore and cheap thrills but instead i got a life changing wonderful yet horrible piece of cinemai gave this film 10 out of 10 just because i cant rate it badly i struggled with the 10 stars but i couldnt rate it any lessthis film has left me speechless forget the gore the raw violence and what people seem to think is a lack of plot no there is a plot a depressing truthfull and disturbing plot this film is horrible and beautiful at the same time i feel sick and dirty yet enlightened and free i have not seen a piece of art like this before only one film has matched the beauty of this in my eyes a korean film called spring summer winter autumn and winter both films are so different yet so awe inspiring watch this film if you want to see the nature of curiosity and stare into the face of horrible beauty i cant tell you whether this is good or bad but all i can say is please please watch this,cruel

contemporary french horror seems to work like this lets rip off some already overused american horrorclich add some twist some surreal and interesting details and make the whole this violent as hellthe story basically about a girl who accidentally gets captured by a secret society which tortures people pretty much like hostel yesso what about the twists there are some indeed this secret society has a strict reason behind its activity and its not about just feeding the perverted senses of the sadist members i wont tell you that reason but is shakes up the plot a bit which is unfortunately still paperthin the characters are flat though the casting is great the child actors really resemble the adults who they supposed to grow up to be the story insists that there is some kind of characterdevelopment and spirituality but i really dont feel it the whole endgame if i may call it that way is a bit rushed i just doesnt seem very believable and since this film is not a bmovie it is indeed very well made and were not in the 80s anymore id like to see a bit more overthought details in the story also the whole movie is very serious from beginning to end and this requires a more coherent and immersing plotwhats with the original details all the little things that makes this movie worthwhile i like the look of the torture chamber its not dirty rusty or even old the stereotypical look you got familiar with from all the classic horror movies or even music videos its hightech and clean its makes much more sense if anyone would decide to build one i assume hed take time and effort to make it convenient to use i already mentioned the casting its just great most of the effects are very well executed so you can see everything in their gory details there are some anatomic errors but i guess most people wouldnt even realize themand the violence whew this movie is brutal over the top brutal as in most french horrors nowadays the violence comes from the realistic and serious approach the gore never gets cartoony or comic even when theres not that much blood its just so mean spirited others pointed out that the movie suffers from something which id like to call a passion of the christ  symptom it is just so insanely violent it makes you numb after awhile maybe but i didnt feel that i think the movie makers were smarter in this one and they always managed to top each scene with an even more repulsive one the earlier mentioned endgame is a strange exclusion that part though not very long makes the movie sit down a little all in all a good horror movie even in the classic horror way its very tense and it often made me jump the gore is very strong also so gorehounds should also be pleased by it just keep in mind that its not that kind of film youd like to see in the middle of a fun horror marathon its dark its serious and very sad thanks for reading,cruel
first i have to say that all the hype about the violent nature of this movie was far too exaggerated im an horror film fan since the tender age of 16 now im 37 and ive seen hundreds of films that were more grotesquely and perversely violent than this one on the other hand i have to admit that i saw the german rental dvd and im not quite sure if the film was cut or not there was little information on the net and from the film itself it was not possible to tell if the german censors had again a field day with that movie because even after 60 years after the nazi regime art has no free right in this country to tell or to show what it has to show but thats a different story in may i can tell you more about the nature of the film when i get the unrated american edition on dvd from amazon and can compare it to the german one even if the movie i saw was cut its still a far cry from things like saw and hostel especially when it comes to term of the quality and the story of the film what started with alexandre ajas film high tension in 2005 and found its following with alexandre bustillos and julien maurys inside in 2007and xavier gens movie frontiers in 2008 french horror directors have delivered films that stand mountain high above the genre outings from the states i hope i allowed to quote from the dvd review of that movie from the fangoria home page that these films are a shining artistic beacon to the rest of the genre world there is nothing more to say about this,cruel
its quite rare that im moved to review something instantly upon seeing it but i feel that the reviews and rating tricked me into watching this and want to warn others awaythis film is disgusting if you enjoy watching bloody young women screaming for a couple of hours then this is for you the movies excuse for this is not a worthwhile payoff i sat through this torture porn attempting to keep my lunch in my stomach because i was of the understanding that there was some grand intelligent reason for all this horror and there wasnt it thinks its intelligent in the way someone whos just finished an introductory module thinks theyre an expert and if thats your bar for finding great meaning in a movie youre setting it very low indeed and just because somethings french doesnt mean its clever this is as though dan brown had become a huge rob zombie fanhonestly stay away from this if youre a gore fan then its juvenile attempt at meaning will put you off and if youre a serious film fan youll be disappointed and disgusted,cruel
this is not torture porn yes its extremely violent and disturbing but the torture is not glamorized exciting and revolting like the saw sequels or hostel its horrific brutal and depressing the acting is top notch and alaoui is reminiscent of maria falconetti in the passion of joan of arc at times it actually has a storyline and characters that arent onedimensional if it was torture porn you wouldnt care about the characters this is an incredibly powerful disturbing terrifying and wellmade film and if you can stomach it absolutely worth the watch it is truly a modern horror masterpiece just dont expect to feel good for several days while its still in your mind,cruel
is a film of two halves first we encounter lucy and anna childhood friends since both were institutionalised in their youth it becomes clear that lucy has suffered abuse and that anna is her carer and protector as they grow older this relationship becomes complicated codependent and a power struggle anna loves lucy however lucy does not seem to return these feelings and is torn apart by her post traumatic demons when lucy embarks on a rampage of revenge against her captors anna follows and attempts to help her friend in the second half of the movie a shift occurs away from this revenge plot and we begin to ask the question why the second half of is probably one of the most violent hours of cinema that you will ever witness as a viewer i found myself feeling mentally and emotionally fatigued for the character and hoping for an end to her suffering is also a very misunderstood film those who argue that its misogynistic are simply wrongmost of the violence perpetuated in this movie is violence perpetuated by women on women the arch antagonist in this film is a woman as are both female protagonists it is a movie driven by female energy men play a much lesser role and seem to only be added as physical tools of torture no different or human than chains or weapons this is a movie about women and it is a movie about big questions it is also overwhelmingly a movie about violence in fact i would go as far to say as the violence in this movie is almost like a third leading character it would be very difficult to make without the violence torture porn this is most certainly not however there is absolutely nothing titillating or erotic about the matter of fact banality of evil that this film conveys so well bodies are punished blood is shed bones break and so do peoplethe two female leads offer outstanding performances in roles that are both emotionally and physically demanding they convey a mind boggling range between visceral and vulnerable and every conceivable emotion between the antagonists are faceless cold detached and above all else indifferentthe result is something stunning powerful and unforgettable in addition to this is genuinely suspenseful wellpaced and will make your mind work very hard to contemplate what the conclusion will be i will not say that is easy viewing because it is visually gruelling and i will not say that it is for everybody because it isnt if you are a free thinker and you love horror you are going to love this movie it will stay with you for many years after you have seen it viewer beware and be fore warned this is true horror with the potential to upset and disgust not for the purpose of titillation thrills or spills but in order to illustrate human evil then invites us to examine human nature and contemplate the true origin of terror and evil within ourselves which is the most terrifying place of allit ends in a quiet simple definition of the word martyr as deriving from greek for one who bears witness leaving the viewer wondering whether the experience of watching the film defines them also to be a martyr,cruel
if just hollywood would learn to do interesting and intelligent horror movies and stop making sad remakes of non american horror flicksat least european horror movies are lightyears in front of hollywood with like and rec haute tensionla intrieur descent etc its liberating to see a horror flick without the same unoriginal seen 100 of times before shitty american stereotypes and hollywood plot lineskeeps you guessing all the way it makes an excellent surprising twist halfway through the movie and lets you sitting back breathless and wondering at the end if you like the horror genre i urge you to watch this masterpiece,cruel
i recall when some years ago both my aunt and one of my cousins came with the film irreversible on dvd they had seen it before on the big screen and told me that day when we were all going to watch it on dvd that it was truly disturbing i was pretty much skeptical i said to them something like i bet it is not disturbing at all and anyways im never disturbed by a film so we watched it and within few minutes my cousin was like i told you so if you have towards pascal laugiers second feature film the sort of punk rocker attitude that i had towards irreversible you willthis aint a hostel this is disturbing this aint a tokyo gore police this is a film with real young women as characters then you will not have a really fun time but like tokyo gore police this is nothing but a mustsee yet certainly is not for everybody i had yet to see the film  lintrieur also known as inside but basically how my cousin describe it to me in terms of being disturbing and a film that you would not want to watch again and again is how i described to him well after all both are considered part of the new wave of french horror yet pascal laugier is not quite agreed with that its still a hell to find the money a hell to convince people that we are legitimate to make this kind of movie in france so i know from an american point of view and probably an english one too there is a kind of new wave of modern horror film but its not true its still hell my country produces almost 200 films a year and there are like 2 or 3 horror films its not even an industry french horror cinema is very low budget its kinda prototype i think that a genre really exists when its industrially produced like the italians did 600 spaghetti westerns so we cant really say that there is a wave of horror in french cinema i dont believe itanyway is about two female friends anna morjana alaoui and lucie mylne jampano who met each other in an orphanage after one of them lucie could escape from a hell on earth what begins in the orphanage is a real friendship as this girl anna is the only one who tries to talk and stuff with lucie there is going to be revenge but this is not really your usual revenge film pascal laugier doesnt go for that but the actual revenge is truly disturbing hard to watch after the stuff in the orphanage where we also learn that something is visiting lucie we travel 15 years and we focus on a family father and mother and their son and daughter a pretty normal family having breakfast and having a normal chat is just a pretty normal sunday is quite disturbing as any revenge should be they deserved to die because they basically destroyed lucies life but their kids and boy is not only that is not only those scenes with lucie shooting the kids but all of what happens with the character anna to be clear these two girls stayed together and when lucie saw on the paper those that destroyed her life she decided to have her revenge we will have anna at the scene of the revenge and of course at one point we have from lucie the they deserved to die the main issue deals with how can you say that to anna in hopes that she gets a little less disturbed when she is in a house with four dead persons knowing that her best friend who is basically the only person that she loves and that has in the world was the one who killed them knowing that the police or anybody else will be there in any minute the main actresses really deserve a big bravo but especially morjana alaoui her character suffers of a complete transformation but before anna becomes an official martyr she pretty much was already one she tries to help the moribund mother certainly we understand this completely and is the most normal action but lucie will not be very satisfied she hides the corpses she sees her best friend killing herself the why of that stuff is just great and she also discovers part of the why which is only more and more horrors anna finds a girl who is just another example of the horrors and she help her very much but the girl was already lost and she is so brave and this is so hard to watch and so interesting while the torture part is only remarkable because of morjana alaoui it could have been a bit shorter without any problems the very last part once anna reaches the last stage is as interesting as the whole part before anna meets the mademoiselle and in the end so great see it before the american remake hits the theaters,cruel
although this is definitely a balls out horror film it is also an excellent multilayered story there is just so much here to think about and digest i went to bed thinking about it and woke up to the same i had a hell of a time writing this review i wasnt entirely sure what i wanted to say about more accurately i wasnt sure what i didnt want to say about it there will be people who will absolutely hate the twist it takes and the grim final scenes for me the film comes full circle by the time the credits role it all becomes one horrifying and tragic tale about love and friendship trauma and revenge and power and religion first and foremost it is a horror film it has wrapped its messages up in a very gory relentlessly bloody package make no mistake about it this films graphic images will be difficult to look at once again the french pull off another horror extravaganza that kicked my asswe start out with lucie physically beaten emotionally distraught and running from an unseen predator lucie meets anna in the hospital after the event the two girls form a bond and a lifelong friendship most of the film takes place fifteen years later when the girls are adults i had a ton of empathy for both of these characters the emotionally destroyed lucie is beyond aid she is scarred mind and body and is tormented to the point of self destruction no matter what lucie does to herself or others anna is there to tend to her wounds anna for all intensive purposes is lucies guardian angel their bond is unbreakable and anna never gives the impression that lucie is a burden to her in any way you might say that anna is somewhat of a martyr the performances by both these women are outstanding the film twists and turns but the hard right it takes midway completely blindsided me it starts out as a revenge picture and transforms into something very different there were more than a few shocks and surprises the ending is complete and utter insanity the violence is extreme and graphic the gore is through the roof the effects are outstanding i could not recommend more highly this unflinching bloody brilliant and completely original horror film,cruel
at least i have to say that the director seems to know how to push the right buttonsbut honestly how can some critics on imdb call this art or even a masterpiece did i missed something there was indeed quite a innovative storyline and the elements of drama are very well made on the other hand many things stay unexplained and this is not for the sake of the viewers imagination it just seems like they were not thought to the end the cult egthe movie is like a very well made french version of hostel maybe even better than the original however i wouldnt call it a mayor breakthrough as some ppl do to show violence as explicit as possible is simply not sufficientto compare it with hanekes funny games or nos irreversible is just ridiculous they are masterpieces for real and not part of the entertainmentmachinery while this production surely isanyway worth a watch,cruel
i was all prepared to try and delicately write a comment about this movie and then i read the synopsis for and saw that someone else has already practically written out the plot scene by scene so theres no use in trying to be delicate i guessi was drawn to this movie because of the quote on the cover one of the most ferocious horror films ever made thats good  im always up for a good bloodnguts flick  i usually rent a stack every weekend because my husband is never home to be offended by my rental choices he is ehhh much more squeamish than i so i get about half way through and im thinking along the lines of other torture and escape movies  shouldnt it be wrapping up about now what could the second half of the movie possibly be about the bad guys got what was coming to them almost everyone of note is dead whats next whats next is quite possibly a transition into a religiouslytinged side of the plot i dont think ive ever seen beforeall i can really say is this film is not and will not be what you are expectingwatch it and see what it ends up meaning to you,cruel
im new to imdb was an amazing if somewhat gruelling filmim a big fan of french cinema especially horror and sci fi and comes in almost at the top that position is held by the visually stunning frontiers followed closely by the equally great switchblade romance even tho draws comparisons with the lame hostel series it has heart it seems to actually have a reason for the torture and although not as gory as hostel it made me wince tenfold and stuck in my head for weekspascal laugier is a new force in cinema and should be watched closely in the future taking the duties on the new hell raiser remake could be geniusvery very excitedif hollywood etc stay out of it and please dont go the alexander aja route and sell out horror movies shouldnt just be for teenagers and gory for shock value we like them to have real plot character arcs and real direction or just proper crazinessps i heard pascal hated michael hannakes funny games this breaks my heart as im a great fan of hanneke and funny gamesboth versionsare amazing films the point was there was no point evil has no planno formula no predictiveness thats why we love it my recommendations arethe uglycarnival of souls house of a 1000 corpses frontiersa tale of two sisters and hell raiser 2 hell boundto make something so big with such a small budgetgeniusppsstay away from salo it will mess with your head and not in a good way its exploitation at its very worst dont be fooled by its reputation and promise of shock its proper gash,cruel
i wasnt really expecting much of this movieim still speechless after finishing it this film was really something a masterpiece horror film in this generation everything was spot on the performances were amazing the special effects was so good its still traumatizing me the direction the shots the sound the musiceverything was insync not everyone can stomach this film it is the most traumatizing goriest take on torture and suffering omg it should be rating nc17 because of its gore but the gore was there for a reason and the ending was satisfying and true to the story the director really knew what he was doingi havent watched a great movie for awhile nowand this movie was excellent i highly recommend it if you can handle it,cruel
freaks creeps and geeks out out there this is for me one of the best horrors in years it has so much to offer there was a time when france only delivered cheese wine and jean paul belmondo or other crap movies coming from that country were always boring but sometimes there was one film that people were talking about first came baise moi not a real horror but a kind of natural born killers but more exploitation years went by and then came haute tension a real gory slasher in a more explicit way then came irreversible with the sickening rape scene and the fireextinguisher then france was beaten by the hollywoodflicks saw and hostel a new era the torture porn everybody was talking what would come next out of france could they do better yes they could suddenly there was frontieres banned in the states at horrorfest can you believe it i thought that they couldnt make it worser it was a bit of torture porn soon after the word martyr felt well this is surely not for the squeamish it got all elements in it it starts of as a nice movie first you see a child running covered in blood okay seen it before and then we watch a happy family nothing wrong sunday morning breakfast fun and a laugh until the doorbell rings what we got then is 90 minutes of explicit gore changing from revenge to humiliation to enigmas to chimera to sudden plots unexpected and the only question is is there live after death but i can tell you you have to watch the hardest film i ever seen until today and ive seen a lot the performances are great the children unbelievable acting lucie and anna two names you will never forget the effects are extremely realistic and if you couldnt stand the fireextinguisher in irreversible well dont watch the hammer scene even the score in the last part of this gem gives you the creeps shivers ran through my spine cause here in belgium and last in another country it happened in some certain way this one sure makes saw and hostel a big comedy watch it if you dare and again not for the weak at heart a masterpiece,cruel
the movie itself is really something you wont forget very soon its very disturbing and brings up some interesting questions which hopefully no one will ever answer  nothing for the timid thou i would divide it into 2 segments which are partially connected and although you may sometimes already know whats about to happen there are a few surprising story twists that keep up the tensionim not really sure if the director knew what he created here unleashing some very dark thoughts upon the world its definitely a movie you can still talk about after watching with your friends asking yourself what ifhavent seen anything comparable a must see even if you dont like it,cruel
i mean i saw the reviews and its really black and white no gray area either people hate it or love it if the 9s and the 10s are real people not friends and family of the producers and directors really i mean really really there are people who like films like this scenes of torture repeated over and over and over and over again they enjoy seeing that even if those scenes are meant to convey some deep meaning or important social issues i still feel theyre too much too far and unnecessarily repetitive so i go with the hate it crowd because in the end all those gave me nothing no deep thoughts or new awareness of a certain social issue nothing simply a feeling of disgust and loathing towards the filmmakers especially the director,cruel
this movie determines me to write my first imdb review ever so there it goes spoilers first of all the movie is about an abused girl who escapes somehow we dont know and dont find out how gets to an orphanage house she makes one good friend there and then whoosh the movie takes us 15 years after a nice family meal all happy and normal when someone rings the door and a pretty lady with a shotgun kills the entire family from here on the movie is a blood bath with no connectivity between the scenes no logic total nonsense blahblah we get to the point where we find out that theres an organization who kidnaps young women in order to reach  martyrdom whatever that means in the light of this movie more or less by the end of the movie we understand that these people want to find out whats after lifethe first problem that i have with this movie is that there is no explanation about why the people torture these women the old lady talks about being and dying with a look on their faces that shows that they saw beyond not to mention that the moment we are to find out oh well lets not spoil all the fun of watching this movieits a bad bad bad story with a bad plot with unconnected action scenes the freaky lady that keeps attacking lucy comes and goes like a shadow with no intelligent lines the actors are bad bad bad i just find it painful to write about it because i have to review it in my headoverall a painful experience violence for the sake of violence lots of blood if youre into bloody experiences torture with no sense and no details  there is absolutely no point in the movie and no point watching it do yourself a favor and read something instead,cruel
it seems the french like they have so many times before have appropriated the american vogue of torture porn for horror films previous to i have seen high tension which i thought was manipulative mundane crap and inside which i thought was quite effectiveits gore actually integral to its story rather than an embellishment i also happened to see sheitan which is so lamebrained and moronic its not even worth considering so having a split of opinion with two french horror films one i thought quite good the other terrible i happen across for my deciding judgment on the current state of the french thrillerif youve noticed my rating at the top of this review youll already see i gave this film a  3  rating the film is unrelentingly sadistic and i dont just mean brutal or extreme because those would be euphemisms for a level of intensity that evidence professionalism but sadistic because it seems the sole intention of the makers of this film appears to be how much brutality and sadism they can cram onto the screen and still hoodwink enough viewers to believe they are watching a story that really has a big message behind all this depravity so they can feel like theyre exempt from complicity at actually being sadistic voyeurswow the big message that excuses all this torture and brutality and sadism is that if someone experiences enough suffering eventually they will have an epiphany and see another world or afterlife or god or whateverfuzzyetherealhigherstateexistsafterdeath is waiting for them as soon as they kick the bucket all because of the strange look in a victims eyes after he or she has experienced unremitting and seemingly unendurable pain hey guess what pervertphilosophersthat beatific look is called shock id be staring at god too if you tortured me every day constantly for two monthsit is a valid idea if it had just been developed further than just the tackedon ending and for all its nihilism without plausibility is wellcrafted so for those reasons i give it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 110 but maybe im just being rationaland merciful which is a helluva lot more than the makers of this film are being to their audience,cruel

this movie was so full of crass i had to write a review reading this will cost you 5 minutes but it will save you more than 1 hr of watching this mindless movie i have no idea how anyone could rate this movie above 5 starsthe movie was painful to watch without a doubt i dont mind violence senseless brutality and torture as long as there is a plot the whole movie revolves around two decent looking girls they get tortured and battered to resembling nothing like their previous self i had to fastforward some scenes because they were sickening we are told the girls are part of an experiment this cult is doing for the past 17 years torture is the only way of bringing the girls closer to the other world death duh only one girl survived long enough to see whats on the other sidesadly the viewers still have no idea whats on the other side the movie ends there and so is my review,cruel
the teenager lucie jurin mylne jampano escapes from the industrial site chamfors brutally but not sexually abused the disturbed lucie is sent to a school for abused children and she becomes the best friend of the girl anna assaoui morjana alaouithat protects her fifteen years later the deranged lucie comes with a shotgun to the house of the belfond family and executes gabrielle her husband and the siblings marie juliette gosselin and antoine xavier dolantadros then she calls anna and tells her that the belfond were the responsible for her suffering anna drives to the address and finds the family murdered lucie is frequently wounded by a creature actually a dead girl who haunts her anna buries the bodies of the family to leave the place with lucie but out of the blue lucie cuts her own neck and dies anna snoops the house and finds an underground facility with a tortured teenager sooner she learns that the place is the base of an organization led by mademoiselle catherine bgin that researches the afterlife martyring young girlsis a brutal and disturbing story of insanity with a deceptive open end the french horror cinema is among the most brutal in the present days and is certainly one of the most violent and gruesome horror films ever madeunfortunately the inconclusive conclusion has many discussions in imdb board but none of them provides a satisfactory explanation to the ending therefore the director pascal laugier has failed in his film since it the viewers are unable to understand it my vote is sixtitle brazil not available,cruel
for fans of french horror of the past decade or so this is not to be missed i put off watching it for quite some time partly due to wanting to savour this genre over as long as possible but also based on the description alone i knew id have to steel myself to finally sit down and watch it never lets you go for a minute but i must admit is strongest and most jarring during the first half once youre in the second half there is still a sense of dead but you know it cant really get any worse the final lead up ventures more into cerebral even philosophical or religious territory one small gripe for those wanting perfect realism technology or physics wise shotgun blasts dont send people flying backwards like a projectile makes for an impressive effect thoughheres the plot two girls anna and lucie meet and befriend one another at an orphanage one of the girls lucie escaped from captivity where she was subject to extreme mistreatment by a cult obsessed with the experience of life after death once grown into excessively beautiful and exotic for those of you for whom thats important women 15 years later lucie locates her former tormenters and draws anna into an episode of vengeance and depravity from which neither can escapeagain some horror can have light moments where the viewer can even revel be joyous even at some of the violence which may appear as righteous given the circumstances not so with there are no winners here from start to finish  true horror,cruel
after watch his most recent movie the tall man which i appreciated by the way i felt some curiosity to watch martys pascal laugiers most acclaimed work to date and told by many to be an excellent and unique horror movie some years ago i had also watched another film from this director called saint ange something like a ghost story and at this moment i can say i have watched all the full length movies pascal laugier did as a director guess what is by far the worst and i mean theworst i never was a person to judge films by ratings so i cant even say i was disappointed about this movie because in fact i wasnt i just felt surprised that a junk like this could be so acclaimed i just ask was all the hype about for this is that what you people call a masterpiece or an innovative and unique horror film is its final massage that good for me it has just one of the most ridiculous final disclosures and plots final message ive ever seen spoiler i mean can you think of a more idiotic idea than torture and martyrize a person just to in the end her final instants she tells how the other world is are you joking its not cruel or sadistic or fanatic or anything else its just stupid end spoiler and to make this absurdity even more ridiculous and funny theres a comment here on the imdb one of the most well rated by the way that comparing this film to funny games by michael haneke says something like this martys is in a whole different league and is everything a film like funny games should have been one more time i do ask are you joking compare this empty message from to a movie like funny games that at least for me has a really good message and it is unlike a really unique and remarkable movie i think these movies are not even comparable at all in any sense a comparison to movies like hostel which was also done is more acceptable but even here loses in my opinion i found it really empty of a meaning and absolutely senseless in each one of its arguments so in the end was not the brutality or the torture present in the movie that shocked me but mostly its final disclosure and the pointless plot it has besides the gratuitous torture we see here is nothing new there is a good count of movies that have similar scenes of free sadism some call it torture porn i really dont feel shocked by the gore itself i have seen some brutal and shocking movies like a serbian film i mean i can stand the blood and the torture scenes if in the end the final messagemeaning of the movie is good but that was not the case of ,cruel
for a film that starts out with some real promise this film sure lets you down in a way you never saw comingthe first half of the film is intriguing enough its outside a clearly defined genrebeginning with an almost documentary like feel as we are shown a short film taken by hospital staff of the location that a young girl lucy had been tortured in the girl had escaped her tormentors and ended up at the hospital she is clearly traumatizedthen there are elements of japanese horror films as lucy sees and hears things at night while recovering in a clinic  orphanage of some kind15 years later and we are in shotgun revenge mode a la sam peckinpah as the girl now grown believes to have found the people who tortured her even here the film is outside normal genre classification because we the audience are not sure whether the people shes found really are her former captors is she a righteous angel of vengeance or a violent and deranged lunatic even her best friend anna doesnt know for surethe violence here is already astounding and horrifying  and i say this as an adult male in my 40s who has no problem with violence in films or so i thought its hard to watch people being cut or cutting themselves and its put on display here in a very realistic way that really makes one cringeok i sit through this thinking theres got to be a pay off there isnt and just when you think things couldnt get worse it does and for no discernible reason thats what helps make it so hard to watch particularly the last third of the film which involves a young woman being repeatedly tortured over an extended period of time its the fact that we dont have any reason for it and not only are the repeated beatings senseless but frankly it gets tedious i was on the verge of hitting the stop button but forced myself to keep watching hoping for a payoff at the endagain i dont have a problem with violence in and of itself i loved takashi miikes horror classic audition finding the final torture scene to be brutally shocking  but in a way that worked and made his film a horror classicdoesnt achieve that shock horror at all its violence becomes a dark hole of tedium and with absolutely no morally redeeming qualities whatsoever at the very end of the film we are given an explanation for the bad guys behaviour whether the explanation is one that you can accept even within the context of this film is entirely up to the viewer i found it to be a silly cop out a complete let down replete with pretension at least hostel makes no pretense to be anything other than what it is  juvenile torture porn horror i felt completely ripped off by which pretended for so long to be something better  but wasnt,cruel
is one of the few horror films ive seen in recent memory that shocked repulsed fascinated and engaged me in a such a way as reading the back of the box one would assume a typical hostellike torture movie with the added twist of revenge within the first 15 minuteshowever youll realize this movie is far more intelligent than you may have given it credit for i know i sure did the events of the film unfold in a very nonlinear way most viewers especially on the american coast are not used to seeing rather than the revenge taking place in the 3rd act it is thrust onto us right at the very begging of the film playing with our emotions of who is the victim vs the culprit the first half of the film is truly scary having to do mainly with the psychological manifestations one of our main characters is experiencing these scenes are filmed expertly and maximize on the scare you pants off effect the second act is where i began to realize this was not a typical horror film although ive marked this post as having spoilers i wont get too far into detail i will however say that up to this point the viewer has seen nothing that theyve expected to see and everything that they havent expected to seethe third act is where my fascination took flightsurprisingly the torture i had expected to see gratuitous amounts of throughout had been held off until the final act of the film when this does begin however the film makers and a special recognition to the editors handle the torture in such a way that never feels cheapimmature or pointless the final payoff which reveals the motives and goals behind the actions of the third act are so shockingly fascinating that it will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling any true horror fan would do themselves a favor and watch this film which shows that horror films dont have to be cheap gimmicky pop corn flicks unfortunately a large number of people will never watch it purely because it is subtitled hollywood if you ever decide to give this the american remake treatment i beg that you film this the exact same way scene by scene shot by shot,cruel
its a rare horror film that lingers in my mind for days after viewing gnawing at my subconscious but from french director pascal laugier achieves just that thanks to its continuously evolving storyline and sheer unrelenting brutality that is guaranteed to disturba shocker form the word go opens as a young girl lucie escapes from a dilapidated building where she has been held captive and subjected to torture by persons unknown fifteen years later a now fully grown but mentally disturbed lucie the lovely mylne jampano eventually manages to track down those responsible for her abuse and accompanied by best friend anna morjana alaoui proceeds to exact revengejustice is swift with a shotgun toting lucie coldly despatching her targets and their innocent children for good measure but even though lucies nightmare seems as though it is finally over annas is just about to beginmight not be perfect with a final act that is a little too drawn out and arguably unnecessary altogether but theres no denying the power of this film as a whole its the cinematic equivalent of a flurry of punches to the gut which leaves one feeling both queasy and breathlesslaugier displays incredible control of his material delivering tense horror and nerve shredding terror whilst also splashing bright red gore across every frame by the closing credits even the most bloodthirsty of gorehounds will have had their fill of shotgun wounds lumphammer attacks cutthroat razor slashing and skin removal and although there are points at which i feel it might have been wiser to end the film ultimately ambiguous ending does at least invite conjecture and debate about such lofty subjects as religion and the afterlife85 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for imdb,cruel
i just finished watching this movie like 15 minutes ago and all i can say is wow incredible movie with excellent acting and direction i heard a whole lot about it over the year which had hyped it up a lot for me but all i ever heard about was how brutal it was i wasnt expecting an existential journey through the mind of someone being martyredi actually thought that the brutality couldve been way worsein a good way and they shouldve really gone all out on the violent nature of the film but beggars cant be choosers in all the film may have skimped out on the brutality but more than made up for it in storyline  out of ,cruel
i didnt think there was anything special about i also felt certain while watching it that a lot of people would love it in my review i will try to communicate both sidesshort version has some great scenes and takes some unusual turns despite what other reviewers have said you should go in expecting entertainment of the darkest sort rather than realismart regarding art the film tries to tackle too much at once and falls on its face not the holy grail of horror but its still worth seeinglong version another reviewer in a haste to discount any similarities to hostel compared to gaspar noes irreversible i think hostel would be an acceptable comparison actually but irreversible is truly more similar in a deep sense irreversible and are both very stylish brutal and captivating they each alternate between scenes of shocking violence and philosophical contemplation and in the end both films are quite a ride but a bit of an ideological messi will add another idiosyncratic comparison audition like audition i went into expecting the most upsetting 90 minutes of my life and came out wondering if i had seen the wrong filmstarts out with a very realistic tone a really muckeduplooking young girl escapes from some sort of terrible abuse it is quite painful to watch her runtheres something really helpless about her there is not entertainment in this scene only pain following are a few clips from a fauxdocumentary about her escape increasing the realism only a few minutes more however and the film totally turns aroundat the first kill scene the film takes a leap pun from realism to romanticism someone gets shot and flies through the air 15 feet a la the matrix pretty cool concurrently with this theres a little monster thing running around spooky and symbolic about 45 minutes in the plot takes such a leap into the fantastic realm that i wondered if i was watching a dream sequence i wasnt the final act includes some hardcore torture to the tune of some sentimental indie music soundtrackacoustic guitar and whatnot i believe it was supposed to be sadin summary i didnt like the film because it was too romanticized where it strayed from the torturefilm template it really just kind of stumbled around for many people this wont be a problem for others a problem will simply be that the film took itself too seriously about some absurd situationsregarding gore pretty gooey i suppose but not really some people get shot in a big way but no exploding heads some selfmutilation with a razor unpleasant to watch but the effect was pretty weak there was one creative death which i wont spoilworth seeing but too ambitious for its own good and not very convincing the most captivating makeupeffects were the aftermath of torture the skin is like paper gg allen,cruel
unforgettablyoriginal suspenseful horror although violent it is absolutely integral to the story telling as opposed to gore and jump scares for cheap shock value after the film ended i realised every scene in the film was perfectly pitched leading to the original powerful conclusion i would recommend watching this version with english subtitles instead of the dubbed version as you will miss out on the brilliant acting,cruel
gore and blood are the hallmark of horror films in this case they are definitely present in fact this film fits nicely into the category of films that has been emerging in past decades called body horror in truth its one of the best a movie that visits pain or disfigurement on its characters and makes you think i hope that never happens to me qualifies as body horror you can feel in a sense what is happening to the protagonist as if it were happening to youyes we definitely can categorize this as body horror through a good part of the beginning in fact i began to think it was just that but i was so mistaken there are people vs the establishment themes going on here there is an empathetic look at suffering especially of women there is a supernatural aspect that for me was never really fleshed out but certainly got me thinking i have a word to the wise if you havent yet seen this film and plan to go in knowing there is a story but let all your expectations fall away this film attacks victimization and vengeance in an all new way i can guarantee exists nowhere else in horrorsomething should be said about this original film its following remake is nothing like it and should only be seen after the original read only non spoiler reviews and the imdb summary before seeing it body horror fans and standard horror fans must see this film it is glorious,cruel
perhaps someone should have informed the filmmakers that it is not possible for a person to live for very long after having all their skin removed except the face as in this movie the movie was very unpleasant to watch but became ridiculous when she is alive and perfectly calm floating in water with no skin i assume i watched the censored version because i was surprised we werent treated to watching someone be skinned alive and of course not screaming or struggling but being perfectly complacent which i guess was the point  that she became a willing victim i get what the filmmakers were attempting to convey but when they want to include conditions that are impossible they should make it a scifi flick where it might be possible due to medical advancementsscience fiction gizmos etc for someone to be kept alive and healthy after removing their skin but the part of the movie that ticked me off the most was another implausible scenario who the heck hunts down their tormentors and doesnt even confront them andor torture them back to get them to fess up she just shoots them without saying a word since the filmmakers wanted to include as much gore as possible why not have a scene where the victim gets even with her tormentors at least we would have that satisfaction was their point that she wasnt going to stoop to their level and commit torture herself well she shoots them and cruelly shoots innocent children too after forcing them to watch their parents murdered that was another awful aspect of this wretched movie at least it would have made more sense to force the parents watch their children be killed another ridiculous scene the mother suddenly coming to life talking coherently after several hours and with a huge whole in her abdomen,cruel
sick and twisted to its very core but i shy away from calling it a true horror as i did not find it at all scary or frightening unless your the one sitting in the chair if you enjoy pure blood and gore maybe this is for you basically some tormented asian chick goes on a psychotic rampage then later it somehow turns into some bizarre religious social experiment half way through i felt like jumping through the screen to torture and make suffer in the worst possible way these oppressors the audience gets a real glimpse at some of the worst humans are capable of not really sure what the point of this movie was other then to assault the senses making me ashamed to be called human let me say that those kinds of people who show up at the very end seeking their confirmation deserve to be sought out then given worst pain and suffering imaginable,cruel
one of the most extreme and controversial horror movies out there is extremely graphic but also extremely unique and not without a purpose the first half of the film is very different from the second half of the film but both of them together create a vivid experience the first half of the movie shoves gore and violence down our mouths without a solid reason it may seem extremely excessive but once we learn of the true natural of the film everything seems justifiable the violence shown in the first half of the movie is more bloody and in your face at the beginning of the movie but the violence in the second half is more harrowing and raw which leaves a greater impact its subtle changes like this from the first half of the movie to the second half that makes the movie brilliant the whole time watching the brutality of the events unfolding in the beginning forces you to wonder what the hell happened to her as a child what possible reason could force someone to cause this sort of rampagethats the brilliance of it keeps you wondering the entire run time just when one door closes a new door opens literally even though the movie is very extreme and brutal you can never take your eyes off the screen because the story unfolds in a very unpredictable manner that you never know what is going to happen next and as for the notorious ending its one of the best aspects of the movie the final minutes leaves you with a powerful thought provoking conclusion sure to keep horror fans talking for ages ends on a very cryptic yet satisfying note probably not most peoples taste this is a movie that warps the horror genre and pushes the envelope,cruel
i was not particularly fond of this film or perhaps i should say wasnt all too impressed dont get me wrong occasionally i do enjoy watching the harder if not hardest variations of horrorflicks in other words i dont mind blood and gore have seen the most extreme of films that the market has to offer and if it comes to the subject of tortureporn well as long as they are only movies i have no problems with the genre my complaint about comes from another cornerfirst of all the director and his film isnt able to built any tension up whatsoever how could he when the story is so utterly predictable im not going to detail the whole storyline this has been done already by many another writer but lets view the structure of the story as such the first half is pretty much a variation of the homeinvasionsub genre made so popular by the exploitationfilms of the 70s lucie having been abducted and tortured by some cult during her childhood later identifies her former tormentors and wipes them and their innocent children out with a shotgun this is done bloody but rather quickly if not to say routinestyle her best friend and this being filmed after haute tension supposed lesbian lover anna a young arab girl aids lucie at disposing the bodies but lucie is still tormented by her memories and inner demons which come to her in the form of a ghostly corpse that seems to have climbed straight out of a ringmovie much time is spent in the families hometurnedslaughterhouse where lucie battles her inner demons and the corpses of the slain family are endlessly dragged from one spot to another lucie succumbs to her demon killing herself by slitting her throat anna discovers the lucie was not mad at all and that the house is indeed the dwelling of a torturecult of course anna becomes the next victim of said cult but one objective to create a martyr literally somebody who witnesses by torturing her to deathlets compare to the other notable films of this genre saw whether you like the series or not with its intricate twists and torturedevices hostel working as an extension of the 80s slasherflicks albeit more gruesome in its execution or a serbian film perhaps so far the toughest to watch yet having a distinct message regarding yugoslavia and what people went through during the civilwar wishes to go another direction here the director would like to have us believe that theres a deeper philosophical meaning behind the mayhem pseudointellectuals will be quick to pull out names like georges bataille from a certain orifice or shall we say lanus solaire or quote some other syphilitic coffeehouse philosopher that they value its an old ailment all too common in highly stylized french cinema the french intellectual elite is often accused of enjoying to hear themselves talk a lot all the while actually saying very little in regard to horrorflicks this is nowhere as true as in as to what differentiates a torturepornflick from your common horror gore or splatterflick primarily the unrelenting harrowing and realistic violence here too lacks behind above mentioned films sure the slaying of a family including kids is violent and messy but nothing that we havent already seen in 70s exploitationfilms sure the skinning of the protagonist at the end of the film is pretty graphic although the act itself takes place offscreen but that too has already been seen elsewhere at times even more graphic the rest of the torture of anna consists of her being chained to a chair being slapped around until her face becomes a living haematoma and being forced again and again to eat some sort of quakers oats from a tin plate sure a matter of taste but if id be given the option id opt for the skinning instead definitely tough on the average viewer but again were talking about the confines of a genrethe final scene raises an interesting question which has opened debates among the viewers but that cant turn a mediocre film into a masterpiece either essentially that is what remains in the end an average torturepornflick handsomely filmed but filled to the brim with its own hype one further word of warning the film is best watched in its original form french with subtitles if need be the english dubbing as is often the case is atrocious and probably the reason why most of these films be it ring or are often enough copied and rebooted as american films which generally should be avoided likewise510,cruel
if anyone asked me for the horror movie that stands out this is it and its about 4 years since i watched itjust noticed that if you view reviews in chronological order another irish contributor put in a carefully reasoned review recentlymy case is simple until i didnt realize there was an internal psychological line to be drawnbecause everyones seen them lets class hostel  hostel ii as just below that lineyoure horrified but have a sneaking feeling that there just might be such places such circumstances could exist with difficulty you move onwith its revelation of the motivation for such grueling horror strikes well above that line there are historical truths not real you understand just that some people believed them in the past in martyrdom that were considered sufficient for the elevation to sainthood there are neurological studies that suggest similar unexpected results in extremes imdb doesnt recognize the word i used swap is for the last two letters es  mostly drug induced you do not want to believe that such an experiment could be contrived and worse still watched over generations for positive results being facetious ah god noyou surely walk away from this film not wanting to think that such things are possible and thats the true horror  youre not sure,cruel
have you ever watched a movie you kind of loved but would hesitate to recommend is such a film if you have even a passing interest in extreme horror or extreme cinema in general chances are you have heard of this french language filmit is a film that has proved to be divisive some feel it is almost a masterpiece while some feel it is a tasteless and extreme gorefest that only appeals to sickosi happen to think its pretty great however this is not a movie i would watch if you have yet to sample more extreme films as it is a lot more extreme both in gore and dark themes than your average horror if the thought of stabbing evisceration or skin removal sounds too much for you dont start your journey into extreme cinema hereif you do decide to give it a go dont be like me and read up too much about it i basically knew the whole plot which was maybe why i was a bit less shocked than i could have been if the thought of ultra fairly realistic violence dark nihilistic themes great cinematography and an ending that is open to interpretation appeal to you just watch it i wont even give any plot details this is a film to see blindis it a perfect film in short no some decisions the characters make are a bit unbelievable in a no sane person would go down that tunnel kinda wayso can you handle it well i am at this time a relative novice to extreme films one of the few ultra violent films i had seen before this was takashi miikes ichi the killer i could handle that and i could handle this so if you have a strong stomach and the urge for something fresh i highly suggest ,cruel
its a mistake to put this movie in horror genre gore is more befitting im not a fan of gore as most of the focus more on the sick scenes instead of the storyline sure there are rare cases where gore movies are worth watching like the saw franchise but even those get pointlessly sickening at some pointis no exception if you like watching pointless torture and bloody scene this movie is for you watching a human being inflicting corporeal torture to another human being is disturbing enough watching the torture without substantial reason is just beyond me if youre looking for a smart plot line and pleasant surprises you better watch inception instead even cabin in the woods might be a better choice to satiate your horror thirst does try hard to give a surprise mindblowing end however it doesnt at all redeem the boring and empty 99 minutes i had to go through im giving it a 5 out of pity and appreciation for the movie making effort,cruel
i watched this movie on the horror channel one night when i couldnt sleep i thought to myself i may as well see what this movie is like expecting your typical gory slasher movie but boy was i wrong straight from the very beginning the movie had me gripped i found this film unbelievable in so many ways i felt the need to look away or turn the tv off several times but needed to see how the movie concluded there are several parts to this superbly interwoven to keep the viewer guessing right until the ending that does not disappoint theres some terrific acting so that the viewer can truly sympathise with the person onscreen almost feeling what they do in conclusion i would indeed give this top marks the acting is top notch the shocks unexpected and the atmosphere always tense if you do not have a strong stomach i would stay away from this movie but if you do this is not a movie to miss,cruel
starts from the perspective of lucie mylene jampanoi a child escaping torturous captivity we next see her in young adulthood butchering a wealthy middleclass family stalked by an embodied figment of her early trauma lucie calls upon her girlfriend anna morjana alaoui to protect her and help clean up her mess the focus then shifts to anna who will unveil dark secrets hidden within the house it crashes along on one of those screenplays that seems made up as it goes  not in terms of tone which is consistently visceral and humourless but in terms of characters and eventsthis is one of my few forays into the socalled new french extremity movement which has been pushing boundaries of what its possible for an audience to endure for some years now in the same way that a certain section of cineastes will test their patience against bela tarr and then emerge with a weird pride but with no apparent insight im sure there are those who would argue that the relentless cruelty amateurish filmmaking and dismal absence of moral argument on show in pascal laugiers film belies some deeper meaning that i just dont get but shouldnt it at least be shocking disturbing haunting or harrowing surely it shouldnt be this boringthe problem with torture porn is that it has all the hallmarks of horror whilst breaking the cardinal rule tell dont show itself a reversal of one of the oldest assumptions in the history of the visual medium if were given money shot after money shot then theres no need for the building of tension hitchcocks favourite masochistic act or for tickling the audiences primal fears through the power of suggestion or for manipulating the expectations of the breathless observer its not simply that we become numbed to the violence an area ripe for exploration albeit not in this film but that the images themselves turn bland the suspension of disbelief becomes impossible under such conditions because theres nothing left for us to do with our imagination so we disengagein terms of positives i would argue that the film is marginally less tedious than the human centipede and more competently made than the eyebleedingly shoddy baise moi also attributed to the extremity movement and there is an epilogue which almost provides some semblance of a context for what has occurred  more of this may have redeemed the film perhaps laugier might have explored the psychological motivations for mademoiselles catherine begin predilection with the lifedeath transition is it an overwhelming death anxiety that means she needs to see what life looks like on the cusp does the need stem from an envious compulsion to ruin youth and beauty the possibilities come too late and too sketchily to register if only the film had spent as much time telling as it did showing,cruel

there are few horror films that provoke such outcry and controversy these days even more so horrors that are remotely tasteful or nonexploitative the human centipede or a serbian film being the worst culprits completely missed my attention upon its release little horrifies or offends me now so i was hoping this movie might be memorable though i worried it might go for a terrible twist and deliberate nihilism for the sake of being edgy my worries were justifiedthe film begins in 1971 with lucie a distraught panicking girl escaping from a derelict industrial area she is put into care where she meets anna a younger girl who ends up taking care of her flash forward 15 years to 1986 not sure why perhaps to get around the cell phoneeasy solution rule and a rural household where mom and dad are enjoying breakfast with their two teenage children theres lots of smile and play then there is a knock at the door dad puts down his paper and goes to answerits lucie now 26 scarred halfmad and shes armed with a doublebarreled shotgun she massacres everyone in the house anna catches up with her but before she arrives lucie is haunted by a demonic creaturea sense of dread of something terrible about to be revealed permeates every frame of the first hour of this 99minute film follows a nearperfect 3act structure but once the second act finishes it all falls apart writerdirector pascal laugier chucks in a ludicrous explanation which has more in common with hellraiser than something that logically follows the established story of it should have had a better ending something that left no gaps in logic or plot holes still its effective for the first hour getting maximum use out of a single location and delivering strong characters that you feel fora curiosity but not the shocking splatterfest i hoped it might be,cruel

i saw this title with a few friends tonight following rec i still had the vibe and fun intensity of rec in my system and after a 10 minute snack break we put on which i had never heard of before hand as the film started i began to get the feeling that it would be a supernatural thriller but as it progressed it became more and more obvious that it was something much more disturbing than i couldve predicted and my previous giddiness was no more this a very great title in that it lives up to the genres true roots you will be horrified by this film in one way or another however the material is something you dont find terribly often in horror films which is what most likely led to my stomach pains that im experiencing while im writing this review the characters in this film arent being hunted down by michael myers leatherface or any famous slasher they are tortured to points of profound pain by humans watching this just reminds me that this is happening in dozens of places every day worldwide thats why i love this film  it makes people understand what goes on while they live what they call hard livesi cant say i enjoyed watching this film per se but it was important i finished it so that the impact left a permanent mark on me to be honest i dont even know if i plan on watching this ever again dont watch this for a fun movie night for you will just ruin anything fun planned for that night however if you plan on watching something that will leave an eternal imprint on your vision of society then i deeply suggest this title after all though this may not be a the kind of film you want to see it is the kind that you should,cruel
well this is only my second review on imdb the other being for eraserhead but after seeing this movie i just knew i had to write something about iti do see myself as a friend of rather extreme and unconventional movies so my interest was piqued while reading a review of  lintrieur here on imdb and also learning that the movie was banned in germany from where i am now writing this reviewi didnt know much about it except that it was about a girl who was tortured in her childhood and later on in her life takes revengewell i have to say that the first half and it is pretty much exactly the first half i found quite amazing it appeared to be an intense unflinching and honest depiction of a woman who had been so severely damaged during her childhood that the actions she took appeared to be quite unavoidable and the way in which these actions were portrayed were in my opinion fantastic cinema still it kept me wondering how this might be sustained through the second halfwell and this is where it all goes pearshaped had this movie stopped at the middle i would have given it a 10 out of 10 but unfortunately it goes onwhat follows is a completely superfluous and at times even unintentionally comical segment of for lack of a better term torture porn i really couldnt see where the point was it appeared to me to be a celebration of everything that the first half of the film would have seemed to criticize the only reason i continued watching to the bitter end and believe me it is an utterly ridiculous end was the hope that somehow the film might manage to breathe at least some sort of sense into what i had to endure during that second half but alas my hopes were smashed to bits i dont enjoy watching people on screen being tortured but i can accept the fact that it might be necessary to show such scenes in order to get your point across however what the point was supposed to be here i have yet to learn the scene when anna is about halfway through her ordeal and suddenly the melancholy piano music sets in had me cringing in my seat i mean come on that is so cheap trying to redeem yourself through wanting to make us feel sad for the victim after you have just subjected her and us as viewers to about 15 minutes of constant abuse maybe its just me but that was i think the weakest scene of the entire movie apart from i have to repeat the ending the old lady that was the head of the organization was also a terrible choice in my opinion why go for a stereotypical villain when someone less obvious would have done the job all in all it seemed to me that the second half was just shot for cheap thrills geared towards people who have a faible for this kind of violencelet me repeat i thought the first half of the film was quite amazing with acting direction editing all being above par but the rubbish that follows just destroys that the first half could have stood for itself even if it was only 45 minutes long so the five stars the film gets from me are basically the 10 stars that the first half deserved,cruel
i was recommended this film as i loved switchblade romance and i have a little obsession for anything darkgoryscary so i immediately ordered this film online and was excited when it arrived to see just how horrifying it was nothing nothing about the story or anything all i knew that it was french and i was shocked in amazement at the story gore acting absolutely everything about this film did not disappoint the slowly unravelling plot line is what makes the film so special just as you think you have sussed whats going on youre even more shocked when you find out the dvd case lets hardly anything away attall all you know is to be prepared for gore and terror this film is definitely a must see for any horror fans and im scared to wright anymore as i think knowing nothing of the story or anything adds to the beauty of the film and makes it even more shocking definite ten out of ten ,cruel

this film reminded me of several other films hole hellraiser hostel stigmata and the passion of the christ it is beautifully shot very arthouse quite bleak yet emotionally engaging it is not a regular horror film but tries to portray the darkness of the human psyche the film creates a dark and uncomfortable and foreboding feeling that is reminiscent of when watching black and white documentaries of the holocaust and the seemingly disaffected mental state of the german nais who tortured innocent jewish peoplethe indifference that a human can show while inflicting pain on another and the lack of concern for another persons suffering at their own hands is what makes this film most disturbing it is very graphic but instills psychological discomfort by the interaction between captor and captive the title of the film however does have me baffled as i feel that the title is misconstrued completelyi think that the film could have had a better titlehowever it depends on who in the film captors captive writer director  is conveying the term martyr if you love films like dead man walking and dead babies both british and other films like battle royale wreck the orphanage hostel hellraiser the hole stigmata then i really think you will like this film it really is excellentexcept for the titlebut it still deserves a 10 for pushing boundaries and sticking to an interesting plotdespite a few inconsistencies here and there however when watching any film its best to suspend disbeliefas then it would be a documentary and not a moviefilmand that would be even more disturbingto think that this could really happen,cruel
written and directed by pascal laugier is a french horror film that tells the story about a young woman who was held captive and brutally tortured as a child her mental instability from this leads her take revenge on the people or the person specifically who put her in the position shes in upon arriving at the house the victims friend anna is in shock to find out that said victim has executed not just the person responsible but her family as well that being her husband and two children anna tries talking some sense into her but soon realizes that lucie the victim is far too unstable to ease even to herselfhaving watched it a second time this film did not piss me off as much as did the first but that does not mean that my opinion on it has changed either the first act was pretty good the second act wasnt halfbad either the third act though  yeah the main problem that i had was that the whole thing felt like two short films spliced into one one of them was a psychological revenge thriller and then the other one was  well  lets just say it was a virtual snuff filmthe tone is mildly inconstant and the acting is there i say questionable at times but the last 3040 minutes are in all honesty incredibly depressing from what ive read pascal laugier didnt want to make the film rely on suffering but more so on pain well ill give him this the climax was a real pain to sit through againim making this review as fair as i possibly can as said before my second viewing of this film was slightly better than my first but that does not mean that i like it as a whole so im rating it 3910,cruel
very scary movie one the best horror movies i have seen it has great acting it also has great and a great story line it is so scary see it it is one of the best movies ever if you like scary movies you will like this it is the best,cruel
there are more layers to this film than would be comfortable for most it is both harrowing and thought provokingan impressive cinematic piece in the main it goes beyond most horror films in many ways however if you take real pleasure from it rather than discomfort you probably shouldnt be allowed to watch it like garlic the experience of watching this should linger but not in a nice way anything else would be tasteless,cruel
few movies have affected me the way this movie did sure it is gory brutal violent and very disturbing but unlike so many other movies it is not there for chock value but rather to show the awful journey of the protagonist from bad to worse as strange as it may sound it brings depth to the story and even more so to the characters yes it is slightly depressing but in all its dark cruelty there is beauty which balances the horror when watching it the first time it came to a point where it was almost too much cruelty but then the end came and made it all worth it so if youve got a strong stomach and want to see a movie that will remain with you for a long time then watch this masterpiece and watch it through itll be worth it,cruel
i must start by saying this is not a movie for the fainthearted also i believe there are a lot of good reviews of this film out there that should be read shocking disturbing brutalthose are just a few words that can describe this movie what a human being can do for revenge or just to find answers is unbelievable i always ask myself how an actor could play so good in a movie where emotions are taken on a different kind of level this is a movie that makes you feel disgusted with the world and ashamed of what humans can do to each other it is a horror film that even for gorehounds the stomach may go nuts a lot of people are making jokes when watching a horror film trying to make it easier to watch the moment anna gets captured nobody can laugh anymore it is intense and brutal a normal person could not even think of making a joke at that moment this movie depicts what human nature is capable of and makes it sad the movie starts with a horror story and then walks into another one over and over again the actors did an amazing job made it feel a lot more realistic with genuine emotions morjana alaoui pulls in a heart wrenching performance this is another reason why this movie is so good i read that a lot of people were repulsed by the second part of the movie and it is understandable but then again it is just a movie clearly not made for those with a weak heart i still dont understand the world we live in but i think these are realistic events converted in a fictional environment the ending went into a direction i was not expecting like all horror films the main character is either saved either killed but in this one the director gave a more profound meaning to the whole film he left us surrounded by mystery and everyone can have their own interpretation it is original unlike a significant number of modern horror movies again foreign films shows us that they are way better than hollywood films,cruel
2008 is honestly an extremely unsettling movie albeit not a great one i have to come clean and say this before i go into detail with my review i am immensely conflicted about if i actually enjoyed this film or not but there is one thing i cannot deny how memorable it truly is there are several scenes that have just been embedded into my brain for the past week i just cant seem to shake off how jarring it was to call it a hard watch is an understatement i was legitimately freaked out to the point of where i had to pause the movie leave and then come back the biggest problem i have has to do with the reason behind the final scene i understand the way the plot was trying to go and what the director was trying to portray but i still find it hardly justifiable overall i think the ending is just overthetop as for the rest the acting is solid the directing is very reputable but the writing is very shoddy i would call a very wellmade and haunting film that has some very questionable plot decisions,cruel
this movie was created with one thing in mind and that is the second half of the movie yes it is fckedtwisted and yes it all makes sense in the end i did not have a problem with the portrayal of the wicked and awful things that happen i thought that they served their purpose they build up towards a climax and that was done properly my problem with the movie lies in the first half and it is probably because the creators were so tunnelvisioned on the intense ending that they majorly overlooked the realistic aspects of the first half many viewers would not mind this because they too only watch for the sick ending but if you are like me and appreciate the whole film then you too will see the flaws in this cinematography the connection between the main characters anna and lucie seems so incredibly wrong to me there are times when these characters will simply walk off mid conversation and i find myself thinking what kind of lifelong friends are these they give no instinctive reaction when the other is about to do something they shouldnt and it really bothered me because this ruins the aspect that feels genuine for being friends from childhood stemming from similar abuse they dont communicate well at all and i had a problem with this,cruel
for some reason i have had this movie in my dvd collection for well over a year if not nearing two and havent gotten around to watching it before a colleague brought up the movie in a dialogue about moviesso finally getting around to watching the movie i can understand what his excitement was about because this movie was brutal and visual in so many aspectsbefore you read on be warned that this review contains a spoiler that will give away a great deal of the moviedont let the french language spook you away because the visual treat and the mayhem you are in for in this movie far outshines any visual barriers you might have with this being a nonenglish moviethe story is about lucie played superbly by mylne jampano who is haunted by something sinister that forces her to do unspeakable acts and along with her is anna played equally well by morjana alaoui the young girls end up at a bloodbath in a house but things take a turn for the worse as the past comes knocking on the doormight not be suitable just for anyone because the violence and the mutilation in the movie is very graphic and in your face there is nothing here to cushion the things that happen in the movie and that raw graphic visualization of the events is what thrilled me it was brutal yet very nicely orchestrated and choreographed at the same time there is beauty in this vile brutalitythe story told in the movie is very interesting and captivating the story reveals bits and pieces of what is really going on right up until springing it all wide open and it was nicely told and nicely edited however the movie takes a turn for a whole other direction when anna ends up being held captive in the basement and you come to realize what is really going on in the house personally i found that twist and direction of the story to be a turn for the worse as the movie went from suspense and thrilling to something utopian and a bit too muchbut all in all then is a great horror movie with some amazing visual treats albeit violent and gruesome ones but they all worked out well to help the movie progress nicelyi would have rated the movie a 7 out of 10 were it not for the twist of storyline once the story started revolving around annas captivity in the basement and the reason for the events that were taking place in the house as such settles in on a firm 6 out 10 rating the movie is great entertainment,cruel
is a hell of a shock to the system starting off as what appears to be a straight forward revenge film it morphs into a nihilistic nightmare that leaves the viewer  this viewer at least  feeling utterly drained seriously after watching i literally couldnt speak for about half an hour this french canadian production has been linked to what has been described as new french extremity and after seeing it youll be left with no questions as to why apparently an american rework is in the pipes and lord knows theyll have to tone down some of the films themes if not necessarily the violence for it to do well at the box office and thats the interesting thing about its not really the violence that is so alarming but the overall theme and tone of the piece  ie the motives for the violence that is perpetrated through the latter portion of the film the earlier sequences are much easier to empathise with  a girl subjecting who she believes to be responsible for the abhorrent treatment she underwent as a child in an abandoned abattoir to a dish of best served cold its when the film takes a bizarre turn midway through that the audience is made to suffer some truly bizarre and corrupt concepts and suffering is what is really all about that and some eccentric and clandestine organisation whose motives are very difficult for us sane folk to wrap our heads around aside from all the torrid carnage and mind bending subject matter there are some terribly poignant scenes between the films lead actors lucie played by mylene jampanoi turns in a breath taking performance as does her co star morjana alaoui who portrays her childhood friend annaim still unclear as to what the films overall message is ive got some theories but divulging them would be tantamount to spoiling youll have to surmise for yourself as to what message this film is attempting to convey and although i did not enjoy this film in terms of deriving pleasure from seeing it i have to tip my cap to the films director pascal laugier for creating something that left me reeling and actually altered my physical state of being it certainly stays with you for good or ill and its with that caveat i suggest that you consider whether you wish to view something akin to the hostel torture porn genre or something that is far more disturbing mentally because this film as superbly acted directed and produced as it is will blow your mind you have been warned,cruel
this is a tough film to reviewthe visual aspects of the film are excellent as is the concept of the film but the film eventually turns into a 200 dollar firework dudi think the film deserves some credit for all of its accomplishments if the final act had provided the viewer with the godly aspects this film so proudly dangles  then wed have ourselves a 9 or 10 star moviei was waiting for some scanners headexploding moment or another twist to put the icing on the cake here but nopethis is a film that every horrorfan should view but this certainly wont be everyones cupofteais not as gory as i thought it would be bloody yes no doubt this is not a film for the faint of heart but its not nearly as bad as some other films in that regardthis borrows from miike and roth but its a real shame that they took the realistic ending instead of the outrageous one the thing that really disappointed me about this flick is that it really failed miserably in explaining and concluding the subject matter that it tackled no doubt it is a shocking wellmade film but not one that i think i could recommend64100youll like this if you likedinside hostel audition or ichi the killer,cruel
 spoilers needless to say the french movie industry has never been too good in producing bisexploitationextreme films whos to blame shy producers who wont bet their shirt to finance movies that are most likely devoted to crash at the boxoffice  french censorship that will surely tattoo some nasty 18 sign on the movie poster instantly killing it commercially  cultural differences that make us all think here that some genres like gore survival or else suit better in englishspeaking countries  lack of courage lack of talent lack of someone like roger corman well a bit of all that maybebut many midtwentiesmidthirties french filmmakers had a blast when building their cinema references by watching movies like halloween evil dead the thing even blair witch project and they wanna be a part of it take a bite why not after all pascal laugier is no stranger to that i guess and after a first draft a ghost story called saintange didnt see it launched his rocket to try to make a statement  a french extreme gore picture hunting on the land of hostel or sawthe first 10 minutes are a collection of everything that punches french movies down to the knockout  cheesy pieces of dialog heavy storytelling bad cinematography the guy wants so much to let us know hes getting to the point that is something horrible happened to a little girl something so frightening she just wouldnt tell anyone even to her closest friend in an orphanagestarting bad eh then the movie took me completely offguard  there is a scary night sequence involving the two little girls that gave me goose bumps really and from that on the movie will dive into speed violenceblood stress despair and even time for well be led to jump 15 years in the futurei think its more a drama or a twisted love story than a torture film like hostel and thats making it even more scary and unsettlingi cant even tell if i liked it or not i wanted to know scene by scene what would go on next and i felt ashamed of it kinda mixed and confusing feelings i guess maybe thats what good horror movies can do to you,cruel
excerpt more at my location  was one of the most talked about films at the cannes film festival 2008 pascal laugier has created a film that has stunned all who have seen it and it has emerged overseas too as a stand out piece in the ever familiar gore porn genre not for those of a nervous disposition what is it that makes this french gem get under your skin so much expect no constraints no rest and no mercythis is 108 minutes of film you will never forget and although some may want those minutes back it will live much longer in the memory this is a true filmic experience rich in thrills and even more in spills as an addition to a genre that is far too easily redone possesses an intelligence and intent that goes beyond just gore there is however a hell of a lot of gore,cruel
had not heard speak before the film but i saw the poster and gave me curious  and when they finally saw i like it doing a cruel and bloody hand what it was i think it has a nice spiritual message is like the movie the exorcist a story of faith but that of terror  perhaps many of you do not understand it well and be waiting this film meets expectations bloody  because if after that i saw was a lot of publicity and research for a french film transcended borders on one side and made the language barrier i found a poster that promoted the film as make todo saw as sesamo street i was speaking to a gathering of the film and found numerous things that i want to share with you photos and summary of the movie pages of criticisms of the film photos and videos of behind the cameras avatar for messenger banners wallpaper also very nice so sad reminder of the song in the film going has since investigated and found the group that sings got the lyrics and free mp3 for you and not only that also the soundtrack free come to the next page and enjoy  httpjoanamolkospaceslivecom blogcns8cac86ac6c43c1272119entry,cruel
i dont care about the socalled artful vision that some sick minds can surmise from this sick movie one of the sickest films i had ever seen up there with salo which at least had a message about fascist italy its more than revealing that the sickest movies ever made came and keep coming to us from europe that wannabe continent that gave us wars galore including the first world war and the second world war and then to boot the shoah the true name of the holocaust and as woody allens most unforgiving jewish character david dobel discloses in anything else the crimes of the nazis were so enormous that if the entire human race were to vanish as a penalty it could be argued that it would be justified amen to that especially after watching ,cruel
indeed a zero star rating would be appropriate the worst piece of garbage i have ever seen and i saw a couple saw movies both hostels all the hellraisers and countless other scaryhorrorslasher moviesalmost all of those movies were bad but had a sense of humor or at least no pretensions that art was being created on the other hand is dull in every sense of the word yet tries to transcend its fate as a pointless boring exercise in filmi looked through a few reviews and the predictable fanboy reviews giving it 810 stars were laughable i imagine 95 of those who liked this movie were males 1630 years old as with crap like saw and the date movieepic moviescary movie long as clueless people keep patronizing these awful movies they will continue to be madetoo bad because there are some good genuinely creepy movies that i am sure dont get made because the kiddies need to see explicit torture to get offtip  see henry portrait of a serial killer that is an excellent movie that bslaps in the creepiness department,cruel
i watched this movie last night maybe i was expecting something different yes because i was expecting a more subtle version of hostel but it turns out that hostel has more plot then this one first of all the movie is really boring and dull for the second half ladder down door opens someone enter beat chained girl close door door opens woman enter feed chained girl door close and so on for half an hour are you kidding me son lets watch a simon thauer porn movie its better its more honest and less repetitive plus midway during the first half it is easy to understand that she sees things that exist only inside her mind thanks not exactly a new idea sixth sense docet plus i could not really relate with the characters as they are quite monodimensional as for the premises or as the director puts it the actual presence of justifications for the violence in the story wheel they are thinner than the air on the himalaya really no one could believe them beside the term martyr has different meaning are those who sacrifice themselves for something they believe in eg all the victims of totalitarian regimes not for something others believe in as in the movie here they are merelyt victims of perverted and depraved persons and its shows luckily we are only victims of a pompous director,cruel
this film is truly incredible it is the most violent horrifying and simultaneously brilliant and beautiful film i have seen in a decade or so if you can make it through the first 40 minutes of this film youll be hooked unfortunately for the weak stomached the ride only gets crazier from there the film changes in the third act and is in fact hard to finish but that being said finishing the film becomes a sort of sacrifice in itself a sacrifice offered up from the viewer to an almost perfect first 23rds of an awesome horror film every once in a while a film comes along that defies any genre any explanation and any definition if you consider yourself to be a horror fan or a film in general and are a mature adult then this film is an absolute must see watch it alone first let it be yours before you share with your friends,cruel
one of the best horror movies of all timefrom the start until the end of the movie you will feel the terror and you will forget to take a breath because of the strong screens and violencei think the movie was made only for horror fans not for the average viewer is not good for the people that have heart problemthe act and the direction is very good also the special effect like the most of france moviesthe story line is prototype not another copy idea or remakepersonally is my favorite horror movie 10 of 10 its for sure meets all the elements for a perfect movieterror is here enjoy one of the best pure horror movieyou will do a lot time to see a movie like that,cruel
i know lots of people resent the whole torture porn trend in recent cinema but i think that what all of those movies share is a sense of entertainment a sense of thrill or elevated heartrate in saw or hostel we cringe and go jeez or whoah man gross i dont know why  maybe its because of the way those film are made  they still retain some hollywood sense of glamour and dont have enough grit they put all their effort into shocking torture porn that all we get is a visual blood orgy with nothing substantial or meaningful to back it up other than some 1store story put together overnight when i walk away from films like that as i did with hostel etc i forget about them quite quicklywas differenti think people who call it torture porn havent seen enough torture porn its hard to put your finger on exactly what makes it different but this movie stayed with me long after i watched it it was the first time that i actually empathised with the characters the cruelty and indifference was so much more vivid and mentallyimpressing than anything i had seen before i was left with a feeling of desolation and powerlessness i couldnt sleep the night i watched this film not out of fear but more a kind of anxiety i like to think of myself as being thickskinned which is why for me the fact that it stayed with me for a while makes it a success,cruel
by the start of the 21st century horror cinema had exhausted the post modernist referencing of films such as the scream trilogy 1996  2000 or simply settled on a variety of remakes of the ghostly modernist narratives from japan ringu 1998 for example after a the last decade of the 20th century which was signified with largely bland cinema and a political climate focused on the perpetration of sexual deviance the financial boom of the 90s was still to be revealed as a fallacy but this extension of capital greed would create an event that would change everything the attack on the twin towers in new york in 2001 led to a political and media climate of fear from this fear the machinations of our political elite were exposed it was also the first significant decade that unregulated internet discussion became widespread with the manufacture of torture on the island prison of guantanamo bay the climate of fear and the perpetration of us foreign policy on suspected terrorists would inevitably be reflected in cinema  specifically the horror genrethis trend set by films such as saw 2004 and particularly eli roths hostel 2005 and their sequels the subgenre was defined by the journalistic term torture porn or gorenography and was focused on physical mutilation torment and bodily endurance french filmmaker and screenwriter pascal laugier took this very conceited concept and managed to create a disturbing and potentially politically motivated and gender specific narrative of institutional abuse after a prologue involving a young girl being manipulated and abused by an unidentified institution the film portrays an appealing family breakfast which is quickly intruded upon a young woman lucie mylene jampanoi bursts into the family property gunning down the 2 point 4 unit once she is joined by anna morjana alaoui the significance of the murders becomes apparent this seemingly idyllic family unit hides a dark secret and these two young women had escaped from their tortuous captors 15 years previouslywhilst the first part of the film focuses on the revenge of the abused girls the film alters both thematically and changes the protagonistspectator relationship a trick used by hitchcock in psycho 1960 when the leading lady janet leigh is killed off the audiences identity is with the unstable lucie annas apparent devotion to lucie extends to the clean up in the slaughter house if the first half of the film could be read as a simplistic revenge narrative with hints of almost delusional character hysteria then the second part focused on anna forms an incredibly moving and disturbing descent into human suffering and endurance the secrets that the house hold is tantamount to serious institutional experimentationbefore lucie leaves the film she is haunted by a twisted and deformed person the apparition of a girl who attacked her when she was young but as the house is explored further the extent of the experiment is revealed whilst the perpetrators have moved from their original location their activities as torturers have moved with them a basement is set up for the purposes of systematic violence what becomes apparent is that the experiments perpetrated on young girls is formed by an elite society looking for answers to fundamental philosophical questions about existence it is this secretive elite that is reflective of the elitist society that rules the global masses this society or global institutions pursue these transcendental answers with disregard of the masses that they torture annas endurance and levels of abuse can be transcended if strong enough but why would we sacrifice our personal narrative to offer information to our institutions like the suspected terrorist held at guantanamo can any extracted information be effectively usefulas hostel portrayed the other that is the foreigner of america as twisted and not civilised like the predominant culture portrays the dominant politics of american foreign policy and the axis of evil simplification of terrorism as damaging and personally tragic it is certainly the most interesting of the torture porn films that i have seen but could easily be interpreted as incredibly misogynist the elitist society group within the film focuses its attentions on women only  the gender whose susceptibility to the experiment is historically easier but then the middleeastern terrorist would be portrayed in the media as women haters the male interpretation of their religion places the female as second class and many of the well publicised suicide bombers were womena damning indictment of the 21st centurys fearsome political climate but also a thrilling scary and often disturbing film it offers interesting twists and some gory asides of violence and mutilation with breathless verisimilitude the last twenty minutes or so shift in tone and the audience is witness the full extent of the torture experiment with the climactic allusions towards stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and references to hellraiser 1987 it is more rewarding than the average gore film of its ilk as of november 2010 an american remake was announced but heres hoping that by the time the undoubtedly false starts in production of an english language project will be completely abandoned basically heres hoping that this torture trend will dissipate and completely disappear but than again will the political and social extremities of our current political milieu be changed before the horror genre trendwwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,cruel

i short  a girl from asylum fights with her inner daemons which seem real as real as they can be being a guardian angel is an other younger girl helping her stay in contact with reality but this is just the established starting point i wont go into describing the turns and twists of this movie because they play a rather important role in creating the mood and feeling but i didnt find the points i found interesting about this movie in other reviews the visual solution is not so subjective as usually is done in these kind of movies with a person suffering from some kind of mental problems it connects you to the main protagonists but still its rather distanced as watched from a safe point of view i guess its because of the gore content which shown in a more subjective emotional or painful way would make this movie unacceptable than it is but still you can say that its not the extreme like other reviewers are saying its not the top but its made right like it should be because gore violence is not really the aim hereid say the idea behind is the pivotal point why this movie works though violent against women it works strong in putting women in a role of a messiah you cannot avoid seeing similarities with jesus christ and jeanne darcbeing the victim of a sick world the crazy insane girl becomes a saint in some way its a resemblance to the modern world increased in intensity to the limits still the problems of a western world inhabit lives of all these characters the killing burden of conscience struggle for a higher knowledge inaccessible to human mind struggle for immortality its all there in a physically sensible way id say this movie goes as far as being a manifest of feminist philosophy not many horror movies ive seen are as multilayered as this one nevertheless extremely hard to watch not for everyone,cruel
firstly i feel as though i have to warn the viewer before they pay four dollars and rent it harrowing is not a strong enough word to describe it this movie is for people who have strong minds and stomachs it is nearly impossible for me to tell you the brief outline of what happens in this film without ruining it for the viewer all i can say without ruining it is that it is about a young girl who was abused as a child i cant really tell you anymore because that is what in a nutshell this whole movie is abouti can personally watch any of those gore filled movies like saw without flinching but was different i watched it almost half a year ago and it still sticks in my head there is a real believableness about this entire film it perfectly depicts human cruelty and the ability the human body has to survive even when the mind might just want to die some of the scenes in this film are brutal and people might want to just turn off the movie and throw it away but i urge you not to stick though the film and you will start to understandyou would have to be a strange sort of person if you could watch this and openly say that you enjoyed it because i think it is a type of movie that you really cant enjoy even with all of the violent themes that run through this film it can still be called a beautiful film the directer has used light and shadow to not only create a atmosphere but as a whole other character this gives it a type of mystery that is never really explainedi hope that if you are one of those people who think that they can watch this that you do the whole movie is in french but please dont run because of that stick through the whole movie then if you can watch it again i think that you will get a lot more out of the movie the second time around i will warn you one last time do not i repeat do not watch this if you dont like these sorts of movies or if you have children of any age in the house with you,cruel
is a brutal compelling film with gruesome violence and a thought provoking story the film revolves around a survivor of brutal child abuse who seeks revenge against those who tormented her only to find out that she faces far greater enemiesthe film goes far deeper than most horror movies and not just in terms of its violence it gives far greater consideration to the traumatic psychological impact of violence while also looking at the religious and intellectual implications of suffering it will have you thinking about the ideas contained in its script for as long if not longer than you think about its brutalityfurthermore the script takes care not to fall into a predictable genre plot shifting its focus at several points in order to throw the viewer off guardthis is not a film for everyone many will find the brutality and make up effects grotesque if not downright vomitinducing even hardcore horror fans will find something that will make them want to turn their eyes however the intelligence and quality of this film raises it above the traditional torture porn grossout scenario making it a worthwhile view,cruel

france have somewhat mastered the horror genre of late i absolutely loved haute tension and so i expected big things from this movie did not disappointthere are some very disturbing scenes but for those that can stomach the saw movies will have no problems here its not as gruesome as the saw movies but the twisted plot leaves you speechlessthis is fantastically acted and the director has nailed the ability to keep the tension throughoutill be honest i really did think that this film was going to fall flat on his face after what was an excellent opening 45 minutes but i was pleasantly surprised with the ending twist which left me thinking that was a great moviei think what makes this movie so good is its originality i cannot think of a film which has taken this path before and this is easily one of the best horror movies ive seen910,cruel
i thought had a great concept but i guess the timing of me watching this disturbing film made me not like it as much as i should have i was expecting a normal horror film with gory scenes but did not expect what i witnessed first of all i took a random movie off the shelf of the horror section and said oh this looks creepy lets watch it i didnt even know the film was in french so you already know my little knowledge of this movie during each scene of child abuse and vicious bloodbaths i had mixed feelings of shock and uneasiness the intensity of this film is off the radar and there are many instances that catch you off guard for example one scene in particular i recall is when they cut to a scene where they show a normal family having a conversation at the kitchen table and all of a sudden the doorbell rings as the father goes to open the door unexpectedly a young teenage girl with a shotgun blows him to bits this was just one of many scenes that left me with my mouth hanging open and left my skin crawlingis a very disturbing film psychologically because the premise of the films subject about people being tortured in order to achieve a martyr type level leaves the viewer dismayed i myself can say i havent seen a movie in a long time that deals with violence and torture in the sense that did i thought this was a unique film with an eerie concept but the shock level of the film was too high for my liking if have no problem with extreme violence and torture and looking for a movie based on something you havent seen before check this one out certainly not for the faint of heart,cruel
this film is about suffering and the ultimately spiritual relief and i dont enjoy where the film goes technically this film is quite a surprise from the plot to the acting are all rather distinguish as all other french films like although it does come up some hints that related to spiritual practice such as the victims fully acceptance and nonresistance of the present moment zen or tao the way it conveys that spirit like all those efforts of making through the other world just twisted although it is very original to make a film like this but i personally cannot see any intrinsic beauty or value from it unless the purpose of the film is to get the audience go through the blood and pain suffered by the characters this defines the film just another saw movie although we all laugh at hollywood movies commercialnesssuperficialness and praise french movies being distinguish and original i doubt if french movie can ever make up their own way to achieve the greatness in terms of spirituality such as the last samurai like the american did710,cruel
i love a good torture horror film and by god this was great i usually find it hard going with foreign subtitled films being scottish apart from city of god but this was just fantasticstarting out it appears to be about a couple of girls seeking revenge on something that happened during childhood but the plot was a lot deeper that that i loved the twist and my feelings during the film changed from boredom frankly this was just another horror revenge film to horror and disgust to another feeling that i cant quite sum upi watched this just before going to bed and i couldnt sleep for a couple of hours as i couldnt stop thinking about it a sign of a great film if it leaves you feeling shocked and surprisedi consider this better than hostel and saw films,cruel
im not watching it againand its not because it was brutal but because it was incredibly boringdamn what a snoozefestsave your money,cruel
first off the dvd cover kept promising this was some new genre of horror wrong its just more of the same torture porn we got from saw and hostel even the weak twist ending didnt change that fact even the saw films had better twists than this onethat said heres how should have ended when the old woman leaned in to listen to anna after she saw the other world i expected anna to kill the bitch then unleash her psychotic bloodpounding wrath of vengeance against every sick fcker in that house by killing every one of them but that never happened so i feel cheated no matter what anna may have whispered to the old lady anna lost in the end after all that suffering she deserved some type of justice letting her just rot away in that tub of water while the others went on wit their lives was a spit in the face to her character and the viewerseven if they showed anna killing the others then it just turns out that she was hallucinating since the old lady said their victims tend to see things after awhile it would have been a much more satisfying ending than the oh gee whiz i wonder what the hell that ending meant crap they gave usand im sure some people will say i just didnt get it but theyre wrong i understood exactly what they were trying to do  and i hated it what a total waste of timejk90,cruel
this was a horrific watch i would never recommend it to anyone i understand some people have a different taste but this was not a horrori have way too many questions after watching thiswhy would you be friends with someone as crazy as lucie shes scarey as hell and gets u into troublewhy would u go help your murderous friendif u need to help her why would you insist on staying in the housewhy would you stay even after she killed herselfwhy would you call ur mom from that housewhy would you go to the basement and the reinforced trap doorand thats only the beginning of my questionsi felt sick it was horrific which im sure was the aim but all of that for what nothingits a whole load of torture for nothingit didnt even have a satisfying end,cruel
the movie has a plot that it is shoddy at best and only needs ten minutes of screen time to portray it its lauded by some as such a good movie but has plot holes and doesnt seem to advance at all while only dragging on some will say i missed the point but movies like no country for old men which is an in depth character study manchester by the sea which explores humanity pulp fiction which is a craft in more ways than one etc all convey their message and craft excellently this movies is part horror part tortureporn part existential film it tries to have some deep meaningful message which depending on the way you look at it is just gonna make you mad im not saying that it should have ended more jovially but it doesnt give you anything to hold on to really just the images but not a message or a plot sure this movie will stick with you and make you feel depressed and question humanity but it does so in a similar way that a ten minute real life gory video will if all it pretends to be is a movie that makes you see how ugly humanity is like i said ten minutes would have been enough it throws in a shamble of a plot an some kind of allegedly meaningful ending but its just a big balloon full of hot air a pretentious film that acts like it is more than it actually is there are other movies labeled as pretentious that actually have a coherent message and strong plot and strong character study this has none of that and ill stop now before this gets any longer,cruel
a movie made for psychos narcissists and sociopaths who feast on the extreme suffering of other people a sick movie made by sick mindsif you in any way enjoy or consider this movie a form of art you may and should want to seek out therapy for your serious mental condition if the makeup artist takes his own life because of his depraved contribution to the world then perhaps its a movie that should have a special rating those who regularly view it are put on a watch list for those who would be potential threats to society,cruel
pretentious torture porn movie wasted about half an hour on this movie after second girl got caught i guessed i had to watch pointless torture of the other one i skipped to the end to see if i was right and no big surprise i was sorry but director lacks big amount of intelligence and talent to make something meaningful sudden appearance of old people in expensive cars talking laughable nonsense that makes you wonder how they managed to survive in life with such feeble minds not to mention that they did so well does not not mean that movie is clever and serious for someone who just wants to watch torture of young girls this movie is good i guess so thanks but no thanks,cruel
may be gory horrendous disturbing unforgiving and cold it may shift your mood to depression or even make you physically sick but if thats all youre left with after watching it to the end youve missed the point beyond the disturbance factor i consider this film to be a vivid allegory of life there will always be suffering and people who benefit from itwhether they cause it or are subject to it suffering binds and teaches us the greater purpose of our existence just as much as loveperhaps even moreso than love i think since due to commercial marketingthe latter has become somewhat shallow and weve become more desensitized towards its core as a film lover in general but as a horror buff in particular i state that quickly became my absolute no1 if viewed as an allegory it has an uncanny applicability to the journey of knowledge through perseverance it may give one the strength to see things through despite the level of discomfort they stir up and the faith that all will make sense in the end if one is true or it may not perhaps you will see the redundancy of knowledge i for one gained a lot of balance after seeing it enough times to assimilate the message none of those times did i feel comfortable watching it despite or perhaps because of my awareness of its ending must watch,cruel
is a sick film  anyone who can deny this must be a sick sonofagun that probably belongs in some sort of mental institution or rehabilitation centre however the word sick is often a compliment towards gory horror flicks such as this one i must say that it is a very effective horror film it serves its purpose to scare the crap out of people like me the plot on the other hand felt underdeveloped if it was going for a philosophical plot twist it should have devoted some time for explanation and development what the filmmakers did felt halfboiled they threw an interesting idea at us but then didnt expand on it and let it rot in front of us the one that got away  i supposei felt that the first half was rather interesting there was a good theme for the plot  revenge ah a classic  and it really put me on the edge of my chair the second half on the other hand was not that great as i mentioned earlier the ending was undeveloped it felt as though the filmmakers tried their hardest in the beginning of the film and then just let the film die with their motivation to making a good movie my rating of a 5 is not a bad one its a mixed one i felt that the first half could easily be about a 7 and the second half more of a 3 or 4  which is bad but not terrible is a disturbing film worth watching by the most devoted horror and gore fans whether they end up liking it or not,cruel
i would like to talk about the characters of this film especially anna from the beginning we can witness her big heart and empathy towards those people who really needed it  lucie she also had a bad childhood maybe not as cruel as lucies she was so big hearted with her that she could bear her demon of course lucies demon was her own conscience and the cruelty of it and after all the years anna didnt lose her integrity with her self she wanted to help people still  she wanted to save the mothers life in the house unnoticeable to lucie i guess not because she was afraid of her rather she knew how big revenge is eating her friend inside and she was understanding her so much she was not starting to talk to her friend lucie about what is right and what is not because her friend was unable to grow up in a normal situation and what great power she had to find and help the other tormented woman she took care of her and hugged her even that a lot of people would run away because of her frightening sight so i have to tell again ann had so much deep understanding and really big heart even her all fear and hatred against her sick tormentors had gone totally i guess in the end the suicide of the lady somehow an influence from anna maybe she realized something more important than only the question of afterlife lucies character was also showing that she had empathy but it couldnt develop to so broad like anns because of her terrorized childhood so her conscience became her demon she wanted to help the other tormented girl but she couldnt her actions was so much clear in the state of her she could not act differently she had to kill those people and herself also but her death was so long and painful so it was a relief after all the tormentor group was totally living only in the ideas world so much that they lost all of their connection with the heart they victimized people young girls for the sake of their thirst to know what is in there after life or for the sake of their hypothesis they killed life to know what is life it can show how much people can do wrong if they live only in the mind althoug as i said maybe the lady got to know something important at the end who knows pascal laugier may be  so it is a really hard movie to watch but with very important topics sometimes extra violence or brutal environment is needed in the movie for us to see somethingthe actors and actresses was doing very good job in this movie also the director the atmosphere was totally perfect i could feel it all the way it was so heavy that i hardly could breath sometimesi was reading a few opinion in a different websites some people wrote that the writer should be rot because of the sick violence in this movie can they think with the heart because how can somebody wish to a living person anything bad and with the reason that his movie was so brutal it is paradox so we should be opening our heartsorry for my bad english,cruel
i cannot fault on any premise it succeeds in creating fear and tension whilst drowning you with intrigue for the duration of the film the film attacks you from every angle starting with the classic horror techniques then moving into more of a psychological battle towards the second half of the film it uses the best from every genre and uses it to great effect through strong acting and an even stronger storyline with constant twists and turns its a hard film to review as it can be seen as several films in one once one question has been answered its replaced by more then the more you question the deeper it takes you into its twisted world of martyrdom,cruel
the first 30 minutes of this is magnificent it is both frightening and very emotional it does not only have a blood bath to offer us on the screen but also the emotional workings of one of the main characters who ironically die in the middle of the film although at first sight it feels like another monster story in fact it is abundant with psychological matters about consciencebut after the first 30 minutes the film changes completely it becomes an organized crime story which i loathed the originality complexity and intensity of the first half hour is not to be found during the rest it is simply like hostel where we see a lot of torture and do not even feel disgusted by it any morethe organization is apparently a maniacal group of rich people who are obsessed about finding out about the other world and who torture young women because they are the best to put up with pain to bring them to a state in which they continue living but are able to see the other world so yeah bullshit absolute crap what i find even more disturbing is the fact that the director seems to imply that what this organization does is not in fact that bad i mean there is no criticism of their actions in the film none at allthere are a lot of references to christianity and especially catholicism the scene where anna is on a wheelchair under white sheet looking like holy mary and the way she is exposed to light after she has been skinned looking like christ on the cross which is fine and i do not attack the principles of catholicism which say that you have to put up with a lot of pain in this world since it is a test and the real world is the other one and so on however in the film it is not the natural difficulties of life that these women are subjected to it is organized torture if the director thought of the organization as a metaphor for life it was very stupid and i feel disgusted by the idea,cruel
im not a hardcore horror fani went into this unprepared didnt read any reviews didnt see any trailers priori have a horrible friend you know you should watch this movie called so i didits the first time ive went to bed with feeling like ive witnessed something truly terrible  heart wrecking just by watching this movieas if i saw a toddler being run over by a semitrailer truck right in front of mewithout going into to much of the movie itselfi will only say its a genuine masterpiece its a must watchi cant compare it to any other movieand its very likely youll never have the thought you know what lets watch that movie againi look differently now at pulldown ladders,cruel
this movie not only satisfied my morbid side of movie loving but also tapped into the my physiological fear as well incredible acting by all of the cast they made you believe in this world and the concept of the movie its self insanely brilliant,cruel
the ones calling this movie cheap or pretentious are like the dumb ones trying to find literature and poetry in nobel prize winning scientific papers just to show off how well educated themselves are this is a horror film for gods sake and horror is the thing this does so masterfully well that imo it can be considered representative of this whole genre which is also thes reason ive no hesitation giving this movie a rating of 9as far as any man made story or entertainment in general the best ones are that elicit the most emotions in you which this movie so cleverly does patiently drags you in while playing with your sympathy with heart striking suspense and intrigue then with orbital velocity suddenly bashes your whole existence on an iron wall that youre left with nothing but wonder and awenearing the end of the movie like in the plot the director literally transcended all the audiences into such a height that even the most mundane motion of any characters every little bit of extra audio or irregularities are all so suspenseful and at the same time frightening this is literally horror at its best something i almost ever experienced in any other horror movieon a more meta analyzing and commenting side the most innovative part of this film is the perfect mix of seemingly supernatural mystery and in reality torture porn too much of the former the torture part became pointless as theyre not even set in reality eg an arm cut of an immortal self repairing super entity is no longer frightening with talking heads and self moving hands every where while too much latter the audiences became numb as in their heart they know in the end its all fake with tomato juices with the perfect amount of supernatural mystery the audience have the anticipation and anxiety that literally anything is possible while at the same time with a reality setting carefully maintained everything in the story can have the maximum impact and weight on the audiences psychologyanyway in the end the filming actresses special effects all did their job perfectly in this movie together they make this imo one of the best if not the most frightening horror film human ever produced,cruel
you should watch this film for the story and the excellence in the transfer of raw emotion from the screen directly to you the superb cinematography contributes to immersion of the viewer into the evil depravity and violence directed upon the victims almost as if you were actually there watching as a eyewitness to the commission of a horrendous crime this is not a theater experience that you are likely to forget there is a remake of that was released in 2015 if you plan on watching both watch this original production first the remake does not come close to capturing the raw emotion and the true portrayal of the devastation wrought upon the victims nor does it adequately portray the overwhelming hatred that has been fermented spawning a unwavering need and a determination for retribution that the perpetrator has projected so deeply within the psyche even the very soul of the his victims as brilliantly demonstrated in this original motion picture after watching this movie you will feel as though you were physically present living the excitement the naked terror and horror generated by the totally believable depictions of pure sadism committed as you stood by frozen just watching,cruel
this film left me speechless it makes you wonder what if these things really happen out thereit really was a unique experience for me to say the least everything in the film being well done from the characters to the story and of course the ending from what other films i have seen i can compare to hostel and the first human centipede in some regards but far superior because it can really strike fear in youwhen i played the film i expected nothing more than a simple plot in which the victims get their revenge on the perpetrators and then we get a plot twist at the end which wasnt the case this film delivering much much more than thatas a horror genre enthusiast this film didnt disturb me in terms of gore but i must admit that there are some scenes that may be hard to digest for some viewers but if you fancy a great film that shows you but a small fragment of the dark corner of humanitys mind you must not miss this one if you are a horror genre fan like me then this one is a mustseea masterpiece like this one deserves no more than the maximum score of 10 from me it was a unique film unlike any other i have seenas a conclusion id like to thank everyone involved in making this movie and of course you the reader for taking time to read this review i would also like to encourage you if you havent already to watch it because even if its not for everyones taste its unique,cruel
there is a lot of intelligent debate about whether this film is a masterwork or simply pretentious exploitation but im leaning toward the former what begins as an almost unwatchably bleakbrutal film slowly transforms into a sincere and deeply moving study on pain and in so doing it takes the viewer on a journey with the main character slowly changing us as it changes her leaving us as numb exhausted and possibly as transcended as she as the violence intensifies over the runtime of the film so too does our perspective and understanding i didnt take my eyes off the screen but i almost dont remember the violence and torture of the third act all i remember isbeautya melancholy sadnessand an almost paternal love for the main characterits almost as if i was subconsciously blocking out the experience of the torture and putting myself in the same brainspace as the lead female the metaphysical questions posed by the films ending are interesting yet unnecessary afterthoughts because at that point in the journey you either will or wont have accepted the main impact of the film overall not an easily forgotten experience and i might be a better person for it,cruel
the film takes itself very seriously it isnt shocking for its graphic violence but for its relentless cruelty like irreversible it is technically well crafted and acted also like irreversible the plot is vague and often pretentious while french cinema can get away with arty vagueness in other genres it isnt something that works well with horror yes horror can be subtle and suggestive implying rather than showing that which is horrifying but does not do this it is little more than the generic plot of young teenagers getting stuck in a house with sickos and nothing in the storyline really gets beyond this apart from some incoherent existentialist theorising about why the sickos trap and torture people this existentialism is what the film hangs its serious credentials on to justify some pretty nasty stuff filmed in a realistic way that makes you wince in this respect is much more exploitative than your schlocky horror films as it attempts to present its upsetting brutality as intelligent its shocking and heartless cruelty as a noble attempt at truth and it fails,cruel
the first part of this film is tension filled brilliant horror that engages you with the characters from the get go the second part is depraved and unwatchable and yet i was compelled to carry on until the end to find out what would happen no movie has stuck with me quite as long as this with maybe the exception of irreversible which is responsible for my newfound fear of underpasses it is hard to describe how makes you feel whilst watching i felt desperate helpless and thoroughly involved for a while afterwards i felt a bit sick and confused but not necessarily in a negative way its very difficult to put into words and im glad to see others felt a similar way in regard to the long torture scenes i wanted to fast forward through them but you almost feel you owe it to the character to stay with her the acting is superb and makes the film feel horribly horribly real the only thing i didnt enjoy was the motiveending i was waiting to whole film to find out why these people were taking and torturing girls only to find out the reason is we want to see whats on the other side so we have to torture them to the point where they basically die and hopefully they are still alive to relay what they experience it is a pretty stupid idea and not well executed it was also frustrating not to hear the answer after the audience had just watched a woman being skinned alive but i can see why it was done that way i guess i really wanted redemption for anna in the end that was never realistically going to come this is a great horror film but it is not for everyone even all horror fans and i cant imagine watching it at a much younger age than i did 20,cruel
mademoiselle one of the people behind what transpires in says thisare exceptionally rare they survive pain they survive total deprivation they bear all the sins of the earth they give themselves up they transcend themselves they are transfiguredmademoiselles words bring to mind artistic representations of saints being killed in these images trauma is portrayed as something rapturous the veil between heaven and earth seems torn the saints face glows and he or she is transported by an otherworldly vision thus the event is not called trauma or torture or murder it is martyrdomhaving known many who have experienced great violence it is clear to me that trauma is very different than martyrdom trauma knows no heavenly companions no separation from ones tortured body no justifications and no escape routes trauma is a tidal wave that sweeps a person away and leaves the person stranded in a world that is no longer recognizable or safe it becomes definitive because it posits a before and after in ones life and an unbridgeable gap is wedged between the twothe establishment of a completely different before and after permits one to describe rapturous moments as containing elements of the traumatic but can one posit elements of the rapturous within the traumatic can one especially as an outsider looking in view the torture of another person and conclude that there was something rapturous about what was experienced speaking of being an outsider looking in i arrive at laugiers film which explores questions like these in great detail is singularly successful in communicating the reality of violence violence that is terrifying violence that is traumatic violence that is random unexpected and well violentthis is a different violence than what is seen in most horror movies it is not sexualized there is no escape through humour or moralizing and one cannot say that the violence is so over the top that the viewer can distance herself from the film this is why the reaction that many have to is also different as laugier explains is an affecting film and the majority of people who have viewed it have felt a lot by watching it but they dont quite understand the nature of the feeling here the simulacrum comes close to representing that which it explores violence trauma and significationactually prompts our initial question is there something rapturous to be found in observing the trauma of others mademoiselle is seeking this but the film throws the question back at the audience why are you watching this what are you seeking here like mademoiselle viewers of violent films seem to be in search of something more in the sufferings of othersbut is this the case evangelicals who watched the passion of the christ might answer affirmatively viewing gibsons snuff film made many feel closer to christ than they had ever felt this is odd i dont know anybody who would watch a snuff film about somebody they loved in order to feel closer to that person i think a fundamental mistake is occurring here the traumatic is being mistaken for the rapturous simply because the rapturous contains elements that appear traumatictherefore what is one to do when mademoiselle speaks of rapturous traumas do those who suffer know more than those who do not believing this leads us to stare at the sufferings of others with the hope of sharing that something more consequently perhaps those who are drawn to are experiencing the simulacrum of something more we are seeking the transcendent but since this is only experienced by those who actually experience the traumas we witness we continue to starebut is this a true statement about trauma when a woman is being beaten can we say that some kind of deeper meaning previously absent is now present ask those who have gone through such beatings and pretty much the opposite experience is the case perhaps then we stare at the traumas of others because we imagine that there just has to be some kind of deeper meaning or explanation otherwise what is going on here but maybe there isnt any sort of explanation or rapture maybe we stare and stare because we need suffering to make sense we want our traumas to be revelatory but maybe they are nothing more than what they are at the end of the day perhaps violence just is and perhaps the experience of trauma will always be nonsensical maybe we stare because we cant get our heads around that maybe we replay the images so that we can force them into some sort of system of meaning maybe we desensitize ourselves so that we can protect ourselves from remembering that much or all of this doesnt make any sort of sense  and movies like disrupt this systemization and so we are unsure how to feel about themwhen trauma does occur with others it lets us live in the moment when planes are flying into towers nobody is thinking about paperwork nobody is thinking about the rules of everyday life the trauma of others permits us to forget ourselves this is the opposite of what we experience when we go through trauma ourselves personal trauma isolates me within myself my body hurts what is going to happen to me next im afraid for my life hence we seek the former and shun the latter maybe we only live vicariously  we can create meaning with the lives of others we can witness it all and slot everything into a narrative that makes sense with ourselves we cannot do this as easily and when we think we have succeeded it is trauma that reminds us we have notperhaps it is the realization of this that leads mademoiselle to put a gun in her mouth,cruel
wow this movie really blew me off my feet as i am recalling it now i cannot think of anything about the movie i didnt like not that i liked what was being displayed because that was just sickening at times but because there where only a few small details where i could see it wasnt real well actually the only thing i didnt liked is that they do not answer the final question of the movie but this is kinda obvious because that question is unanswerablethe acting was really good sometimes even too good i could swear the actress got some pretty good real hits and i really had empathy for some characters the visual effects were astounding and i think there wasnt any cgi maybe some small effects but no monsters or things near the ending i was really happy with a scene where i could see that it was fake more clearly because i was beginning to wonder if it wasnt the movie really caught me and set a pretty good startled moodthe way the story is told is also really good it starts with a short police film about what happened some small flashbacks for explaining some things and further just normal telling with very much tensionbut the story itself is just amazing a young girl escapes from being tortured 15 years later she finally finds the family who tortured her all those years ago so she heads out to the family to get her revenge but from here the story escalates further and further with every scene at first i thought that something in the first half of the moviei wont spoil what didnt belong in such a quality horror and thank god it wasnt made of cgi but once you get it it makes perfect sense when this gets explained later in the movie you will start to understand the disturbed nature of both the main character of the first half the thing i just talked about and just the story itselfafter all this you feel like youve seen enough for a whole movie but you better prepare for a whole lot more because the next day dawns and the whole story goes over the top 4 times you will start to get things you previously didnt even noticed in the movie and when you finally know what its all about youll be more than satisfied although at times you might want to look away but i guess this shows youre human the movie ends with a bang and leaves you with the main question unansweredbut thats ok because that would be impossible although the movie is about finding the answer but the final words offer a nice room for both a good and evil interpretation which is worthy of a discussionthis is one of the best movies i have seen so far not that i have seen a whole lot but quite a few horror movies and i always search for the one with the best story,cruel
best horror ive seen in a long time 1010 simply stunning very powerful film with great acting by all especially the lead actresses who did a fine job and really pulled you in there were lots of twists and turns that i never saw coming and an ending you wont forget it has restored my faith in the horror genreif you are a fan of horror this is a must seewatch it if you like horror films dont watch it if you dont like horrorso many people rating horror films 1 star because it was sick or disgusting thats like rating a comedy 1 star because it was funny or a romance 1 star because there was too much love interest in it,cruel
i dont want to pretend that im a horror expert but i know my way around a lot of foreign horrordramathriller type movies and this is definitely one that sticks in my mindthe twists and turns are seamless but it does feel as though youre drifting through genres and at points you wonder what happened to get you to where you are in the filmhowever the start is fantastic it shows all the violence and the trauma and the troubled nature of the characters in one fell swoop and does so beautifullyall i can say is watch it because its a totally engrossing filmgoogle owmyfoothurts and foreign film reviews for more reviews especially if you like this kind of film,cruel
this is a sick horror movie that is also shocking and revolting it isnt the most revolting and sickest movie when it comes to this type of horror flicks but its still pretty messed up stuff the movie starts out with a girl who escaped from a place that was torturing her and she sees a vicious female monster that attacks her the victim also has a sister and the movie takes place 15 yrs later but the monster girl viciously attacks her to the point you wonder how she managed to survive for 15 yrs and things start to get really shocking from there with gut wrenching scenarios and some of the disturbing parts dont always come from pain inflicted on the victims but what is done to themselves although the pain inflicted on the victims is painful to watch as well though the twist of what is going on about a hour into the movie isnt all that original but still sort of shocking to watch and isnt for audiences that has a weak stomach to violence just when i thought its going to be a typical revenge flick the shock value is pretty high in this horror flick and so i can see how some horror buffs that love violent horror flicks would like this and find it amusing and some horror buffs that enjoy torture flicks will find this movie to be uplifting as well some even claim this movie is a explicit torture porn and to some degree i agree in fact this movie reminded me of of hostel with more mental and emotional aspects to it the man topic in this is how just like how so many people in the past and even now are interested in death this movie is about how far would some deluded people would go with insane efforts to find something out so if your looking for a gut wrenching horror flick that is depressing and also sad to watch than see this movie for others who start this movie will mostly finish it anyways though7210,cruel
the movie starts like a common movie of this kind of genre the tortured child that escapes the gory slaughtering of the family the grotesque fights with the imagined deformed woman the first half of this film seems like nothing special and is partially foreseeable and hard to classify not spooky enough for a horror not brutal enough for a torturemovie either but since the captivation of anna the movie makes a 180 turn and just hits the viewers face like a highspeedtrain the torture scenes last for about 15 minutes and are wordless the first pretty looking young anna turns more and more into a flayed meatball as much as her once beautiful outside changes her inside also breaks apart and all these terrible transformations are relentlessly thrown right into the viewers very heart one really wants to get this vulnerable girl out of the claws of her devilish torturers but the more the tormenting moves on the more one becomes aware about the fact that there will be no redemption for the poor innocent victim these scenes dont shock with their amount of gore but will hurt you on a psychological level of your mind caused by the unsparingly presentation of the girls suffering and the unbelievable coldness of her tormentors this tourdefarce peaks into the skinning of anna and when you see her raw body you wont be able to close your mouth anymore but the biggest shock maybe is the goal that lies behind all this seemingly senseless torturing getting behind the mystery of death itself the sinister organisation and especially the queer old lady worship their victims as for mankind for they reveal the deepest secrets that lie beyond the ecstasy of neardeath experiences this revelation almost reminds one about the twisted ending of polanskis rosemarys baby but with a much harder blow into the stomachas common as the film might begin as unbelievable and shocking it will come to its end the acting of the maincharacters is highly to be acclaimed mylne jampano les filles du botaniste gives a solid performance yet her role must be considered as quite short and without room for any development morjana alaoui instead convinces with an outstanding show of her decay she possesses a rare sort of appeal which makes the viewer want to protect her and make her tormentors pay her aura of innocence and vigour beauty increases the crime of destroying such a being even more all these facts put together make a film which will blow the viewers mind sustainably and force him to contemplate his views about moral ethics and his own mortality anewfinally it is done a movie that is worthy to be called the most shocking yet actually is more than a movie but a true experience of the darkest and most lost places of humans abilities,cruel
i was excited to see this it has a good rating and something about it just looked interesting overall i was disappointed and im surprised this film is rated so highlythe film is technically competent throughout and the first 40 minutes are quite good if realism is an important metric for you in your choice of horror movies this film is excellent in that regard even less common wounds are impressive and the film really succeeds in the repeated portrayals of someone who has been erm ravaged camera work is solid several scenes cut to the same scene same angle which is interesting it gives a disorienting feel that seems appropriate acting is alright nothing fantastic but nothing that distracts form the filmthe second half of the movie is where things fall apart essentially the movie ends half way through by pulling a clich and this is then drawn out for the second half a bit of extremely unfortunate plot is added which really should have been left out  its a real this is so stupid forehead slapping moment the movie gets very graphic here but because its so dumb its not interesting by the end youre just watching mutilation scenes without any interest in who or why,cruel
if anyone would ask me what the most disturbing movie ive ever seen is id have to say im reluctant to use the word scary since scary seems kinda juvenile compared on the impact this movie had on mei couldnt get a good night sleep for days after viewing it i know that a friend of mine actually cried during the movie and another friend couldnt take it so he fast forward itthe movie closest to this is irrversible but about 10x worseill never watch this or irrversible twiceif there ever should be an 18 discretion then and irrversible deserve it,cruel
1st of all i admit that the movie is not put together very well screenplay i dont say the story acting and direction are not very fine in fact they actually go on the negative sidenot too much thougheven the violence is not the greatest but its intensebut the movie is interesting and its differentthe ending is the best part of the movie which is extremely unpredictableits worth a watch if you are looking for a horrorthriller violent unpredictable movie  you should give it a tryi am giving this movie a 910 for its intensity which is my generous rating but i will never rate this movie less than 7 as a critic or 8,cruel
this movie was interesting really weird this first half of the movie was bloody intense and held my attention well but the second half was very repetitive and definitely went in the wrong direction once you get into the second half youll be feeling like it should have been over a while ago with the all reviews about how shocking and disturbing it was from i was expecting this movie to be almost unwatchable this is not the case there are plenty american movies such as the hills have eyes last house on the left and hostel that easily match and sometimes pass the levels of intensity and gore in dont get me wrong there are some uneasy bloody moments this isnt really a have to see movie but you might enjoy it it certainly is no masterpiece of horror,cruel
hello everyone watch out spoiler ahead i just saw yesterday and have been going through the various comments on the board i really dont understand how it can be called horror porn the reason behind the torture with no specifically sexual abuse such as rape involved as was stated at the beginning of the movie when the girl escaped was because the powerful rich wanted to know what was on the other side by reproducing the agony of the religious even though many shown were not religious at all but the idea is the same through their agony they see the other sid or god i see political implications here remember society the idea that at the end there is no other side makes the old lady of the powerful aristocrat shoot herself because she knows now that it was all useless there is no other sidepity actually because they all should eventually got to hell  where is this tortureporn or does it have a significat meaning to me it has,cruel
i think that was a good film but i dont think it meets up to expectations after the hype i heard about it my partner a blockbuster employee has to warn customers before hiring the film about its graphicemotional contents i expected more from the film and saw the predictable ending although this doesnt stop it being a good film i would recommend it to watch as it worth it i found that the torture scenes and the entrances and exits of the tortures a bit boring and didnt remain shocking although i could understand why this was done to build a relationship with the character and make audiences uneasy i found that the first half of the film up until she is tortured is the best as it captures the emotional effects of torture and how people deal with it,cruel
only a sick person can enjoy watching it its torture porn nothing else,cruel
nothingabsolutely nothing this film and totally all the splatter gender is just another cheap garbage that tries to earn its money by shocking the audience the big hidden message is just an excuse instead of being just a hostel it is supposingly becoming a cinefil horror movie with something important to say but it hasnt but the most disappointing of all isnt that they filmed a crap like this its that many critics are claiming that this is a good film or somethingall the cinemagraphic techniques are old and well known nothing new and nothing interesting bullshit my friends totally emptiness covered with skin and blood,cruel
in short  this is a waste of time the most disappointing thing about this movie is motivation behind the torture while watching it you are waiting to see what is behind all this violence what is the aim of all of this do they do it for fun are they psychopaths are they ill are they deranged the answer is sooooo weak and so poor that you realise those who made this film just wanted to film some torture scenes but needed the excuse of a film to fund it and do it nothing makes you engage with the characters the twist which becomes predictable after 5 minutes is revealed in the first third leaving you with a pointless movie i do not understand what the other positive reviewers were seeing that i didnt finally imdb classes this as a horrordramathriller there was no drama there were no scares i was not thrilleddont waste your time,cruel
2008  12 out of 4 bitterly disgusting and rather vile french film has a young girl named lucie escaping from a hell where he she held captive and tortured day after day fifteen years later lucie mylene jampanoi with the help of friend anna morjana alaoui seek revenge against those who did the torture thats pretty much what the back of the dvd case will tell you but thats pretty much the first fifteenminutes and youve got a lot more rather ugly and disturbing stuff to go through those who thought the french film haute tension pushed to new levels will find that film to be like a disney movie compared to this one ive got really mixed emotions about this film because on a technical level its very impressive i highly enjoyed the ugly atmosphere built up by director laugier and he has a certain visual style which isnt all fast edits and quick cuts hes not afraid to just let the camera role pick up what action he can and milk it for every emotion imaginable another major plus were the performances with both female actresses coming off so real and powerful that at times you will forget that youre actually watching a movie both women are so focused and so into their roles that it really makes certain scenes very hard to watch the movie starts off on an ugly page but then gets a little cleaner as were introduced to a family but what happens next really threw me for a loop and it will take you by such surprise that youll know that anything can happen in this film and anything almost does another major plus are the special effects which are quite brutal and very realistic we get nonstop violence and gore and most of it goes beyond the tortureporn stuff weve come to watch the past several years the special effects range from bullet holes to wrist cutting to other major scenes of disgust that i wont give away to avoid spoilers i wont mention the exact effect but what remains at the end is one of the most brutal and memorable scenes from any horror film that i can think of earlier i said that this film left me with mixed emotions ive said all the great stuff and now its time to look at the bad i personally find tortureporn movies like saw hostel and various others to be fairly weak stuff they want to shock young viewers but to me they arent the strongest stuff out there this film is being sold as the same type of thing but this here is a lot more as the film tries to be disturbing even without the graphic violence with that said as a diehard horror fan for life i started to ask myself who would enjoy watching something like this i mean seriously the final thirtyminutes we get to see someone abused tortured pee herself and various other vile things and what for i dont believe in taking some sort of high road or moral preacher but this is the first time that i can remember asking myself what on earth any of this was for and what appeal this stuff could have the movie is wellmade disturbing and immoral and its certainly unlike many others id say 100 of people will turn this off after tenminutes perhaps 90 of horror fans will hang in there until the end and i cant say id blame anyone for turning it off,cruel
i realize this is an incredibly polarizing movie in terms of audience response but for the life of me i cannot see why its absolute trash its gratuitous torture porn made worse by its highfalutin attempt to trick us into believing that its deep the fact that the movie blatantly states women make the best aka recipients of emotional and physical torture is particularly disturbing im just going to recap this for you guys so you can do yourselves a huge favor and skip this pile of garbage  spoilers to follow  lucie a young girl is the victim of ritualistic torture who has recently escaped from her brutish torture chamber and her two abductors she is placed in a psychiatric facility where she meets fellow woebegoner anna the two form a close friendship flash forward 15 years and lucie thinks shes found the couple responsible for her childhood suffering from a photograph she sees in a newspaper article a revenge style home invasion ensues after lucie has hacked her way through this seemingly idyllic family of four good ole loyal anna shows up to help clean up the bloody mess while anna is playing maid and grave digger seriously anna should rethink this friendship lucie is coming to terms with her demons  literally theres a psychological component that is actually pretty scary but with a twist that is so obvious it couldve been spelled out on the walls in blood if these first two acts had been flushed out with a little more storyline and a lot more subtlety i think this would have made for a decent movie that explores the depth of emotional trauma in abuse victims but of course it doesnt stop there theres a whole third act of depravity left to endure anna discovers a new and improved torture chamber below the house that is accessed through an unlocked cabinet in the living room i can only assume that the couples two teenagers were in on their parents unusual weekend hobby because what kid hasnt looked inside every cabinet of their home gotta find that secret stash of booze amirite it would be sort of hard to miss the tunnel leading into darkness behind that ikea cabinet by the television so the audience is now asked to suspend belief on one of two seemingly impossible realities  a that the children were really that dense to never realize their parents had a giant gleaming modern underground bunker beneath the house dedicated to satanic style ritualized torture and murder or that b these seemingly well adjusted star athlete high schoolers were living in full knowledge of their parents alternate lives its the devils rejects meets the brady brunch people this is the plot holiest of all plot holes and deserves at least five eyerolls but anyways so anna keeping with her shtick of having poor freaking judgment decides its in her best interest to go explore said chamber of satanic doom i refuse to go into all the terrible things that happens next except to say theres a cult and some more ritualistic torture but trust me when i say its hard to stomach there are visuals in this film that i reacted to as strongly as i did the first time i saw pictures of holocaust victims the brutality thats depicted in the final act is just gut wrenching i wanted so badly to turn it off but i kept thinking there was going to be some culminating purpose and what was i left with a sense of regret and a bad taste in my mouth i simply cannot fathom what the meaning of this film was supposed to be people can transcend their suffering yes its called disassociation at the end of this twisted journey there is no answer to the question why did i just watch this there is no justice for any of the poor brutalized women depicted and there is no deeper meaning this is m night shyamalan levels of pretentious debaucherymy advice skip,cruel
let me start my review with this i knew very little to nothing about this movie my friend had the idea so we decided to just check it outmost people would call this movie torture porn and to some people it may appear to be that way but this movie requires you to think and not just focus on the physical aspect of the filmi dont want to put more into this review since the movie is best viewed raw from what i gathered of itthe cinematography is phenomenal the score although there isnt much music in the movie is great the acting is superbyes this movie is disturbing violent and may bring nightmares to some peoplebut its worth the watch trust me after watching it itll give you a feeling you wont find anywhere else a genuinely terrified feeling is brutal emotionally and graphically but in the end its a beautiful production,cruel
this movie floors you if you are squeemish dont bother humanity is looked at from every angle ill never watch this again,cruel
lately ive been watching a lot of foreign horror films as ive run out of american ones that are any good i must admit i spend hours sometimes looking through online lists with names like best horror films in the last 10 years and any list that contains sinister or the purge is immediately disqualifiedits unfortunate that my favorite genre mostly produces crap for every great horror movie ive seen there are at least 25 bad ones that ill have to suffer through before getting to another gem was a gem although that term seems a little inappropriate some how in a film that is so ugly and left me feeling so terriblei have to admit about 4560 minutes into i was about to turn it off i thought it was stupid unnecessarily violent and the plot seemed like it was going no where fast in fact i was shocked to see there was more then fifteen minutes of the film left which is probably why i continued on i simply could not see where the story could go with another hour or so left and all but one of the characters deadi am glad i stuck with it though because that first hour or so is really just a set up for the real horror to come the director disorients the audience into thinking this is a movie about psychotic delusions and then you come to find out theres some truth behind these imagined delusions involving an incredibly offthewall conspiracy twist that somehow works if you just dont question it too much because thats really not the point of the last half of the film is almost unbearable to watch it manages to make movies like hostel trouble every day and the saw series look like light hearted comedies i mean really i have a strong stomach for gore not just in movies but ive seen some terrible things in real life too so believe me when i say this movie is literally like an assault on the viewers eyes unlike hostel or saw though the torture and violence is almost tasteful for lack of a better word this movie achieved what i imagine mel gibson wanted to create in the passion the viewer becomes incredibly sympathetic and moved by the protagonists struggle and at the end after the final insult to her body it almost becomes beautiful ill admit i even shed a tear after our hero becomes flayed and theres that magnificent close up shot of her eye as she enters a state of ecstasythis is a really quality film i cant say that i enjoyed it but if you appreciate film as an art form and also appreciate horror films then i definitely recommend it it definitely goes above and beyond anything ive ever seen before in the tortureporn genreand what i mean by that is its actually a good movie not just a splatterfest,cruel
surprisingly there are a bevy of bad user reviews for this film and contrary to these i really loved this film you will too i must say i was very impressed at how intelligently laid out the story line is the excellent twist of plot the character composition the atmosphere and the superb acting and therefore it is a must see in my booki enjoy intelligent films and have a morbid curiosity for the twisted ones this one did not disappoint and surpassed expectation anyone who says it had no purpose or is just torture porn clearly missed the beautifully unraveling story and main premise the film touches on a believable topic in pushing the scientific envelope and yearning to understand the afterlife the entire premise is based on the belief by a group secret researchers that beyond the pinnacle of pain torture and suffering just prior to death the strong willed touch the other side and experience heavenly bliss the way in which the writerdirector arrives at this is simply beautiful smart and horrifying the story alone would make for a bestselling book but the way in which the shock is trickled among the emotion and depravity of mental illness revenge afterlife and hanging on to life through pain coupled with the ending is like nothing else out there in filmof course there are brutal scenes but it pales in comparison to some of the unintelligent teeny bopper slashers that lack substance i found myself cringing a bit yet i understood eventually there was a purpose  to show that anna had to bare the brunt of this pain to fight death and experience the ultimate bliss she is a survivor she lived on through the torture by having hope to escape like lucie had yet the researchers wanted her to live for their own selfish purpose the second act was the most captivating piece for me because anna goes through all the stages of despair and suffering to an ultimate horrifying climax the movie moves from elated escape to exacting revenge to mental horror to scary monster to horrific discovery to pain and suffering and finally to a climactic finishi highly recommend this film for those who are tired of the same old hollywood pieces and teeny bopper plots this movie is something more this movie is a martyr in and of itself,cruel
on the occasion of the release of the remake i decided to watch again watching it the first time was an experience like no other its the kind of movie that after its over you need some time to regain your composure and your senses and to process what you just went through a truly impactful movie thats in all honesty unforgettablein the years since its been made it hasnt lost anything in part because despite some recent attempts at making fresh horror nothing comes close it was the seal of the short french extreme horror years in a way it was also the end of the torture porn era even tough saw continues to limp along for no good reason a dreadful and pointless franchise that should have ended a long time agoim not a fan of the torture porn label even more so when applied to still is the best torture porn movie that isnt a torture porn movie but so much more no other movie has made more visceral torture scenes than scenes that are more of a ritual than individual scenes no other movie has managed to torture its audience along with it main character like it martyrizes us in the processand yet this isnt torture for the the sake of torture like all those true torture porn movies when its all said an done this is torture for the sake of something else something other than torture something much greater than pain and suffering in this case ultimate knowledge or knowledge of the ultimate and the huge payoff in is intellectual again not just for the protagonist but for the audience as well which is why i think many dont like it the payoff isnt emotional youre left with a huge emotional question markgranted the knowledge we gain in isnt an answerbut a question however after having experienced even a question is enough after all its not just any question but the question of lifeis among the very finest movies ever and the greatest horror movie and by a good margin,cruel
has got to be one of the top 5 movies of all time in my book of the countless times ive seen it i never tire of itlove the 2 gorgeous french girls in the lead madame turbanhead is right on up there with the grandest of torturers deservedly next to pinhead  marquis de sadethe reboot is bound for disappointment im dreading itbut must know just how bad it is to be most assuredly in amerikan spoiling handsmeh to that the tense edge of your seat atmosphere is consistently permeated from the beginning of the film to the very last second any film encompassing that which is otherness is truly monumentally worth the watch the tintinnabulation in the resonance of the haunting it plagues one with is timeless and without bounds a true french new realism magnum opusincomparable i have found this treasuremost definitely not for mass consumption as its far too sublime in its pathos  slicing edge onto ones psyche  very core to have survived the truest sufferings of existence is to have truly appreciated in all its groundbreaking breadth the pity was that the film had to end at all so enrapt does one become in the entanglement of its living and gasping misery i truly envy anyone about to see this gem for the first time,cruel
there are few movies out there that makes me uneasy and disturbed when i watch them not in a ouch that hurt way but more like feeling the atmosphere the surrounding the pain everything while seeing the scene the movie itself starts off normal it goes normal but then all of a sudden it gets a turn you would never expect leading to stories you wouldnt ever expect if you ever want to disturb your friends with a real horror movie i strongly suggest this onethe violence is so well made and recorded that it just doesnt give blood and slash but also the feeling the amazing thing is that it is not just stupid horror that most horror movies are but the twist that the movie gives gives an amazing explanation to why everything happens as it does and it actually gives of an amazing explanation that makes you wonder for more then a couple of minutes yes it might seem too far fetched and boring in places but its just about surviving til the end and you will definitely think its worth it,cruel
dont get me wrong is a good film and definitely disturbing enough to warrant a spot on nearly every top 10 most disturbing film lists however where succeeds in its original horror take it falls a bit flat in the filler portions of the film but it bounces back to full throttle in the final 10 minutes giving you an image you will never forget just dont go into this film with your kids or thinking its going to be a blood splatter fest its far too clever to give off cheap thrills like that whilst is by no means perfect it is original disturbing and a good film to watch hard to watch at times both due to boring filled i time and its intense disturbing factor will no doubt keep you thinking about it for a long time after the film,cruel
i like to be scared so i am in the constant search for scary movies that will make me gasp reach for the blanket and regret i even started the movie and there are probably other people like me here on imdb the movie started out scary really scarybut it lasts for only 25 minutes or sothen the ridiculous torture begins which ive seen 120 times beforeso im getting the feeling that the people who made this movie first original idea was some new fancy way to torture people and later wrapped it up in some fancy reason to categorize it with other thinker movies this will get a 6 as so many other horror movies wonder if a scary movie ever will earn a real 7 rating,cruel
oh france i cant quit you between this high tension irreversible and inside i think le franais take the cake for producing some of the most twisted horror films of the twentyfirst century with we have what begins as an inexplicable home invasion scenario an apparently wealthy family is interrupted during sunday breakfast by a hooded woman with a shotgun things dont end prettily but if you thought that was bad youve got another thing comingpascal laugier penned and directed this film which turned heads in 2008 and is now legendary before he was known for his divisive supernatural drama house of voices which didnt receive the fraction of praise hes gotten for this but is indisputably the better film the script here is adept and tight it starts off running and defies our expectations from stage one it begins on one foot but funnels into something far darker and demoralizing the central theme is a spiritual one which is perhaps part of what makes the film as compelling and as disturbing as it is here violence and degradation are a means of uncovering a spiritual and existential truth humankinds ultimate riddle that we cannot seem to unravelwhile the film does become a bit tedious as it propels our heroine or martyr toward her fate the repetitiousness and grating on the audiences limits of endurance are a necessary part of the package here both morjana alaoui and mylne jampano turn in vulnerable and terrifying performances while catherine bgin is just the right tinge of detached evil the films conclusion is perhaps more rattling than the on screen violence that precedes it and thats another beauty here that the response is not just impulse toward gore but also an emotional entrapment psychologically and aesthetically has a death grip on its audience and for that i commend it,cruel
there are many things that could be said about some would say it is a violent exploitation film others would say that is is a gory horror flick but it is neither from the first moment the film starts the viewer gets drawn into a bleak world a young girl running away from sadistic abusers we do not who they are yet will eventually the girl escapes but the psychological and physical damage has already left a very severe mark years later an apparently simple family home becomes the setting of a horrific nightmare a nightmare years in the making carried out by a young woman plagued by grotesque visions symbolizing her pain when she endured as a child very soon the viewer knows that terrible individuals were responsible for an act that is beyond inhuman then the movie starts with a normal family breakfast that turns into a bloodbath and very soon lines are blurred of who actually is the antagonist the girl getting revenge or the people that caused her to commit a heinous massacre the last two acts of the film combing glorious elements of existentialism and deep dramatic character development that culminates in a terrifying yet bittersweet finale obviously influenced by many real world cults and reminiscent of the jonestown incident this film will leave you thinking it really should be watched twice people that compare this to irreversible or frontiers are not very smart as both of those films are garbage watch this film as you will not be disappointed as long as you can handle the violence 1010,cruel
this movie is one of the new wave of french horror from the past 15 years such as high tension and frontiers i have to say the acting is amazing and the effects and gore are as well it starts out that the character lucie is abused and gets away she ends up in a pediatric psychiatric hospitalorphanage she wont talk about what happened to anyone she finally ends up making a friend anna flash forward 15 years and lucie sees the people that hurt her in the newspaper and hunts them down to seek revenge through murder she is tormented by a figment of her imagination a girl she left behind when she escaped finally her friend anna notices that the woman anna shot that abused her is not dead and goes to help her this results in lucie thinking that anna never believed her she freaks out and kills herself anna ends up finding a stairway to a basement where there are pictures on the walls of tortured people she even finds a girl thats been tortured that she tries to help the girl is so traumatized she ends up trying to run away and gets shot it turns out that the people doing this were involved in a group that was trying to create basically to see what is in the afterlife you see anna go through every kind of torture imaginable finally shes skinned alive she lives and the leader of the group gets her to tell her what she sees which you never find out the group shows up to hear what is in the afterlife but the leader shoots herself before she tells anyone overall dont over think it its worth the watch the plot acting and effects are amazing give it a try,cruel
i do not care much about the form of a movie and how it is made i do care about the content the content of is terrible if you think about the probability that something like this could have happened in real life which is high we can emphasize with the level of desperation of a tortured person we see religious fanaticism or fanaticism of any other kind in hands of crazy probably rich enough to get through with it unknowingly living in one household with monsters brutality to completely innocent person and knowing it revenge is on its place here good friendship on the other hand and willingness to help a stranger,cruel
a heavy movie definitely not for a casual viewer of horror had some extremely graphic scenes abuse violence a really great endingwhich will leave anyone thinking about the movie hard to figure out what was that all about some parts of the movie however were a little boring and could have been replaced by making the plot more complicated by adding more characters or more options for the woman who was held hostage really the whole time it seemed like she is hopeless and there is no way she can escape people who love goreabuse will enjoy this especially the ending i would not advise people who are sensitive to violence watching this since this movie took it to an extreme level,cruel
this has to be the most disturbing film ive seen its disturbing difficult to watch mind you but not disgusting as some movies that are disguised as scary films the very idea the gist  treatment of the film scares you the film starts with a girl named lucie being tortured and then she manages to escape the house where she was kept then we are shown a family that seems normal and likable but lucie returns with her childhood friend anna and we come to know that the couple was the one who help lucie captive  tortured her lucie takes her revenge but her delusions become stronger but we come to know theres much more than thatthe film is more about anna though than lucie youll know it when you see the film the violence seems very much real and is unlike the lame hollywood flicks this is why i like french films theyre raw and seem genuine unlike hollywood filmsthis film is definitely not for everyone people who are averse to watching violent films stay away from the film the rest enjoy this french masterpiece ending is superb its like nothing youve ever seen,cruel
i think if one is to review the film one has to focus on the ending it is essential to understanding the rest of the film one can consider starting from the point when anna found sarah that the violence and the structure provide us with the necessary background needed to contemplate the suicide of mademoiselle though it is not like the horrific scenes prior to finding sarah had no impact but i feel the scenes after discovering sarah had a direct influence on our understanding of the psychology of mademoiselle the question i had at the end of the film was was the knowledge gained worth the pursuit mademoiselle killed herself because she got an answer to this question though we do not know if the suicide was caused by guilt or happiness to die because it was better to be dead and she wanted to keep this to herself in the end we a left desiring the answer to this question as well as a new question would we do anything to find out,cruel
i am usually not into horror films as a i do not consider blowing winds sudden shouts or creaky doors horrifying b i want evil to be real not imaginary c at the end i would like to know what was real and what was not too many creators of horror films think that the more sophisticated the script the better consisting of two different intertwined parts was generally well watchable the scenes were intense with many twists and unpredictable solutions leading actresses  morjana alaoui as anna assaoui and mylne jampano as lucie jurin  were catchy and credible camerawork was skillful the evildoers however could have obtained more attention and clarification the reason behind those atrocities and the amount of people involved was not really satisfactory and the preending and ending could have been wittier as well more in the hitchcock style when you really feel horrified while the subtitles rollnevertheless a film far above average recommended to all those fond of related topics and films,cruel
i have seen many many movies but this one is seriously messed up if you can get through the first half of the movie hold on to seat cause the last half is where the chit hits the fan hard to imagine anyone man or woman could survive such brutality and doubt seriously that anyone could but it is a movie after all and as we know anything is possible in a movie the closest thing i can think of to compare this is movie to is grotesque but that is mostly do to the shock value of this movie bondage and torture be warnedthis movie is not for the squeamish or faint of heart,cruel
dont underestimate this one is pretty heavy even for me one moment actually had me wincing as i sat alone with one other guy in cinema 3 of the trak in adelaide which only consists of four small rows the 97 minute flick seems to last much longer sitting at the front no more than ten feet from the screen i must say i was wowed by the story if cinematic appeal especially in the last half hour kojo productions which is an adelaide company was partially responsible for this foreign shocker which sees two sisters who when younger girls were snatched after their parents were brutally killed but manage to eventually escape their captors now grown up they return forth a bloody vengeance that has us cheering inside again they are reliving the hell of the past when they are snatched again only this time theres really no escape and its here where the story really gets weird as though the story is talking over your head you really have to wrack your brain but if you do it on this one i guarantee it wont be long before your head will hurt believe me this film is shockingly bloody one scene involving a full skinning which almost took the cake this is still one of the most shocking unnerving hard to stomach flicks ive seen which still haunts me visually at the memory of a few scenes its horror on a very heavy scale be warned before viewing this one an intriguing horror i must say one of the most intriguing years drawing some creepy parallels if faintly comparing it to audition,cruel
i just finished watching this movie and quite frankly it is a very shocking movie it is not for people who are not accustomed to watching gory moviesread hostel saw etc it is also not a movie for people who dislike movies with an open ending also some people do not understand the point of this movie but isnt all fiction inherently pointlessaccording to me the gore is not as appalling sorry for not having a better word as the 2 movies i just mentioned so its not violent to the point of being unwatchable but the movie is actually thought provoking and very tragic contrary to some peoples thinking most of the films violence is in the first half the second half is a little less on violence and more on what anna is going through though that does not mean that there is no violence in the second half at all but it did not make me cringe as much as similar scenes from hostel did the acting by the 2 leading ladies is surprisingly great and makes you feel for them         alert spoilers below          the plot has some really good twists and turns which at times are very touching and tragic apart from being shocking athe revelation of who that woman haunting lucie was as shown in her memories bthat anna tries to save the blond wife in the family canna feels guilty about not believing her friend and saying sorry and dthe end credits are my favorite among the twists but the hopelesslyshockingtothecore moment in the movie which actually impressedand shocked me a lot was when anna finds out the other martyr in the house and talking about the open ending i think there can be at least 23 different interpretations that i can make on my own1anna told mademoiselle something like she will be facing consequences of whatever she has done in her life good or bad in her afterlife which made her feel fear which led her to her end2anna told mademoiselle that the afterlife is so beautiful that she killed herself to experience it though the chances of that are quite low but not impossible3anna told there is no afterlife which made mademoiselle think that all the wrong she did is all pointless and thus she felt all the guilt leading her to kill herself  spoiler overso no matter what it is a good watch a movie which has lots of gore but still has some meaning to it,cruel
horror is my favorite genre but its also the hardest to please my appetite so i have very few horror movies that i would consider great most have a moment or two that are entertaining and the majority are just awful had the chance to be one of the greatest horror movies ive ever seen from the opening scene to the climax this movie was disturbing scene after scene of sheer terror and disgust this movie had it all there was a lapse of redundancy that went on for quite a while but that was tolerable then it got to the payoff the reason for this young womans torture and it was so stupid moronic and unbelievable that it ruined all the brilliance that came before it there are many who defend the payoff theyre full of it yes people have done things in the name of god before terrible awful things but nothing like this and not for any reason close to this stupidity if you enjoy violence for the sake of watching violence if watching humans suffer terribly for no good reason at all then you will love this had the chance to be absolutely brilliant instead it was just pure torture porn for nothing such a shame,cruel
i cant say that i enjoyed this movie but then i dont think that was the point its very disturbing i thought that the first 23 of the movie was better than the rest though it was almost like watching 2 different movies put together the first 23 was interesting  believable even if it was upsetting i was actually pretty engrossed until the story line veered off the rest felt like it should have been a whole different film there could have been more background to itthe last parts  insight into the characters that were introduced later it just felt to me like they decided to come up with a twist at the last minute  this was the result it just didnt mesh well i wouldnt recommend the movie itself to anyone however i thought the main actress was great i look forward to seeing her in something a little less disgusting,cruel
this film is not like any other i have seen and i wanted to wait to watch it a second time to make up my mind about it mind you i had to wait a good 18 months before i could find the nerve to rewatch it is really a film of two parts the first part is plain and bloody horror and the second part more psychological and brutal horror both parts of the film work equally well and are full of surprises though i found the second half to be very grueling to watch i had a constant feeling of anxiety throughout something i dont recall having watching any other film it is extremely well filmed with high production values and actually has a plot which makes you think which is not often said of this genre the two young leads are both excellent especially morjana alaoui as anna who excels in what must have been a very difficult role to play the ending of many horror films are notoriously poor but for me the ending really turns this from a good horror film to a truly great horror filmwithout doubt this is the scariest and most disturbing film i have yet seen but also one of the classiest due to the subject matter some people will understandably hate it my wife did but if you have the stomach for it then this film is a surprisingly rewarding if harrowing experience just dont try and watch it alone,cruel
this film definitely has something to say about religious fanaticism but it doesnt reveal itself until the last five minutes i think it did itself a disservice by holding its cards so close to its chestimho it would have been much more satisfying if wed been let in on the secret much sooner by the time the truth is revealed i was thoroughly bored by the torture because we didnt know the why these awful things were happening it just felt like some sort of vile sadomasochistic pornmaybe im a bit stupid but i really hadnt worked out exactly why such terrible things were happening to these women more intelligent viewers may have realised what was going on but not methat said i still think it would have been much better if wed been given an insight into the religious loons and their search for redemption without that it felt too much like any other piece of torture porna shame because once the motives of the torturers is revealed everything makes sensetldr could have been much better if the writerdirector had told the story differently,cruel
each and every time i read articles about horror movies which are the most horrific the ones that will shock the pants off you is always close to the top of the list naturally after reading profusely about this film intrigued at its ability to shock even the most jaded of horror fans i had to give it a look of course things arent always as they seem in the world of film criticsthe film itself is french filmed in quebec canada dont be disheartened by subtitles i find them an excellent way to help fully absorb yourself in a movie anyway not the point it follows two girls lucie and anna both subjected to horrible abuse as children however in separate circumstances adult lucie is determined to get revenge on those who put her through such terrible anguish with anna generally supporting her lucie suffering from trauma as well as delusions soon allows herself to be consumed by her mental instability leaving anna alone in the house of lucies abusers i know this seems like a longwinded introduction but i dont want to give any of the events awayshortly into her time in the apparently empty house anna makes a discovery a sterile hospital like basement hidden away from the world in this basement anna finds yet another like lucie who has been tortured in the same manner minus the escape needless to say annas attempts to help the other are shortlived once again alone in the house anna is confused and becoming unravelled that is until she is foundfrom here on the film takes an interesting turn exposing us to a world filled with depravity and torment all the while lacking humanity and reason as annas life begins a rapid downward spiral it becomes quite difficult to understand why this film was made the concept of a martyr is not entirely convincing and while many reviews rave about how different is from the shockhorror goreporn we have all come to know  i dont know i cant say i necessarily agree the film is bizarre twisted degrading horrific unreasonable and to be frank fed up dont get me wrong i understood it but was there a need for it perhaps notlook give it one viewing  if you get squeamish at mutated humans like me then youll get a slight kick out of it but ensure you are prepared for a whole lot of strange will definitely not be anything like you are expecting if you liked this review dont forget to follow my blog horrorbleblogspotcom ,cruel
years ago lucie mylne jampano escaped nameless captives who forced her to withstand torture denigration and mutilation through time lucie was unable to cope with the stress constantly haunted by a ruthless revenant who causes her bodily harm finally lucie stumbles upon the family responsible and decides to avenge herself hopefully getting rid of the apparition in the progress after dispatching a family of four including 2 kids the hysterical lucie calls on her only friend anna morjana alaoui to assist her with dealing with the aftermaththe new french horror wave seems to be easily characterised as deeply nihilistic unabashedly graphic and visceral with atmospherics to kill for literally unfortunately also devoid of logic charm and sensible characters instead supplanting them with excruciatingly exercised clichs taken from american movies the underlying message seems to be  whatever the americans can do we can do worse  not only is their brutality more graphic than that in america but also their plot holes are greater both in size and in volume than their american counterpartsthankfully can be approached without much fright of being logically decapitated and if you dont poke about too incessantly with a yardstick you will find the story relatively sturdy if straightforward and necessitating a leap of faith naturally after some bona fide idiocies churned out in high tension frontiers or inside i expected much of the same so despite heightened awareness pascal laugiers script escaped relatively intactis exactly what is aims to be  a gory hackfest with prolonged scenes of torture dismemberment disfuguration with the welcome additive of lack of horror guidelines no one is innocent and on one is safe and inexplicable terror nonetheless such nihilistic exploitation is streamlined for specific audiences to which i do not belong much more lovingly admiring the honest tension and subsequent atmosphere of horror than the inyourface audacity of gorno nonetheless im pretty sure fans of the genre will satisfy bloodlust whilst positively charmed by the natural feistiness of our two leadsno holds barred guts galore frantic movie aimed for a select crowd otherwise avoid for your stomachs sake,cruel
this is probably one of the most polarizing horror films since cannibal holocaust people either think it is brilliant or just garbage i am surprised that this film is scored so high especially since 9 out of 10 of the people that bother to put their opinion online have a negative opinion this should tell you that the film has a substantial amount of fans that believe it is brilliant of course this film is not for everyone the film is extremely brutal and very hard to watch at times what really differentiates it from hostel and other film with extreme violence or torture is simple eli roth made hostel because he wanted to make a takashi miike film this is a quote from tarantino the problem is the movie has none of the depth or meaning of anything miike has done like his masterpiece audition the violence in hostel is meant to be entertaining draw your own conclusions as to what that says about mr roth or anyone who really liked the movie the only way that hostel succeeded at all was that it had a simple message about violence for entertainment and by the end most people were screaming for it in the form of some good old fashioned revenge the violence in is not entertaining at all i have never seen a movie where someone being shot by a shotgun is so disturbing and that is because somehow the film captures that this guy is so instantaneously destroyed and dead also this is some of the least disturbing violence in the film there is something extremely disturbing about a film that involves torture where the torturer isnt even having any fun it is calculated and precise like solving an extremely complex mathematical equation but there are even a few people on earth that would take great delight in that the torturers work like its any other day job that gives them no particular joy thats disturbing if youve heard of or seen audition irreversible the woman or high tension a great shocker until its twist then you may like if you are looking for something that will entertain you with its violence go somewhere else this is about vicariously experiencing something awful and unpleasant that might make you ask some questions about life good and evil and that is something few people want to get too close to here are the spoilers there has been a lot said about the whole point of the film as being stupid and nonsensical many people have said that if these people are trying to find out about the afterlife then their means of doing so will send them to hell simply put youre wrong there is a point to what they are doing and it cannot be achieved by just waiting for death proof of an afterlife is proof that life is unending that our lives do matter it is proof that we are significant that our souls are in fact real and that there is a god so why dont they just go to church worship god pray and wait for the inevitable happy ending they cant there are many people that would like to believe in god but just cant they need proof so isnt torturing young girls to death going to insure a toasty spot in hell nope not if they come to truly believe and repent for their sins the bible is a funny thing one part that most christians forget is that all sins are equal in the eyes of god because any sin is the equivalent of saying that you know better than he does another part is that judgment is a sin and this is a sin that most christians commit several times a day judgement is mine sayeth the lord when you judge someone you are declaring yourself god and taking his power this is as offensive to him as deciding that you should end someones life before their time thank god for all you judgemental christians out there god forgives all sins in exchange for worshiping him as the highest authority and asking for forgiveness so no these people doing terrible terrible things could turn things around if they had enough time and found true belief no matter how they got there if you have a problem believing that dont argue on message boards go argue with a minister or priest if there are spelling errors in this review please forgive me i am typing one handed thanks to a boxers fracture in my right hand too much time in the basement with anna,cruel
anna and lucie embark on a revenge movie in respect of childhood abuses in the course of this a ghost story briefly pops up before the movie sinks into a pit of graphic torture and unremitting extreme sadism i normally synopsise but i really dont want to and you really dont want me to believe methis film is very well made and features excellent makeup effects and some brilliant performances but it is unremittingly nasty has minimal redemption for any of its nastiness and while it doesnt exactly revel in its sadism it clearly believes it is saying something important the fact that it is not clear what it is saying or that what it is saying is inconsequential means that the unpleasantness which precedes it has been of no value,cruel
lucy and ana who grew up together in an orphanage are on a path of vengeance when lucy was little she was kidnapped and tortured for unknown reasons and since then hasnt been the same person she suffers from severe psychological problems and because the police never caught the culprits she has never been able to have closure on the matter many years pass and lucy is convinced that she has found the people responsible and in a terrifying act of violence sets off a chain of events that neither lucy or ana will ever forgetas part of the french fab four is the most notorious as the hardest to watch i can totally agree with this statement while it isnt as good a film as inside i believe this one had much more impact because its tale of violence which is heartbreaking but at the same time serves a strong purpose many people have dismissed this as torture porn but i believe its missing the point this film is both very psychological and graphically discomforting just when you think you know which direction the movie is headed it turns a 180 degree turn and throws the viewer completely off guard it is about the levels of pain a human can take its about someones limits of how much they can sustain before breaking down its a tale of will power the desire to keep struggling through so many subtle layers that are constantly overlooked due to the high impact violence and sheer cruelty it is a work of genius but be very very careful this film didnt get its reputation for nothing,cruel
yet more evidence of just how depraved we as humans can be i have watched so many horror flicks yet this one leaves me cold its a powerful film if you wish to deal with it on an emotional level if you just want blood and gore go watch hostel or something those kind of flicks dont do anything for me but this one challenges everything on an emotional and psychological levelthe subject matter is one of those taboo subjects that most films wont touch child abuse thankfully there is no sexual child abuse here but in many ways worse imagery is present if you are put off by any kind of abuse then move along and dont watch this one its not for you i watched as i watched a sense of numbness seemed to spread across my body and mind the second half of the film was so powerful i very nearly didnt watch the end i hung in there and glad i did as the twist makes it worthy of the effortif you can stomach the subject matter dont mind some very powerful psychological images and you have a reasonably sound mind watch this it wont disappoint you unlike hostel and its elk its not just about violence and sexual degradation its a whole lot more than thatto sum it up its a very draining flick to watch but if you can be objective and stay somewhat emotionally detached you will probably understand what a good piece of film making this really is,cruel
i must say i am appalled at the fact that hollywood has bought the rights to this movie and will be remaking it for the masses the movies is as it should beand like so many othersshould be left alonethis movie is not hostel its not high tension its not even anything like a serbian film this is a slow story that buildsand buildsand thenat the final moment if you dont laugh out loud at the awesomeness of what you have watched you should not be watching movies like thesenow yes it is slow in building and a bit silly here and there which is why a 7 not an 8 however if you are looking for something to sit at home with and see as the characters go on through these moments through these trials through these exquisite scenes of pure grimacing torture that make you think why am i watching this as hell is brought forth and unleashed on innocents on the road to get you to that final reveal that leaves your jaw dropped and your thoughts racing as you laugh at how after all this the final moments of the movie come to an end and your left thinkingnow this is why i watch movies like thesethen this is what you will enjoylook this is not for everybody this is not for most people this is not hollywood nor pretentious art house films that make you delve into your soul to find theblah blah blah this is a film about searching for somethingand when you find itwas it really worth it i hope you enjoy and if you dont im sorryyou shouldnt have watched this best of luckps before you get upset i do love a lot of the films out there from hollywood and the art house circuit all im saying is there is depth and there is a bit of gore nothing like ive seen in low budget or slasher films but yes some things could be looked as a bit over the top you should take it for what it is a film trying to tell a story of what happens to those in life and why it happens sometimes i loved it i think others will too,cruel
this movie is spectacular the way the subject matter is presented is outsanding it does not give comic relief from the very beginning its opener is grisly and it builds from there the brilliant use of that which is unsaid is powerful there is no shying away from death as so many horrors do this movie shows the full hardcore nature of murder and almost truamatizes viewers this movie is basically everything a film should be it lingers in your mind for weeks after the film is over and makes you contemplate many things it brings up this is not for the faint of heart this is not for the lovers of slashercomedy this is a brutal story of revenge and the search for answers it will go into the film history books as the film that retold a tired genre and it is one of the few films that really makes you feel give it a shot if you can it will win you over,cruel
is one of the most difficult recent horror movies to watch seriously this one makes look the socalled torture porn movies such as saw hostel murderset pieces etc as a walk in the park this is the real thing the torture shows no mercy this time and the lead female character is submitted to brutal beatings psychological violence gets her skin ripped plus shes humiliated and in consequence she loses her mindthese kind of events are supported by an evil plot which demonstrates that society is corrupted and filled with dirty elements such as a double moral corrupt politicians ignorant religious freaks and more the direction is top level and the plot is really honest and brutal the first 48 minutes could be considered as an orgy between haute tension and black swanthe gore is also beautiful nasty gunshots beatings and more i dont want to spoil the good stuffthis one should be considered as a ground breaking film as it defies the standards of violence in cinema sure it cant be considered as an art film nor a 100 horror effort but it flirts with the thin line between both of them not sure where to label this one in some years but im sure it ranks high amongst the most brutal and nihilistic movies made in recent historymorjana alaoui delivers one of the bravest performances in horror cinema history she suffers shes tortured she finds peace her acting is magnificent she shouldnt be an underrated actress plus shes extremely beautiful,cruel
in the period of american rehashes of foreign cinema and what is now referred to as tortureporn ala hostel and the like youd be forgiven for missing some of the genuine efforts out there films that make a real attempt to truly leave a lasting impression and cause reaction second film by pascal laugier runs alongside irreversible as part of this new wave horror that seems to be spearheaded by france i can honestly say this one is hard to review in any way other than the abstract as it is one whose impact on the audience relies pretty heavily on the fact they are going in cold knowing little to nothing about what to expect as a basic synopsis  a young girl escapes what is clearly some awful ordeal and goes into a nondescript young girls home we move quickly to fifteen years later where we find her visiting vengeance upon the people she believes responsible for what she was put through vague tedious and predictable perhapsbut to say any more would be starting to destroy the experience of this film predictable this film is not just as you think you have categorised it will defy your expectations and shift conventions it is a genre piece but one of the most erratic you are likely to put yourself through this film wrings you pretty dry its unconventional style making sure youre never settled into too comfortable a groove its extremity of violence being some of the most fierce you could witnesswhat i found most noteworthy about this film though was the clear intention of laugier he knows exactly what he wants to do where he wants to take you and what he wants to say and it shows with each passing scene believe me if you find the likes of hostel and saw to be works of extreme revulsion do not watch this the irony is you might not notice unlike the aforementioned american works is about something the extremity resonates on what becomes a genuinely emotional level as the film moves forward the intense violence neither being lingered on nor skipped over simply being used as a device and part of the films architecture and to achieve something greater than the likes of this tortureporn we have come to know would dare try this isnt a film you watch with your buddies over pizza this film hurtsthis is aided hugely by the performances of the leads they are superb it is easy to overlook how tough it could be for an actor to get to an emotional place and hold it there for an extended period of time and its only on reflection you realise how real these women made this experience its impressive if horribleis it a perfect film no i think it has its small flaws its revelation and the titles relevance will bring about just as many moans of dissatisfaction as gasps of realised brilliance but i applaud it for going to the extreme and being courageous in its motive it will cause conversation each person will walk away from it feeling differently but never unaffected and thats why i recommend this filma film that doesnt just aim to churn your stomach but is ultimately more concerned with churning your mind and emotionsand one that is actually about somethingeven if you dont end up appreciating its point,cruel
spoilers about the moviestructure ahead minor spoiler about the premise of the film let me first say that i do not consider this movie to fall under the tortureporn category because the the total abuse of power that is shown to the viewers is not intended to just shock the audience or even give satisfaction to the deranged that get a kick out of see someone sufferno the movie goes deeper than that it draws a fictitious painting of how far humanity can go as history has shown over and over again in its quest to find answers replace the suffering characters in this movie with animals for example then this kind of torture exists everyday around us in that perspective or you can draw parallels to how we experimented with human lives during the first half of the 1900s and yet again you come to the conclusion that what you see is not that far from reality as we want to think and that is only the tip of an iceberg since we have always loved to come up with creative ways of torturing eachothers in the past when words like ethic and human value only existed as a philosophical definition that had little to no impact on our behavior on to the movie the structure in the storytelling is fascinating since it can be cut into atleast two halves the first half leans towards the japanese kind of horror ala the grudge and is on its own not interesting at all and fooled me at least to believe that ive come across yet another subpar horrorflick but it is in the second half that the film shows its true form and is what some has reacted too and misjudged in my opinion as an example of poor taste to me this film exists as one of few perfect examples of how to make a horror movie with a clear focus on the horror it reaches our subconscious and stays with you after the credits roll and stimulates our imagination and that is why i rate this movie as one of my favorites regardless of genre,cruel
well i came across this when i was looking for any messed up horror films i cant say a fulfilled this urge fully but wow am i glad i found this this is cinematic history if you are looking for something with lots of murders or killings this is not it this has lots of violence but only about 10 deaths about 4 being in the beginningat the beginning of this you think wtf this crazy girl has been here 5 minutes and already shot this house up but as the story unfolds you see all the pain and torture that anna and lucie were put through this is weird in parts but always explains the reason it shows the traumatic pain something like this can put on a fragile young girl and the family it is also quite crazy that they would believe its ok to do this thing for anything never mind religious research to be honest why would anyone care so much about the afterlife i find it odd that thy would pry out metal from somebodys head without anything as much as a first aid kit or a doctor or even a sane personone thing that i do not understand is when the dying mother is found to be alive why help her i know its sounds brutal horrible heartless whatever but i dont think forgiving for something like that is that easy honestly i would lock the bathroom door or tell my friend to finish her she might as well been dead already this is already one of my horror favourites i would recommend to fans of rec 12 the tortured and possibly hostel and saw sagas i recommend watching the uncut version and not the television cut,cruel
while not afraid of subtitles i rarely dip into french cinema for the simple reason that people speaking french tends to lull me off to sleep no such worries here i think i even started to forget to blink as this hideously compelling film unfoldeda young girl named lucie jampanoi escapes from unspeakable imprisonment and torture traumatised beyond measure shes brought up in an orphanage where she is taken under the wing of anna alaoui who cares for her with simple and heartwrenching humanity fifteen years later a helpless anna cannot control the tragic and brutal events as lucie takes her revenge on the couple who may or may not have been her tormentors so long agoa few years back i really enjoyed hostel it was a lurid ride of bibleblack comedy horror it did however let loose a torrent of lookeylikeys that have become both tedious and sinister director laugier considers this an antihostel and by the films end you can see what he meansif you survive the squirmy gore and horror of the seemingly conventional but technically excellent first act you find the film drags you deeper and deeper into the grotesque but ultimately for a purpose whether that purpose justifies the movie or not depends on your resistance to high concept pretension or the level of empathy you share with anna a character who surely belongs in any list of cinemas most tragic heroines,cruel
is a thriller that uses violence gore and mystery to build tension and peak your interest for its final message it had me guessing where the plot was heading as well as the characters motivation once the main characters return to the scene of the crime they tend to needlessly linger which causes the bulk of the movie that follows ultraviolence fans will love this movie however it is not an action movie a longish sequence of brutal depravity ensues just when i thought to myself this movie better not leave me hanging without answers or a dumb ending it sucker punched me in the gut wow the ending was very revealing and makes this movie what it is is not for everyone due to the violence gore and religious views it suggests i imagine conservatives will not like the movie and rate it lower than what it deserves this movie can affect you emotionally spiritually and physically a must see for thriller fans,cruel
a young girl is abused force fed slop and chained up she escapes but is haunted by a ghastly looking demon girl who continue to inflict harm on her she is sent to an orphanage where she makes friends with another girl 15 years later she seeks revenge on the people that did this to her what she and her friend end up going through is more haunting than they imaginedi dont really know where to start with this review let me say that i consider myself desensitized to violence and horrors i can sit through the hollywood films of saw and hostel and laugh at the screen in the violent terror i can sit through the shock and horror of cannibal holocaust and i spit on your grave i was not expecting anything from this film and yet it hit me the hardest no other film has really made me feel as emotionally drained as this the images the sounds and the emotions in this film are very disturbing and hard to watch is not something i would recommend people watching simply because of its subject matter i wont go into details but the second half of the film is some of the most heart wrenching images to watch from a fictional film standpoint the film almost has a grindhouse feel to it as if you are watching two different films the first half is a revenge tale with a bit of psychological horror thrown in then the second half hits you and you dont know what to dothe film has no hope for its characters i usually hate films like this because it makes the point of watching it almost mute why should i care about these characters when i know the journey they are going on will end in a horrible mess for some odd reason though this film felt a little different i suppose this is why i dont throw it into the same torture porn horror field as the hostels and saw films in this world the film is in french and it plays out with a sense of professionalism it knows the point it wants to get across and it does so i can completely understand that people can feel the total opposite though this film walks a very fine linei felt dirty after the film i felt horrible and helpless i wanted the characters to do so many things to get them out of their situations but it never happened and i knew it never would the explanation at the end of it all is a bit out there in terms of believability but the ending is left to the viewers imagination my take on it is that the human mind cannot fathom the truth of what they seek which is why it ends the way it does is a very tough film to sit through and i commend anyone who does so,cruel
there is no denying that this is a difficult film to watch if you fancy a night in with the lads and a six pack this is most certainly not the film to watch a very powerful and uncompromising film in two parts and an epilogue at first the tale is a bloody and violent romp which remains uncomfortable because of the evident appalling abuse in the background although while this appears simply a revenge movie it is watchable in the second phase we enter a world we are really not happy about viewing at all the violence becomes brutal seemingly without purpose and sickeningly repetitive and unrelenting just watching the lower half of a tormentor retreating with such a swagger after inflicting such violence is truly awful to behold it is however worth staying with this one for the final section and the subtle but devastating attack upon all religions to some extent but the catholic church in particular for those not bound to any strict religious belief the ending is uplifting and to others well maybe some food for thought quite devastating,cruel
preface since i began reviewing films ive undergone a significant transition from casual movie goer to film critic several of my earlier reviews are written with an inexperience unbefitting of the films i discussed i was hostile in my condemnation of certain films particularly captivity because i found them distasteful i will not be so absolute with current reviews i may still find something inappropriate within a film but i will try to critique it for less obvious reasons assuming such is possibleassuming you read the preface to this review if not go back and read it then let me abstain from any virulent condemnation of the brutal film im about to discuss i was first exposed to in the march 2009 issue of rue morgue it is part of the french new wave of horror that developed this decade perhaps it is the most challenging to finish of any of the films ive seen this yearthe movie is incredibly violent and uncompromisingly sorrowful this isnt even like inside folks director pascal laugier makes no attempt to amuse us he had a story for this film and decided that the horror genre would be best to display it imagine your first viewing of cannibal holocaust mine resulted in an emotional vacancy that lasted several days before dissipating into appreciation may inspire a similar reaction in some viewers but like its predecessor will cause revulsion in most for that reason i warn you not to read the following plot summary it will spoil the films thesis and nullify the directors intent basic plot events will be revealed though specific details are withheldthe film is split into three unequal parts the first plays like any north american slasher film a family is eating breakfast discussing pointless things a crazy young woman bursts in and shoots everyone at point blank range including the adolescent son and tween daughter the woman lucie calls her friend anna to help her dispose of the bodies anna comes and asks lucie about the thing that has been chasing her this creature is like gollums maniacal relative and inflicts all kinds of pain on lucieafter many skillful scenes of terror that would please any japanese horror director the thing kills lucie though anna is unhurt left alone she explores the house and discovers an underground chamber where people appear to have been imprisoned and beaten one victim is still alive and anna releases her before they can escape some people arrive and kill the victimthe leader of these people called only mademoiselle decides anna would be a suitable candidate for her experiment this process involves the enslavement and physical and psychological torture of young women in an effort to see beyond death kind of like samsara after a level of incredible suffering young women she mentions that this subgroup has been the only one found to reach this state will lose the ability to fear death in many years of experimentation only a few candidates have actually reached martyrdom many like lucie see visions of what isnt there and never reach it annas skin is entirely removed and presumably she becomes a martyr and she whispers to mademoiselle what she sees we never find out thoughive read epithets from holocaust survivors about nazi scientific experiments involving live victims i cant imagine how someone whom i feel has knowledge of this tragedy could recreate it on film director pascal laugier tells us in the dvd special features that he feels uneasy for directing he isnt sure if it is a good film or not he also encourages people to hate him for this projectat the end of this summary i am left with one question to answer is a good film or not should you see it well ill defer to you on this topic im sorry there is no way i can answer this without compromising myself yes his story has meaning but left me empty after surviving this film i wanted to know what anna saw even if it was a sentence a passage or even a single word something would have at least allowed me some happiness in having watched it maybe laugier intentionally left this out to maintain his universally somber tone but i didnt like it it feels like a copout to medo you want more details on why the film is so controversial ill describe some from the third part of the movie when anna is captured we endure 30 minutes of silent beatings humiliation and eventual torture is it misogynistic yes unlike even the virginal emphasis in slasher pics or the wretched on screen violence most tortureporn flicks its also not misogynistic laugier uses the violence to tell his story and not titillate a male audience the silent beatings leave a feeling of sadness it couldnt be further from tortureporn still seeing a bouncerlike bald burly man abusing a young woman never sexually presents such a stereotypical image that i cant recommend to anyone save those who really want to see it,cruel
first off im a horror fan and i enjoy a good horror film when it comes my way but to tell you the truth when i saw for the first time i wasnt sure what to think the film had all the makings of a good horror film gore violence and the kind of cinematography that ive only seen in french horror films so far but the first question that rolled through my head after seeing this thing was what kind of drugs was the writer doing when he came up with this film he either needs to stop or share his stash with other aspiring horror filmmakers and writersthis was a good horror film nonetheless it is one of the few films where every twist to the story is unbelievable and shocking at the same time although unlike previous french films like high tension frontiers and inside this film stays more true to the dramatic aspect and the character story making it appear almost less violent than the other films i mentionedeven though i am a horror fan im not even sure if i can recommend this film to other horror fans sure theres a healthy supply of gore violence and torture but the overall film is so strange and yet disturbing im not sure how horror fans that are used to films like saw  hostel and of course the other french films i mentioned will react to this because this film is neither and youd be wasting time running comparisons because like i said this film is neither the best way for someone to know if they will like this film is for everyone to go see it for themselves,cruel
i will not write much about this movie because itswas definitely not worth yourmy timescenes of pure violence with absolute nonsenseit gets 210 only because some artefacts allow us to feel disturbed and disgusteddo not waste your time you can definitely find something worthier than this piece of garbage,cruel
i like to think ive pretty much seen most types of horror film throughout the course of my life so ill never forget the first time i sat down to watch french horror film for the first time it starts with a young girl escaping a horrific ordeal at the hands of some unseen captors before shes placed in care of the state there she befriends another girl and the two become close however if the first girls torture wasnt bad enough shes haunted by some sort of supernatural presence equally hellbent on harming herso thats how it begins and my initial reaction was oh sort of like the grudge the being tormenting the girl kind of looks like every creepy dishevelled little longhaired kid from most recent japanese horror films think the grudge the ring or dark water so i was pretty underwhelmed when it came to originality how wrong i wasi feel that i should now state as to how and why i was proved so wrong with my early expectations however that would pretty much take us into spoiler territory all i can really say is that all is not what it seems this film has many moments where you think you know where its going only to have everything you thought you knew pulled away from you and replaced with something even more horrific the two main girls both give excellent performances but the character that steals the show comes into the story a little later i wont go into too much detail about her but shes known as only the mademoiselle and she isnt easily forgotteni suppose if you had to label this film within the horror genre you could loosely call it torture prn however thats probably oversimplifying it a bit as that kind of branding conjures up images of the hostel franchise is a lot worse than that simply because the whole premise is slowly revealed over the course of the film although due to its graphic content a strong stomach is advised to possess before you contemplate sitting through this plus  as youve probably guessed  it is pretty dark but not just dark  bleak is the word id use so dont expect anything even vaguely uplifting here i guess the target audience are people who can stomach a film like this i suppose i must be one of them as this is the third time ive sat through this i just find it difficult to believe that after nearly four decades of watching horror films theres still one that really does disturb me obviously youll have to put up with french subtitles all the way through but if you do and you have a really strong stomach for nastiness then this film really will leave a lasting impression on you it still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it,cruel
a while back while sitting at work i started thinking about this movie although that may not seem very unusual considering people tend to daydream about all sorts of things and i happened to work graveyards overseeing psychologically unstable criminals and sex offenders the returning thought of this film hit me in a particularly personal way from the jarring opening sequence to the conclusions various implications i became lost in my personal interpretation of a film i hadnt viewed in years its both renowned and detested for being disturbing graphic and abstractly artistic all lubricants to the average indiebuffs horror wet dreams but it was spiritual and cathartic nature that truly remained with me and i couldnt untangle myself from the thought for the rest of the nightit was in the way that anna morjana alaoui held the hands of the dead and dying that originally cued me into this movies sentimental core for every act of stomachchurning horror we are likewise treated to a moment of absolute tenderness lucie mylne jampano is tormented by the ghost of a woman she was unable to rescue given deep and serious wounds by its pale gnarled hands shortly before inflicting some of the worst injuries yet this ghoulish creature embraces lucie tucking its head into her bosom gently touching her bloodied face because of instances like this the pictures perpetual storm of gore avoids clich and becomes legitimately powerful  there is an impact to the suffering we witness in and it has little to do with the amount of gristle on screen when were first introduced to anna and lucie they are children in an institution united through their loneliness and fear the initially slow and methodical pace promises a gradually unfurling mystery a potential whodunit revolving around the kidnapping of lucie the opening scene shows her halfnaked fleeing barefoot down an alleyway screaming loudly and covered in lacerations however this is but one of many stylistic stages in a varied rotation of horror subgenres the first being the briefest of them all without warning the plot quickly leaps years ahead and acts of shocking violence take the film by storm these young women engulfed in a world of revenge murder and horrendous torture they feel pain both physical and emotional and it is portrayed with empathy and realism the camera remains close for a majority of these shots the characters suffering represented through facial expressions far more than jumpcuts of the obvious carnage at hand this breed of intimacy sparks an outcome that many horror movies have been lacking for upwards of two decades the audiences feeling of true and biting dread when they witness a protagonist in peril we have been given opportunities to love and understand these people thus we are upset by their miseryall the same instead of opting for more obvious tropes to relate characters and viewers a dead parentunrequited lovementally retarded sibling writer and director pascal laugier allows us to connect during the littler moments as lucie lies on her back she inspects the thickening blood on her hands astonishment and bittersweet relief swim hazily over her face and she is both troubled and relaxed at once caught in a moment of selfreflection these ten seconds may not directly narrate her motivations or backstory but they show us the impacts of both additionally hinting at the weight of their presence as they drift ever closer she doesnt just kill she ponders the killing  she doesnt casually walk away from the body of her victim she weeps and rocks herself over its pale form leaning in to kiss it on the cheek why did you do that to me she asks the corpse sure the picture has slick production a fitting soundtrack and killer cinematography to boot but its also brutally soulful and selfaware immediately setting it leagues above the competition in a genre known for possessing the highest highs and lowest lows its transitions have meaning splitting the film into three incredibly diverse acts with their own tones and implications as it stands the final product is far more than the sum of its parts and yet the parts alone are still fantastic this is no simple slasher gross out pic or torture pornography this is an auteurs visionin an especially memorable scene one character bathes another attempting to wash their gored skin and remove a harmful device from their body thats about as specific as i want to make it from the moment their flesh touches the bathwater a plethora of emotions are put on display from overwhelming remorse to a form of desperate frustration the latter burning in a young womans eyes as she struggles with her companion its something frantic and human that really shines through an industry defined by faceless men who needlessly murder teenagers  its an energy that musters the need to bust out critically overused hyperboles in a way that isnt solely meant for humor or exaggeration though there are some extreme moments namely plot elements which will surely divide viewers by the end all are there with purpose and acted with intensity and passion controversy may be an overused term in hollywood but that doesnt make it an overrated concept after all cinema is art and art is propaganda if your motion picture cannot stir people in some regard then youve created an ineffective piece of said propaganda and stands as some of horrors most intriguing propaganda yet communicating an array of ideas that most will feel uncertain of by the time its curtains fall exactly what laugier wishes to tell us is left to interpretation a smart move in my opinion but some key messages are crafted so sharply and so keenly you may find yourself turning them over in your thoughts years later sitting alone in a long shift at work,cruel
should you go see martrys i would say it depends if you are an average movie goer and not a horror fan this is not for you if you are an average movie goer and if you curious about getting into the horror genre this is probably not the first movie you want to start withhowever if you are a horror fan you must watch this i can guarantee you this film will come in conversation with other horror movie buffs i didnt feel the movie was really scary but it does raise the bar on how graphic it does get this movie is nothing i have ever seen before great and disturbing,cruel
all i can say is  wow this film lives up to the hype it is a superbly acted beautifully realized gruesomely violent brutally beautiful saga divided into three windows if you will  each of which is so vividly realized you feel you are right in there with the action everyone will be talking about what a sadistic graphic brutal violent dehumanizing misogynist creepy fed up experience this isand theyre rightsort of not on the misogynist part its an exploration of misogyny but so much more than that pascal is a genius this film is very french too nothing like the downanddirty american hostel or australian film wolf creek both of which for their respective sub genres of horror were very effective too i felt for each and every character and just like life  each character is multifaceted and not one dimensional there are villains in this story victims bystanders creatures monsters misogynists kidnappers and traumatized children  sometimes all rolled up into one extraordinarily interesting character the cast really do their homework  even the guys who quickly exit the story in a surreal ultraviolent first sequence of action would i recommend this to anyone yes if you have the stomach for it if you are really willing to take a trip to see a thoughtful view on the horrors of human depravity  which as ugly as it is is so brutally beautiful in its realization because it does not flinch for an instant  that you will be mesmerized as much as disturbed,cruel
i collect movies from all genres basically anything highly rated or anything that seems interesting but this was my first true horror film yes i have all the hostel movies extis like nothing i have ever witnessed quite honestly i picked this film up without knowing the true nature of what i was getting myself into and after watching it i was so disturbed that i wished i never saw it now that i have had some time to digest the movie i decided to make a review about it what makes this movie so unsettling is how it seems to give you no hope you begin to just wish it would hurry up and end because you realize that this is not the type of movie where the star walks away at the end of the movie this is a must watch for anyone who enjoys a good movie but i must warn you that if you have underlying mental or depression issues or your movie watching buddy does please stay clear of this movie it really messes with the mind,cruel
this was one of the most horrific movies ive ever seen i like the horror scene but theres also a lot of crap movies in this genre when i started to watch this movie i didnt know what to expect just surfing on the web to find a good horror movie and then i saw thisin the first part i thought this is just a sick slasher kind of movie but in moments i knew that wasnt what this movie was i dont know what to call it some kind of psychological torture horror movie or something like that the second part of the movie is mostly about torture and thats when it becomes psychological that last part is one of the reasons that its one of the best movies ive ever seeni like this movie because it has such a great background story and of course because it also has a lot of gore they dont say all that much but images say more than words the movie is constantly messing with your head even when its over even now months after i saw the movie i still sometimes think about it and then i realized its more than a movie because something like this is even possible in real life there are definitely some religious people who are nuts enough to make this movie become reality its sad to say but truebut for all people this movies a must watch its an excellent movie and especially the way in which they filmed it is perfect,cruel
is probably not what i expected as a horror film i think the first hour was good but what about the second hour we only see someone being tortured up to her death its about an organization who want to know what do you see before die i really dont understand why so many peoples liked this film for bloody movies fans you doesnt will be sad there are much i liked the first hour because of its concept of vengeance but the scene where lucie is attacked by a kind of monster is a bit stupid i think the director wanted to make us think about the human violence but i didnt understand the film like that for me it was just a bloody movie without story,cruel
this movie is absolutely disturbingshocking and emotionalit also has a lot of suspense and shock factor in iti finished watching it at 430 am today and i couldnt get to sleepi have seen almost every torture porn movie out there and this one is the few that truly shocked mei was looking for something to shock me and this one achieved thati wont forget about it anytime soonit makes all the 7 saw movies and 2 hostel movies like a kids movieyou must see this movie if you like torture porni dont think i will be able to watch this movie again cos it is just so shockingone of the most horrific movies ever madea masterpiecethe ending is truly shocking  my mouth was wide open at the end 810 is my rating,cruel
so i was watching saw series hostel hannibal  texas chainsaw the other day and i was pretty proud of myself that i have the balls to watch such movies and enjoy them fcuk i almost siht in my pants watching this movie  that was fukcnig awesome first off loved mylenes character a lot i cant seem to recall a profound story in all the violent movies ive seen but this was a masterpiece the story was very realistic and can be related to anybody thats probably why it was so sicki didnt knew was violent i saw a cover online somewhere and liked mylenes look and planned to watch it hell it was fresh and a lot lot more than i expected i was hooked on the first scene of violence it goes boom without a warning i was skeptic about that ghost woman lucie was seeing but it finally made sense the story kept me on the edge of my seat from then on and never stopped i had difficulty breathing for about 10 minutes after the last test i was stupid thinking oh what hes going to spin her now how is spinning her going to make it worse than beating her up and waking up to beat her up again hell i never expected what was comingits a 10 for me im becoming a mylene fan after this movie  i thought nothings gonna be sicker than hostel man im watching french violence from now on the story as a whole and every scene made me sick and that was aweeesome,cruel
im as big a horror movie fan as anybody and i didnt care for this one at all  there seems to be a new trend in french horror filmmaking of great talent in cameraworkperformanceseruptions of gore joined with completely idiotic storytelling after a promising start with the two lead characters as young girls the film moves to a family scene in the vein of michael hanekes loathsome funny games as the filmmakers introduce us to a set of ordinary likable characters then blow them away in an orgy of sadistic violence this kind of strategy has been effective in other films but here it just feels like a trendy way to provide a gratuitous shock for a while the movie toys with some pointless plot tangents one of the lead girls wrestles with a demon from her subconscious a mindless torture victim is paraded in front of us for no particular reason but grimy spectacle until finally the movie gets around to its pretentious final act the films lead character is brutally tortured until she reaches a level of maybe spiritual ecstasy reminiscent of dreyers passion of joan of arc but without any you know actual feeling or spirituality to it  the whole final act is merely justification for all the otherwise pointless brutality strained and pretentious if you got some actual uplift from the film then good for you i didnt,cruel
is a french horror movie that follows a womans quest for revenge against people who kidnapped and tortured her as a child but isnt necessarily a revenge movie only a small part of it in fact anna and lucie the two main characters of the movie play off each other extremely effectively the chemistry between the two actresses cant really be disputed the enjoyment factor of the movie however is questionablealthough i tend to like my movies violent and bloody i do like a good story to sink my teeth into alongside all the gore certainly delivers on this but in my opinion it delivers far too much although the plot is an interesting and quite original one it isnt carried out quite as well as it could be at times it even gets boring and plods on at a slow pace as a guidance i would probably say the first and last 15 minutes of the movie are by far the best with the spaces in between filled with random body dumping or downright strange and confusing scenesapproach with caution it has a good message but it takes a while to get therehttpukmoretk,cruel
at first glance pascal laugiers movie seems to be a revenge story dealing with a woman attempting at killing the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child in order to get rid of an imaginary demon that is chasing her till that time however the movie alters as quickly as it is starting to focus on her female friend who experiences all the atrocities her best friend commits in the name of peace and quiet the second half of the movie is twisted in the sickest way possible when no i wont reveal the main turn is one of the sickest and most disturbing movies i have seen but its numbing violence is not used only to shock but also to provide a fascinating insight into the peoples voyeuristic nature moreover it tries to explain the tragic events taking place in the film in a painfully rational manner given this is a slickly executed effective movie with amazingly intense gory first half containing some amazing scenes and slow devastating second one it is certainly not for the squeamish but i guarantee that those who dare to try it out will not regret this is a cleverly provocative horror movie that only strengthens the position of france in this field,cruel
lets start with a checklist of horrorshocking film elements and rate them on a scale of 15 1 being disneys up and 5 being high tension or ishi the killer and everything in between lets begin1 violence martytrs definitely serves up heaps of violence my favored scenebesides the shocker noted in 4 would be the random actsslicing inflicted upon lucie mylene jampanoi by her haunting female creature or the shotgunning down of an entire family a few had it coming it was no halloween ii but it was quite violent brucevain rating on violence 5 ishi all the way2 gore even films that have a decent budget can have over the top gore or scenes that just dont look real or even worse cgi gore displays a minimal measure of gore but when they do they really take it to the next level and make it work there is a scene where a women that has been held captive for who knows how long has a metal blindfold on fence staples are used to keep it in place and when they remove them they can bleed a lot it appears that the skin has grown around the blindfold and when it is finally removed the slime like puss from infection really screams quality gore another example of the effects is a scene where lucie is fighting with her haunting female creature and the creature uses a straight razor and cuts into lucies arm lengthwise from behind the elbow to the wrist reminded me of fatal attraction i watch a lot of horror and this scene actually gave me chills brucevain rating on gore 5 high tension style3 abuse apparently the mo of the film trying to induce enough of it to promote transcendence in order to see the afterlife in fact the victims are not victims at all they are put through this process to make them into greek for witness hoping that they can see what lies after death brucevain rating on abuse5 ishi all the way4 flaying a human alive to reach that final stage of transcendence this type of systematic abuse must be inflicted and it is portrayed right before your eyes this scene in particular is a testament to the acting and direction the pain in annasmorjana alaoui eyes is characterized exponentially for the viewer to experience brucevain rating on flaying a human alive5 shoot thats gotta hurtthere were a few elements that i was not a fan of for instance the film grain effect used in the opening and closing scenes i was hoping that this would not continue for the remainder of the filmit didnt if i failed to mention this film is in french and is subtitled for the first 5 min the subtitles are on the top of the screen rather than the normal bottom i was peeved by thisthe director pascal laugier deserves credit for the performances how did he get those girls to cry nonstop i felt the pacing was a little slow and a bit out of place it seemed like a long 137 min because of it overall the film is a must see for an admirer of the genre and if you want shocking depiction of violence and abuse is for youif a horrorshock film were a tachometer in a race car would be a blown enginebruce vain,cruel
this is a movie that you may not have heard about if it werent for all the buzz that its gotten on horror forums during the past year its like a specialised slice of cinema giallo torture horror that is being touted as art because of its unflinching attempts to shock you but this felt a little empty to me its one of those cool movies that you mention to show how edgy you are but soon realise in a few years when youre 19 that it doesnt have much substance i think this movie could have been more effective if it had been reduced to an hour in length the storyline is great the movie starts with a young girl lucie who escapes a torture chamber and later finds refuge in an orphanage there she befriends another girl anna who cares for her and helps her deal with the psychological trauma shes endured we also learn that lucie is regularly attacked by some sort of creature the story quickly shifts forward 15 years and we are shown a family having breakfast i wont go into what follows because the first half of this movie will get your blood pumping however by the halfway mark i was quite honestly a little bored you are inundated with imagery that is intended to shock and it actually desensitizes you to a degree or maybe ive seen too many horror films then theres a twist the plot takes a turn and you dont quite know where its taking you but it keeps you on the edge of your seat unfortunately youre forced to watch another 45 minutes of similarly shocking scenes just to get to the end whether or not its worth it is a matter of personal taste i wanted to like this film its bold the storyline is good and the plot twist works really well ive also seen exploitation films more violent than this so its not that i couldnt stomach the gore i just felt that the relentless graphic scenes particularly towards the end did little to further the story this is a film that in a way works backwards we see the effects of torture and then are made to symbolically endure it for another 45 minutes the ending is good because it ties everything together and is ambiguous enough to get you thinking but i cant help but think that we could have gotten there earlier and with a little less pain,cruel
im sorry for those who liked but i hated this moviefor me it was just nonsense tortureweak plotthe beginning was interesting but then its basically watch a woman being tortured the entire movie and the end was so awful i was expecting some good twist in the end to make worth all the torture we had to watch but it didnt comethe movie is just complety disturbing without a really good plot,cruel
i have nothing more to add to this  film cruelty with an interesting plot makes the film interesting but cruelty with a strange or stupid plot  giglet,cruel
having seen pascal laugiers the tall man which i absolutely loved i had heard a lot of praise for his first film and finally saw it today 2017 on dvd i cant believe all the reviewers who praise this film lavishly it is over 90 minutes of torture porn and while there is a revenge motive there is little if any satisfaction to be gained by the victims or the viewers and it is imo the viewers who are the ultimate victims despite the clever twist at the end one reviewer said that those who like hostel will probably like this film too and viceversa well sorry for i really liked hostel but this exercise in nonstop cruelty and torture was so over the top as to make it hard to care and nobody could survive the tortures shown for ten minutes let alone years huge disappointment,cruel
i can express my feeling for this movie in one word pathetic with this movie cinema has fallen to its lowest level after watching this movie you might even smash your tv too pathetic i would have given minus score but voting window doesnt allow it  start of the movie was promising i watched it with intent a girl escaped from confinement of kidnapper where she was tortured badly she recovered from the trauma gradually with the help of her friend things were looking interesting then story moved 15 years ahead and with that began bloodshed apparently girl was taking revenge for the abuse she endured in childhood movie started to dive in hell from here onward and went to the lowest level possible i would not recommend this movie to my friends my enemy can enjoy it to experience hell,cruel
not because its a bad movie this was actually rematchi had to rewatch i had not seen since it first came out i remember its being a really crazy movie i really liked the opening scenes of the movie if i had no seen it before or read anything about this moviethe opening makes look a bit a scary ghost story at first but dose not long when the movies fast forwards a number of years and goes right int to busy without wasting anytime this is kinda of nasty and horrible to watch which some will find very hard to watch7 out of 10,cruel
i watched the movie with quite a lot of expectations but honestly i was led down 2 children grew up in that house for their entire lives how could they have not ever found about the socalled secret chamber and what kind of a research allows people to bash and torture girls and kids for so many days i hated that stupid research part of finding or creating but definitely this movie will go on in your head even the day after and it doesnt really matter whether you loved it or not its going to disturb you i give it a 510 because it was clever at some points but the research thing i really couldnt take it,cruel
almost banned in its native france dividing audiences at cannes and pushing the envelope in its stark depiction of violence this latest entry into the newera french horror cannon think haute tension and alinterieur arrives with quite the followingits hard to give plot details without spoiling the overall effect so well just suggest you rent it instead contains so many wtf moments you may well find yourself pausing the dvd several times not to work out whats going on everything is tied together in the jawdropping final act but to take a breather its that intensewatching for the first time is a unique disorienting experience genre conventions are toppled almost immediately when the expected revengehorror that the movie sets itself up with gives way to grudgelike supernatural episodes and finally an extended sequence of endurance that will test the mettle of even the most hardcore horror fan and the gruesome finale  along with its accompanying message  will stay with you long after the credits rolla mustsee for fans of smart horror is a raw intelligent and brutal masterpiece that towers over shoddy american counterparts such as hostel and the saw series the quality of filmmaking on display here is sublime from the flawless acting of the two female leads to the gorgeous cinematography and the stellar use of sound perhaps whats even scarier than this movie is the fact that up next for director pascal laurier is a remake of 80s horror classic hellraiser be afraid be very afraid,cruel
i dont want to waste your timein brief the director should be kept in an asylum under strict surveillance until he be cured of course if there is any cure for sadismalthough i have to confess it proposed cues for some scenarios may i make them in future,cruel

talk about shooting yourself in the foot is a film with a massive identity crisis for every interesting idea it has and believe me it has many it cancels it out with a lame horror movie clich or tortureporn segment why on earth did the director take such clearly interesting material and try to shoehorn it into the horrorgore genre did he not believe in the material enough clearly he didnt because the film feels like two directors of completely different styles worked on this instead of one with one coherent vision quick run down spoilers two girls break into a house and we arent given any clue as to why we soon find out that one of the girls has escaped from an organization that women in order to prove the existence of heaven soon after the other one endures this same procedure and well sees heaven we think its never properly reveal but its heavily implied the ending which i wont ruin is interesting if a bit abrupt and obtuseanyway more on this identity crisis the film is split between two modes a pretty dire horror movie type thing and an excellent art house film with a lot to say about human suffering heaven and faith the fact that the latter is so good is beyond disheartening they feel cheapened by the directors over reliance on cheap gore and shockviolence and effects as a film its in need of a good editor and maybe some extra scenes to pad out the time lost by cutting out the horror sections but thats about it the final few scenes are actually extremely affecting and are an achievement simply in how profound they feel theyre terribly depressing of course but stillit probably speaks volumes about how bad the horror parts are that im giving it a 4 even as im raving about the good points bottom line rent it out and see you may be able to ignore its bad points i simply wasnt,cruel
if you trace or follow the history of shocking films that are intelligent risky and even ahead of their time since the invention of celluloid you get freaks psycho rosemarys baby the exorcist salo and many more that are not just gorefests gorefests are really a genre of their own and some films fit both criteria salo a serbian film but others are meaningless gore that lack intelligence or a message cannibal holocaust human centipede i have been sure to watch all the above mentioned films and appreciate them but is much bigger than all of them in terms of message the exorcist went from creating controversy to actually being embraced by the catholic church for its accuracy and renewing an interest in religion itself this film is the first film on a list of horrorcontroversial that is truly spiritual in nature given the darkness i was a child who was raised by fighting segments of two families so i was part time catholic part time jewish and more disturbingly part time pentacostal there was lots of conflicting reading from bibles and torahs and exciting revelations i was 10 when i saw the exorcist and had to prove i had read the book first so an adult would bring me horror with religious or political undercurrents can prove the most disturbing and disruptive to the psyche if thats your    sensitivity people who are empathic susceptible to the suffering of animals and other living things or who have conflicted spiritual beliefs can see this positively or negatively schlocky bfilm fans will get nothing out of this its so unfair to compare anything about this film to hostel or saw  those were checklists of ways to do special effects gore and a good reason for the term torture porn this film can enlighten you about yourself and your attitudes about spirituality dont read spoilers and youll have the raw unexpected reaction you should have beyond the first rather normal half of the movie i have an addictive personality and seeing the exorcist at 10 and the omen etc started a fascination with the genre that id like to advise those who may suffer from depression anxiety or spiritual issues to use caution with a film like this a similar warning in the case of another great film antichrist several years ago i got caught up in hype banned films lists and watched human centipede silly really high camp salo cannibal holocaust and regrettably slipped into a malaise and sadness that took several weeks to dig out of likely triggered by salo and the research surrounding the film the ending the directors death and knowledge of italian politicsseveral years go by and now ive done a serbian film antichrist and back to back bad move i feel the sadness these artists may have used film directing of these particular films as forms of expression of a darker view of the human spirit they are literally for the cause of filmmaking for our voyeuristic needs all directors who have suffered from depression on the record im sure i may be mocked for this review as being weak in some way  but isnt film meant to make us feel dont we all feel in our own way my message  use caution and know your heart this film makes a brilliant overall spiritual statement that is horrifying to get to you must not turn away but if you are prone to fits of depression use caution share the experience with others or at least clean your palette with something uplifting or funny afterward believe in the light perhaps,cruel
there are examples in cinema which can be termed as violent shocking disturbing appalling unsettling depressing or disgusting but there is only one proudly presented by the new french extremity movement notable for films like high tension inside  irreversible sets an incredibly high bar for ensuing films of its genre and is arguably the most extreme  violent film ever madebeginning with a prologue that shows a young girl named lucy escaping after a horrifying experience of abduction  prolonged torture jumps to events taking place 15 years later when lucy along with her friend anna embarks on a bloody quest for revenge against her oppressors but the two only end up going through another living hell of depravity as one of them is ultimately driven mad by the horrors of the pasti dont usually say this early in most of my reviews but here i have to because is certainly not a film for the squeamish even the most hardcore fans of extreme horror will find it tough to sit through  will find themselves flinching multiple times due to its extremely graphic content the film is an absolute terror from start to finish but its real strength is the aftereffects for it can leave one shocked  upset for a certain amount of timeboldly directed finely scripted nicely photographed cleverly edited solidly performed and presented in a grisly uncompromising  disturbing manner shows the many existing chambers in the world of horror which still remain unexplored and is one of the most unimaginable portrayals of human violence on film canvas it may not be as seamlessly executed as inside but it sure sets a new standard of extremity in cinemaon an overall scale marking a new high for the new wave of french horror  possessing a strength that guarantees an extremely discomforting cinematic experience takes violence in motion pictures to a whole new level without abandoning its story which actually features an interesting concept and is arguably the farthest cinema has gone to explore the gruesome brutality a human body can endure watch it at your own risk,cruel
ill write this review trying to avoid spoilers which is very hard since the essence of this movie relies on its plot its impossible to transmit by words how great this movie is without spoiling it to others who havent seen it yetthe beginning of shows already the type of horror movies its going to be a psychological one and not a typical gory one sure there are shocking scenes that are almost unwatchable but the psychological part is what really shines on this moviethe scenarios costumes camera angles background music and special effects are marvelous contributing a lot to the mystery feeling we get from almost every scenethe acting is also one of the main aspects of this movie the feelings are well transmitted making it easy for the public to connect with the characters there are moments where youll feel sadness regret love fear all due to the great acting behind iti was confused in the beginning with a lot of questions in my head about what was happening on the screen but those questions soon vanished as the story advanced not only did i have a brighter view about what the movie was about but i was also more captivated to know what would happen next all i can say is there are a great deal of surprises on this filmi dont really know of any bad aspects about this movie except some minor flaws with the story itself and some scenes which were too slowpaced with no music these scenes were also a bit disconnected between each othermy favourite sequences were the scene where we learn why is the movie called and the end of the movie the end is just amazing it leaves the audience thinking about it and frustrated for not knowing the answeri recommend this movie to everyone who loves a good horror movie with a clever plot and good acting with the right amount of blood and violence scenes910,cruel
before i say anything about story first you should know this is not a true horror movie you cant call this a revenge movie too unlike what people are commonly telling about this film and about the story first you are watching a painful past of a young girl named lucie that taken by a mysterious cult group and tortured she escaped and is growing up in somewhere like orphanage and doctors cant cure her mental sickness but the girl keep growing and being alive for next 15 years in continue you will see how hard and dangerous is her sickness that make her easily murdered a whole family with their children and keep hurting herself but what the  how was she living these years as she has a very close friend however you will understand its more than a friendship and more like a lesbian relationship named anna that take care of her but she must spend every minute of her life with her to stay her alive these events happened in less than half of movie and those are the best parts of it the ideas in movie are over and remaining minutes of film are totally waste of timebecause lucie had her revenge and killed herself and with that the small and only scary part of movie lucies paranoid vision of a creature is over now what we have are just anna and those insane cult members they found anna and start doing what they done to others to her and i blame myself why i didnt use fast forward to prevent myself from seeing those sick behaviors that director put details on this part you will watch painful scenes of tortures that have nothing to do with horror seeing a big bald guy mercilessly hit a small and weaken girl in every weak is more like a torture prn than horror or slasher movie and at last skinned her alive to make her see what they always looking for she said something in ear of their boss and people being curious about what anna saw on that moments thb i dont give any fck what anna saw i dont know how kind of feel should i have why should it being important when its a result of sadistic methods and the boss commit a suicide before telling her followers what she heard from anna and movie ended the question is what is this movie about revenge being a lover of a stupid person you will win a stupid price or about to advertise that cult even we forgot lucies events because of misleading of story i can not find the point because the movie is not entertaining anyway and i guess people who enjoys this movie and its scenes are typical fans of torture prns and the goal is people in prn doesnt graphically get hurt but in this movie they do if you are a person who the end and meaning of the movie is important for you just dont watch this,cruel
what i found horrible beyond belief is that multitudes of people rated this film with 9 even 10 stars what in the world did they find gratifying in this sickeningly repulsive movie i have no clue but just to be on the safe side im buying extra locks and alarms in case some of these people might be living in my neighbourhood,cruel
this is another film that i had heard a lot about from horror film podcasts i listen to but never had gotten around to seeing until now this film is quite brutal but if you can handle it it is well worth it the synopsis is a young womans quest for revenge against the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child leads her and a friend who is also a victim of child abuse on a terrifying journey into a living hell of depravityi tried to come in knowing as little as possible about the film i really like that we got to see the lucie as she escaped from her captors this is given to us in a few different scenes early on we just get a taste of the torture she had to endure at the time we arent given why it is happening but we do get a see a news crew goes into the place she was held there is just a chair that she was strapped to and a hole in the seat to go to the bathroom lucie grows to be mylne jampanoshe has befriended anna morjana alaoui who we end up learning is a runaway lucie then decides to get revenge on the people that hurt her when she finds their picture in a newspaper what i really liked about the story early on is this seems like a normal family it made me question if lucie has just lost it or is this really the people that hurt her anna seems to think that the latter is the case though there is also the creature that lucie sees that she thinks is chasing her this looked creepy and had me wondering from the first time seeing her if she was real or not what it ends up being i thought was great even though i do have issues with this trope sometimethis film has a few reveals that i really liked around the time that lucie gets her revenge was where i was starting to wonder what was going on the film then takes it even farther and i thought it was great to fully delve into the story i would need to spoil the film which i really dont want to do here i will say i like how the film ends as it ties science and religion together what anna goes through is horrible and made me cringe the ending though was greatgoing from there i need to talk about the effects they look to be practical and looked to be very real the gun shots to the knife cuts all look like they really happened which is very well done on the effects department seeing the torture as well looked quite vivid and a lot of it had me cringing at the brutal realism even the after effects look so real on the characters i could definitely see what they went through on their bodies i was very impressed in a morbid way i also want to include here how the film looks grainy this was a good touch as it makes what we are seeing even more realistic it also made me feel that what was happening was gritty as wellthe film was very interesting in how it was edited as well we do follow a very linear story but there are intercuts of things that happened to lucie in the past these are shown when she is sleeping or when anna is cleaning early on i like how they use these to fill us in on the backstory it works as well because we get to see what lucie went through later but it is done to anna it just doesnt tell us and it makes it that much more horrific the film does build tension and the climax was the payoff i needed i thought the conclusion makes sense as wellsomething else that was very good for the film was the acting i thought the two leads did great what their characters go through is amazing and they portrayed the effects of this very well it seemed very believable that they dealt with everything that they did the rest of the cast round out the film well what i really find interesting about the supporting cast is that they seem like normal people who are doing completely horrible things it really brings the moral of the story that we dont know what those people around us are doing when the doors close which is very scary it makes you wonder if someone you know is doing something like this to peoplethe score didnt really stand out to me for the film but i think that it fit the scenes for what they needed i dont have anything negative to say about it and it never took me out of the scenesnow with that said i would recommend this film if you can stomach french extreme films this one i had heard great things about and was satisfied after seeing it the film has some depraved aspects that happen but it also makes you question if lucie is crazy or not early on you learn that she is mentally scarred by what happened to her which i found to be believable the acting was good and this is coupled with the realistic effects that happen to them it definitely made me cringe i felt dirty after watching it and i also wanted them to get their revenge it is interesting as to why this is happening to them and i like how it ties religion with science this has become my new favorite from this genre as stated it is very realistic and made me cringe so if you can stomach it i definitely recommend viewing this,cruel
is a french horror movie which is part of the new wave of french extremity which means its extremely dark gory and disturbingyoure not supposed to have a good time watching this movie and i know thats the point but the whole thing just felt so shallow and pointless to methe second half of the movie is pretty much a woman being beaten to within an inch of her life and tortured no story interesting dialogue or characters just a girl being punched kicked and mutilated over and over againall of this torture is for zero payoff the ending is one of the dumbest things ive ever seen and it actually made me mad watching iti have no problem with movie gore and violence a lot of my favourite movies are violent but this was just garbagethere are actually a lot of people who consider this to be a good movie,cruel
i agree with the other reviews that rate this movie as little more than torture very similar to high tension but less story i will stay clear of french women the rest of my life they seem to be another breed of psychotic lol,cruel
this movie is creepy disturbing and worst movie never waste your time on this,cruel
great amazing a must see at times silly with noticable bad acting at times just too much but with all of its cons the pros are uncountableits gory tense stressful sad and relievingits a must see,cruel
this movie has so many layers horror revenge violence love torture survival and makes you question something we are all dying to find out is there an afterlife,cruel
as a huge gore and splatter movie fan i can say that this is the best movie in this genre ive seen so far i dont know if it sounds weird but for me its not just a basic horror movie it has something poetical lovely so sad that its underrated this movie deserves more respect to be honest martys is the first movie that made me cry forget all of those stupid drama movies and give a chance to this beautiful masterpiece,cruel
i was lucky to survive over this torture would be happy to be on their place instead mine right now,cruel
watching was a experience i certainly dont regret and contrary to what most people feel about it i would watch it again the problem with it was that the plot was developed in a very predictible waythis is the only movie directed by pascal laugier that ive seen so i dont have any experience with his style but i expected something quite different from a french movie i received what i wanted in a very small dose but the rare moments of insightful introversion silence and flashbacks werent enough for my tastethe whole standard horror film linear plot gave me an american vibe and thats what killed it for me i didnt appreciate the jumpscares either since they werent very tastefulbut my take on is more than simply seeing it as a shock value movie it has some subtance to it and it displays the vulnerability of human nature in an unconventional manner it is the fear of death that makes people do inhumane things and the journey of anna gradually presents the process of dehumanization of both herself and the organisation members a better approach of this theme could have transformed this movie into a masterpiecevisually i found very aesthetic and it didnt fail to make the public symphatize with the main characters through a sensory amplification of their dreadful experiencesthe music was very good and i will certainly check it out for its quality and for the nostalgic feeling it didnt fail to give meall things said i would recommend to anybody who want to see a horror film which roots from an original idea only if they can get over the graphic violent and gory scenes,cruel
i really doubt that good reviews are about this movie pure waste of time,cruel
frenchists shouldve stopped making movies after inspector clouseau leave snuff movies for japanese and koreans you just dont know how to do it,cruel
not a horrible movie but i was not fazed in the least by this moviemaybe that is more an indictment of me than this picture sure there are graphic scenes but have seen it all before i have seen skinless bodies before in several films namely hell raiser have seen people die from shotgun blast and have seen women held in a torturelike basementdungeon situation and as disturbing as some of the torture scenes are it is all in fact being done with a purpose if you will versus other films where it is just being shown for its shockvalue so to me the purpose and existential quality of the narrative in this second half of the movie nullifies the purely disgusting and i had to leave the movie and go vomit type reactions being caused by this film not all other films of this genre are as tense or welldirected or wellacted as this film was but nothing here seems groundbreaking or includes anything that lends to this movie in many circles being called the most disturbing film of alltime or a masterpiecea word thrown around very loosely these days in my opinion for seemingly any new film that just pushes the boundaries a bit and is fairly wellacted and directed etcthis movie is worth a watch for sure has some interesting things to say about society and violence and and what it all gets us in the end but at times it is choppy from one scene to the nextlots of fadeouts towards the end of the film which seem to break the flow of the film this im sure was purposeful as im sure the fadeouts were to show each step anna was enduring to reach enlightenment but much of the cuts seemed to detract from the mood and overall storyline i felt myself saying where are we now a few times throughout the film as the jumps in time mood and mental state detracted from the power of what the intentions were in my opinion and the mother of the family that tortured lucie as a young girl comes back to life after being blasted by a shotgun through the chest i tried to wonder if this was just an apparition or fear that lucie had of the mother not dying of continuing to torture her in some waybut anna finds the mother alive in the bathroom and she tries to help her to safety only to be found out by lucie who then bludgeons the mothers head with a hammer questioning annas loyalty to her for trying to help the mom i dont know was this just metaphorical or imagined if so whysome of the makeup effects are very well done while others seems outwardly sort of secondclass it appeared to me that the demonspirit just a manifestation of her own tortured self woman haunting lucie in the first part of the film had a plastic suit on full of cuts and scratches etc as it appears she did if you watch the making of extra on the dvd and we all have seen the contorted maimed twisted walking like a crab demon in many films before pretty well done here but still not groundbreaking in my opinion same for the tortured girl found by anna in the basement in the second half of the film with the helm stapled to her skullit looked like she was wearing a rubber bodysuit with lots of makeup i may be nitpicking but it was a distraction for me nonethelessas for the underlying narrative of this film the first half seemingly was about revenge and exorcising ones demonsas lucie repeatedly tells the demon spirit following her that ive done it ive killed them alleven the kids as if why are you still bothering me ive done what you wanta manifestation of her inner self trying to rid herself of her horrid memories she enters the home of a family who tortured her 15 years earlier and guns down all four of them including the two children she never succeeds though in exorcising her demon and is driven to madness and suicide by the requisite slit throat gushing blood death scene anna her best friend now picks up the baton to fight this demontype girl and she is spared by a group of officiallooking types who enter the house and blow a hole through the demongirls head they soon show themselves to not be friendly at all as anna is shackled by them and dragged down to a dungeonhospital ward type basement setting to begin her enlightenment seems this group of mercenaries works for the madomoiselle an older woman who seems in charge of the whole martyrtortureenlightenment scenario being undertaken with anna and she is just the latest in a long line it seems of girls who they have tortured in the past seemingly with the objective of finding out whether enough deprivation and torture will actually bring about the loss of ego and self and the attainment of a state of pure enlightenment and a transcending view of the afterlife madamoiselle says that too many women call themselves victims while what we really need are and she is out to find if she can turn a victim to a martyr if you will most of the prior victims it seems have gone mad while anna they notice is accepting each step in the process in comparison so they see the potential of their experiment succeeding anna is deprived of normal food and drink she is repeatedly fed a groullike substance that she at first cant stomach and she spits it out at her captorher head is shaved and she endures repeated beatings by a male guard and finally she is skinned and placed in a vat of solution to linger while there the woman who feeds her tells madamoiselle that it appears it is happening you should see her eyes she sees nothing around her its like she is not here anymore which to them is successshe has transcendedmadamoiselle invites many guests to come and see the success they have had with annaand all seem very excited to finally find out what her enlightenment has brought and what has been found out about the afterlife before they do madamoiselle goes to see anna and asks her if she has crossed over and seen whats there and she gets a whispered answer from anna in her ear while preparing in her roomactually unpreparing because madamoiselle is taking off her headdress and makeupeyebrows etcshe asks her attendant through her bedroom door if he believes or knows if there is an afterlife and he says he doesnt know she then says to him keep doubting as she pulls a gun and shoots herself through the mouth i believe after all the torture and deprivation anna told her that there was no crossing over or sure answer about the afterlife in fact unable to tell her if she in fact became a martyr with madamoiselle seemingly so close to what she thought was the breakthrough she was seeking and now with no more answers than if it never happened at all she kills herself knowing there is no other level to go to in this life to find out what exists in the nextmaybe a victim only remains so,cruel

boring movie with trying to be some reason twist in the end its like evil dead just worse i expected much much morei recommend a serbian fillm to watch,cruel
when i first heard of this movie  i was like this sounds interesting let me check it out after watching it  i can tell you that i basically just saw a extremely violent movie that had a strong message behind it  but the movie doesnt do anything creative with it and once you understand why its all happening  you just become no longer invested in it because you are already sick to your stomach and there isnt any characters that are interesting  every character in this movie is just an inanimate object for more gore to be shown and the performances arent good either and they become annoying and the whole movie feels annoying  hollow dull vile and pretentious  the violence is so much that i begin to feel like vomiting at certain points and the beating scene of anna was too much for me  the end was one of those ending that doesnt give you any explanation of why anything is happening and let the audience guess  which is a common in these artsyfartsy movies there are so many plot holes in this movie  1 when she kills the entire family and calls her friend to help and after doing that  they dont even leave the house  they just stay there 2 when anna finds the woman locked in the basement  instead of taking her to the hospital or calling 911 to help her  she puts her in the bathtub which i felt was just an excuse for more gore to be shown 3 why didnt the police arrive when lucy killed the family  the in the end  is just another generic torture porn movie with virtually no plot and a slight twist that s they re searching for the afterlife stuff,cruel
lucie and anna grew up together in a shelter form abused kids lucie had undergone and ordeal and is not crazy and she sees demons years later she still sees demons and is out for revengei wanted to turn the film off in the first 10 minutes i didnt really like the overall plot i thought it was a bit silly what makes this film stand out from other slashers is the realism you can almost feel the pain inflicted on the victimgive me fake blood and gore with girls who take showers,cruel
i am a fan of stupid movies but problem starts when you read and hear that this crap is called artisticreallyfor god sake no plot no character development not disturbingnot frighteningnothingthis movie is at most optimistic view like the worst bdsm porn ever nt a movie you can dishonor the title of movie by this moving picturesthe writerif it has any and director tries to be difffernet but it even makes it more nonsense not even worth to see just in order to say you see one of the worst movies ever cause the set music and sometimes actings are in the level of a middle class movieso you have something between worst and middle which means a total waste of timei am sorry for those who rate it highthey have not seen much movie i guess,cruel
the synopsis for on netflix where it is not yet available even on dvd indicates that the movies about a young woman who enlists the aid of her longtime friend to exact revenge on the couple who imprisoned and tortured her when she was a kid but that covers only about the first twenty minutes of this gory thriller then stuff gets weirdfirst a disclaimer as i was watching this movie i realized i really didnt like it i just didnt get it didnt know why the plot was moving forward wasnt the revenge over and then the third act finally arrived and when i went to bed i still didnt like it but i was wavering when i woke up the next morning i had to admit to myself that it was a pretty good movie after allin a sense the plot isnt quite linear we first see the women getting the revenge but then the focus shifts from the original victim lucie mylene jampanoi to her friend anna morjana alaoui who herself becomes a victim of immeasurable suffering its like watching the events that probably happened to lucie play out with anna i started to wonder what the point or the endgame was was this just for the sake of bloodletting the answer lies in the title i certainly cant tell you why as that would spoil the surprise but if you do take the time to watch this movie  and beware its in french and the version i saw was dubbed not subtitled  try to stick with it itll give you something to think about if nothing else,cruel
when i watched this film for the first time a couple years ago i had flashbacks this is the most disturbing movie i have ever seen in my life i recently found out that a supposed cousin of mine had a role in it and was also the stuntman this is why the remake 2015 went straight to dvd because it was too disturbing to be in the theatres,cruel
pascal laugiers is one of the defining films in the successful extreme wave of french horror movies during the 21st century capitalizing on the successes of contemporaries like high tension is a film which hits the viewer hard with an array of relentless torture sequences coupled with a gritty style complementing the genre the films tone is its stand out feature as rather than presenting you with a fun gorefest it instead submerges you in an uncomfortably grotesque story which is sure to play with your emotions unlike films such as hostel it isnt just an excuse to push cinema to its visual extremity the film has a powerful story and interesting concepts which sets it apart from other installments in this type of disturbing cinemathe film boasts beautiful cinematography powerful sound design and strong character development which only adds to the films overall look and feel aside from some shaky writing in regards to annas character early on in the film i found to be lacking in negatives and would happily give it a strong 910 recommended to all of those who want to experience an educated form of the darker side of cinema thoroughly deserves to be considered an iconic installation into the horror genre,cruel
this movie got me to know the huge successful artist pascal laugier what a work hes done in this movie  the movie has unexpected twist that will make you think and contemplate life afterwards  the performance was more than an extraordinary everything was actually super cool  dont judge the movie by its name because soon you will realize that you been tricked and misunderstood the word in the end of this review i would like to elucidate something for the people who already watched the film so they may stop reading  the group the do the torturing the girls are trying to make them lose the sense of this life and transfer to other life life after death because its the only way to observe it  i think the director tried to allude that all previous girls couldnt make it to that stage but anna morjana alaoui made it because she doesnt have any grudge or fear shes a good person as you seen they way she treated people ,cruel
there have been a lot of torture based films in the past 15 years some more thoughtful than others there are the ones like hostel which really want to do nothing more than shock you at how violent gruesome and cruel they can be then there are the ones like saw which are a step up in the intelligence ranks the saw series put some real time and effort into their stories and plots and their masterful twist endings of all the torture films ive ever seen though and that is quite a few admittedly i think i would have to say is the most intelligent of them all trust the french i love french films and i loved what i thought was just another hostel type film attempting nothing more than to shock the audience as much as possible turned out to be something quite brilliantit goes without saying that this film will not be for everyone make no mistake some of the imagery is truly brutal and i suspect will stay with me for a long time and ive seen a lot horrible imagery over the years in a way its a little sad that a lot of people wont be able to stomach the film because they will miss out on what ended up being a very interesting and intriguing ending this is a wonderful film and if youre up to it make sure you check it out,cruel
not easy to watch the movie is very well made and is as well scary as well as horribly gory i have seen a lot of horror movies and there is none other that stirred me as much as this one and to be honest i did not enjoy watching this movie and i will probably never watch it again at the end it left me with a deep sadness  but stirring ones emotions scaring you to death and revolting you about the horrific things you see is what does this movie really really well and for that even if i did not enjoy watching it in my opinion it earns a good rating because this movie succeeds in what it wants to achieve so in short it is by far the most scary movie i have seen so far watch at your own risk,cruel
i loved this movie this movie is almost solely for those who have disturbed sick minds which i proudly possess everyone who gave this a 1 star rating are people who cant handle anything that makes them even slightly uncomfortable if you consider yourself having a disturbed mind you will love this movie it is not for everyone hence the 1 star ratings the low ratings anger me so much because they shouldnt have watched the movie in the first place it was not meant for people who do not have an open mind and not for those who cant handle any disturbing content anyway i found this movie very interesting and unique compared to what horror movies are popular in the us unlike others who claim you cant rewatch this movie ive already seen it twice and will most likely re watch several more times i am so happy i found this gem,cruel
i have a different experience after watching this movie again some five years later now i can appreciate the supreme acting grit buildup cinematography music etci now can more get what they were trying to get at it the characters in the movie i meanhowever they could have accomplished the same thing by using drugs on the take a person to actual death and bring them backi guess the option is another option but yet to this day i still agree its very sickalso i dont know if the woman at the end is going to the place as the poor victim here,cruel
after years of seeking a limit i saw this movie for about 5 years ago after this one i didnt need more cruelness in life since then i have not looking for that kind of movies it was scary in a way and i almost got sick of the violenceso if you enjoy movies like the grudge the ring and perhaps irreversible or funny games you will like this one i think it has some of the elements brutality and scary psychology in commonfor me   please make it stopenjoy  9 and not 10 because it changed me but i will not see it ever again ,cruel
this is the first time ive ever reviewed something on imdb ive always felt like ive wanted to but never felt the need to do so until i watched this film i almost felt like i should review itlike everyone says on here its not just a horror or a thriller its so many things rolled into one the film itself has stages the first half an hour or so is very creepy but it then changes into more of a story with a few twiststhe last part where anna is taken by the organisation is something obviously i could see coming as soon as they entered the houseit was extremely disturbing and you can see why in the world of today the uk does not provide consumers with movies like this partially because its morally and ethically wrong and partially because the majority of consumers will just moan about it being too disgusting im a big movie fan and appreciated this where it needed to be appreciatedif youre like me and have wanted to watch this movie for ages but have never got round to it then trust me force yourself to watch it not many movies ive seen are like this its along the lines of dogtooth funny games saw and the hostels but in its own right it deserves its own individual accolades810 stars its missing 1 purely for the fact its very disturbing you may struggle to sleep well after watching this movieits missing another 1 for the fact its french and therefore subtitled  any movie with subtitles loses a mark because frankly its a movie not a book if i wanted to read something id go and pick up a magazine,cruel
i am a horror movie junkie and have been watching horror movies for about 17 years now i will not put any spoilers in this review what i do before i watch all my movies all i watch is horror is read the critics reviews and synopsis on imdb to make sure it is actually worth watching i think we can all agree so much of horror is just pure crap nowadays after reading up on this movie i was really excited to watch it i am american and watched it subtitled surprisingly the movie was so engulfing within a few minutes i forgot i was even reading subtitles the movie is basically split into two stories which is really cool my advice is not to read anything about this movie before you watch it since i knew what to expect it really took a lot away from the movie and i deeply regret doing so a lot of people name this as the most disturbing movie or one of them and i definitely dont agree with that however i guess it depends on personal taste i watched a youtube review where the girl was practically crying reviewing this maybe im just that desensitized ive seen a serbian film and while i didnt consider that all that disturbing either i think it goes beyond what i love about this movie is that you dont just get gore or torture for the sake of it there is real meaning behind it the end of the film is one of my favorites ever put to screen and this movie will truly get you thinking i adore psychological thrillers victim is one of my favorites as well and i think this imparts some aspects of that at any rate this is a must see for any horror lover possible spoiler  i would especially recommend this film for atheists i am myself and particularly enjoyed it for that reason,cruel
incredible film not just for the horror genre but for film in general ive really begun to fall in love with french horror films recently and out of all the ones ive seen which i also plan to review this is the best and the closest one to attaining the title of masterpiece try it its absolutely worth a viewing yes its violent gruesome and gory its still worth iti dont plan to divulge any plot information just understand that i was kept in a state between quiet nervousness and shivering terror for almost the entire runtime it deserves a better review than ive been able to give and it deserves your attention even if only for a couple of hours be blessed,cruel
i feel there are a lot of misconceptions of this film ive watched this film twice the first time i was relatively disgusted by the seemingly empty impact it left however the 2nd time i came to a complete different conclusion this film is not devised to be enjoyed whatsoever or your regular horror the lack of enjoyment and darkness cultivates a void filled with a variety of thoughts during the film and allows the audience to manifest in those should they arise it is incredibly bleak at times often mistaken for torture porn however the malicious visceral and macabre notions of screenplay are vital to construe the complete reflection of the films ideas serving as an symbol to human pain personally the heinous nature of the actions partly represent aspects of the arguably dysfunctional capitalist society as it is regarded by many today the almost unbearably gritty nature in way the film is exhibited and executed plays an exceptional correlation to the ultimate destruction of hope the duration in which anna is tortured brings up much controversy but in my honest opinion it creates a bleak build up yet essential appreciation in comparison to the malicious beat down and struggle endured by many people in postmodern society where dreams are smashed into a drab isolated resignation of slavery to the capitalist system the very powerful scene in which anna has a mental conversation with lucie the rich and powerful those perpetrating annas suffering are so dissociated and proceed to prolong the suffering of people in which is a selfishly justifiable cause to themselves the almost unsatisfactory ending to me represents an analogy of the insatiable nature of greed largely leaving the rich unsatisfied as mademoiselle commits suicide because she possibly cannot handle the truth of realisation of her actions and ready to prolong suffering eg continuing the experiment due to the lack of conclusionunderstandably a potential downside could be the hints of misogyny potentially using women with the symbol of the weak and beaten down in society as the plot clearly states females are more susceptible to the torturing using only females for the characters enduring the suffering this film really leaves an impact like no other originally of disgust but upon 2nd viewing pure sadness however it is definitely not recommended to everyone due to the very challenging scenes within it which are integral to the symbolisation it definitely requires an open mind,cruel
is in my top 3 favorite horror movies of all time most negative criticism i read here seems to be from people who either dont really like horror movies or like them on the light sideif you think every horror movie should make you laugh be unrealistic and full of jumpscares youll probably hate but if you are a hardcore horror movie fan like me this is the movie youve been waiting for never a motion picture has made me feel so empty and amazed by the sheer brutality and hopelessness shown all of it is top notch acting pacing makeup cinematography plot score atmosphere not everything is absolutely perfect but which movie is what makes it so good is that there is a little of everything a monster physical and psychological violence a slasher flick a revenge flick a cult flick all rolledup into one fabulous nightmare another big plus is the realism avantgardiste this movie was ahead of the curve in understanding that whats truly scary is seeing something that could really happen youll go trough all kinds of emotions this movie leaves no one indifferentmaybe the most important reminds us that true horror in essence shouldnt be entertaining,cruel
the reason i watched was because i saw it described as an existential nightmare on reddit i wish i could take credit for that description because that just about perfectly sums up this filmthis film begins with someone literally escaping their torture and ends with someone metaphorically escaping their torture the film revolves around lucie a victim of torture dealing with depression and guilt since she didnt save one person as she was escaping and anna lucies caretaker of sorts and a caring selfless mother figure for pretty much everyone she sees that is suffering probably since she was never given that motherly care that she gives to others after brief introductions to these characters we are shown a happy family on a regular morning but we dont yet know what theyre significance is to this storysuddenly they are murdered yeah its shocking and truly horrifying especially after we have just gotten to know this family even the kids are killed then the murderer is unveiled to be lucie the parents of the family are apparently her torturers yet lucie seems to feel genuine guilt about what shed done she is pursued by her symbolic demons which she expected to go away after her revenge the jumpscares during these scenes are one of my only major flaws with the film because they are completely ineffective regardless it serves as gruesome and terrifying symbolic imagery anna arrives at the house and she attempts to save one almost dead victim of lucie but lucie hears her and this sets her off she kills the barely surviving woman for good then nearly kills anna then kills herself this alone is an absolute nightmare for anna since she wasnt able to help her in the end no matter what she did but she is confronted with this nightmare once again when she discovers an underground laboratory of sorts that contains a woman whose skin is scratched and falling off but still alive anna realizes she cant save this woman no matter what she does since her problem is internal but tries anyway but to no availa bullet wound is suddenly placed in that womans skull people that seem to be some sort of government task force come and trap anna in a torture chamber like the one she found the woman in and she is tortured but why well this organization wants to create they want to subject human beings to unimaginable seemingly unsurvivable physical torture until they transcend what was once physical and human and go somewhere different entirely the torture scenes are brutally realistic and hard to watch and with every passing minute she seems more and more helpless no one can help her and she cant help herself the two possible results are that the torture becomes a part of anna driven by fear and a need to die or she lets go of herself entirely to where torture doesnt bother her because she is no longer attached to her body still the only thing she can do is let the torture be inflicted upon her eventually anna lets go of herself which was her only escape she goes into a state of martyrdom she becomes a witness to what is beyond life she whispers this to the head of the organization and they plan to hold a meeting to reveal her description of what is after deaththe end is incredibly ambiguous and im still trying to figure out what it means the woman who heard this description the head of the company has a conversation with another large figure holding the meeting she asks if he has ever tried to imagine what is after death he says no she says keep doubting and shoots herself what this probably means is that the afterlife is unbelievably horrible and she doesnt want anyone to know the truth because then the rest of life will seem as meaningless as it is to her now she wants them to keep doubting that there is another world because nothingness would be better than what it is therefore annes torture was pointless and life only ever results in pain with no one to help and nowhere to go the ending could also mean that the afterlife was so amazing that she wanted to get there now and she didnt want anyone else to know because she was selfish and careless about others this means that no matter how much pain and torture humans are put through even if there is one completely selfless soul due to the inherent selfishness of the rest of mankind her suffering is for nothing and we will never know about the afterlife i think the former sounds a bit more plausible but either way this is a pure existential nightmare,cruel
the start is incredible the middle  edge of seat and the ending groundbreaking and boundary stretchingi love movies with a make your own mind up kind of attitude and this film delivers on that immensely its about revenge but also just as much about other peoples beliefs not only is this film violent but also clever and shouldnt be classed as an overly gratuitously violent type film either it has meaning within a real story that makes you care and fear for the characters i know im more into describing the feelings i have rather than the story line but the feelings are just as important we will all have our own interpretations of films like these and this was one hell of a journey,cruel
i think this is the only film i have ever watched where i had absolutely no idea what it was about and it didnt matter the film opens looking like like a no budget schlock fest made with a home video camera and a bottle of tomato sauce and somehow it just gets better and more bizarre as it goes along its as though someone saw the rushes for the first half and said here you go heres 10k buy some props for much of the opening half hour you at times are wondering whether this is some sort of pina bausch inspired contemporary dance off plus lots of killing but then the story evolves more into a distopic nightmare kind of midnight express made by a group of stoners who watched too much asian gore anyways despite all of the above its somehow a work of genius and i highly recommend itunless you dont like seeing people peeledthen you just should watch misses doubtfire again,cruel
let me begin with a simple question would you consider as just another silly gore film i believe that the answer will surprise you for many reasons before seeing this movie i had no expectations about it actually when i saw the poster it didnt strike me as something special in fact it looked just like one of so many lowbudget gory films then i saw the movie and i was very impressed in a really good way first of all the film shocked me with how psychosis hallucination is described in a way i had never seen before it was too realistic then i was deeply involved with the philosophical plot of course it was disturbing and not for everyone however i can make a risky statement this is art why well maybe because it confronts the viewer with the last face of death some strange and perplexing kind of beauty,cruel
ok i dont want to sound like a weirdo buti enjoy the hell out of a well acted beautifully directed smarttightly written script that sits atop a large stack of the old ultraviolencesorry clockwork but im talking about high tensioni saw the deviltexas chainsaw made a new friend the devils rejectsthe walking dead  its name is hannibalthe series clear cool is truly unlike any other film its horror genre but not its also thrillercrime dramaand wtf the category of torture porn horror it is not that would require sadism in a serial abusemurderer for no reason way and its reason is a dark hallway paved with glass shardsleading us thru our heroines very complex yet brutally simple set of new circumstances it is a visceralengrossing journey that will at times have you peaking thru your fingers from the edge of your seat and still thinking about it days later i first saw in 2009 then i bought the dvd watched it again many months later and again last night yep i recruited the uninitiated i dont recommend it to everyone but when i have they are just as taken with it as i was and remain is a quality cool horror movie good luck and try to sit back and not chew off all ten fingernails,cruel
o dayum i woke up in the middle of the night i had a nightmare haunted by that ghost in the martyr and you know i dont remember the last time a movie give me any nightmare i thought only my ex gives me nightmare i know i shouldnt have watched this movie before going to sleep and i watched the unrated version there is no way i am gonna get to sleep for at least another 30 minutes i have to push the dead girl outside of my brain with some music before i dowhile i am recovering i guess i will just write this reviewthis movie is so disturbing the first half of the movie made me feel really anxious i even had to take a break watching the first half of the movieit is disturbing not only because the gore is so realistic but the story telling at the first half is well done you will be wondering what is going on did she murder innocent family is that real its that kind of storytelling that made you on edge but you cant stop because you are so curiousthe sound omg i took break after the first girl died and the other girl heard a sound in empty house i was like if the dead woman gonna hurt the other girl i cant take it anymore i need a breakand the ending it is unpredictable there are two key moment in the movie before the real ending that could be an ending the first one is disturbing ending but hey the story is still go on and you got an ok happy ending but the story still go on just watch yourself for the real endingthe flaw in this movie is that the 13 part at the end is kinda predictable it just felt too long but since the first half is really good i still give it 8i have watched a lot of horror movies and most of them dont scare me at all but this one made me feel so anxious and give me fukg nightmarethis is the most disturbing horror movie i ever saw i cant recommend it enough just go watch it if you love horror movie,cruel
there was a time when france was not particularly praised for its horror film output this despite the outpourings of jean rollins personal voyage of vampirism zombies and the like this despite the supreme eyes without a faceles yeux sans visage the filmtelevision series the returnedles revenants and films like the pack and there is a famous photograph sometimes known as napalm girl featuring a nine yearold vietnamese girl running naked and terrified away from the carnage caused by an aerial napalm attack in 1972 as effective as any antiwar poster this picture might have inspired one of the opening scenes of this truly disturbing film brutally attacked and imprisoned halfdressed lucie jurin escapes her prison and runs down the street making her escapethe next time we see her she has met anna in the orphanage where she has been placed she is terrorized by the image of a decaying woman possibly a ghostanna and lucie become lovers and vow to get even with the torturers years later they burst in on a happy respectable family and brutally murder them surely these law abiding people cant have been responsible this film succeeds in wrongfooting the audience and providing twist after twist not only are these people partially responsible for lucies degradation but moments later lucie is killed and it is anna that becomes the centre of attention in a narrative that then assumes the moniker torture porn rarely have i seen filmed abuse presented so uncompromisingly anna is ritually beaten fed the bare minimum gruel and if she resists is beaten yet more her broken face and body is heartbreaking to see extremely uncomfortable  her captors only comment is that they are amazed she is still alive she therefore has one final appalling punishment to godespite spoiler warnings the reasons for this abuse will not be mentioned here other than to say it is respectable establishment figures that are behind it all and everything then comes to a very final and satisfying  if that is the right word to use end this is an incredible profound horrifying film  not one im sure ill ever see again but if you can stomach it id recommend watching once,cruel
spoilers this was an excellent movie its not gruesome there are certain torture scenes but its more of a mental torture not physical and theres some physical abuse scenes big man hitting small chick other than the very end the movie isnt very gross at all its rather sad you feel sorry for the girl not sure exactly why people keep comparing this to hellraiser the only thing about this movie that has a likeness is the skinned girl the helmet and chastity chick looked a little clive barker tortured souls but nothing about the story resembles hr comparing to high tension no still not a good comparison the only likeness is a crazy chick who sees things  chick she left behind ht  crazy man and desire for the other girl if i had to compare it would be a mix of hostel meets the lovely bones meets saw,cruel
a young girl escapes a den of torture and terror 15 years later she finds her former captors and exacts a bloody revenge but the nightmare doesnt end it just starts over with a new victim a new martyr chilling soul crushing and poignant is like nothing youve ever seen a very disturbing film about fear not just the fear that the two heroines endure but the fears that drive their tormentors to commit vicious acts of brutality the films antagonists do not see themselves as villains they apparently believe that they are actually doing their victims a service of some sort their acts of violence do not come from a place of sadistic enjoyment i suspect they actually view their cause as holy if not enlightening and that makes them all the more detestablea very striking and thought provoking film,cruel
high tension hard candy baisemoi lesbian rage well there are lesbians in but its revenge and madness that fuel this plot years of abuse and mistreatment left lucie hallucinating and self mutilating with the single goal of laying waste to her captorsit was an experiment gone awry pseudo scientists without ethics and their methods were anything but sound i was reminded of men behind the sun or even auschwitz whether this was mutilation for its own sake or a determination of the constraints of sanity when subjected to the outer limits of brutality remains to be justified here the end product was evidence of martyrdom or perhaps simply a coping mechanism of the nervous system resulting from excruciating infliction of painanna was an apt replacement for the now defunct lucie and she would undergo procedures and horrors that lucies most tainted nightmares could not have encapsulated annas swollen plum face with sliver slit eyes has a ragged porcelain doll quality when she mutters i miss you to her imaginary lucie her soul screams audibly although her voice is no longer capable i was overwhelmed with the beauty of the somber scene at that moment pascual langier grabbed through the lens and simply crushed my heart in his palm i criedin the end we see inside anna not just anatomically but also regarding her multifaceted intricacies had mademoiselle planned on this frail waif being something more than a victim she certainly banked on some inevitable transformation ultimately was anna mademoiselles killer with a forked tongue of deceit or was mademoiselle forced to face her own demons or perhaps nothingness in the end alas the elderly crowd eagerly anticipating evidence of experimental proof may die none the wiser,cruel
i find myself reclassifying this movie over and over again on a personal level i did not quite enjoy it the scenes of torture sit in my head and replay themselves over and over again but the movie sits in my head which in itself is an accomplishment most movies would be completely forgotten 10 minutes after leaving the cinema this is one of those movies that is hard to forget so on a personal level i would give it a five out of 10 did not enjoy but was able to watch to the end looking at the movie from a distance i can see a well defined plot a good twist and as said before a memorable movie so on these technicalities i would give it a 7 out of 10 im going to have to compromise and give it a 6 or maybe a 7 or a 6arrg,cruel
first review after watching the movie due to reviews i decided to write my owni like this movie just liked it made me cringe and think but the thought wasnt deep or sustained if a movie is going to attempt to make the audience think it should give us something to chew on for awhile i am glad i watched it but i am not interested in seeing it again the plot was lackluster and i seen where the story was taking me ahead of timei think many reviews are people seeing it as a art piece and rating it high on that merit alone i really feel the ratings for this movie are a bit generousin summary watch this movie it is definitely worth watching once 5510,cruel
this was incredibly captivating from the beginning until anna was put in handcuffs i was totally engrossed in what was going on it was amazing to watch and i wish i could rate that part of the movie separately  i would have given it a 10 perhaps i thought so because that was the traditional sort of psychological horror while the rest of the film delved into body horror in any case annas torments simply didnt engross me as much the atmosphere may have been too pervasive there may have been too much routine in her abuse to maintain that sort of immersion perhaps it was just the notion of an afterlife which provided the backbone of the movie had it been a group of sadistic monsters it would have been more believable i wouldnt have had to question it the second i questioned the premise the atmosphere came apart,cruel
this movie does not lean on sexual taboos in order to obtain a high degree of shock value as so many movies dubbed disturbing do the shear brutality the driving force behind its antagonists actions and the explanation of many of the scenes makes this one of my top 10 dont get me wrong this movie ended leaving me with enough who what why where questions to keep it in the back of my questioning mind for weeks after watching itrepulsive yet thought provokingnot for the feint of heart is a much watch for any movie goer who seeks the unusual or disturbing,cruel
in 1987 my dad took me to see hellraiser in the theatre and it became my all time favorite horror film passing by friday the 13th part 2 in 2004 i went to a special screening to switchblade romance aka high tension and well clive barker and the cenobites took the silver metal that night while high tension took the gold and this was the point when the gritty new wave splatter horror from france took over my mind since than i have seen so many more gems in my skin  could be the most disturbing film i have seen calvaire ils frontiers the pack cadavers and the fantastic inside tried to get the gold but just missed until that cold rainy night in 2008 when i popped in into my dvd player this film just blew me away from the eye popping opening to the cryptic finale i wont get into the plot since there are hundreds of reviews on imdb that have done this but any horror fan that hasnt seen this owes it to themselves to watch it you may love it hate it or just simply be disgusted with it but you will never forget it,cruel
horror movies as a form of artistic expression usually have a deeper meaning and this one is no exception like in body snatchers or nowadays in all omnipresent zombie movies where we can recognize a fear of spreading of the brutal and low life communism here the author also describes his view of todays social circumstances as enclosed and usually highly secretive circles of people like bankers for instance rule to us all from behind the scenes in this movie author uses a form of a cult that seeks to find a look into the life after death through deliberately induced suffering of another human being which most appropriately shows to the extreme a lack of compassion and inhumanity that such circles can exhibit in pursuit of their selfish goals yet they live their lives like ordinary human beings in a completely normal way with all the love and affection when it comes to their own families this was nicely presented in a scene when lucie before she shoots him asks the oldest son how old is he and he answers 18 which means that his parents had a three year old child for whom they cared with all the love and affection yet that didnt prevent them to horrifically torture a slightly older girl similar to the nazis families like goebbels for instance which cared dearly for his six children but at the same time torturing and murdering countless others as we can see these things are not just a fiction,cruel
i buy it i believe it of the frenchtwist aside is well made the practical and special effects are especially good and i loved the minimalist soundtrack it was wellacted and the script was well written at least to my admittedly weak french best of all it still works as a horror film on the small screen without needing the surround sound to boo at you that being said this is not a for everyone lionsgate horror mcnugget if you are used to the scary crap that hollywood churns out i cant recommend this because you might be scarred for life this is a film for real fans of extreme cinema everyone else will just wonder why anyone would ever want to watch this crap also it isnt funscary with those bouncy jumps everyone likes so much it disturbs on a deeper level definitely not a halloween movie marathon party movie indeed ive never shown it in any of my screeningsnow some people think the wheels come off as soon as you know whats going on that is the reason for the title of the review many of the bad reviews are coming from people who dont buy the twist which is understandable my recommendation even if you dont buy the twist roll with it is saying something important about how dangerous people are when they are driven by religious conviction without falling into the christian vs skeptic trap that so many american films land themselves in that alone makes it worth the watchif you can stomach it,cruel
if the object of this movie was to leave me feeling utter rage and anger then it succeeded but dont take that as the start of a bad review this is an excellent movie which grabs you right from the start shakes you around and never lets go until the closing credits and even then you are feeling revulsion from what you have just witnessed but also guilt from actually admiring the standard of the film making the opening scene of a young girl obviously fleeing from some unspeakable experience sets the scene perfectly for what is about to come the plot is actually a simple one  abused and tortured girl lucie seeks revenge on her abusers with the help of the one girl anna who could connect with her in the hospital both were admitted to with most of the movie concentrated 15 years after the opening scene but dont go thinking this is just another revenge movie  it isnt there are more twists and turns than youll find at a rollercoaster in a theme park and the intensity builds and builds until you dont think you can take any more but then comes the final 25 minutes when anna the main character is subjected to inhuman abuse which is a relentless assault on your senses and i almost found myself wanting the movie to end to stop her suffering finding out just why she had to suffer such inhuman abuse made my blood boil and i had to keep reminding myself that this was just a movie the very last scene had me full of so many emotions  anger pity grief sadness and ultimately relief that her suffering would soon be over this is a movie that will stay with me for a long time some may compare it to hostel but it is nothing of the kind this is an intelligently made movie but also the fact that the victims werent tortured for some perverted pleasure but for another almost worse objective makes this far more disturbing watch this if you want to see a good movie but dont expect to feel good about yourself afterwards right im off for a shower to clean this feeling off me,cruel
i see people rating this movie with 1 and 2 stars you need to make one crappy film to get 1 or 2 starspeople need to rate the movie based on the genre of the film people write things like tortureporn rears it ugly head again well duh what were you expecting bambi you people are total monkeys the film has great effects a killer plot with 180 twist excellent acting and directing even if you hate gory horror suspenseful thrillers you have to give the movie at least a 7 it is absolutely gripping with no dull dragging momentsmovies like twilight get better ratings than 1 or 2 i think i gave the last one a 3if you were fired from the film dont rate it because you hate the director or producerif you dont like horror dont watch horror movies and certainly dont rate them or write reviews really can you be any more moronic i like movies of any genre if it is wellmade with solid acting and directing i rate it accordingly i like dramas romance comedies action flicks fantasy and comedy i like horror that has plot without senseless killing by an unstoppable slow movie bad guy like jason that is just silly and along comes a film like thisthis is honestly one of the greatest films ever made period horror or other genre this is a mustsee an absolute mindblowing masterpieceignore reviews by people that give this a 1 star and movies like rec3  genesis 7 stars are you kidding me what a bunch of clowns,cruel
is a masterpiece no lets clear the air right awaybut it is intriguing it starts off in something of a hurry and quells down in its latter half to a much slower pace however given that the theme of the second half of the movie is that of monotonous slow unbearable pain the film made a wise style choice to parallel it by the viewing experience at that stage you shouldnt feel bored but you will notice the formulaic filming of this half its slowness and its unbearablenessis it really so unbearable though that depends on how you watch your films if you keep an active mind about you if you let yourself become immersed in the pain then it will have an effect on you  one itself close to sickness but if you watch your films from a distance in that curious selfnumbing way the average horrorgoer seems to take in his films then you might be disappointed there are no scenes here that are designed to make you shout and talk about how fed up it is no superfluous show of violence for the sake of violenceif you consider yourself an intellectual or enjoy movies with deep plot lines then you will undoubtedly be disappointed precisely because this film  in the latter half anyway  tries to turn itself on its heels and pull off something profound when time comes to reveal what really is so profound we find ourselves watching a confession being told candidly by the film itself that it had no idea how to wrap up that it really did not contain that bit of profundity it boasted only a half hour earlier that indeed it did have we watch whatever it is that is so profound as a whisper one character telling another character everything we have been waiting to hear and the entire dialogue is muted never to be told to usif you can get past this last aspect of you might still find a good little horror movie wrapped up inside i would be inclined to give this a 7 out of 10 a rather high rating for horrors in general if it were not for this anticlimactic ending that was a mistake that should have been avoided especially if the movie itself knew it had nothing to offer and decided anyway to pretend like it did for that reason i give it 6 of 10not perfect not wholly disappointing a movie for one of those boring nights or gettogethers where all parties do not have great expectations,cruel
a film that starts out as a revenge thriller soon turns into something very much darker its well made though with some nice touches particularly i found with the use of musicnow some have dismissed this film as torture porn but i felt it was much better than that yes there are scenes of torture both physical and psychological and dont think for one minute i condone this behaviour but an explanation is given for it and this is all brought together nicely by the rather interesting ending i feel its a film that will stay with me for some time the plot does seem to be two stories patched together using the character of lucie as the link and yes there are problems with that however i did find the film quite compelling although there is an awful lot of gore and some extreme violence on screen for those that can take it then i can definitely recommend this one otherwise give it a wide berthmy score 6710imdb score 7010 based on 25123 votes at the time of going to pressmetascore no data based on 0 critic reviews provided by metacriticcom at the time of going to pressrotten tomatoes tomatometer score 52100 based on 27 reviews counted at the time of going to pressrotten tomatoes audience score 70100 liked it based on 9443 user ratings counted at the time of going to pressyou can find an expanded version of this review on my blog thoughts of a steelmonster,cruel
ive always liked disturbingoddweird and unsettling films but the kind that get into your mind due to moving something inside yourather than just slicing people up this is the filmthat so far has got inside my brain the deepestit is quite clear that things are going to go very bad after the first scene is over how bad they go though im not gonna give a lot of detailsbut i will only say that what got me from this movie is the the sensation that even if most people committing horrible deeds out there have mental issues or are plain evil some may actually have a higher belief and seek something honestly that is even more frightening to methe violent scenes arent as uncomfortable to watch as the hopelessness and fanaticism from one side and the otherthe ending still confuses me do watch with nothing in mindbut dont expect this to be pretty,cruel
is definitely one of the best movies ever made not just in the horror genre but in the whole movie industry the movie is packed with superb acting meaning and ruthless and bloody entertainmentin the first half of we are shown a disturbing bloody view into what lives for anna and lucie are like lucie escapes from the hostile environment she had been kept in and tortured and in later years she decides to take revenge against her captors this is like your typical horror at first packed with gore and disturbing violence and seems to keep the story at a steady pacethen we come into the second half and the tone and plot change completely we are introduced to meaning which is something no horror has ever done and mental torture rather than physical everything in the second half is a new and exciting look at what horror movies need to do to grab the viewers fear its brilliantis a very unique piece of art a horror movie that isnt ignorant and obnoxious like other modern horrors the acting is superb ive never seen actors having to cry scream so much the plot is brilliant as it changes direction and the meaning of this movie is something every single human being will relate to1010,cruel
french horror at its bestwill keep you guessing and glued to the screen if you enjoy switchblade romance and how could you not you will love this horror should be horrific and certainly delivers on that front the casting is also brilliant in particular the use of trained dancers it is a shame the promoposters and the box cover look so bland and try to make the girls look like typical pretty victimswhich they are not everyone i have recommended this film to loved it so give it a watch you will not be disappointed french horror really is some of the best in the world they grab their subject matter by the spinal cord and pull it out never backing away from that which must be shown to gain full effect,cruel
well there are very few movies where you want the end credits to roll as soon as they can not because the movies bad but because of the eerie feeling you get when it starts getting under your skin is one of them it will twist your mind numb your senses and flay your skin as it does to the main protagonist of the movie some scenes are so mind screwing that you wont be able to take it the climax was one of the best ive ever seen its a mind trip that should not be missed kudos to the director for making such a complicated film with equally complicated premises will be remembered for decades to come you have to witness this or youll always keep doubting,cruel
ive been a true horror movie fan for over 30 years i still remember the day i sat down to watch the texas chainsaw massacre with my younger brother and felt my legs shake at the sight of leatherface slamming a metal door of course i was only 10 years old but it was the first time a movie had left a lasting impression on memy favorite movies tend to leave me feeling drained as if i had just experienced a traumatic event we all want to feel something whether its good or bad for me its the later i want to feel sad i want to feel disturbed is there something wrong with me nahrequiem for a dream is another film that sat with me for days the elephant man is another these films are not classified as horror but they effectively display human suffering in a way that few films have is of the same tattered clothim not going to bore you with a plot summary theres no need in fact the less you know the better i will say this though the story is unique and the message it conveys is deeply profoundits true the graphic violence and subject matter will offend many viewers but dont we all need a swift kick in the rear every now and then seriously folks if your idea of horror is twilight then avoid this like you would a portapotty at a biker rally this one aint for you however if you want to see a landmark film one that transcends far beyond the rubbish hollywood produces these days then this is a must 10 out of 10horror fans rejoice,cruel
 910 this is the only film i have ever seen that has left me feeling weak and a bit sick i remember everyone on here talking about it when it first came out i downloaded a dodgy version of it and when the download was complete i skipped forward halfway through the film to catch a random scene to see if i had downloaded the right thingi cant remember which bit i caught but whatever it was it put me off watching it on my own which means it must have been really bad as i generally will watch anything alone or with friends so this downloaded film sat on my pc for ages there was no way my gf was going to watch it with me either i finally found a good time to watch it no subtitles so i found a blueray copy in one of those trade in stores over christmas and sat down to watch it the other day i knew from peoples comments on here that it was going to be a rough ride and was almost guaranteed to disturb mewell all i can say is whatever short scene i saw that put me off watching it for years was deemed completely justifiable to say it packs a punch would be a massive understatement the director tries his hardest to make you feel uneasy you never know what is coming next just when you think youve figured it out another twist comes along and completely unsettles you this really isnt a film to can relax and watchive seen so many horror films but none like this the film primarily has two acts the first focuses on the highly disturbed and abused girl named lucie who escaped torture when she was young but is still haunted by a demon it becomes apparent that this demon is merely a figment of her imagination long before it is fully revealed to the viewer so the film lures you into the false sense of security that youve figured the ending outthe scene in which the character lucie thinks she has finally conquered her demon but is also betrayed by her friend and lover anna is the standout scene from the first act even though as the viewer you had known that the demon was in her head you are not prepared for the brutal demise of the first acts main character chillingwhat follows i thought was a wind down towards the ending anna discovers that the demon in lucies head was actually real and she had been wrong in thinking she was crazy for all these years i was expecting the credits to appear at any moments but what actually followed was the most incredible shocking piece of cinema ive ever seenthe second act focuses on the boundaries of human suffering it is clear that anna isnt just being randomly abused instead she is undergoing a much more calculated procedure with a specific intended outcome why am i watching this young girl being maliciously tortured there better be a point to this is the general thought that any viewer would be going through at this stagethe final scenes which include a very beautiful piece of cinematography contain a mixture of brutality gore pain violence and tenderness it all mixes together perfectly and produces something that ive never seen in a film before a very ambiguous ending that leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks with their interpretation of the events they have just been a martyr too laugier tries his very hardest to make you feel awkward and squeamish throughout this final act and he does the job perfectlyoverall this film is absolutely stunning in many ways but i dont think i could ever sit through it again which bewilders me i actually rate this film very highly but could never say it was enjoyable,cruel
where the hell do i start with this film well someone lent me a copy a couple of years ago recently i bought my own copy which is still unopened the reason for this is that although is a musthave film for any decent collection it is incredibly hard to watch hence my reluctance to sit through it again and my reluctance comes purely from my inability to stomach the absolute inhumanity and level of violence within this has been compared many films in the hostel ilk but trust me this has the barest of connections to those films this raises the game to near perfection and although i find this deeply unsettling to watch i cannot deny the artistry involved well shot and perfectly acted with a storyline unknown until the very end and that part reaches the pinnacle of monstrosity within this film i dont know if this can be classed as horror im thinking that may well have created its own genre an absolute mustsee film and certainly one of a kind,cruel
this is the best horror film ive seen since inside coincidentally theyre both french which proves my now longstanding point that the french have handily surpassed hollywood and are even eclipsing asia in making effective and shocking horror films frontiers them calvaire sheitan and everything but the ending of high tension have all been infinitely better than most other offerings from around the world id even put irreversible in there can you think of one horror film made in america that truly shocked you that wasnt a remake or adaptation the only truly great american horror film from last year was midnight meat train and that was buried immediately upon release that shows you just how much studio executives care about giving you good horror nowadays americans have a choice between the latest saw rehash and a god awful asian horror remake dont get me wrong i love hollywood as much as the next knucklehead but they are clearly giving up on trumpeting original andor daring horror films that brings me to i can understand why some probably most people who see this film will predictably lump it in with torture porngorno flicks with a dismissive meh their entitled to their opinion wrong as it is nonetheless what does is force you to endure 90odd minutes of sheer brutality in order to hammer home a philosophical point now some might scoff at that notion but i was so knocked back by the effectiveness of this point that i couldnt believe that i saw what i just saw ive heard theres a deal already in the works for an american remake theres no way on earth that this film could ever exist in hollywood and you owe it to yourself to see this jawdropping sucker punch of a shocker if the last line of dialogue doesnt smack you right in the face then youre not someone id want to hang out with,cruel
i would like to start out by saying that ive seen a lot of extreme horror movies but this is the only one ive ever seen which has ever had any real effect on me i finished watching this movie around 25 minutes ago and sat glued to the chair for about 10 minutes after the credits had finished rolling i then needed another 15 minutes to compose myself and think of anything sensible to write about it this movie really packs a punchfrom the first second to the last you are taken on a wild adventure which to begin with seems to make very little sense this changes about half way through as the story is further developed and this is where you begin to feel the effect which i discussed at the beginning of this review the sense of helplessness knowing that this will not end well for anna makes me want to hate this movie but i cant i feel as though this is a movie which i will never forget and isnt that what a movie should do the amazing cinematography the amazing acting everything about this film makes it stand out for me and the kick in the face which this movie delivers at the end makes it one of the best ive ever seen,cruel
really a brilliantly disturbing movie after watching this movie i am feeling depressed some word about it1 watch it once because it worth itafter watching you will never wish to watch it againi bet2 depressing and not scary nothing is horrible here3 martyrdom is truth and new way is described in movie4 loved the climaxlife after death is reality5 brutally presented movie not for everyoneeven 18acting is really appreciable i think it is the unique type of movie during the movie i wished to close itbut i couldnt it is not a master piece but it is not less than that,cruel
wow so im going to throw it out there straight away i did not finish this movie yet i feel like i just saw an amazing movie pow we open on a scene of a young girl terrified she is running the camera work is subtle yet excellent there is something happening here have i found the holy grail the divine perfect proportion between disturbing and beautiful disgusting yet interestingi continue to watch my mind is telling me that there is something important to be said here it flashes to a moment in time where things have past yet still exist filmmakers spend more time here next timemy next memory of this film reminds me of kill bill a sudden instantaneous shot of someone bursting through a door the protagonist  has a shotgun she is shooting people there is no respite here it is blood thirsty and the gore is plentifulthis is where the movie ends for me i continued to watch for another half hour and frankly it upset me yet did not make me question anything why oh why did they not leave this as a short film instead it turns into your general torture porn the two main actresses sublime not to mention the simply brilliant performance of the young lucie the direction worth seeing the movie watch it but please turn it off when you become bored,cruel
starts as an abused girl named lucie is taken into an orphanage in france where she befriends another girl named anna despite the horrors that she has suffered throughout her short life jump forward fifteen years later  in a secluded house the french countryside a family are enjoying breakfast when they hear a knock at the door the father robert toupin answers  is faced with lucie mylne jampano who promptly shoots him with a shotgun  then continues the slaughter the rest of the family before calling her friend anna morjana alaoui  claiming that the family were the ones who tortured her when she was a young girl all those years ago anna drives to the house  finds lucie  the bodies  decides to try to help her friend but there appears to be someone else in the house a dirty naked woman who attacks lucie  while anna didnt believe lucie at first the horrors that she discovers there soon change her mind as she becomes the next victim  a sick  sadistic greater planthis french  canadian coproduction was written  directed by pascal laugier  while theres been a recent spate of french horror that has been well received with the likes of high tension 2003 them 2006  frontiers 2007 although personally i am not a huge fan of any of them so wasnt expecting a great deal from but i have to say its definitely both the best french horror film ive seen  one of the best films ive seen in a while the script is as relentless  brutal as anything i have seen in recently with one nasty endurance testing sequence after another all knitted together with a truly compelling  to me fascinating script that throws in twist after twist as the story goes in all sorts of different directions the opening twenty minutes is fantastic with a seemingly normal family blown away by lucie in a real attention grabbing scene before the twists  turns kick in with hallucinations filthy tortured chained up women  secret evil organisations takes itself extremely seriously  theres no let up in the grimness or brutality of the events happening forget about any humour or uplifting sentiment or feel good moments because there arent any theres a real relentless ferocity to all the violence  gore is extreme with some really unpleasant moments to cherish along with the plot that really does move along like a rocket with constant twists  turns that take you deeper into the torture  sadism on show everything that happens has meaning  a purpose i suppose but having said that the twenty odd minute almost silent torture of anna at the end maybe lasts a little too long but it certainly has impact  leaves an impression before yet another nasty sequence in which anna is skinned while still alive is not for the squeamish or faint of heart its a tough watch  not all the answers are spoon fed to the audience we never find out who are behind all this or who they work for  the purpose of the martyr experiments are rather vague but if your prepared for an intense 90 minutes of brutal horror  torture that features a clever  original script then is highly recommendeddealing with the issues of faith  suffering  psychological torture the final revelation  twist is a little unsatisfying did that woman really accept the dying words of a badly tortured  skinned person as fact i wouldnt want to put so much faith in her dying testimony as to kill myself you know what i mean anyway is still a pretty powerful film with some nasty imagery some surprising twists  a film most people wont forget in a hurry as mentioned doesnt disappoint when it comes to the gore available in both r rated  unrated versions in the us i am basing my review on the unrated cut theres plenty of blood splatter nasty slit throats pins being pulled out of skin someone slicing the skin of their own arm someone slicing their arms with a straight razor various brutalized torture victims covered in bruises  scars someone is seen skinned in a very icky scene people are gorily shot  sliced open  stabbed in one of the goriest  brutal films ive seen in quite a whileapparently filmed in qubec in canada this is well made  looks very slick i am not sure about the james bond style underground lair but i suppose it could happen i am not sure who produced the subtitles but on the version i saw there were some really bad spelling  grammatical errors couldnt they have been checked by someone with a decent grasp of the english language the acting is good from the cast some of whom were really put through itis one of the best films ive seen in a while its relentlessly brutal  goes against expectation with some strange twists in a ferocious script that has no mercy for its characters or its audience dont be put off by the subtitles find the uncut version  watch it now for an unforgettable experience a hollywood remake is listed on the imdb as currently being in production but i cant see it being anywhere near as good as this the original,cruel
first off is one of these rare horror movies which truly do inspire horror and disgust as opposed to most horror movies ive seen which mainly provide cheap scares and funny goremany reviews here seem to complain calling horror porn and the reviewers are so annoyed about it that they unfairly rate it 110 reflecting in my opinion their initial distaste although very objectively the movie is well filmed and fairly entertaining hence i cant understand how one can mercilessly degrade it to a mere 110 give it a damn 3 or 4 if you dislike it dont make it some talentless borefest which its obviously notis indeed a sadistic movie the likes of hostel plotwise but much much more unsettling and with a less commercial pace where i feel the bad reviews are unfair is that they blame a simplistic plot which supposedly puts the entire horror genre to shame i personally fail to see how horror classics like halloween or even alien which incidentally is my favorite movie have a stronger plot horror classics are in general extremely simple often focusing on one antagonist whose origins are hardly explained who massacres people easily and predictablyisnt that simple and can be divided into two acts the first 50 minutes can be considered quite canonical for a 2000s horror film action mystery and scary creature although the initial massacre at the beginning comes to quite a surprise and is thus pleasantly original the second act is the most disturbing and controversial and what makes the movie the monster that it is i understand why some may dislike it and im not trying to be condescending i guess its the kind of movie you either like or hate i wouldnt consider it to be exploitation and think the plot is very solid and well thoughtmy main criticism is the acting as a native french speaker i thought the casual conversations in the first half of the movie were appalling the main female actresses are good at screaming and looking terrified but their casual acting sounds so fake that its painful same for all the actors in the first half of the movie including the happy family talking like theyre in a commercial im not going to spoil anything but another criticism is the very ending which i thought was kind of cheap and disappointing although the intention was greateranyway if youre looking to watch a seriously disturbing horror film the likes which certainly wont liven up a movienight with friends is what you need to watch and you wont forget it it will stay as a reference in how gruesome a movie can get whether you like it or not,cruel
howdy its me you old pal pinhead you know i like a good torture as much as the next guy greetings to jigsaw but this picture really knocked me off my feet i suppose that folks that thought the saw series or coffin joe or borderland or my own appearances in hellraiser was for pussies will enjoy this piece a lot all others should think twice before watching you are not going to forget it anytime soon apart from the movies subject matter there is a lot more to say about the movie it is well directed well lit and photographed set set design is good as is the acting it has a lot of twists and turns and surprises really the region b bluray disc presentation is great hang in there girls i for one am signing off now i gotta continue puking in the recycle bin rot in peace pinhead,cruel
yes you might think im crazy but im most definitely not i watched the film and laughed at the end i felt somewhat mocked from the start the movie was building something something like a gruesome revenge story but ended with something totally different i liked and disliked it at the same time i guess you cant be onesided about this movie as far as it goes its not something very unusual to me because ive seen way too much to be easily shocked i guess there was only one scene that made me nervous and uncomfortable the movie isnt bad but not something special either if not for the well done gruesome scenes it wouldnt be that good the ending was too boring for me i just skipped the dvd then came back to that part later and realized that i pretty much didnt miss anything the ending was funny as hell  i was pleasantly surprised and took it for a dark prank joke left me with a lot of unanswered questions too the story of the two girls is pretty much clear but later the movie just skips some explaining and leaves an empty gap to your own interpretations id rate it 710 just for gruesome scenes and good acting,cruel
i wasnt really expecting much when i began to watch this movie i knew there were torture scenes in it but being a huge horror fan i didnt expect this to affect me i was very wrongthis is the type of movie that you see once for its artistic merit then never again this must be the only movie to ever affect me and even when i think about it i shudder despite having torture scenes like any other horror movie the message i got from this movie was of antitorture the whole point of the movie was to show how devastating torture is in real life and not just in a movie that uses it for the sake of violence it is a very emotional movie thatll catch you off guardif youre a very sensitive person you probably shouldnt watch this but if you arent and are able to discern between reality and fiction then go ahead and watch it its a good movie and its entertaining but still very horrifying,cruel
i have to confess after reading the reviews here i was looking forward to seeing this and being taken somewhere i havent been before my overall satisfaction is partial i love my exploitation cinema but i go real sour real quick when that cinema tries to masquerade as art im not accusing laugier of doing this deliberately but it certainly seems to be interpreted that way by the bulk of the reviewers here which is unfortunate the greatest enemy of this kind of film is high production standards it loses punch by being impeccably made and why vintage italian and japanese exploitation will always have a far longer shelf life these movies need to look and feel cheap  the viewer needs to feel soiled to feel a sense of guilt that this is not the type of flick they want to be caught watching these flicks pay off when they are more like those in coin operated pornography booths  viewed in cinemas that reek of detergent and have sticky carpets this is why movies like hostel and saw fail nasty and cheap are like bread and butter the hollywood gloss ruins everythingas noted already this is largely a film in two parts this first is superb crapyourpants terrifying and masterfully executed the second is more in the realm of true horror  it doesnt rely on jolting you out of your seat but more on the slow burn revulsion of the type perfected by damato in buio omega and craven in last house of the left and it does reach those heights my major gripes scriptwise are why did the girls hang around at the scene of such an excessively violent crime why was the wife digging around in a hole of industrial plumbing only to find a mouse why was it more important to dump the corpses into that hole rather than do something about all of the more obvious evidence these are minor issues though  these types of films never place high priority on logic or consistency theyre not citizen kane and their target audience is different but the biggest gripe of all is the conclusion  a total anticlimax like they ran out of film ideas or both very disappointingoverall it is a well made film but it is not what i would call a keeper i very much doubt i will ever go to the trouble of seeing it again unlike the damato and craven flicks but it is very definitely worth seeing once i am of the growing opinion that video killed the video nasty  the real cheap nasty and unapologetic grit with no redeeming features or convoluted justifications just simply is no longer made outside of the occasional japanese contribution which is sad i miss 70s and 80s gutter cinema hollywood has a lot to answer for,cruel
a sign of the fuked up time we live in with psychopaths pulling the strings and sheeple too stupid to hear the music yet for all their wealth and power they are ultimately pathetic twisted creatures unable to seek and accept life in all her beauty truly it must be that growing our own heirloom food building whatever we require in fablabs and sustaining independently worthy societies respecting life and death may bring us to an interesting shore yes the actors director and dp brought a polished film into existence it is art and it does hold a mirror to our own depravity zizek would you view this as an example of our systemic malaise,cruel
the french they know how to make a good movie that will disturb people in many ways either it will be good or bad let me start off by saying this is one film that will shock people hopefully in a entertaining waythe movie starts of fast and brutal and never really lets up the story revolves around 2 girls who are looking for the people that tortured and abused one of them when she was young i dont wanna say anything else about the story just in case i might ruin it for some people the acting was good morjana alaoui and mylne jampano did a great job as the 2 friends everyone else in the movie were kinda just a set piece in this wonderful movie but they acted well enoughthe killings and gore in the movie was good it will probably shock and disturb some people but thats to be expected i might have cringed during some parts but it takes more then this to shockdisturb me the french have a great understanding of how to make a good thrillerhorror frontier and high tension just to name a few hollywood should take note on this and stop bringing out crap like insert one of many bad thrillerhorror movies from hollywood heregood acting good script good directing good movie 810,cruel
is another french film that is one of the most effective and incredible films i have ever seen its a rare thing now to get a horror film that truly shocks you but is one of these rarities a film that you cant unsee and possibly one you wouldnt want to either now it would be easy to dismiss as tortureporn like hostel but is so much deeper than that the explicit and hugely upsetting torture sequences serve a very fine purpose to the mindboggling narrative and carefully constructed characters you could also dismiss as being exploitative using gore for gores sake however uses some of the most cringeinducing gore ive ever seen which dares you not to look away never has violence looked more nasty or pointless you could even say that its a comment on how films glamorise violence shows violence for what it really iswhat makes so extraordinary is its unpredictability and the way it plays on your expectations in a similar way to the cabin in the woods only not humorous in the slightest the film changes direction at least four times and two of these occasions are in the opening 10 minutes the first time i saw i was in shock at the first plot twist as it delivers the nasty surprise thick and fast like a michael haneke film it defies all conventions without ever feeling schizophrenic in tone even though has so many plot twists it never feels messy and its always focused on true narrative its trying to express ive seen the film about six times now and it still manages to hit me hard with its visceral shocksanother great thing about is its characters the main protagonists feature on the front cover both of them have a touching relationship as we see them through childhood one of them lucie is terribly haunted and a really tragic character who i felt immeasurably sympathetic towards her friend is also almost like her carer who looks after lucie and also probably has feelings for her too theyre both very deep characters who we can care for also features a memorable villain whos not in for long but offers a lasting and chilling presence almost like hannibal lecter in the silence of the lambs however i dont want to spoil too much because that would be such a shamethe turning point for people will be just over halfway when takes a seriously surprising and gutpunching turn that no one could see coming theres a really heartwrenching scene when anna makes a discovery which should be strictly kept under wraps this scene is one of the hardest scenes to watch in the film and is outrageously disturbing i always say that films become masterpieces when they turn into more of an experience such as black swan but transcends from being an experience to being a challenge its a real challenge to make it through the final half hour of as things only become more disturbingthe final half hour will be the decider about whether you liked or not you can say what you like about the last half hour but whatever you say it will be the thing that you remember the most about it i shall not spoil it but its one of the saddest moments actually no it is the saddest moment ive seen on film every time i see it i almost cry which is something i dont do on many occasions it packs such a huge emotional punch and also has this chillsinducing music that escalates your feelings every time i see it i just want to collapse into a ball and weep an ocean of tears but im yet to try that it really is what takes from being already one of the best horror films ever to being legendary if you feel no emotion in this final third then youre either a robot or a psychopathi can understand why people hate these final moments because i remember when i saw it a second time i thought that it would be much better to have a frontierstype finale however then i realised that this is what pascal laugier would want us to have and is probably what other filmmakers would give us its these final moments that are the biggest shock of the film and also are very relevant to the narrative as it allows us to go deeper into the characters suddenly the mystery is revealed and its a chilling one turns unbelievably deep and philosophical which will make you provoke more thought than you could imagine the ending will make your jaw drop as its a lot to take in you could even say that the film takes another surprising turn the final two shots are just the final nails in the coffin of your psyche theyre the last visceral shocks and the last shot is sure to haunt your dreamsso its easy to call tortureporn but it seriously is anything but since when has tortureporn made you think or feel as much emotion as does its hugely depressing and leaves such an emotional impact the directing alone makes more than just an exploitation film hes created a moving masterpiece its not easy to watch but the payoff is immense is possibly the boldest and most powerful films ive ever seen its truly unforgettable and i could write a list of superlatives like i did with the dark knight but not one of them would justify just how mesmerising this film is its a true horror masterpiece is a difficult film to recommend because its the opposite end of entertainment but the payoff is truly unlike any other witness it for yourself its one of the best horror films ever made maybe even the best,cruel
what a breath of  different airthis film started on a tortureporn footing more gorebrutality but quickly changed gears i wont tell you how many gears but before the end your pushing the frontiers of human experiencei was heavily reminded of the infamous human tolerance experiments of mengeles but with a completely different aim and scopethis film is a twist upon a twist upon a twist horror fans will love it but be prepared for something more surreal and awe inspiring it is not hellraiser or hostel like in the leastwatch this film for its own merit it is a bloody wonderfrench horror is becoming exactly what we were missing from american blah blah blah horror not to mention the swedes with theyre classic let the right one in the us has a lot to learn from the europeans when it comes to gore  suspense yes they can coexist eli,cruel
i am not easily shocked ive seen a good deal of horror movies ranging from psychological horror to slasher to torture porn often i watch movies which are reviewed as disturbing but seldomly do they really disturb me well did totallygets often compared with movies like saw and hostel but i would say that this is wrong ok they do have certain things in common people get tortured the difference is although some people might not agree with me that movies like saw and hostel are made for amusement they are like that heavy rollercoaster ride which how gruesome it may be you still somewhat enjoyis far from enjoyable its horror in a much more pure form it bites you in the neck with cruel sharp teeth drags you in and its not going to be a fun ride someone mentioned that this is stuff nightmares are made from i very much agree what makes so different is that it feels so very real the movie starts out as what looks like is going to be a pure revenge movie young girl lucie escapes something horrible and though you dont know what exactly happened it is clear that she is traumatized for life 15 years later she is back for revenge her best friend anna backs her up even though she has her doubts about whats true and whats not so far so reasonably typical horrormovie plot though it is all already pretty intense and focused on the emotional pain lucie is suffering aside from that nothing is really new there but then halfway the movie everything changes anna is about to find out what actually happened to lucie and its not really the storyline that is so original its more the way how it is brought to usmayor spoilers comingthe torture scenes are truly gut wrenching the torturers dont make use of all kinds of instruments its kept much more simple but that for sure doesnt make it less gruesome over and over again we see our protagonist get beaten up force fed her hair cut off humiliated beaten up again and again it seems like its going on for ever its heart breaking to say the least and all this time you hope for a miracle to happen for her to stand sane and to escape but that miracle stays far away its just not happening and just when you think that nothing can be more cruel she enters the final stage which is so incredibly horrible that your earlier gut wrench seems like an almost pleasurable memory end of spoilersi will not say what happens at the end what happens with anna and when we get to see who are behind the experiment and why but to me it made this movie so much more then just torture porn it lifts it above movies like hostel and gives you something to think about and it makes sure that this movie will haunt you even further this movie itself is at times pure torture to watch but it is also in a strange way beautiful in all its deep tragic sadness its almost darkly poetic i would say i was really asking myself why i kept on watching but i just had to and thankfully the plot makes up for the difficulties i had while sitting through the movies second part all in all i was very much impressed by its not a movie that i would recommend to many if you want to have a pleasurable night with your new girlfriend or boyfriend on the couch with some popcorn and you hope that after the movie shehe will be in the mood forget about that but if you are in for an impressive gut wrenching but also still beautiful total nightmare then you have a true dark gem of a film,cruel
6282010is the final film in my reviews of the new french horror wave all four of these films were extremely thoughtful and well made nothing exemplifies this more than this film could be accurately described as art house existential horror written and directed by pascual laugier his film goes the distance when it comes to creativity and graphic brutality dealing mostly with the psychological effects of torture and what lies beyond human sufferingthe film opens with a disheveled young girl running from a warehouse this is lucie she has endured quite a lot while being held captive by a group of unknown people she is sent to an orphanage and obviously has some severe psychological and physical trauma she eventually becomes friends with anna a girl her age the film flash forwards 15 years to your basic family of four having breakfast and conversation when there is a knock at the door the father goes to answer it and finds and hooded stranger with a shotgun this person coldly and brutally massacres the whole family the stranger is lucie she feels that the parents of this family were responsible for the torture she endured as a child she calls anna who comes right over to deal with the mess anna has always taken care of and felt sorry for what happen to lucie and little by little has gotten in over her head in helping her lucie has been fighting her inner demons for years and this get kind of confusing as laugier actually creates a woman like creature that continues to attack her upon first viewing its hard to tell what the hell to make of her despite annas efforts lucie commits suicide anna further investigates the house and finds a hidden passage way to an underground facility that is the headquarters to a secret society whose mission it is to contact the other side to find out what lies beyond death certain people mainly young women are chosen to be these people are systematically tortured and psychologically broken till they reach a certain point where they transcend the pain and suffering to enter into a new consciousnessanna is captured whiles snooping around the place and is subjected to the same torture that lucie endured after anna has been broken it is time for the next stage are you ready for this she is taken into another room and skinned alive except for her face she doesnt scream or seem to feel any pain she has transcended she survives this procedure and whispers into the ear of the older women who seems to head this society the madam calls a meeting to share the news of what she has heard if you want to know the rest watch the movie suckathis film definitely transcends your basic horror movie and goes places we have rarely been this secret society is composed of rich elderly white people i guess they want to know what to expect sadly there is an american remake in the works and no matter what they do it could never come close to matching the stunning effect of this film,cruel
is a remarkable horror film that goes beyond the standard fare the film is clearly structured with 3 parts the prologue tells of a girl lucie in her early teens beaten and bloody who escapes from some hospital she is taken into a care facility and is befriended by anna who takes care of her but lucie also suffers from nightmares and is haunted by creatures the second part takes us several years later to a regular and seemingly innocent family who is having sunday breakfast all members of the family parents and 2 kids are suddenly and mercilessly shot the killer is lucie who tells anna that the dead ones are those who are responsible lucie continues to be haunted by some creature a naked bloody woman she terrorizes beats and cuts lucie but as anna soon discovers there is no creature it is lucie who hurts herself in a flashback we are told who this woman is she was another victim in the hospital one who lucie couldnt save when she escaped but lucie cant take it anymore and slits her throat anna then discovers a hidden passage in the familys house it leads to a hightech dungeon with posters of deaddying people there she discovers and rescues another naked woman wearing a chastity belt and a some skullcap nailed into her skull in the third and final part anna is made captive by the group behind the kidnaptorture scheme first an old woman discloses what this group is all about the posters in the hall are of those who despite extreme suffering found bliss their eyes reflect it they are alive yet their bodies are almost in decay they have transmuted pain and found something else the point of all the torture is to provoke that state beyond suffering and now its annas turn in a series if fadeinfadeouts we are see all that anna has to go through and its not pretty she is shackled shaved forcefed and most stunningly freed from the shackles only when its time to get brutally beaten in the final step she is skinned alive except for her nowunrecognizable face and then she reaches the next stage the group now claims success and in a meeting plans to reveal it all to the members but that revelation doesnt take place as the old woman shoots herself after hearing what anna has to sayit is not easy to critique a movie like because it is perfect the story the direction the cinematography the acting could not be better this movie will captivate you and you will either love it or hate it but you cannot remain indifferent it is that effective whether you love it or hate it will depend on whether you stay with the ugliness of what happens to the girls or are able to transcend that and find meaning as the movie itself guides you to it no doubt terrible things happen but this movie doesnt stop there it goes beyond the horror to the sublime is one of the best movies ever made,cruel
well to make it short this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made ive seen a lot from august underground to classics like white zombie this movie delivers really its shy on the gore but nevertheless more disturbing than everything ive seen for a long time to spoil would ruin the experience and yes thats what it is an experience so im going for the big picture this film is about love and death sounds familiar sounds simple well its not have you ever thought about your own death what it feels like and that you can read science books believe in god but you will never know for sure before its really happening to you have you ever wondered what the love of your life beside you really thinks has on hisher mind does he or she really loves you how can you be for sure when you cant feel the samethe first 30 minutes of the film hit the next 30 you just want it get over the last 30 tear you apart this movie is exceptional watch it with an open mind and it needs you to empathize with the girls thats how it works how it truly hurts but watch it its a philosophical ride through existentialism,cruel
did anyone notice the shoutout to dario argento at the end of the movie we realized that the movie is an extreme version of the giallo films from the 6070s which dario contributed to there were a couple of problems we had w the movie but it has certainly stuck w us today a lot of those italian giallo films were certainly graphic and sexual for the time a lot of them also were pretty strange but many of them had secret organizations with nefarious designs on pretty women sounds a lot like marytrs of course there are a lot of other filmsstyles the movie evokes  young peoplegirls being tortured has become a staple in horror  but this movie is certainly thought provoking while being disgustingly perverse at the same time gonna check out his other movies,cruel
i am just now watching this film for the second timei was reluctant to watch this as most films without a substantial time gap between viewings but this film is one at least for me that deserves at least a local second viewingthe first time i watched i was engrossed and horrified by the physical and psychological torture i didnt realize it at the time but i was numbed by the watchingin this second look i found myself crying and sympathizing with the characters and being reminded of the torture i have experienced in my own lifethis is an amazing film it is beyond boldi also have pity for the mind that spawned it but im glad that it was madea look at the highest rating demographic shows females under 18 thats a pity it shows it was mainly appreciated by the main characters age group which shows the film is under appreciated intellectually as gross as it is this is a very smart film and transcends the usual horror typeit is piece of work that transcends the genrewatch itmore than oncefor rape and abuse victims this will be tough,cruel
is a horrific movie being this movie is a horror movie that is actually a good thing its been a while since i have had such an unsettling time watching a horror movie never takes the easy way out this is as brutal and realistic as a horror movie gets the concept is pretty unique and even makes the viewer raise philosophical questionsthis is a movie that should be in every horror movie fans collection it is quite brutal some might even say the violence is unnecessary  the brutal violence never stops its recommended to stay away from this movie if you dislike seeing a lot of violence on the screen still as one defines the horror genre is definitely high on the list of being one of the most horrific horror movies ever made in that respect is a classic 1010,cruel
oh boy im gonna try to make this short and simplefirst off this is def in my top 5 of disturbing filmsand to say that it is disturbing is putting it lightlyi remember reading a review before i saw it where the person said the movie made them feel sadnow im a huge fan of disturbing and graphic stuff and it takes a lot to get me but wow this movie got me all kinds of sadi found myself feeling bad for even watching itand i never feel like that about moviesme and my bestie both felt sick after watching it and it wasnt a sick like from the gorewe just felt a sinking feeling from itanyways its a great movie from beginning to endno dull momentsfinal words to describedisturbingshockinggory,cruel
by far this is the most disturbing and brilliant plot ive ever seen on a horror movieat first i couldnt understand whats causing all this furious anger and sadistic behavior but the movies plot slowly develops by itselfi only can tell you if you have the guts to watch it to the end you will be thinking for days about youve seen on this movie and the possibility of all these things could be realive never seen anything like this and im a horror movie fan i like dark and twisted plots more than pointless blood with scary monsters or the typical killateenager move where you hear the classic phrase you get this way iwill get this other way then everybody dies is a movie that deserves respect maybe you will be as amazed with this movie like me maybe not but im sure you wont be indifferent look for it rent it grab your balls watch it alone with lights off your wont be disappointed,cruel
the vast majority of great horror movies these days come out of france not the us almost every horror movie that comes from the us is a remake now a days but the french still find a way to make amazing creative and fresh movies is easily one of the best horror movies of the past decade its a little bit of a workout though very hard to watch at some parts it is extremely violent but theres none of that mindless violence you see now a days where they just put in more violence then what is needed it gets sad at parts more in the second half thats why you feel drained after watching this movie its violent emotionally stressful and it works your mind to where you actually have to think a little bit when watching it one of the most refreshing aspects of the film is that theres a reason for the madness and torture its not just for no reason or because its a family of cannibals which you see all too often in films if youre looking for a great horror movie with a great story line and great acting you need to see this movie if youre one of those people that dont really care for a movie that you have to watch subtitles this should be your exception if theres a recent horror movie that every horror fan should see it would be this one,cruel
yes it is a gore movie but its not stephen kings horror novel that ran out of tricks and decided to gross you out so you wont complainthis movie got several themes the main one is hinted by the titleit is the most daring movie but the script justified the visual violenceim surprised yet pleased that this movie is a quebec canada movie most people think movies made in canada  quebec is too traditional to the point it is boring yet they conjure up this little flick that is quite a pleasant surpriseps this movie is at least 10 times more gore than peter jacksons lovely bones yet i didnt get the sickness or grotesque feeling i had after watching lovely bonesits a pity a great movie maker such as peterson got a tainted movie like that hope hell recover soon,cruel
i just saw this movie about 15 minutes ago and i am still in some sort of shock from it it is relentless atmospheric and unbelievably brutal the violence depicted in the movie is so realistic i am still stunned i saw what i actually saw there are movies a lot more bloody chaotic and visually disgusting than this but this is the first time i feel literally traumatized by a moviethe only thing i really feel i can comment on at this point is the performances of the actors in the film which is nothing short of incredible generally the acting was so convincing i felt more like i was watching a documentary than a work of fiction and to have this level of performance consistent throughout the horrendous events amazes me to no endalso i should mention makeup which is second to none and helps things seem incredibly authenticif you are willing to endure something that will most likely shock and disgust you to no end do not hesitate to see this movie rarely have i seen more impressive acting,cruel
just finished watching this and i must say i was impressed as with most horror movies i wouldnt say it is totally original but it was executed very well there are some genuinely scary parts in amongst the depravity and violence acting was very good and even though there is quite a bit of gore it is the violence and deprivation that makes its mark on the vieweri wonder what goes through the minds of the actors while making this kind of film it was as brilliant as it was disturbing to watchdespite very polar reviewslove or hate it is definitely not a film that you could recommend to just anyone,cruel
owing primarily to the contemporary hollywood paradigm any film which demonstrates a particularly large quantity of bloodshed is automatically branded with that most unsavoury of appellations torture porn pascal laugiers 2008 french horror film is no stranger to this label its brutality immediately motivating its critics to set it among the ranks of these films largely dismissed as tasteless tactless and tawdry satiations of modern audiences violent voyeurism opens on a young girl frantically fleeing a large apparently disused industrial complex her body is bruised and scarred her face swollen and beaten her clotheswhat little she is wearingstreaked with blood she looks around her seemingly as ignorant of what is going on as we are it is precisely this ignorance that much of effect relies so heavily upon the disarming feeling of insecurity and unease engendered by its unprecedented narrative progression the result of our utter confusion at the events unfolding before usmany have condemned the substantially graphic violence which populates as an indulgence in the aforementioned subgenre suggesting the violence and bloodshed therein to be employed simply in an effort to shock horrify and encourage a visceral reaction whilst it is inarguably valid that these scenes present gore and body horror in an astoundingly frank upfront and forthwith manner it is important to note that these are not the sources of the films horror are they scary certainly but as is a sudden noise in your ear to scare someone is a remarkably easy task but to truly terrify haunt harrow and horrify that is an achievement and one which manages with a disquieting regularity the images may be frightening especially to those of particularly weak stomachs but what remains in the mind is not the violence rather the ideas behind it the films themes are what commit it to memory and regularly return it to the forefront of ones attentions our extraordinary capability for cruelty as a race the desperate and despicable lengths to which we go in our search for answers for purpose and for meaning the effects of suffering upon the human psyche these are the concepts behind the carnage the meaning behind the mayhem what sets apart from and indeed above the socalled torture porn is that it is inherently about something rather than pandering to the bloodthirsty voyeurs who have made the saw and hostel franchises so commercially successful it inspires intelligent thought on the subjects of pain fear and horror itself it is said that true horror cinema transcends and by conclusion it is difficult not to be moved in a perplexing manner that such hideous violence can create something emotional and beautiful is almost contradictory and yet there is a thematic effulgence to the film a lingering sensation of elation and enlightenment achieved through this astonishing depravitymay employ body horror and bloody gore to elicit minor scares but the lasting harrowing effect the film purveys is down to the themes and ideas which back it up while torture porn is exactly what that phrase impliescheap and crass exploitation intended to create a reaction surface scares masking the vacuous nothing beneathis so much moreintelligent and interesting filmmaking intended to create thought emotion and achieve the feeling of transcendence which seems so rare in modern horror cinema,cruel
an extraordinary example of why the french are producing the most brutal yet thoughtful horror films of recent years on the surface a tale of revenge that could be categorized as torture porn but with much to ponder over afterwards that takes the film to another level of existential bleakness this is every bit as brutal and unrelenting as it needed to be every moment as captivating as horror should be its interesting to note that the director is going on to remake clive barkers hellraiser in my view the original film is a classic but lacking in directorial panache in a way that im convinced pascal laugier will prove he possesses when he tackles the remake a fantastic nocompromises voyage into the depths of human behaviour in the name of religious enlightenment this film makes us question the similarly inhuman behaviour of various religions throughout time which brings us to such a bleak point that anyone who recognizes their part in placing human compassion below pursuit of their religion should choose the exit that the mysterious mademoiselle chooses in ,cruel
this is definitely worth watchingill give a few bad points first firstly i wouldnt really agree with all of the plot twists that other reviewers found in the film if youve got half a brain youll spot them coming a mile off the plot overall was fairly ridiculous a load of rich crumblies looking for evidence of life after death through torture of young horny womenand unbelievable the actions of anna after lucie kills herselfi wasnt overwhelmed by the twist at the end eitherit was more of a cop out than anything elsethe good points are the acting is excellent as is the production and direction its a good looking great hellraiser type body suitand sounding film and moves along pretty well i wouldnt let the torture bits put anyone off watching this film it wasnt too graphic and i dont think the torture scenes were stretched out for the sake of it as other reviewers thinkit was just right in my opinionthe ending leaves it open so that anna could have whispered anything in the old bags ear however she actually did see something white light so theres a few options as to what the old dear was thinking of before she blew her head offi was wondering whether doubting was the perfect translation from the french languageif the ending had been a bit more solid it would have jumped to about an 8 out of 10 but it was far too vague to be satisfactory i expect hellraiser remake reboot will be in safe hands with this guy directing it should be good,cruel
the movie starts out like a good horror should a desperate girl in a creepy environment immediately i was hypnotized to the screen wanting to know what happened to her the horrors that occurred these 15 years before the rest of the story were something i didnt expect the cold cruel setting of the movie drifts on desperation and does a very good job while continuously uttering the question is this real or not the blood and gore are not flying around in a brutal yet funny way but more realistic in a way that creeps most people out to the point of looking away the cold setting of the kills and the psychotic acting really are the highlights here the acting is really incredible i felt the shivers on my back more than a couple of times during the play as the plot thickens more becomes clear only to be twisted again and again to make you really wanting to know what is or isnt real so im really sorry to say that the ending didnt really live up to the story we had seen earlier it ends in a rather quick almost parodylike way to leave me asking why like this,cruel

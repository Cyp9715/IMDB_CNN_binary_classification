youll need to inhale then exhale slowly and relax before plunging into the world of nick naylor aaron eckhart lobbyist and bag man for the tobacco industry the laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise ive ever had at the movies is far and away the best satire to come out of hollywood in years the last attempt i remember was wag the dog this film is far better at true satire its wit biting dogooders and dobadders alike it has been too long since satire and the politically incorrect sense of humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue if you dont laugh out loud your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the doctors of spin and the nursemaids of political correctnessyoung jason reitmans direction and screenplay are deft and light he is never heavyhanded or worse condescending as may have happened more than once in wag the dog based on a novel by christopher buckley the son of william f buckley the script is the star here the double triple and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a starstudded ensemble cast who clearly revel in great material and great lines every reviewer opines that this will be aaron eckharts breakout role with his dudleydoright face and that guy who always gets the girl on crack charm and glibness his nick naylor is the ultimate purveyor of the spin doctors prescription the means justify the endthe casting director should be congratulated in the same breath as the director rob lowe as the genius behind hollywood ego a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement is noteperfect in a small role with william h macy the vermont senator who takes on the tobacco industry maria bello a fellow merchant of death lobbyist and robert duvall the captain of this particular industry the cast is jawdropping and sublimely funny katie holmes pretomkat is gorgeous seductive and completely believable as the reporter who stops at nothing to get her storynick naylors relationship with his son is the lens which focuses nick on his own behavior even that relationship is not treated as a clich or completely reverently by the satirist who remains true to the last frame to the goal of letting the air out of our selfrighteousness it is a breath of fresh air i not only recommend it i intend to see it again,black_comedy
first of all sorry for the cheesy title i couldnt help myself second of all is in fact a darn good satire  one of the best ive seen since election aaron eckhart holds the picture together with a witty charismatic performance as a tobacco lobbyist the film is basically about his profession as he spins the news pitches a movie idea dodges a subpoena has an affair with a reporter katie holmes tries to spend time with his son cameron bright and has lunch with an alcohol lobbyist maria bello and a firearms rep david koechner  where they literally compare body counts the performances are excellent across the board from william h macys crusading senator to rob lowes smirking hollywood agent who struts around his office in a kimono even adam brody is enjoyable as lowes hyperactive assistant whose injoke with a coworker earned one of the biggest laughs of the moviethe majority of the credit however needs to go to firsttime feature director jason son of ivan reitman adapting from christopher buckleys novel reitman has fashioned an enormously clever script consistent and strong in character yet not forgetting to be incredibly funny the style is also perfect  brisk lighthearted with impeccable timing marred only by a tangental subplot including sam elliott that is sadly not very funny overall however the pace is fast enough where the laughs keep comingreitman also does the unthinkable he keeps the satire dark and funny to the very end while most comedies stray blindly into the sentimental thank you avoids unnecessary emotional tripe and  thankfully  avoids sermonizing about the dangers of smoking or of the flaws of the political process eckharts flawless performance and reitmans wonderful screenplay anchor an uncommonly perceptive comedy provided you take yours black if you need a little cream and sugar fun with dick and jane might still be at the dollar theater,black_comedy
edited to omit reported spoilers and by spoilers i dont mean the bruce willis is dead type but bruce willis is bald types sighsome jobs are harder than others but nick naylor aaron eckhart tobacco industry spokesman handles his with effortless skill along with two other spokespeople for the alcohol and firearms industry respectively he is part of the selfappointed mod squad merchants of death whose main objective is to talk to bs to spin to confuse and convince their opponent and charm their audience a job of such nature naturally requires a certain moral flexibility and with smoothtalk and sex appeal it is apparent that nick is incredibly gifted in this areahe goes on tvshows verbally battles us senators deems the cancer research foundation arseholes  all the while trying to set an example for his 10yearold son this is naturally very difficult doing what he does so as big tobacco for whom he is a lobbyist launches a campaign to reinstate the cool smoking image into mainstream hollywood and sends nick to work a producer for the proper productplacement nick decides to bring his son along for the ride to see how daddy works in hopes to bond with himgood satires are hard to come by but reitmans is so wet with sarcasm and dripping with humour that it is impossible not to enjoy it navigates the fastpaced industry the art of talking and spoofs the antismoking camp with their chich cancersick boy in a wheelchair front as seen in the opening scene of the film and it explores the moral flexibility of americans without preaching too much in doing so only once does it fall prey to predictable moral messages as when nick starts reevaluating his work and has moral qualms following his kidnapping by an antismoking group only to swoop down into tongueandcheek mode again and return twice as biting  and twice as funnyalthough the film is evenly peppered with fun oneliners and perfect delivery from its cast the best scene is when the mod squad are at their usual restaurant hangout at the end of the day and brag to each other and argue over whose business kills the most people per year nick how many alcoholrelated deaths per day 100000 thats what 270 a day wow 270 people tragedy excuse me if i dont exactly see terrorists getting excited about kidnapping anyone from the alcoholindustry maria bello who plays the detached funny moderate spokeswoman for alcohol has great inyourface aptitude and attitude thats stupid arguing aaron eckhart is also hilarious throughout in a shady businessman way i now have a major crush on him out of all the cast only nicks little kid joe chokes on the wellwritten linesin fact even the cinematography is wellcrafted in the film just the way a scene cuts to another deserves credit opening with a rapidfire ironic note speaking of which thank yous opening montage of cigarette packages as credits is a stroke of genius on reitmans part so are the various casting choices  the amount of respected actors that have been crammed into supporting roles in impressive robert duvall sam elliot william h macy and give rise to an almost familiar and feelgood tone in the film that said i wouldnt call this laughoutloud worthy exactly and i didnt care for the ending but it is clear that a lot of thought has been put into  every line is a wellarticulated kick up the arse to something and delivered by the bucketload a very enjoyable little satire8 out of 10,black_comedy
just saw this as it premiered in toronto  awesome cast very funny dialog and more than skin deep first time director does a nice job  and the opening credits are noteworthy recommended pokes fun at the smoking industry and lobbyists but at others as well and its hard to disagree with the sharp satire rob lowes small role is priceless the casting was perfect across the board nick naylors eckart relationship with his son is center and keeps some genuine qualities through all the laughs my friend and i both rated this near the top or at the top of the 7 films we saw in toronto last weekend not sure what its distribution  release schedule is yet as there was still some debate over who had actually purchased the rights to it eckart in person came across as very genuine and is also in another great upcoming movie  neverwas,black_comedy
this was the most enjoyable film we saw at sundance smart and funny is not an easy pairing to find these days provides thought provoking content delivered through a network of great acting performances that make this film so thought provokingly hilariousthis comedy unlike many that grace the screen these days is clean enough to take your parents to and funny enough that you will forget you are at the movies with your mom it was truly refreshing how no one in the film was filmed smoking a cigarette rob lowes character provides a wonderful satire of the corporate film world i only hope that the intelligence level of this film does not keep it from gaining mainstream appeal,black_comedy
i saw this movie at a screening in dc last night it was great aaron eckhart the single leading man with the worst haircut in hollywood full disclosure  im damn near bald matches very well with the direction of reitman from the getgo its a fastpaced sendup of everyone and everything in the tobacco war the entire cast does a good job w the exception maybe of katie holmes rob lowe is hysterical in his cameo but i have to say eckhart  his mod squad buddies maria bello  david koechner really light up the screen their scenes of discussing the dealing out of death through the industries they represent over drinks are a real strong point of the moviethe fact that this movie doesnt take sides  and really could be about any issue because its more about the man behind the spokesperson  but makes fun of all sides in the tobacco issue the interaction bw nick naylor eckhart  the old marlboro man sam elliot is priceless as is the backandforth between naylor  senator ortolan finistirre william h macy towards the end of the film its basically good actors doing what they do well  and its very funnythe movies also a little bit touchyfeely focusing for a bit on the relationship bw naylor  his son joey cameron bright  the kids good  some of the lines written for him are pricelessthere was one odd stupid thing  and my wife agrees w me on this so im not just being a guy there are 2 sex scenes w eckhart  katie holmes but zero nudity nada not even partial we see them having sex in multiple places  positions but theyre almost completely clothed it just took away from the credibility is all im trying to point out here  as i said my wife actually made the comment before i didbottom line its a great movie  well worth the price of admission its funny its entertaining  it moves what more could you ask for,black_comedy
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning nick naylor aaron eckhart is damn good at his job but that doesnt stop him being any less detested for it hes a spokesperson for the tobacco companies cleverly putting slants on proven medical facts and observations but hes facing a new opponent in the shape of senator finistirre william h macy whos challenging him to come to a commitee and stand up against some new antismoking material hes discovered hes also got to struggle to be a positive role model to his 12 year old son joey cameron bright who he takes on a cross country trip to try and bond with and to top it all off the tobacco giants are desperate to make smoking appear cool in the movies again a job they leave at the hands of nick but a double crossing reporter katie holmes and a group threatening to bump off nick for the lives hes ruined his own life is starting to look pretty bumpy on its ownalways leave it to the small independent films to produce the best comedies because they generally do a much better job of it than big overblown hollywood productions tyfs has received a large number of generally glowing reviews up to this pointand im glad to say this will be another onewith a title and premise that was guaranteed to spark controversy or maybe outrage would be a better word rather than go for shock value in any other way this manages to be a consistently clever and sharp stab at the hypocrisy and overreaction that can cloud those who make it their lives to poo poo tobacco and those who try and defend it with one of the greatest cinematic characters in a while in nick he defends an industry i despise so its credit to the film that he struck a chord as such a savvy and charismatic guy who carries the film to the beat of his own tune great performances all round also do the film no end of favours guided along by a screen play that dishes out witty and sparkling dialogue by the bucketload making the film a seemingly neverending glee rideplease come again ,black_comedy
ivan reitman must be so proud im not kidding his son jason has come out with a caustic original comedy all his own i dont know what people outside los angeles may make of this they may think is science fiction when in fact most people who have spent any time there knows that this is as normal as going to church in the vatican the scenes inside the caa like agency are even underplayed if you believe that aaron eckhart is as perfect as they come the charming monster with human sides william h macy rob lowe and the rest of the cast are great fun to watch im rooting for this movie to make a zillion bucks itll be nice to have more good writing good acting and good direction in march for a change,black_comedy
i hate to say it but this movie is gonna fail in the box office for the same reason no one showed up to its screening but this will be one of the most entertaining cult movies ever although it lacks the glam and actually will turn a lot of people away before they even get to the box office do to the subject matter but they will all be missing out on a hilariously made movie i dont think ive laughed this hard in a long long time this movie isnt really intended to be antismoking propaganda but there is some of it its more of a satire on the reality of people and how much were willing to believe or willing to be dooped i see it similar to liar liar not being about about the legal system but the moral and ethical decisions of people within society overall i would have to saw this is a great great movie highly recommend it and could not imagine this movie to turn out any better than it has already been with the perfect cast and great story line i think the best way to encompass the movie is paraphrased in the movies catchy advertising line the main character nick naylor doesnt lie he filters the truth,black_comedy
very smart funny and interesting movie i seldom say that about any movie the story of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry whos job is to put a spin on cigarettes improve their image make them cool again and prevent one senator from getting legislature to mandate that cigarette companies place a large graphic skull and cross bones on each pack soldnick naylors character is brilliant while he was selling the public on his ideas and views and convincing them his own son and everyone else that he is correct he actually sold me too with his good looks charm and logiceveryone knows that smoking causes cancer and anyone who attempts to sell or promote it wont garner any sympathy for lagging sales thats where the spin doctor nick comes in to teach everyone that smoking is coolexcellent movie,black_comedy
a clever satire of the spinworld thanks largely to its cast and a witty script by jason reitman comes on like wag the dog via the insider  its a painfully honest insight into the tobacco industry led by the narration of nick naylor aaron eckhart the big tobacco corporations chief spokesman his narcissistic selfinfatuation charles manson kills people i talk and sleazy tactics land him in trouble when he finds himself bribing a lung cancer victim in front of his preteen son who is not yet old enough to smoke but is being influenced by his moneydriven fathernick has a lot on his mind hes got pressure from an antismoking senator played brilliantly by william h macy his boss his exwife fanatical groups on homicidal missions a doublecrossing reporter katie holmes and a hollywood producer rob lowe trying to cast the perfect hollywood glamorization of smoking brad pitt and catherine zetajones are offered as the leadsthe movie directed by the son of ivan reitman the ghosbusters directorproducer extraordinaire balances absurdity with realism moments of the film come across as poignant reflection while following scenes are completely the opposite this balance is thrown off a bit sometimes  david koechners portrayal of an nra lobbyist is great but feels out of place as if it belongs in a comedy in the vein of anchorman and ultimately this uneven mix of the deadly serious literally with offthewall gags does catch up with the film it eventually falls back upon its very strong script which supports it a lesser film might be affected more drastically with a weaker screenplay but some scenes probably should have been toned down a bit to comply with the subtler and more realistic scenes for what its worth the wacky scenes are extremely hilarious but they seem to contradict other portions of the materialjason is a better director than his father though and shows a lot of potential here id say the direction is almost deserving of a more serious film id love to see what he could do with a drama in the futurethe movie also boasts an excellent lead performance by aaron eckhart who oozes with sleaze greed corruption and a hidden sense of morals he knows what he is doing is wrong but hes not a stereotypical hollywood motion picture good guy  even the closing of the picture without spoiling it isnt the moralistic copout i had expected the movie isnt a blackandwhite painting of the smoking controversy it doesnt take sides on either side of the debatethis is really being marketed incorrectly as the next 40yearold virgin right now but the film  for the most part anyway  really isnt as hilarious as it is thoughtprovoking and engaging apart from a few aforementioned moments of utter absurdity the majority of the films duration involves some pretty serious topics and it handles them well its not a bustyourgutfunny movie and its perhaps not as strong as some reviews would lead you to believe but its one of the better satires in recent memory and certainly one of the more effective since wag the dog,black_comedy
i saw this at sundance last night actually it was a salt lake screening and thus the filmmakers didnt bother to drive 30 miles to talk to usnot that i am bitter at first i was a bit worried that this was going to be the old hat anti smoking movie that makes all smokers victims of the eeeeevil tobacco companies but then i saw that it was based on a christopher buckley novel and i relaxed a bit this pokes fun at all sides of the issue from the tobacco lobbyists insistence that there has been no conclusive proof that tobacco is harmful to the legislators thinking that putting a warning label on cigarettes will actually make someone pick up a cigarette package read the label and decide not to smokeas if anyone with half a brain doesnt know that inhaling smoke into your lungs will harm youaaron eckhart did a fine job in his role as did sam elliot rob lowe katie holmesi could go on and on its fascinating to watch eckharts character spin and spin so that he brings people around to his way of thinking he has to be representing one of the most hated industries in the united states yet he is able to convince people as to the opposite i highly recommend this film,black_comedy
this was quite the clever satire but its not really about smoking i was reminded of cinderella man last years best film that one wasnt really a boxing movie it was about a man realizing what was important in his life and boxing was just a means to an end isnt trying to convince people to smoke or not to smoke its about choice well thats what the characters are lobbying for quite literally maybe since this is a dark comedy it doesnt really have any moral high ground but aaron eckhart who plays the lead role of tobacco industry spokesperson nick naylor and is playing a character who himself smokes doesnt actually light up a cigarette on cameranick naylors job is spin and hes damn good at it as he tells his 12 year old son who idolizes his father youre never on the wrong side of an argument if you can support your facts and most importantly prove the other person wrong and its not that naylor thinks cigarettes are the greatest invention ever he does what he does for the challenge his tasks in this film include getting cigarettes back into movies preferably being used by brad pitt and catherine zetajones right after a zerog sex scene and to convince a congressional subcommittee to not include a new poison icon on all packs of cigarettesthe movie is full of subplots and great supporting characters but the movie doesnt seem weighed down by them it still moves along rather briskly and clocks in at about 90 minutes but at the same time it never loses its dual focus that of naylors relationship with his son where hes still trying to be a good role model despite how hated he is by others for what he does and with the other focus just being the brilliance of naylors spin eckhart shines in this film he never rambles he always gets his two cents in and more hes clever throughout and no matter what evil it is that he may be defending you cant help but like and admire himand i must go over some of this supporting cast maria bello and david koechner join naylor for lunch once a week and as respective representatives for the alcohol firearms and tobacco industries they refer to themselves as the merchants of death and have quite a lively mealdebate william h macy is senator ortolan k finistirre who loves his state of vermonts cheese and is one of the most outspoken adversaries of big tobacco i loved jk simmons as br naylors boss he just has such a loud mouth i love hearing him swear and rant in movies you also have robert duvall as the captain the guy br has to run policy through and who is idolized by anyone working in big tobacco sam elliott as a former marlboro man who is deadset against not shutting up in anger until naylor spins a few things katie holmes as a reporter naylor falls for rob lowe as a movie producer wholl take funding from anyone and can spin as well as naylor and dennis miller as thankfully himselfso then i dont think this movie takes sides at all on tobacco its a movie for people actually capable of looking at an issue from both sides and to find humor in it all i guess that means its not for republicans and even if you go into this movie thinking you wont be impressed i think naylor will work his magic and convince you otherwise,black_comedy
i think that if you want to spend a good evening this is the movie the story is very good and the dialogs wittyit is very sarcastic and even caustic but it will make you have a thought on what is the truth in our world everything here is discussed  how medias are manipulated how big companies can decide what we see and what information we getall the actors are very good especially rob lowe playing president of ego nice acronym huh  who is only sleeping on sundaysif you are not convinced yet to go and rent this movie i recommend that you take a look at the memorable quotes from the movie available in the imdb movies file youll understand how funny and caustic it is,black_comedy
i was expecting to laugh a whole bunch while watching this satirical comedy unfortunately this movie has fallen victim to the spoilers of trailers there were about 2 good laughs that were new to me but the other 7 i had already seen in those marvelous trailers i would have probably enjoyed a bit better if i had not seen the trailers so the lesson is to avoid trailers trailers are spoilers the story was good maybe because there havent been any movies about a spokesperson for the tobacco industry still youll find some possibly hollywood clichs even if this is supposedly an independent film id think the mainstream audience would enjoy this film more so than transamerica its style of jokes perhaps is the reason for example subtitles or symbols are introduced to add humor which of course arent seen by the characters it doesnt make the movie any worse but the type of humor is why id think casual film goers would enjoy this movie and the satire is in some ways similar to what is on tv now a days sure it had some good jokes and was an interesting story but as the film ended it just didnt fit together dont want to spoil it but there were some mix messages of what the movie was really about was a nice film which seemed to have a unique story but had some hollywood influencespoilers why didnt i like the endingthe movie was a satire on the people in charge of the tobacco industry however it did show the good in the people at least the lobbyist nick naylor the message was delivered that people had to do their jobs to get by in life to have money to support it another was to decide for yourself and not let a higher power tell you what to believe yet in the end the tobacco industry lost and nick decided not rejoin the industry tobacco was seen as the enemy once again nick should have rejoined and the industry should have continued its contradictory of what the start of he film was the movie basically told the audience tobacco was bad directly not through satire it seemed as if a hollywood producer got hold of the script and changed it to be morally correct it just didnt fit unless the ending was a satire on how hollywood movies end good guys win i doubt it well it was based on a book i dont know how it ended but either way i didnt like the ending of the film,black_comedy
in the opening scene of nick naylor aaron eckhart tobacco lobbyist is a guest on the joan lunden talk show with a young boy robin who is a dying of lung cancer nick somewhat sympathetic makes his argument that it is in his best interest to keep people like robin alive so they can continue to smoke cigarettes nick proclaims that the tobacco industry will spend 50 million on campaign to educate kids against smoking nick wins over the entire studio audience for his humanitarian stance a young woman sitting by also watching the movie voices that i am very annoyed she might have been clued in by the movie audience laughter that satire lives and thrives in jason reitmans reitmans screenplay based on the book by christopher buckley son of william buckley is painfully hilarious and a clever dark comedy focused on the multibillion dollar tobacco industry writer and director rietman has a similar conceit as his main character nick naylor as he tells his story in the context of freedom and the consequence of choicehowever skewed the context aaron eckhart is amazing as nick time magazines sultan of spin as nick describes himself michael jordan plays ball charles manson kills people i talk his nick naylor is the vicepresident of the academy of tobacco studies or in english he is a tobacco lobbyist he is a master at what he does nick is also the political target of senator ortolan finistirre william h macy who wants to stamp all cigarettes with a poison labelevery week nick has dinner with the mod squadthat would be the merchants of death polly bailey smart and sexy mario bello is with the alcohol lobby bobby jay bliss classic good old boy david koechner is with the firearms lobby big dog nick reminds polly that she is only responsible for two deaths per day only it turns out that nick is scheduled for an interview with reporter heather holloway hot and lethal katie holmes who according to bobby jay has spectacular ts of course nick is never over his head at the same time nicks boss br absolutely funny jk simmons arranges meeting with entertainment agency egos ceo jeff megall played by rob lowe at his comic straight man best in los angeles nick is after getting smoking back in the movies reestablishing it as sexy and cool nick makes a case to his exwife jill kim dickens that this would be an opportunity for him to spend quality time with their son joey kind of eerily played by cameron bright he fails however joey presents a winning argument that gains him a trip to los angeles with his dadin a signature scene reporter heather holmes asks nick eckhart why do you do what you do unflinching nick says population control then he cops to everyones got to pay the mortgage this is funny and dead on director rietman maintains this absurdest ecologythere is no envelop for his material and at the same time he generates genuine sympathy for his characters and in the business world it is all about the bottom line in another classic scene nick delivers a brief case with 25 million to the lung cancer stricken marlborough man a great sam elliotwho can either keep the money for his family thus shutting his mouth to the media or give it all away to charity the offer is nonnegotiable everyone has to pay their mortgage walking on the santa monica pier with his son joey nick advises on the virtues of being morally flexible the writing in is so smart and drop dead funnyso to speakthe performances are equally stunning starting with aaron eckhart as nick eckhart is a great looking leading man who is edgy and has impeccable comedic timing he plays nick with the innate charm that tempers his arrogance and aloofness his nick is doing his best to spin the tobacco industrys aftermath and still raise his son to make up his own mind as he grows up not easyeven without the cigarettes issue cameron bright is smart and strangely endearing as joey who really has the choice of despising or admiring his father robert duvall is at his caricature best as the captain of the tobacco industry rob lowe is another standout as the totally affected ego head jeff megall there is comic genius when the kimono attired jeff calls nick saying that its 4 am in japan im calling from the future director rietman goes where few dare and makes us laugh at our darker nature he also tells a story of the responsibilities of freedom and choice and the consequences all with a sense of humor see thank you for smokingit is one of the years best,black_comedy
jason reitmans is a remarkable satire about successful bsting oh the things one can get away with the things one can turn around and twist just through words charisma and a smile all the characters arewere hypocrites even in the relationship between nick and his son we see how his own traits brush off on his son not only that he teaches his own son how to get away with things just by using words reitmans execution and screenplay are very intriguing he uses clever humour and the lines spoken by the actors are absurdly amazing and hilarious the multiple meanings of the lines particularly standout also reitmans intentions in making this successful satire seem very genuine as the film is not pretentious nor condescending as is the case with many of the socalled recent satires theres a stellar cast of which all the actors except katie holmes naturally fit their parts aaron eckhart carries the film its difficult to describe his performance in words as the actor seems to pulls it off with ease nick naylor was meant for him acclaimed actors like william huffman macy maria bello rob lowe and robert duvall all do nothing short of excellence in their acting even adam brody provokes laughter katie holmes is the weakest link but this can be easily overlooked as shes not there for long and the other actors compensate enough the cinematography and background score are very effective and the visuals are impressive the sepia tone and brightness gives the feeling of a classic movie where things are positively exaggerated while some people find the film offensive because they think it promotes smoking but is not really about smoking its pretty much about politics political incorrectness ill be watching this movie again because it deserves so,black_comedy
at long long last a movie for which i can write a positive commentary and to think i wouldnt have even gone out of my way to see this film had it not been for the good luck of winning tickets on the radionick naylors omnipresent smirk is symbolic of this films wry wit now its not the vile george w bush smirk its a kid playing a joke smirkthe writing is clever and human except for an absurd kidnapping the story is very human as well are the characters the acting is superbi found myself laughing out loud the theater erupted in applause at the conclusion the american filmgoing public needs more films like we need fewer remakes of old classics we need fewer copfilms chases special effects heists and super heroes and more good writing and original ideasmy hat is off to jason reitmann,black_comedy
how does it feel to be hated by everyone nick naylor is the spokesman of a cigar industry decided to clean the image of smoking his character is poetic from where he gets the nerve to go on with his job to his utter manipulative skills and brave charisma his character transforms those around him with major intelligencereitmans job is to execute perfectly the characters into their intentions but not with their way of executing them thats saying that he does the obvious job to show the morally correct into stupid and the manipulative soulless pig into a hero etcharkt throws an unseen sparkle and the script is in charge of putting america into the focus bringing the movie a smart edge nick naylors relationship with his son is deep and smart emotional and vividbut as naylor says think for yourself dont be guided dont let the movie convert you into a smoker or brilliant lobbyist think for yourself and thank you for reading,black_comedy
this is one of the best films ive seen come out of the last twenty years of hollywood schlockits a testament to the quality of the script that so many brilliant actors attached themselves to a film that cost 75 million to make chump change in modern productions aaron eckhart owns this moviehe is the life and soul of nick naylor and brings every character around him into the world talents such as rob lowe and sam eliot hold pivotal roles but little screen time in the true sense of what a supporting actor is supposed to benick naylor should be despised for his defense of an industry which deliberately addicts children and lies to the populace but you wont youll love him for his honesty and intellect and the conviction that everyone deserves a defense even tobacco companies this is a movie which will make you think and should be discussed with other passionate intelligent people9 out of 10 proof that comedies can go toe to toe with overwrought dramatic headliners and win,black_comedy
having just seen this movie and slept on it too i have to admit it is one of the smartest celluloid storytelling that i have seen in a long timeit balances sarcastic humour with subtle social commentary rapidfire wit with narrative subtlety and most of all is remains surprisingly neutral about the smoking issue notice how there isnt a single person seen smoking on screen during the entire movieand to top it all off its his first feature film come to think of it now i really hate jason reitmango see this film laugh your abdomen out then see it again with a friend repeat and rinse with absolute disregard for political correctness,black_comedy
nick aaron eckhart is an attractive scumbag lobbyist for a protobacco institute this makes it difficult to raise his young son without damaging the youngsters ability to determine what is right or wrong there are also problems with his exwife soothing but shamefaced dinners with two fellow lobbyists and an affair with an attractive reporter katie holmes on this seasons agenda will nick be a hero to anyone and is his charmed but flawed existence about to take a wrong turn what a year for lobbyists indeed we have jack abramoff and now nick naylor the very attractive eckhart is superb as the man whose love for debate supersedes his ethics surrounding him are wonderful supporting actors including holmes robert duvall maria bello sam elliot and the talented youngster cameron bright lets all bow to concept and topnotch script however the movies storyline is the reason this film is important and laudable do you want to see a movie which will result in a first class conversation and coffee opportunity see this one absolutely,black_comedy
jason reitman has written and directed a fantastically funny film it portrays a tobacco lobbyist nick naylor who will bend over backwards to make a buck the part of naylor is done exquisitely by aaron eckhart his associates in crime do likewise for the alcohol and firearms industries one of the high points of the film is the actor sam elliott portraying the marlboro man lorne lutch who is dying of lung cancer he masterfully looks and sounds like the image of this former character of billboards and tv rob lowe plays jeff megall a hollywood mogul who is convinced that the plan to add cigarettes to current films will enhance his wallet as well one expects to see a documentary on the tobacco industry but i was pleasantly surprised to find a delightful comedy that deserves a great success it should be on ones list of current films to see,black_comedy
lawyers are often asked how they can act for clients who are clearly bad people who ought to be in jail once the arguments like everyone is entitled to a fair trial and everyone is presumed innocent are swept aside it usually gets down to well ive got a mortgage to pay so it is for lobbyists for unpopular industries there is no legal industry more unpopular than big tobacco and in this film aaron eckhart plays with great relish nick naylor a superb operator with absolutely no shame who prosecutes big tobaccos cause at venues ranging from grade school classes to congressional committeesfirst time director reitman derived his screenplay from christopher buckleys 1994 book and in the book there is a deeper motivation than the must pay the mortgage defence chris buckley happens to be the son of the wealthy rightwing columnist and political gadfly william f buckley and chris shares his fathers politics to some degree if you are against the state telling people what to do ie not smoke it is logical to support the tobacco companies who after all are only providing a substance people are free not to use the problem with this libertarian position is of course externalities  others are affected by the smokers actions through passive smoking and the state will still have to foot the bill for the smokers medical treatment so unless our smoker is going to smoke only with other smokers or alone and is prepared to pay for their medical treatment the state has an interestthis issue is only lightly alluded to in what is a very clever witty snappily directed and rather superficial satire on lobbyists for pariah industries the film does come close to being serious when nick takes his perceptive 12 year old son joey wonderfully played by cameron bright to various work engagements how can a lobbyist for big tobacco justify what he does to his son he does it but i wont spoil your enjoyment of the movie by telling you howthe satire here is not subtle and some of the performances border on caricature william h macy however as the antitobacco senator for vermont home to cheesecreated cholesterol manages to avoid farce and produce a believable characterchristopher buckley was reportedly pleased with this film though i think his message was obscured somewhat by the pyrotechnics of aaron eckharts performance perhaps those champions of individual freedom are actually sociopaths using liberty as an excuse for doing bad i dont like being told what to do or telling other people what to do but sometimes there is no other choice,black_comedy

how to comment on a film that was this entertaining and at the same time so utterly empty afterwards a bit like smoking an intense pleasure when you light up but when the cigarette is in the ashtray the thrill is gone its been two days since ive seen the movie and i can barely remember if there was a story at allsome comparisons have been made with wag the dog 1997 a film i never found much more than a mildly amusing satire which didnt have much of a story as well but thank you is by far the funniest of the two this film was clearly made as a comedy and in that department it succeeds with clever writing great dialog and each role cast to perfectionaaron eckhardt is nick naylor a spokesman for big tobacco on a mission to defend the rights of smokers and the tobacco industry nick is a master at rhetorical manipulation and  according to a lot of people  a yuppie mephistopheles a trafficker in human misery his only real friends are the lobbyists for two other controversial products alcohol and firearms who are called the merchants of death or the the mod squad but he is at a moral crossroad in his life because his twelveyear old son cameron bright is asking him some serious questions about his fathers profession and soon he is faced with some moral dilemmas its hard to imagine anyone else playing nick naylor than aaron eckhardt who gives an impressive performance only after seeing thank you i learned he also played the incredibly annoying toogoodtobetrue motorcycle boyfriend of julia roberts in erin brokovich is this really the same actor he is supported by quite a phenomenal cast with robert duvall as an aging tobacco baron william h macy as ortolan finisterre what a name a rabiate antismoking vermont senator sam elliot as the former marlboro mana and rob lowe as a slick spiritualminded hollywood agent some slackers though cameron bright must be one of the most annoying little brads ive seen in a long time and katie holmes as an ambitious young journalist who doublecrosses nick naylor didnt do it for me at all cleverly the film stays clear from supporting any pro or antismoking causes if anything the film is about choice every american should be able to choose whether it is smoking drinking alcohol buying firearms or eating junk food all dayif you want a sharp intelligent comedy definitely worth your money for a 90 minute feature film i expect a little more than just straight satire most of the sharpest pokes are at hollywood and show business and not at washington politics or the ridiculous smoking laws in many american states the satire could have been a little more lasting but with a cast like this its hard to complaincamera obscura  710,black_comedy

does what few movies ever know how to do it hits us all right where it hurts pointing out everyones hypocrisy in everything and the way that our society is based on spin aaron eckhart whom you may remember from erin brockovich gets the role of a lifetime as tobacco industry spin doctor nick naylor whose job it is to make his industry look good and win people over with his good boy looks and worldly charm he has no problem doing just thatthe opening scene features nick on a talk show with a cancer patient and representatives from antismoking groups he manages to frame the debate so that it looks like the tobacco industry wants to keep the patient alive that sets up how manipulative this guy is for meals he likes to meet with the mod squad meaning merchants of death to discuss how to market this group consists of polly maria bello from the alcohol industry and bobby jay david koechner of the firearm industry nick always reminds polly and bobby jay that he nick has it the hardest their products kill far fewer peopleas for nicks personal life he always reminds his son joey cameron bright to think for himself  which of course means always question people who say that cigarettes are bad in fact he even shows joey how to present an argument for a class paper and no one in the class can challenge the argument thats how good this guy is at pr but as nick notes while getting interviewed by reporter heather holloway katie holmes i do it for the mortgage thats when the movie really gets good nicks boss br jk simmons who played spidermans boss sends nick to meet with the captain robert duvall sort of the head honcho of the tobacco industry in winstonsalem the captain explains to nick that to market cigarettes they need to make cigarettes look sexy so nick meets with the ultimate entertainment executive ego ceo jeff megall rob lowe they figure that brad pitt and catherine zetajones lighting up after having sex in outer space would make a great sceneespecially if they release a tiein cigarette and when nick meets with the dying marlboro man sam elliottwell lets just say that i didnt expect that scene however nicks life might get a lot more complicated selfrighteous vermont sen ortolan finistirre william h macy wants to put a warning label on cigarettes and subpoenas nick about the dangers of his products but nick knows just how to get the public on his own side at the hearing isnt heart disease a problem but your state keeps making cheddar cheeseall in all is a great look at everything its not a polemic at all quite simply its about how our society is dominated by spin political diatribes etc and both sides are hypocrites always doing everything possible to make themselves look good the movie stings like a bee perfect,black_comedy
nick baylor is a tobacco lobbyst in washington his work is to influence people in congress about his product cigarettes never mind the usage has long been considered bad for anyone that uses it nick will debate anyone and will always have an answer that will make his opponents appear as though they are the bad guysthat is the case when nick is seen on a talk show where he sits next to a young man afflicted with cancer caused from smoking who at the end of the show will have a different opinion of the industry that made him sick or take the presentation nick makes to his son joeys career day class when the young girl tells him that her mom says smoking is bad for you baylor questions her if her mother is a doctor to have arrived at that conclusionbaylors great idea is to try to enlist hollywood into letting big stars be seen smoking on whatever movies they appear he presents the idea to a powerful jeff megall an insider man who is willing to go along for the right price nick baylor is the ultimate salesman after all he and his employer have enormous resources to pay the right people in order to get their message acrossnick baylor loves his son who now lives with his mother nick wants to teach his son a valuable lesson so that he can fully appreciate what he does for a living the result is a young boy that begins to see his father side and how the truth as is perceived can be manipulated by anyone with the right contacts with people in governmentjason reitmans adaptation of christopher buckleys enormously funny satire about the role of the lobbyst in our society is one of the best films about this subject that have been brought to the screen mr reitman clearly understands how power and money make a heady combination in the way he presents the storyits hard to imagine anyone else but aaron eckhart playing nick baylor mr eckhart is never obnoxious or overbearing his nick is a man who knows what moves people to do the things they do and has no scruples in getting them done cameron bright is seen as nicks son joey this young actor was the perfect choice also because he brings an uncanny intelligence to whatever role he is asked to play the rest of the ensemble cast do well under mr reitmans direction with great contributions by maria bello william h macy rob lowe adam brody robert duvall katie holmes and the restthanks for smoking shows a new talented director jason reitman working with an excellent aaron eckhart to great results in a movie that will not disappoint,black_comedy
this movie rocked on so many levels it hurts it was furiously funny and intelligent you would think that from the title and movie image that the movie is about cigarette smoking cigarettes are not the main agenda of this movie it really is about a well crafted creative spin doctor named nick naylor nick is a lobbyist for cigarette companies he is a master of talk and spin that could argue and charm anyone about a subject and this is really what the movie is about i thoroughly enjoyed the rasputin likeness of the character but he was also sprinkled with human qualities being a father and loving his son so while we actively see him working as a lobbyist his son questions his motives and methods and uses the same skill to work for him i loved this about the moviei particularly liked the merchant of death conversations and the extreme realness of language spoken by all characters i have not had the pleasure of reading the book but look forward to looking it up and reading it when i get the chancethe movie is really about the freedom to think i highly recommend it,black_comedy
a funny smartly written movie in which the most powerful are those who use the english language the best a perfectly casted lead surrounded by an ensemble of fine actors several morale issues are addressed although not the ones you might think rob lowes character is hilarious  especially for the one day of work he did the whole mod squad merchants of death is a good example of this movie not taking itself too seriously while still entertaining everyone the take your dad to work day scene is also laugh out loud funny katie holes characters rise and fall may fortell her own marriage to tome cruise this movie is a must see for anyone with an iq over 80,black_comedy
nick naylor is a talented man who is employed as one of the top spokesmen for big tobacco sure he has to keep the alleged truth about the health effects contributing to the death of 1200 people each and every day but hes got to pay the mortgage just like the rest of us he is separated from his wife but still wants to be a role model to his son while also pursuing his chosen career summoned to meet with the general one of the last great tobacco barons nick is put in charge of pushing through new ways of promoting smoking while also defeating a push by senator finistirre to put a skull and crossbones on the front of every cigarette packet sold in the countryif the plot summary sounds like this film has a definite narrative flow to it then im sorry for misleading you because although it moves in a certain direction it isnt that tight a story it probably didnt help either that i had literally been in a different cinema watching dr strangelove an hour before i watched this film because this was never going to be able to compare no matter what the current imdb rating says the comedy isnt that sharp and in terms of satire this is about as mean as a poodle this lack of teeth is evident from the very start where the opening credits are kind of cool comic and fun in the same way the comedy is cool funny enjoyable but not really something that rips into its subject with an acerbic wit that i expected part of me was thinking this at times that this was a problem but then i realised that it actually wasnt that big a dealthe reason is that sure it aint a sharp satire but it is a fun comedy with a general swagger and a great ear for dialogue the story wanders and tends to go off in directions that it drops or doesnt follow through but by staying with nick at least we have a focal point that is interesting and engaging i did have a bit of a problem swallowing nicks sudden massive lack of professional judgement and the fact that it is a key part of the plot made the film seem to stall for a while but such moments were mostly covered by the pace and energy of the majority the targets are easy but the manner of writing produces a great feel of mocking them from the inside rather than being outside throwing stones the gentle mocking approach takes away the edge but it makes the film easier to enjoy it has a steadily amusing air to it while also throwing in lines characters and touches that made me laugh out loud reitman may not be the future of satire but he can certainly do comedy and this film is all the better for this work as director and screen writerthe cast is deep and everyone gets a piece albeit mostly small pieces the film belongs to eckhart who has proved company of men etc that he seems to find it easy to play characters whose moral compasses are way off he is as charming as he is soulless and he is a delight to watch  a major force in the film being as engaging as it was the support cast includes some real heavyweight names such as duvall bello elliott holmes macy simmons lowe and others generally the quality is high but i found the presence of holmes to be a distraction and her fully clothed sex scenes to be pretty laughable  her lack of genuine sex appeal and chemistry here made her part of the plot much harder to buyoverall then this is not the sharp acerbic satire that some reviewers would have you believe it is  it simply hasnt got the teeth or the balls for that but this shouldnt matter too much because what it does do is produce a consistently fun atmosphere that is cynical without wandering away from being pretty mainstream in delivery the cast are mostly very good but eckhart dominates with a great lead role while the material keeps the laughs coming on a fairly regular basis,black_comedy

it seems that every year of the new millennium brings with it a bumper crop of political comedies with wag the dog as the benchmark films compete in cheerful contrarian satire but what seems to come so easily to the daily show writers four nights a week has proved to be quite a challenge for movie scriptwriters few things are sadder than a satire that falls flat and the past few years are littered with those  from american dreamz to otherwise reliable mike judges idiocracy to unseen by me but illreviewed man of the year to fast food nation and many others this film at long last delivers biting sarcasm and takes it to a logical conclusion without pulling punches but also with taste and restraintthe cast is a dream come true all the characters come to life and defy their types from the for once in movies intellectually adequate 12yearold son to the ingnue reporter to the crusading crowdpleaser senator holding them all together is nick naylor lobbyist and spokesman extraordinaire is there an actor in the world who could have played this role better than aaron eckhart anything is possible but i firmly believe that the only person who could match this performance would be the actual best industry spokesperson in americanow about nick naylor this mans job is to go out and convince people not to take action against a product that kills thousands every day and offers nothing in return he does his job but more than that  he does it with grace with style and with inspiration he lies when he has to but knows how to use honesty to devastating effect at the same time nick is within the confines of what he does a decent person he has no illusions about public opinion of him or his bosses nor about the effects of tobacco on human health he loves his son sincerely and unselfishly and does whatever he can to be a good father why then does he do what he does for a living it seems to be part quasilibertarian resignation somebodys gotta do this and crucially part love of challenge someone as ambitious as nick is destined to seek out the ever greater challenge and there are few greater than defending the tobacco industry even for someone whose forte is debateand boy is it ever his forte in most films where an argument or debate takes place and is won the winning party suffices to be of normal intelligence and bring arguments any of us could have thought of to counter stumbling strawman idiocy from the other side one of the reasons to love is that nick naylor wins his debates not due to the subhuman intelligence of his opponents  they are about as smart or smarter than the average audience member  but because he is really truly brilliant i find spin a despicable art but i found it impossible not to be dazzled and grudgingly admiring for the way nailor manages to turn the most seemingly hopeless arguments around it is again to the writers credit that they sell it one hundred percent and do it not by shortchanging the other characters but making nailor so much better at the game than everyone else despite their honest best effortsthis film is not for everyone of course if you feel squeamish about seeing a deathpeddling character with charisma and a heart or hearing extremely convincing arguments for tobacco advertising to teens stay away but if you can brave the deadpan callous cynicism then one of the best political satires of the decade is waiting for you,black_comedy
this is one of the best black comedies that i have seen i will rank this at the same level as comedies made by coen brothers such as the big lebowski and o brother where art thou where do i start paying a tribute to this movie ill start with the script and the direction the script is taut engrossing concise well paced and funny hence the previous comparison with coen bros the pauses voice overs by ekhart scene overlays are excellent the direction is subtle i hope this does not count as a spoiler  did any one notice that there are no scenes where any character is seen smoking these are people in high profile jobs with billions of dollars worth of business depending on there ability to present truth as they see it very very intense jobsthe next aspect to be paid a tribute to will have to be acting the casting could not be more perfect i may be quoting some other user comments while doing so i am right there with you pal aaron eckhart as nick naylor is charming intelligent and a master of presenting his version of truth he is funny serious manipulative and smooth talking sultan of spin all in all is great maria bello as polly bailey i like her in any role she has put in and david koechner as bobby jay bliss are his friends and perfect foils the scenes where they meet at the restaurant and exchange ideas how their day went are hilarious the chemistry between the characters is portrayed very well by the actors the relation that nick shares with his son is presented very well  they teach other some very surprisingly valuable lessons the support cast of katie holms as the investigative journalist robert duvall as the cigarette baron and jk simmons as nicks boss are great i have always thought that william h macy is one of the best mediumprofile actors working in hollywood his turn as the senator leading an antismoking crusade is great contrast to aaron eckharts spin wizard needs to be watchedonce upon a time i used to enjoy jim careys comedy  i still think he is one of the best comic talents but his movies try to teach you a lesson they start with high octane comedy only to peter out as a lesson of life nothing wrong with the format just presenting a point this movie on the other hand takes on a seriously emotive issue such as smoking  who hasnt seen an antismoking advert on tv  and does it as a completely levelheaded black comedy that leaves it up to the viewers to make up their minds about the issue it does not preach anything but does a great job in presenting the callousness of the cigarette bloc and the extremism of the nonsmoking lobby i will have you know that i am a nonsmoker i prefer to sit at a nonsmoking section of the restaurant and have no agenda pro or antismoking i completely agree with the conclusion of the moviea strong 910,black_comedy
thank you for spoilers nick naylor aaron eckhart is vicepresident of the academy of tobacco studies as well as the spokesman for the tobacco lobbyhis motto is i dont hide the truth i filter it and basically is the embodiment of shamelessness he would be able to sell freezers to inuits just to make an examplesomething that his boss br jk simmons undoubtedly appreciateson the personal front things are a little shakier he is divorced with a son joey cameron bright who wants to get to know his father better and his only two friends are polly maria bello the spokeswoman for the alcohol lobby and bobby david koechner the spokesman for the army lobby as a group they call themselves the dods dealers of deathbut a trip to california to meet with jeff rob lowe a hollywood producer with a west wingy fasttalking and sometimes annoying seth cohenalike assistant jack adam brody and more importantly a sexy journalist with worldclass tits heather holloway katie holmes will change everythingwhat will nick do this is the first movie by jason reitman son of the famous ivan and its really good i particularly liked how this movie felt fresh original intense and cheekily dark one of the best satires in a very long time at least it has felt like itall the actors the above mentioned plus robert duvall and sam elliot are perfectly in part  even if youd just like to turn adam brody off sometimes  especially eckhart who gives  as usual  an outstanding performanceif you like your satire irreverent and acid this is a movie to rentbuy 910,black_comedy
is a great comedy using dialog as its main weapon aaron eckhart plays a spokesman for conglomerated tobacco named nick naylor known as the sultan of spin naylor navigates his way around the sensitive subjects of teen smoking and the effects of tobacco on human health by finding unique ways of spinning arguments so that he is always right throughout the movie you see him on the joan show eat food with his buddies from the alcohol and gun companies and have an affair with a reporter who is only interested in screwing him in a couple of different ways the movie also illustrates naylors family situation his son joey idolizes his father and picks up many of his fathers bantering skills the last thirty minutes of this movie has a series of great scenes with a mix of irony and just desserts this is one of the best and most creative comedies ive seen in years the cast was perfect and the dialog was witty and well thought out,black_comedy
thankyou for smoking is one of the funniest films i have seen in quite some time the humour isnt crude but bitingly satirical the great thing though is this movie is also extremely smart which may seem weird as movies are not generally smart and funny aaron eckhart gives a fantastic and oscar worthy performance as nick naylor the lobbyist for big tobacco all the other cast maria bello william h macy katie holmes and david koechner give great performances the script is funny and very witty i wouldnt be surprised if it gets nominated for an oscaroverall this is an extremely funny film with great acting and a witty script highly recommended 45,black_comedy
as they explain on the dvd extras this movie is not about the tobacco industry nor about whether smoking is bad for us in fact we all pretty well concede that smoking is bad for you and the movie uses the subject in humorous ways to show how spin can alter our perception maybe even to thinking that maybe it isnt bad aaron eckhart stars as master spin doctor and lobbyist nick naylor who works for a big tobacco research institution he is divorced and his ex is played by kim dickens his 12 year old son is joey cameron bright who seems to have dads gift and nick must be careful to show him the right path why does nick do this particular job to pay the mortgage which is a statement of why most people do their particular jobsit is possible to give a brief synopsis of the story but that isnt so important what is important is how they show ways spin affect us every day today it is about how the iraq war is going clips show both current president bush and former president clinton using spin to take some of the severity off their situations who can forget it depends on what the definition of is isdefinitely a movie worth seeing,black_comedy
i like the satire a lot but it needs to be very well done and is a great satire very well done the actors make an excellent work highlighting aaron eckhartrobert duvall and jk simmons director jason reitman had a brilliant debut with this movie and it will definitely be interesting to watch his next projects the movie is very fun and funny and it kept me very interested is a great satire and i totally recommend it if you wanna have a hugely entertaining time with a sharply written solidly directed and perfectly acted satirerating9,black_comedy
its not often that a budding director manages to secure a film that sets a high standard for all future films  much less a comedy since all comedies nowadays seem to fall under the categories of a soppy cheesy romantic comedies with the predictable happily ever after ending or b teen comedies with grossout moments and crammed full of gratuitous nudity but jason reitman has achieved this impossible he mustve learned from his father ivans mistakes and decided to go in the opposite direction the result is astonishing a hilarious sendup of all that is politically correct neither side of the smoking debate was safe from the films scathing wit and that is the star of the show reitmans screenplay adapted from christopher buckleys novel is sheer genius the comedy is smart and sophisticated the clever oneliners came thick and fast all delivered deadpan by a cast comprised of indie stars here is another strong point of the film the ensemble cast is flawless and not one of them drops the torch which carries the consistent tempo throughout of course aaron eckhart nick naylor onscreen is the hero here he steals the show with such credibility as the smoothtalking charismatic charmer and manages to coax us into empathising with him despite being the villain protagonist of the film he personifies the perfect spin doctor his oratorical rhetoric is practically intoxicating it was simply empowering and inspiring to watch a master at work triumphing in the face of all odds in a way that makes you wonder how the hell did he do that minutes later his supporting cast does exactly that  support each of them symbolises someone unique attached to his life and everyone managed to extract the maximum amount of laughs out of their roles no matter how short their screen time was maria bello and david koechner provided the perfect backseat commentary to the film  a much needed relief when the plot accelerates to a terminal velocity rob lowe manages to supply a parallel to nick an equal that hints at what the film would be like had the subject of satire been hollywood rather than the tobacco industry william h macy as senator finistirre is nicks opposition destined to trip up against our protagonist and to have his ass handed to him with style jk simmons was pitchperfect as the disgruntled boss cameron bright served as the inquisitive product of his father and katie holmes was irresistible enough for us to believe her as the young seductive reporter who manages to tease the information out of our seeminglyimpervious nick by the common weakness to all men the plot itself comes secondary to the artistic style unsurprising due to the sheer brilliance of it nicks life takes various twists and turns while he juggles a threat at work and fatherhood the soundtrack is a collection of golden oldies from the 1940s and 50s it gives a solid backbone to the story especially when nick spends some time alone to reflect upon his life a joy to watch and highly recommended if youre looking for one and a half hours of entertainment just sit back and bask in the glory of its dry and witty script perfectly executed and enough to send the audience into a state of mesmerised euphoria,black_comedy
this is one of the better movies i have seen in a long time i have been a fan of aaron eckart since his amazing performance in company of men this was great he plays a spinster for the tobacco company and his boss is that jk simmons from oz he is a great actor and his lines are hysterical the sports man from anchorman was great as the gun dude all in all this movie delivered goods from start to finish rob lowe was perfectly cast as the producer who only sleeps on sunday i will have to see this again as i loved the acting katie holmes was forgettable all i think about now when i see her is tom cruise and his bizarre behavior great cameo in this movie by mark hamil,black_comedy
a spokesman for big tobacco who fights their battles out on television talk shows and in congressional hearings is an odd choice for a protagonist especially today with all the telling statistics and the virulent campaign to wipe smoking off the map of the usa this film takes us into his personal life divorced with one son whose love and respect mean a lot to him and committed to his job not so much out of conviction but because he considers himself a good or even the best arguer out there and he has to be considering hes fighting a losing battle that hes one of americas most hated figures is illustrated when hes threatened on a live callin show and then kidnapped by a group of antismoking militants that in itself the kidnapping has got to be one of the most satirical plot lines recently put on film but before you start chuckling too much he goes to visit the dying marlboro man whos about to go public with a briefcase full of cash in an attempt to buy him out one look at the oxygen tanks on his front porch is enough to bring home the true sadness and suffering twenty years of smoking can cause in the middle is his relationship with his son who must be learning about how bad cigarettes are in school the culture of tobacco specifically the cigarette from the big tobacco boardrooms to the virginia mansion of a dying tobacco tycoon are neatly inserted as is hollywoods use of the cigarette past present and future and the politics of tobacco often shrouded in hypocrisy is nearly brilliantly put out there maybe relying a little too much on the easy joke but presented astutely,black_comedy
does two things in particular it shows its writerdirector jason reitman son of ivan should have a good career ahead of him with this being a promising debut it also shows how casting decisions do make up then crucial framework for a film like this where its ensemble form needs the right people the satire comes in the form of its lead character a lobbyist for tobacco aaron eckhardt one of his better performances who has a crises in the midst of a reporters investigation katie holmes his own son and in dealings with a super movie agent rob lowe one of his very best roles and even the old marlboro man sam elliot his main opponent from the cheesehead mainstay state of vermont is played by william h macy in another key role if theres one thing this man can play its smarmy and antagonistic while seeming very professional ie fargo its with this parallel of the two sides of varying hypocrisies of the tobaccos side and the fervent antitobacco side that reitman loads his guns not to mention with the alcohol and tobacco sides represented as the guys friends there scenes in the restaurant are some of the funniest in the filmif there is a problem at least for me with the film in the overall is that as much as a satire can be clever and have aims its needs to balance out its comedy with its storytelling after the first twenty minutes of the film which contain some really big laughs if not by the actors ie jk simmons then by the cool style of reitmans it goes into its story and becomes more or less in the realm of being entertaining but not necessarily as funny as it should or could be in a way this is one of those films i admire more so for having me grin at a lot of whats going on and that the shots at the societal tennis match of the tobacco issue do work theres nothing persay i can say that should dissuade you from seeing it and it could very likely become a comedy cult favorite along the lines of the christopher guest films albeit a different sort of cultural satire that its less than great though when it becomes sincere and that the sincerity isnt as matched up with its clever side is more of an observation than a stonecold criticism after all its hard to turn down a film that features lowe in a kimono on a sleeponlyonsunday schedule b,black_comedy
this is a fine film filled with sarcasm scary truths and sadly an accurate depiction of the times we live in and what we have come to accept as the truth based on advertising coalitions and constant bombardment with misleading information all in the name of profit the truth is that there are real nick naylors out there brilliantly portrayed with such cavalier bravado  a contradiction and a good one for this film by aaron eckhart he could have been pitching nsaids otcs prescription drugs unnecessary operations life insurance pyramid scamshe could be john edwards agentheck he could have been one of ojs lawyers he is convincing charismatic and committed to his actions even as he is aware of the questionable ethics he is engaging in he is unapologetic but is far from stupid is a great film that makes a statement about individual rights gullibility and freedom a brilliant mix oh and monsanto you guys make me vomit literally got this one in your collection do you,black_comedy
2005 directed by jason reitman starring aaron eckhart maria bello cameron bright adam brody sam elliot katie holmes david koechner rob lowe william h macy jk simmons kim dickens  kim dickens mpaa rating r for language and some sexual content is a satirical look at the tobacco industry corporate america the media and just about everything you can imagine aaron eckhart stars as nick naylorone of the most hated men in americathe tobacco industry lobbyist called the sultan of spin naylor is famous for twisting logic to turn arguments in his favor and believes that simply proving his opponent wrong by changing the argument completely no less is enough to prove him correct and this theory must be correct as it has propelled him to success and considerable wealth for example nick is asked to attend his sons schools career day one little girl says that her mommy says that cigarettes can kill you ignoring his sons request to not ruin his childhood nick crossexamines the young girl asking is your mommy a doctor a scientific researcher of some kind the little girl says no to which nick says well then shes hardly a credible expert is she one could almost say that anyone could manipulate a young child and that nick is nothing specialuntil you realize that he can manipulate anyone young or old just as easily as nick so eloquently states thats the beauty of argument if you argue correctly youre never wrongthe health hazards of cigarettes have become widelypublicized people are no longer as unknowing about the dangers of tobacco as they once were nick naylors job is seemingly impossible promoting cigarettes in a time when almost everyone knows that cigarette smoke can cause a multitude of health problems constantly trying to balance his work and his son joey bright nick begins to find his job more and more difficult nick meets with members of the mod merchants of death squad which consists of the alcohol lobbyist polly bailey bello and the firearms lobbyist bobby jay bliss koechner once a month to discuss new techniques for promoting their different products they often argue about which of their products kills the most people when a sexy reporter heather holloway holmes wins nicks trust and takes advantage of it for the sake of the perfectly controversial article nicks world begins to tumble down around him but always the calculating thinker nick prepares for his ultimate comebackone of my favorite scenes in features nick naylor as a guest on the joan lunden show sitting next to him is robin eric haberman a fifteenyearold cancer victim the audience applauds when joan says that robin has stopped smoking and they boo when she introduces nick you would think that this is nicks downfall how could he turn such a damaging situation in his favor did i mention that the other people on the stage are all antismoking campaigners well they are anyway nick smiling confidently says that it is in the smoking industrys best interest to keep robin alive healthyand smoking of course why would they not care whether or not he lived or died if he is their customerthe source of their financial security this seems reasonable enough although we all surely know that this is merely hogwash next nick looks straight into the audience piercing them with his firm stare and he says that the antismoking people are the ones who want robin to die because they get more and more support with every casualty the audience seems completely taken aback for a few moments and then they realize that nicks attack is completely understandable we of course know that this is simply ludicrousbut there is just something about the way nick says it you just cannot help but at least consider the idea that he is telling the truth this scene is a testament to aaron eckharts talent and could very well be the highlight of a careerdefining rolewhen this movie ended i felt completely satisfied it revels in its often subtle humor and trying to catch every little joke the first time around is next to impossible it one of the most politicallyincorrect bold inspired and effective comedies of the year i often criticize comedies for being too safe when deciding what to joke about on the other hand is a movie that seems as though the filmmakers decided what was too safe to joke about and cut it all out leaving everything that could be considered offensive in the final cut thank god for that it is about time filmmakers decide that offending some people doesnt matter if an audience member is so easilyoffended then they shouldnt be watching a satire to begin with is not a movie made to entertain everybody it was made to entertain the people who would like it ignoring everyone else nick ends the movie by saying michael jordan plays ball charles manson kills people i talk everyone has a talent i quite like that line everyone does have talent and clearly for these filmmakers their talent is making a movie that is courageous and completely hilariousfinal thought is one of the best comedies of the yearoverall rating 1010 a,black_comedy
review although this is an old movie i still enjoyed it it shows a different aspect to big business which good or bad every business needs the acting is great from all of the cast and the writing was witty even though it is a serious subject after watching movies like the insider and many michael moore movies which show how big businesses trick the world by making them think that they are doing right by buying there products its good to see a lighter side to the subject its very well written and entertaining from beginning to end enjoyableroundup judging by the money that this movie made it must have touched all audiences smokers and nonsmokers and the relationship between the leading character and his some gave it a human touch ive seen this movie a few times on tv so i knew what to expect in a lot of way this message is politically incorrect but once the spin had been applied by the spin doctor you does twist your mind by the way the director cleverly didnt show anyone in the movie smoking so he obviously put his own message across budget 65million worldwide gross 40millioni recommend this movie to people who want to learn about the spin doctors who work for the tobacco industry 610,black_comedy
2005the premise of this film if hilarious for those who like a black comedy in a kind of dark grey nothing too stark the protobacco lobbyist is played with wit and energy and really quite brilliantly never mind his eternal cutesy smile by aaron eckhart who keeps the film fast and warm the supporting cast is an array of decent talent not given a lot to work with though his son played by cameron bright is a bright spotbut after seeing the previews i had a feeling that i had seen the best moments in the film and didnt need to see it all through and this is sort of true since the idea of rooting for the villain is great for five minutes and then the variations on the theme start to run thinbut then came juno 2007 yes juno shares the same director jason reitman and i have seen juno three times now surprised that i enjoy the movie each time even though the plot is no surprise who is this new director who has now come up with up in the air just to burnish his creds a little more well is no great film for one thing the story is just for laughs and this one doesnt pull it off the way other pure comedies from airplane to the big lebowski keep the tables spinning and the writing is on fire even though its all relatively meaningless for another ellen page and george clooney are bigger more lovable more complicated talentsbut again you can in fact see some of the stylistic traits that are becoming reitman signatures one is a matter of fact kind of fast speaking another is the way the camera work is edited including closeups on reactions another is a kind of contemporary feel without any overt stylizing which is no contradiction unlike tarantino or the coen brothers not to match apples and oranges reitman works within a standard editing and filming and acting framework but with a fresh invisible elegance that lets the interior the acting and writing blossom and reitman so far creates an airy kind of innocence to his scenarios even here which is anything but innocentso far lets see whats next for him i realize i havent said much about the movie here but thats because its a throwaway a fun time that seems too long even at 90 minutes yes there are some great laughs and there are those harbingers of better things to come which is great to see and sense for yourself,black_comedy
finally a funny movie about a social and cultural issue that does not take sides and paints just an original fresh outlook hand aaron eckhart any award you canhe does it so effortlesslymost movies these days are pure and complete garbage who still finances this crap is beyond me but not this onemost of the world agrees and promotes the fact that cigarettes are poison it doesnt matter what you think of tobacco eckhart can take your opinion and put it back in your face like i said nothing you think matters about the subject just watch and enjoy a socially neutral cinematic experiencewhether or not you smoke watch the film,black_comedy
this is some good entertainment by that i mean that its not necessarily original or profound new or amazing in technique or really that important yet its a decently written wellacted observational satire one that can give or take depending on what you want to receive or expect from it the trailer gives away some of its best jokes we know that everyone will become a better person at the end and theres nothing really offensive in it yet its still if anything a great way to pass your time if you have the opportunity to see itfrankly this is the type of movie that hollywood should be making while the mediumsized movie aka indies by those who dont know better aka indiewood aka movies with stars that arent expected to be blockbusters should be attempting something different instead we have hollywood making complete crap mediumsized movies making the welldone formulas like this and the really independent films trying to make the midsized movie but with the unfortunate sideeffect of selling the frankly ugly and annoying handheld camera effect as that grainy independent feel but enough about the shoulda coulda woulda this a highly comic and entertaining feature by jason reitman is about a guy named nick naylor who must defend big tobacco against a nation of health warnings fear of cancer antibigbusiness terrorist groups and basically everyone in the nation who frankly hates him as a person even though hes a decent caring guy who really just cares about taking care of his son what keeps this movie flowing and interesting is its comedic timing a lot of nice quotables and oneliners that keep the audience at least amused until it finally is able to show the character express whats really on his mind the importance of personal responsibility towards everything even morally questionable businesses for all the talk and spin naylor never really says smoke cigarettes he says make your own decisions the unfortunate thing is that in order to make a living saying that he has to do it under the name of big tobaccoi personally love any movie thats willing to tackle issues of media and able to do it without being condescending or terribly misinformed thats where a lot of this films strength lays in its ability to analyze public relations and various forms of media as they operate without really being all da media is trying to kill you oh noes this movie has some very important lessons to show in terms of understanding spin how it works and also understanding that sometimes the talking heads are real people too however what really keeps it from being brilliant or progressive or anything like that is the fact that it really needed to have come out about fifteen years ago or thereabouts nowadays such subjects are pretty much common discourse at least this movie has the ability to humanize it and make us empathize with someone weve been taught to hatepolarisdib,black_comedy
this is pretty good satire biggest surprise was just how effective the core guy was in the lead wow he should run for office he was funny vicious and deadon the media gets theirs in this bigtime kudos to joan lunden for being there for the ride as wellthe cast has many a familiar facemario bello rob lowe bill macy all very good robert duvall and j k simmons play their ceo roles to the hilt as well i also thought eckhardts son was effectivewhere the movie failed if you willrelatively speakingwas the final congressional hearing i didnt see eckhardt getting the better of macy at all i also didnt buy katie holmes as a diane sawyer type reporter whod bed her targets for story info she just looks barely 18 and like in batman begins as a da just is miscastsam elliott was good in his turn as the marlboro man to i want to add anything hes in is a plusoverall i liked this quite a bit the mod squad stuff was the best part you will enjoy the first half hour or so the most and you kinda wish it stayed in that vein the entire way thru outta ,black_comedy
just saw this movie at a screening  and am going to another screening next week and it has to be one of the best films i have seen in the past few months funny funny funny well written you may need to see it more then once to get all the gags that are there check out the name of the company the lowe works for my daughter caught one i missed what is seen right after the flight attendant on the plane leaves watch the killer whale on the big screen in the lobby of a company that is going for that zen look also check out the picture on lowes office wall and the list goes on and on in one word  enjoy great fun for smokers and non smokers alike,black_comedy
i had high hopes for a satire about smoking and the way the media politicians and people in general act in relation to the issues it generates i found it to be disappointingly tame in its derision of the hypocrisies and manipulation of the various groups and characters in the film sure it presents a number of interesting ideas but most of them just dont really go anywhere william h macys character in particular seems plainly unoriginal and pointlesshowever the real problem for me is that this just isnt nearly as funny as it ought to be although some bits of it are pretty funny and others original and thought provoking the remaining sections are often to be quite frank dull much of the humour misses in my opinion and some scenes are borderline boring the occasional witty line is not enough to engage an audience and tell a meaningful story furthermore i found the film confusing in its tone its too silly for its plot to be taken seriously but then it spends so much time on establishing an elaborate plot that goes nowhere in particularaaron eckhart is very good as nick naylor while the supporting cast is solid however none of the characters are explored deeply enough to truly add any depth to the movie with perhaps the exception of nick naylor and his son in fact some of the most intelligent and memorable lines come from the son but for me they were still unrealistic and lacked subtlety thats a problem with the movie as a whole the characters arent real and as good as some of lines may be they dont fit in with the characters and situationsanother odd problem with the movie was the colour it often seemed to have some kind of yellow tint to it  i thought there was a problem with our dvd player or something also the cinematography felt limited and languid accentuating the slower weaker parts of the movie the music by rolfe kent although probably alright per se similarly added nothing in my opinion unlike the use of his music in sideways for exampleperhaps the worst thing about is how forgettable it is i remember i enjoyed some bits but i find it difficult to recall any of them thinking back i am primarily reminded of how much of a missed opportunity it ended up being,black_comedy
if you were head of an ethically challenged industry youd want nick naylor on your side lobbying the holy crap out of everyone nick would have you believing your lung cancer has nothing to do with the industry he represents big tobacco and that the real issue here is the freedom of adults across america to choose what they want to choose and isnt that worth fighting for nick aaron eckhart is so slick hes able to accuse an antismoking advocate of hoping that lungcancer patients die because if they lived then he the advocate would see his budget slashed then he tells a shocked studio audience that his organization is launching a 50 million campaign to discourage kids from smoking slick and effective when not spinning spinning and spinning nick commiserates with fellow spokespersons for industries of ill repute polly maria bello the liquor companies and bobby jay david koechner the gun companies together they are the mod squad wherein mod stands for merchants of death a little gallows humor is necessary when you peddle mortalityanyway the idea is that nick must spin smoking is good from deriding questionable scientific studies that disagree with his premise to lobbying hollywood for more product placement that is no more would cigarettes be held in movies only by bad guys or europeans  the heroes would get them too oh and pay off the marlboro man sam elliott whos bitterly dying of cancer and deal with a duplicitous boss j k simmons who plays j jonah jameson in the spiderman films and be spirited about by the head honcho of big tabacka the captain robert duvallits a lot for poor ol nick but thats not all  he has to be a role model of sorts to his young son who dotes upon him while living with his mom and her boyfriend in nicks house while nick gets an apartmentbut dont feel too bad for nick since he gets to shag nearly every female in the story but not in the movie since its not a movie of infinite length but then im comparing the movie to the book by christopher buckley and thats not entirely fairthe problem with the movie is that its wit so wicked and sharp in the book has been dulled a bit it feels hollywoodized as if everything has to be just so as if its okay to point and laugh at the absurdity of pimping for cigarettes from a distance but not to get in close and snark at the detailsthe story also suffers from a shifted focus in the book nicks relationship with his son was one of the lesser threads but in the movie its at the forefront my guess is that the makers including the director and writer jason reitman figured this would make the movie a better sell across various demographics this is what happens when a plot gets hollywoodized  it tries to appeal to too many people kind of odd for a movie that wasnt supposed to be a blockbuster anywayon the bright side the casting is spot on particularly eckhart who is aces in roles of dubious morality sure hes an insufferable randy cad but hes not a nasty jerk so we kind of root for him but deplore his intentionsjust about everyone else is a secondary character except for nicks son joey cameron bright and thankfully the young actor wasnt melodramatic or maudlin or hammy or any of a number of thespianic maladies that affect novices point of fact he was quite charming and convincingnot so convincing was the oftenmiscast mrs tom cruise how is it the katie holmes keeps getting grownup roles when she looks like shes about two years late for her high school reunion side note holmes character a reporter is described in the book and the movie as having nice breasts this wasnt weird to see in the book but it made no sense in the movie as holmes herself is uh lacking the bottom line is that thank you misses the mark just a tad by way of a shift in plot focus and a dulling of sharp satire,black_comedy
a simple sentence but one look at the final word and there you have the subversive nature of jason reitmans debut film which i had the chance to see friday march 31 in new york city as satire it frolics in going after not only at the smoking industry but those going after the smoking industry those in the fringes former smoking victims reporters et al no one is sacred and everyone is for grabs in reitmans sharp screenplay that is closer to the sentiment of the 1970s and uses elements of rapid dialog reminiscent of the 1930s screwball comedyaaron eckhart is again used to great measure to portray a character who has a moral black hole and an eager disposition to show just how black it is seeing how he is early on described  his talking handsome face sped up and the superimposed sound of a drill attacking cement  you can see how aggressive he can be his nick naylor is the ultimate lobbyist and will convince you as he himself says not that you are wrong but he is right and he makes no apologies when invited to a talk show the only person who advocates smoking from the guest panel he seems destined to lose but god bless him he smiles himself out of it and comes out with flying colors he goes one step father at a lesser level when visiting his son johns school a little girl tells him her mother is against smoking watch his response you will like john recoilbut nicks lobbying powers make him a god in his world he cannot do wrong he flies coach and mingles with the people and induces them to smoke and hes become the favorite of the tobacco czar robert duvall who is using his own money to bribe a former marlboro man dying of cancer played by sam neill not to talk against the industry and to use the money for a charity hes also trying to negotiate a smart move against his bosses wishes with a hollywood superagent rob lowe to reintroduce smoking in films because nowadays only europeans and psychovillains smoke  its deglamorized hollywood they suggest bringing brad pitt and catherine zetajones in a movie about smoking in space listen to them talk and listen to how they would resolve the minor issue that smoking cannot be done in space hes also not in total control even though he may think himself to be in one hilarious sequence he meets with a sexy female reporter katie holmes has voracious sex with her against his better judgment and the warnings from his fellow lunch mates both lobbyists for the alcohol and firearms industry and spills so much information its a wonder hes still alive and careers have not been ruinedthe great thing about is that it doesnt play by hollywood rules nick is a scapegoat waiting to be flogged by society into submission and while certainly he gets his just desserts right after a key appearance on dennis millers talk show in which he effectively trumps vermont senator finistree william h macy you would think hed see the light and have a moral reversal maybe even reconcile with his estranged wife and renounce lobbying for the tobacco industry after all such a thing has happened in hollywood tradition  the hays code would not have permitted any other thing well one thing he does leave lobbying and wouldnt you know it he bounces right back in business better than ever,black_comedy
thank you is a great film but it only weighs in at a paltry ninety odd minutes the novel had so much other great material which was excluded almost everybody i know who has read the book remembers the nicotine patch episode but they only allude to the campaign to reduce teen smoking which was everything your parents told you about smoking is right i suppose the truthcom ads about blah blah smoking isnt stupid hit too close to life imitating artaaron eckhart was fantastic as the smarmy spokesman for big tobacco and william macy outdid himself as the dimwitted birkenstock wearing liberal senator who decorates his desk with jars of maple syrup and who is on a crusade to expand the nanny state and make life safe for everybody  even if that meant changing historymy only complaint was that i had to drive to godforsaken bethesda to see it in the white hot core of liberal lawyer hell it should have gone to mass release from the getgo its as funny as a movie can be  almost as many laughs as airplane this one is worth watching a couple of times,black_comedy
this movie isnt about smoking its about spin  jason reitman i just saw the film tonight and had a qa with jason reitman the movie was brilliant and funny  good twists good laughs and very good writing jason reitmans qa was very delightful after the movie and he stayed to sign autographs for the entire group i also got to speak with the coproducer daniel brunt daniel was very friendly and had some funny stories about the shootgreat movie that isnt about the smoking issues it is about fast talkers and spinning the truth  its about the balance of lies and lies truth and truth go see it you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
if you are old enough you should to remember when american movies were brave a use auto critic as a way to educate and change societyof course that is something you do not see very often lately you can probably find a few independent projects with barely known actors doing some denounce but not seen by many people and sometimes just because they did not deserve public either or you can find some michel moore or similar political statements that target a current situation but never go really deep in the cause of americans society illnesswell here it is a movie a comedy but really an statement a deep and cruel analysis of the cancer affecting american people is here and should be seen by everybodyno this is not a movie against tobacco industry as the title suggest is about the manipulation of the people by corrupts industries politics and media the hypocrisy that is killing our minds and bodiesis about a spin doctor for the tobacco industry a guy that can use a parents talk in his son classroom to publish cigarettes among kids if you think he is the demon itself you are quite wrong as the history progress he is far from being the worst guythe movie attacks everybody politicians looking for media and political attention through stupid and unnecessary crusades prostitution of the media and the corruption of the corporate environmentjason reitman the director does not go for the easy target if you want to blame americans decadence is not the fault of impersonal industries but the ambition and corruption of the people that control information law or money people like you and me but with more power and using for their own profitin brief see this movie pay very good attention to the impressive and intelligent dialogs open your mind enough to laugh about the things you are seeing every day and after that try to find a way to change all this i am sure this movie is a good first step to make things better for everybody,black_comedy

this movie was on my list of viewing because it was shown and ran at amsterdam theatres for long but not in the pathe theatres where i hold my pass so when pathe was running these special pac movies rerun i grabbed the opportunity to see the movie with my colleagues son felix who had come for a flying visit from zurich to meet his dadthe story is about nick naylor aaron eckhart who is lobbyist for the smoking industry in us his job is to convince people that smoking is not actually bad  no scientific research has proved it so it is as bad as eating cheese that increases cholesterol levels he is an argumentative talker who can confidently find logic to prove that he is right the movie tries to project the american culture and way of life  the alcohol the gun the press the senators  all of them at what levels people can easily stoop to earn a living as nick naylor says all he does is just to pay the mortgagethe movie is a satirical comedy and should be seen in that way it is made from a book with the same title people who have read the book have not liked the movie but those who have not read the book for them the movie was pretty goodthis is the first time directorial debut for short film maker jason reitman he was done a commendable job here aaron eckhart has tried to play this negative character with great conviction and humor the other good character i like who plays the senator in the movie is william macy he is as good as ever but little under usedeveryone knows smoking is bad but americans  as their true image  can sell anything with so much stupid conviction  that it can become believable their confidence calmness and smiling face in the face of adversity to pull out arguments for something so deadly as smoking is shown is great waylast thing i would add is  all humans stoop to do terrible things not for paying mortgage  but with the desire to get rich and which other place can there be the best example other than usa that is america for you on the platter i liked the movie go and get a dvd if you want to see the american way of lifestars 65 out of 10,black_comedy

mainly suffers from the fact that the satire which mightve seemed biting when the novel first appeared in the nineties now seems more like a veryslightlytongueincheek version of reality indeed the movie is oddly sweet in a lot of ways and im not sure thats exactly what suits the materialoutside of that this is perfectly diverting with mr eckhart in particular wonderful as the brave pr lobbyist who suffers trials and career reversals before learning in a heartwarming conclusion that its not so much whether anything he says is true or not its more the quality of the bs,black_comedy
every now and then a movie will come along that will show a side of the world not often open to public scrutiny the tobacco industry is probably one of the most mysterious in the world with a number of restrictions placed on them over advertising and health warnings meaning we dont really have an idea of how they work if jason reitmans is anything to go by they are every bit as despicable as you would believefollows nick naylor a fast talking pr spokesman for tobacco tasked with the unenviable job of making tobacco look good aaron eckhart is absolutely superb in the role of nick a man who believes he can win any argument as long as he comes at it from the right angle and hes right throughout the movie you will see nick worm his way out of sticky situations again and again with eckharts smarminess effectively replacing any sense of logic in his arguments hes a truly despicable character but you cannot take your eyes off him and as the movie progresses you may even find yourself liking himit is a testament to eckharts performance and the fantastic script that you find yourself rooting for nick as he takes on pragmatic politicians his ex wife and her new husband a disgruntled former employee and perhaps most tricky of all his young son it may have been risky making a movie about the inner machinations of the tobacco industry but reitman wisely keeps the tone light throughout with only a handful of dramatic scenes punctuating the sharp comedy this may be offputting to some due to the serious nature of the subject matter but reitman and co have clearly aimed for a black satirical comedy and with a lightning fast script and excellent performances from all involved it succeeds admirably a very clever and funny look at the inner workings of the tobacco industry some jokes may be too near the knuckle for some but if youre in the mood for some inappropriate laughs then this one is for you,black_comedy
nicks job is spinning good pr for the tobacco industry and he is very good at it unfortunately for all his quick thinking and gift of the gab there are those who feel that he is doing the devils work and hold him responsible nick has to tread a careful line to keep his life in balancebased on christopher buckleys sharply funny satirical novel jason reitmans film is well adapted well cast and well directed nick is the sort of part any actor would leap at and aaron eckhart gives a tour de force performance there is plenty of food for thought some decent plot and a great deal of humour nicks sheer nerve in fronting some of the defensive lines he comes up with is funny funny stuff,black_comedy

dang it thats what i get for waiting 8 years to see this movie all the other reviewers have already used up all the smoking pun titles so without any catchy intro heres my reviewdoes something that very few movies can accomplish it features a character who does reprehensible things and it makes us genuinely like him cheer him on laugh with him  applaud him for doing things which in real life would annoy us to the point of heart failureim talking about the spin doctor the doublespeaker the political gasbag who could sell a baby a lollipop made of poop and count his money as the baby dies of cholera his name is nick naylor played by aaron eckhart and he is the hero of this movieyoud think that a movie with this premise could only work as an absurdist comedy like airplane or hot shots or even a christopher guest type mockumentary like spinal tap or best in show but writerdirector jason reitman takes the tough road by weaving a straight story with a sane rational human protagonistyes this is a satire so there are plenty of absurdly comical scenes like when nick shows up at his sons career day and essentially convinces a bunch of 12yearold kids to smoke but for the most part the story is solidlygrounded logically plausible and probably more truth than it is fictionin this film the whole tobacco plot is basically a smokescreen ha i knew there was a pun left the real story is on a human level and its the story of a father  his son yeah that might sound a little boring but thats where the tobacco drama comes in to spice up the tale in telling the simple tale of a father and son reitman takes us through many comedic hijinks including traitorous newscasters psychotic politicians kidnappers assassins shotguntoting cowboys and a naked guy in the lap of the lincoln monument so rest assured it never gets boringnor does the comedy let up even while telling a sober story of a man attempting to reconcile his amoral career with raising his son in a respectable way the cute banter between nick and his son expertly played by young cameron bright is both philosophical and funny and thats how reitman pulls off this amazing achievement this is a very funny film but it doesnt depart from reality nor make us emotionally disconnected from the themes at play it gives you a lot to think aboutas far as funny goes this movie clocked in on my laughometer with about 1 lol every 10 minutes and a snicker every 2 now thats a lot coming from a guy who doesnt usually lol at all but in the end it wasnt even the comedy that made this so enjoyable it was the films power to make me see a completely different side of a no brainer argument like cigarettes  health the character nick is so slickwitted and charismatic that he can win any argument or win the audience over for that matter without making any point at all as he says to his son you dont have to prove youre right you just have to prove your opponent is wrong sad but true and in this case very funnyi highly recommend this movie to people who are exasperated at all the political doublespeak we hear on the cable news channels every day to people who cant understand how law  authority  public opinion can get so messed up itll make you laugh without upsetting you and itll make you see the whole ridiculous debate over smoking as really entertaining even though in real life smoking is a drag ,black_comedy
its often interesting to see the directorial debut of someone who has gone on to make so many great movies ever since in so many debuts like duel or following you can see traces of some of the best tropes or idioms used by a certain director is no different and provides us with a glimpse of the origins of jason reitmans fantastic and often dark sense of humourthe film follows nick naylor a lobbyist for cigarette companies through various different tasks and problems with his job and family nicks relationship with his son is really interesting and gives the film some of its more touching moments plotwise the film is fairly thin and takes the shape more of a series of sketches or vignettes with interconnected stories and themes however this doesnt bog the film down at all and just gives it the potential for even more humour and new situations its filled with a barrage of fantastic supporting characters too from katie holmes manipulative journalist to rob lowes hollywood agent and no part of it feels unnecessary or stuck onthe script is the movies greatest strength and it reaches a great level of satire making you think as well as laugh while smoking is the centre of the movie it never is encouraged since we know that naylor is sweettalking and slimy the merchants of death meetings are a particular stroke of genius bringing together three controversial industries and making them seem foul from the very first scene of the film where naylor is attempting to put a good spin on cancer when he is opposed greatly on a talk show even by a boy suffering from lung cancer you can see that the film is not afraid of being controversial but manages very well to bring its message across through humourlead by a fantastic set of performances and a razorsharp script is a great start for jason reitman paving the way for his later successes such as juno and up in the air and manages to be touching informative and downright hilarious throughout,black_comedy
the film is pretty good its well shot decent acting some great dialogs it just never gets you going i think the story is pretty lacking there is no big problem or important events that could keep you at the edge of your seat generally this is what one would expect from a movie about a tobacco spokesperson but somehow i expected more mainly because this is a jason reitman film but clearly this was not the right material to make a classa movie so if you have time and want and easy film preferably a comedy give it a try but dont get too much excited about it it will be the main reason against the film as it is for me as im writing this,black_comedy
is a political movie about the people who promote smoking and smooth talk the general public into buying their first pack nick naylor araon eckhart is the chief spokesman for a big tabacco company and while he tries to remain a rolemodel for his son he has to stand by his beliefs and his job the movies isnt as funny as i thought it would be but it definitely has it moments such as the merchants of death scenes with eckhart maria bello and david koechner the senetor of vermont william h macy has his laughs as well and lets not forget the one and only jk simmons who plays br naylors boss this movie really keeps you thinking and you honestly understand where the characters are coming from the only reason i didnt give this movie a higher rating is because at times the movie seemed it didnt know where it was going overall is a great movie with a phenomenal cast and superb acting,black_comedy
cleverlybalanced comedy juggles darkhued elements within an inviting package the moral ambiguities of a smoothtalking quickthinking lobbyist for the tobacco industry come under fire while he continues to work for a heartless organization that panics when cigarette sales drop even the slightest percent and children with cancer turn up on tv talk shows writerdirector jason reitman doesnt attempt to use sneaky reverse psychology on the audience he boldly displays the smug recklessness of not only the tobacco industry but the squawkboxes for the alcohol and firearms people as well we see them for the bloodsuckers they are bragging about doing their dirty work for the mortgagereitman even manages to make them funny aaron eckhart was the perfect casting choice for this sultan of spin with his creamy pseudocharm and unbridled arrogance eckhart knows just how to play the devil incarnate and make him both wily and buffoonish reitmans filmmaking style is amusingly jaded in a glossy format he wrings big laughs out of the quotable dialogue though theres no weight behind his verbal and visual slings and arrows the movies edges are blunted in its quest to be likableits just a sendup of the outrageous behavior we read about or see on the daily news theres nothing here which goes beyond the cheeky sidewaysslanted humor which deliberately dominates though the entire cast makes it a fun jaunt 12 from ,black_comedy
this film is a savvy if cynical take on the worlds hypocrisy over attacking the bad habits it so richly in every sense of the word enjoys there are some laughs at wry moments and bitter ironies the part of the worldly wise precocious son is very well played and should have been used much more prominentlybut the only problem is that the plot so often errs from the whole premise of the film that the main character can talk himself into or out of anything at will but we see over and over again thats not true now is that the intent of the film that his braggadocio is false and he is self deluding maybe but thats not clear so it takes away from the plot when you find out he has a divorce he couldnt talk his way out of doesnt have sole custody of his son gets screwed in more ways than one by several folksone is never clear whether these are the fault of the character or the writing and its distractingin the end with all the smoke rings of the premise and plot its an amusing movie that will make you look at your own foibles and those of society with a smile if a little discomfort,black_comedy
one of the many ironies in this blatant satire which is not a documentary is that at no time is anybody seen smoking no hollywood cinematic light ups even nick naylor who is vice president of the smoking pr conglomerate does not actually light up on screen we see him once look into an empty pack of cigarettes wishing he had one thats itthe joke on the square is that although this movie is about smoking nobody associated with the movie wants to be accused of supporting smoking in any way now you might think that well a movie that puts smoking in a bad light as this movie does certainly is not what the tobacco companies want to see however if the movie producers also threw in a few scenes with the stars puffing happily away the message would surely be mixedno mixed messages here aaron eckhart who stars as nick naylor is a sort of charming sociopath he describes himself as the kind of guy who could get any woman into bed in an relentlessly ironic follow up to that we have katie holmes playing an intrepid reporter for the washington probe newspaper who gets him into bed all the better to get him to reveal all his dirty secrets and dirty tricks he was owned so to speak and taken advantage of sexuallyeckhart is perfect for the part with his handsome winning ways you may recall that he played a corporate sexist pig sociopath in the critically acclaimed film in the company of men 1997 which i highly recommend see my review here he is a little sweeter a little more charming and amazingly enough a good role model for his son joey cameron bright who by the way has a lot of sharp lines and delivers them well how this is pulled off is something to behold for sure but basically the rationale is that nick is doing it all to pay the mortgage the yuppie nuremberg defense and that is the lesson that joey learns and presumably he will be able to adapt to more socially correct employment when he grows upsome satirical bits include the marlboro man sam elliott with cancer getting a bribe a senator from vermont william h macy holding a senate hearing about getting a skull and crossbones logo put on cigarette packages while nick tells him that the vermont cows and their cheese are causing clogged arteries and heart attacks nick hanging out with a rp person representing the interests of alcohol maria bello and another david koechner whoring for the gun industry they like to sit around over dinner and compare the number of people their products have killedrobert duvall has a modest part as the captain of tobacco and rob lowe gets to play jeff megall a big time machiavellian hollywood money man who is lining up catherine zetajones and i forget who to play a naked in a space movie with some serious smoking scenesfor a price to be paid for by big tobacco the joke here is that this practice has long been a source of hollywood film production upfront revenue theres a scene showing old hollywood stars with pc touch ups of their movies showing them with lollypops or pencils hanging out of their mouths instead of cigarettesthe script adapted from a novel by christopher buckley son of conservative pundit william f buckley and direction by jason reitman deserve some kind of award for originality the film is definitely a put down of industry pr people yet somehow it makes them look humannote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,black_comedy
this has to be one of the best films ive seen in a few years the rare mix of politics culture and actually funny humor especially the wealth of sarcasm nick conveys leaves you laughing even after the show endsthe best part in my opinion though was that whatever point it set out to make wasnt really made its like they wanted to entertain us a very nice change to michael moores linear predictable and preachy method of drilling points into your head like a college professorfiller for imdbs excellent rule  and more,black_comedy
this movie had its moments of laughter and irony from the cancer ridden marlboro man accepting the bribe to nick being kidnapped and forced to wear many nicotine patches to the boss in winstonsalem the film was short and told a story without a lot of needless scenes i prefer it that way i dont know why such a big deal was made of katie holmes shes hardly in it and isnt convincing as a slutty reporteri also liked the part where his friends are lobbyists for gun control and alcohol prevention they argue over whose product kills more people and therefore who has the harder job to sell the product to the publicfinal verdict unique satire i liked it because it is not out of some cookie cutter formula,black_comedy
jason reitmans would make an interesting companion piece to lord of war since both are sharp acerbic satires about industries  one tobacco the other small arms  whose practitioners are often referred to as merchants of deathbased on the novel by christopher buckley centers on nick naylor a smoothtalking lobbyist for big tobacco whose job it is to counter all the medical charges leveled against cigarettes so that people will go right on using the product despite the fact that americans are dropping dead from heart disease cancer and emphysema caused primarily by smoking at the rate of well over 430000 people a year the triumph of the film is that it resists the temptation to paint everything in broad strokes or to reduce all its figures to the level of simpleminded caricatures naylor may be an amoral bastard in the profession he has chosen to pursue as he says with an amused smirk on his face to pay the mortgage but as played by the brilliant aaron eckhart he also has a bit of a conscience and the semiredeeming traits of insecurity vulnerability and a deep and abiding love for his devoted young son writerdirector jason reitman humanizes the characters even as he skewers them mercilessly for how they have chosen to live their lives naylor for instance is part of an informal group labeled the mod squad  short for merchants of death  consisting of naylor plus two other lobbyists one from the alcohol industry and one from the gun manufacturers who meet regularly at a local bar to bemoan their standing as social pariahs and to argue over which of the three industries scores the most deaths per annum these characters could easily have been overdrawn and turned into callous villains but we find ourselves actually liking them  much as we do naylor  partly because they remain loyal to their buddy when the going gets tough for him and his world threatens to fall to pieces around himindeed it is this feeling of ambivalence we have towards naylor that makes more than just an antismoking jeremiad for the movie beautifully approximates the seductive power of men like naylor and makes us aware of how easily we too fall under their spell eckhart is so charismatic charming and convincing in the role of naylor that we find ourselves in the unusual position of practically rooting for him to prevail even though intellectually we can pretty much see through the speciousness of his arguments the filmmakers are to be commended for not softening the material by turning naylor into the conventional antihero who eventually sees the evils of his ways and does everything in his power to make reparations for the damage and suffering he has caused for even though naylor does have a soft likable side to his personality it isnt always enough to make him do the right thing in every situation or to make all the politically correct speeches the audience believes should be coming from the mouth of a reformed wrongdoer the filmmakers make it clear that naylor reforms only up to a point for there is still a great deal of flimflamery lurking in the core of his genes moreover buckley and reitman dont let the antismoking forces entirely off the hook either it often shows them as extreme one group even kidnaps and nicotinepoisons naylor to get him to stop what hes doing and petty one senator wants to digitally erase all the cigarettes from old movieseckhart who has always been a very fine actor despite never having achieved superstar status in hollywood should have been nominated for a best actor oscar for his dazzling finelytuned turn here as a man it is easy to criticize but hard to hate he is bolstered by an outstanding cast that includes jk simmons maria bello david koechner kim dickens william h macy robert duvall katie holmes rob lowe and sam elliott special note should be taken of young cameron bright xmen 3 who brings spirit and depth to the role of naylors impressionable but cleareyed and levelheaded teenage sonis a rarity among american films in that it provides genuine food for thought while amusing the heck out of us at the same time,black_comedy
in this age of spin and with a relentless supply of public relations that could make hitler look like a diplomat in this day and age has a protagonist aaron eckhart who speaks on behalf of the tobacco industry and tries to lessen the publics perception of the damaging effects of a lethal product that kills hundreds of thousands of americans each year this is a satire of the most ingenious proportions it is consistently entertaining from both a quirky and truthful point of view and striking that kind of a balance is quite a juggling act what makes this film most appealing is that while defending the tobacco industry eckhart is trying to pass on values to his impressionable 12 year old son the truth in this film is as important as allowing one to make up their own mind about the important things in life remarkable,black_comedy
if you were around prior to 1971 and saw the marlboro man in those cigarette commercials you never stopped to consider that that was a real person actually there was more than one marlboro man and they werent all cowboys watching sam elliott portray a former marlboro man dying from smoking cigarettes wasnt far off the mark two actors who portrayed the character did die of lung cancerprobably better than any other movie shows just how effective both sides of an argument can be when delivered by a talented huckster who can think on his feet whats the best thing about america  endless appeals whats the most frustrating thing about america  endless appeals to argue either side requires a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people real life nick naylors can be dangerousmovie nick naylors though are fun to watch if youre fed up with political correctness this is just the right ticket naylor treads the periphery of human decency as a member of a self appointed mod squad the merchants of death who delight in comparing battlefield casualties among the cigarette alcohol and firearms industries anyone else make the connection between the name naylor and an oft used euphemism for a cigarette  a nail the films best sight gag  the st euthanasius schoolsmokers and non smokers alike i think will get a kick out of this movie because there are no moral judgments and there isnt anything revealed that one doesnt already know about the hazards of smoking its about choices and after that its all spin control,black_comedy
has come in the nicotine i mean nick of time of spin control madness aaron eckhart stars as nick naylor a gabby master of the verbose who is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry lets just say that nick is naylored for their tobacco advocate taste however at times nick does go over the benson  hedge by favoring tobacco in the most healthconcerned issues i must clear the air and state that on the bright side nick is a very devoted father to his young son joey who is played by cameron bright our protagonist cleverly does blow his antitobacco proponents away with his witty banter writerdirector jason reitman was definitely the reitman for the job by delivering a cerebral and clever cinematic product the acting of the film was also how can i say it to quote the iconic the mask smokin eckhart nailed down his naylor character william macy was once again amacying as antitobacco senator finistirre rob lowe low and behold was a scenestealer as movie product placement executive jeff megall maria bello  david koechner has the right ammunition  substance as the reps of the firearm  alcohol portion of the national firearm alcohol and tobacco organization otherwise known as the mob squad a puff of supporting acting credit also goes to robert duvall sam elliot todd louiso and the bright kid himself cameron bright i do have to mention that katie holmes did not cruise on brightly in her role as investigative reporter heather holloway katies work was way to hollow for my taste is a satirical film that will take your breath away thank you for preparing to now go check out spin it meeza  good,black_comedy
this is the first time i preferred the movie better than the book aaron paycheck eckhart as the heroic badguy nick naylor does a lot like his last name and nails it he takes his weaknesses and uses them as his strength to win more charred hearts and add ashtrays to the tobacco industry william cellular mystery men macy as the sinister finisterre of vermont is well placed as the wannabe foil to nick a virtuous villain vilified justifiably katie holmes as the reporter who goes all out to put a story to bed really fools the viewer as to her true agenda however as a sex symbol she leaves much to be desiredmaria duets payback  coyote ugly bello is cool in her usual toughgal pastiche like a 21st century lauren bacallthe real spin of this movie is a number of intertwined plot lines  how most modern situations require a way to justify their jobs they may or may not hate to keep family and roof intact marketing public relations or spin the key to being a successful debater by not winning but making sure the other party looks more at fault altering viewpoints with willing participation and how does even a socalled villain look their children in the eye and convince them not to make the same mistakes they made while earning respect and gaining favour for that one watch the movie and see how eckharts character shows his love for his son a wry commentary on the lies of both bush jr and clinton eras sorry if youre a democrat or gop as that last comment could bring a tear to your eye  maybe its smoke mirroring the lies httpbajanreporterblogspotcom,black_comedy
this a very cool movie as far as it goes trouble is it doesnt go far enough and tries to be everything to all people not that its poor i just expected a lot more than a silly dialogue movieits another movie in two halves  some great voice over and witty dialogue and behind that some disturbing and wrong portrayals of people no way can the lead character be seen as a victim or a hero this leaves the emotional investment of the audience hanging out to dry it was an unsatisfactory feeling to be rooting as the americans say for someone who was so obviously a mental weakling terrible father and greedy to bootnevertheless it poked fun at big tobacco and big guns big oil big fast food big whateveryawant really in probably the only way you can these days anything more preachy would be cringeworthy and anything serious wouldnt work in the end i was pleased that the filmmakers were able to get their point across so effectivelythis isnt the funniest movie ive seen even in a while but it does have something worth a look anyway,black_comedy
its like an assignment for a film school students final project  make a movie about a spokesman for big tobacco and make viewers sympathize with him by this measure succeedsand it succeeds on other counts as well the expected satire of the tobacco industry is here and its intelligent and somewhat enlightening but its also nicely restrained and takes a back seat to bigger topicstobacco is just one example the film seems to say of larger evils at work in society those evils include the sad state of rhetoric and debate in the age of sound bites mediamanipulation across a spectrum that includes movies talk shows and congressional hearings and a morphed definition of personal and career success that suggests that a moral compass is far less important than possessing rare  and therefore valuable  skillsa plot device has nick naylor aaron eckhart explaining himself to the viewer by having to explain himself to his son who travels with dad as he schmoozes movie execs and bribes cigarette critics all in a days work we see the internal logic that holds together an industry whose products kill 400000 in the us each year and the surprisingly reasonablesounding principles its golden boy spokesman leans on to justify his workis light on laugh outloud humor and theres not much plot exposition but its breezy style and cleverly framed philosophical questions make it an engaging and worthwhile film,black_comedy
personally im a very politically incorrect person i spit on anyone whos a greene andor a gun control lobbyist in the street though i havent got the chance yet and ill bully anyone whos a communist or any of the above also ill bully anyone who aggravates smokers though im not one myself i cant stand people who pick on smokers especially fat people since its a persons right to smoke though im no fan of the smoking industry or its dirty tactics i just love this movie for the message it sends smoking isnt the only health problem in the world what about obesity or cancer caused by overuse of certain chemicals or disease resistance from overuse of antibiotics it also incredibly funny seeing how our smoking lobbyist cant remember his name can use just about anything you say or do against you hes superb this movie actually makes the smoking industry look worse for the tactics it uses to defend itself top marks and a recommended for antismokers,black_comedy
my comments on this movie are based on the fact i read the book first the books author christopher buckley was a speechwriter for a conservative president forget which one and had no input into the screenplay written by a hollywood insider the contrast between these two extremes just happens to highlight the major differences between themup front my simple assessment is yes this is a great movie most anyone would truly enjoy real characters playing current events and washington dc scenes all work together around hilarious dialogue and situations to scream out the errors of government spin doctors and lobbyists with a heavily satirical attitude unfortunately however the movie fails to fully portray all the aspects of the books satire and is failing because of it these weaknesses appear to satisfy politically correct viewpoints afraid of offending too many different groups ironically the very theme of the bookmovie i saw the dvd version of course which contains the normal stuff director commentaries deleted scenes with commentary etc and the mostinteresting interview of author screenwriter actor and financier from the charlie rose show highly recommended despite the failings warning i go on now into some specifics and some are spoilers so if that bothers you please skip the rest of my comments even though the screenwriter states it was easy making the movie from the book he also admits to creating his own final storyline christopher buckley was interestingly silent for most of the interview so the major differences with the book show the contrast in authors viewpoints in several ways1 the portrayal of smokers and their lobbyists some of the most hilarious moments of the book revolve around the absurdity of places where smokers can puff away whenever they want and the physical results of this the movie never even shows a cigarette let alone one lit or someone puffing on one how can a theme based off the smokers lobby never show a smoker  its crazy and some producertype obviously made a decision to nix this  again contrary to the whole premise of ripping the pc craze2 women in general sex scenes in specific another major contribution to the theme from the book involves women and sex how the powerhungry use it especially women in high places using low methods to get their way admittedly not a new thought but the lack of this emphasis in the movie not typical for hollywood lessens the portrayal of the lead character nick naylor is such a selfserving spinner that he thinks everything in his life was a result of his perfect spin in reality he slowly realizes hes the one being spun its his relations with women that first begin his realization that he is out of control not in control the movie totally misses this and simply portrays nick as a nice guy getting by it definitely needed to elevate sexual tension and could have done it tastefully without risking an ma or x rating as the novel risks3 the relation with his boss is totally misportrayed the movie isnt that hurt by this but nick discovers some spin there as well in the book4 another characterdevelopment technique used in the book involves nicks inner monologue the movie does attempt this with some voiceovers but much of the novels comedy generates from them it seems a simple thing to do and wouldve fit timewise if the screenwriter hadnt chosen his most defiant change described next in 5 i wouldve used the  stopframescene acting out nicks inner thoughtsreturn to stopped framecontinue movie technique like in the ally mcbeal tv series it wouldve been hilarious while showing nicks weaknessesquick mind last warning ive purposely saved the spoilers for the last so if you dont want the plot spoiled stop reading5 spoilers the dvd interview with the screenwriter clearly points out his reading of the book was emphasized by the one question to nick what would you tell your child this one simple line in the novel caused him to totally rewrite the final change in the hero an interesting word for a lying cheating nogood spin doctor nicks estranged wife and son become the central theme and does not exist at all in the book so the plot goes from a dickensian scrooge transformation to the typical hollywood children know best and if parents would just listen to them everything would be ok there is no wrapup in the movie where nick actually becomes an antismoking lobbyist as in the book the movie spends many dozens of precious filmminutes of fatherson dialogue and character development which takes away from the theme using this time with more of nicks inner monologue wouldve vastly improved the moviewrapup see this movie  its an entertaining one but if you want the full effect of buckleys satire and nicks heroic transformation you have to read the novel time for only one  i would choose the book even though seeing the movie would actually be faster but you know what im saying,black_comedy
has been on my todo list for sometime now and im happy to say its been checked offthat kind of sounds bad well to put that last sentence to rest was one of the wittiest and funnestnot funniestwell that too movies ive seen in a little bityou have nick naylor hes the spokesman for tobacco study its his job to inform people whats going on withyou guessed it the study on cigarettes nick is a pretty big celebrity in the news because of his forward answers and decisive arguing mixed with his fullfledged backing of cigarettes he has mastered the technique of answering questions so it can favor him the entire film revolves around nicks life from his family to the missions he goes on to benefit big tobacco and each and every step of the way the film flies right by and that for me is the only drawback to this film i was hoping it would be a little longer the acting directing writingthe whole production was fantastic i just wish it was a tad longerits a sweet little film that was made with lots of love and care if youre looking for a really good satire check out youll be glad you did ,black_comedy
is not a big budget super blockbuster like the ones flooding our cinemas in recent weeks but it is definitely an impressive gem worth a watch do not be misled by the title this show takes on a neither pro nor antismoking stance the show revolves around a persistent tobacco lobbyist trying to promote the act of smoking while at the same time having to deal with consequences such as an equally persistent senator bent on crushing the whole tobacco industry death threats and general negative feelings of the people around him with regards to what hes doingtyfs does not delve deep into the issue of smoking even the final discussion on whether to put graphic labels on cigarette packs is reduced to arguments that probably at high school level we will be able to bring out but that is not the point tyfs is not a satire on smoking but rather on the art of arguments and persuasion the tobacco lobbyist is not the only one who resorts to various fallacious means to promote his stance on smoking the senator himself isnt portrayed in a positive light either as seen in a hilarious scene where he harshly rebuked his representative for choosing a healthylooking cancer boy to bring out the harmful effects of smoking to the public which negates whatever impact he could have caused as can be seen pokes fun at just almost anyone on both sides of the debate including journalists senators and even hollywood agentsit is the tongueincheek style that the show uses in its display of adult themes that makes it amusing to watch in a guilty way the whole black comedic atmosphere has already been set up right immediately after the beginning credits and the humour ranges from the absolutely politically incorrect to the very occasional slapstick ones which surprisingly end up being really funny as well i am not a good judge of acting skill but i am biased towards maria bello simply love all the shows she stars in and this one is no exception highly recommended,black_comedy
the thing i liked about this movie is that it doesnt just deal with each sides arguments in the cigarette debate but it actually looks at the concept of argument itself particularly politically it points out the spin that influences what the public believes regarding everything from government to medical research and it mocks the concept of impartiality all while being witty and unpatronizingyoull appreciate this movie regardless of your take on smoking the film does have a slightly antitobacco company subplot but its not antismoker it doesnt seek to vilify anyone its an equal opportunity offender,black_comedy
i watched the movie laughed out loud but comes the end of the show and i look at my mate and both of i are trying to puzzle out what was that about is it a satire on how the cigarette industry behaves  no not really is it about spin  not reallyafter some thought i think it is about us we know that what nick is doing is not right but in some way we all want to be nick we admire him because he is smooth and generally gets what he wants as much as we like to be idealists we all make pragmatic decisions in life to pay the mortgage nick i think just does it in style maybe that is what the writer is telling usthe movie will make you laugh but will be something different from what you expect go and see it and then spend countless hours discussing what it was about with your friends,black_comedy
im not a smoker so i didnt see the movie to be shocked by the welldocumented and understood effects of smoking in fact i mostly went because this girl i met wanted to go see itbut i found while i was watching that the movie is a fascinating look at the power of language and charisma in fact its almost irrelevant that the movie is about smoking because the principles that eckharts character nick naylor applies to his arguments are universally used by those who deflect attention from their real motives and goalsthe script is ingenious using naylors son as a confidant for naylor to reveal his methods felt natural and compounded naylors sins my favorite moment of the film and maybe the most revealing as a comment on how propaganda succeeds is when naylor creates an analogy for his son about how arguing over whether smoking causes cancer is similar to an argument over whether vanilla ice cream is better than chocolate they stage the fake argument and naylor begins twisting the discussion until hes talking about freedom of choice in ice cream flavors or something like that flustered his son says but thats not what were talking aboutbut thats what im talking about emphasizes nayloryou can almost picture bush saying this exact thing to a roomful of reporterspress where are the weapons of mass destruction bush we have liberated the iraqi people from a terrible dictator p but thats not what were talking about b but thats what im talking aboutfantastic also brilliant is the fact that the black comedy remains black to the very end the entire story all the plot points all the character arcs even the resolution are straightforward story elements but they are all subverted this point was kind of lost on the audience i watched the movie with as dark jokes were sometimes absorbed in puzzlement especially later onat the point in the film where most black comedies would have the protagonist starting to realize the error of his ways naylor is having an argument with his colleagues over whose profession is most deserving of death threats from terrorists he unashamedly contends that cigarettes as a proved killer of a half million people a year are far more deserving than alcohol or guns of the spite that leads to death threats later at a moment of crisis when most protagonists would be repenting for their childrens sake naylor sticks to his guns and swallows his own propaganda wholethis is also unique because the movie does not paint him i cant think of another film that achieves such a calculated moral detachment from its repulsive subject ultimately this makes it easier for the viewer to pass judgment on naylor and his moral flexibility because god knows americans hate being told what to thinkhighly recommended,black_comedy
i find it quite rare that i enjoy a modern movie ie one made this decade this is a welcome exception thoughtprovoking but not in a whiny manner the film entertains and intrigues in equal measure the lead character is nick naylor a supersmooth tobacco lobbyist who can spin any yarn to anybody faced with a challenge from a democrat senator he has to unleash his skills without going into the plot too deeply the film ends on a refreshingly different note to the one i expected i was waiting for the traditional hollywood happy ending where a baddy finds his morals and reforms his behaviour not so in this picture this film essentially pokes fun at all sides of the tobacco debate from the merciless cigarette barons to the annoying leftwing killjoys who become consumed with such hatred of their opposition that they lose sight of the original issue the acting is spot on whilst at around 90 minutes its well paced and doesnt drag worth a look,black_comedy
an extremely twisted fairy tale a darkly amusing tale about a tobacco lobbyist so good named nick naylor the excellent aaron eckhart at his job that you nearly like him you do at least respect his ability to misrepresent and confuse the issue so that on reflection the tobacco industry is not seen as opportunistic or moneygrubbing this is the role of a lifetime for aaron eckhart and he knocks it out of the park his square jaw projects an air of decency that is not undermined by his seemingly honest smile in this film however what is most impressive about his ability as a lobbyist is his ability to distort the discussion so that one is not arguing whether one likes one thing or another but whether ones freedom is under attack as he tells his son in illuminating his modus operandi that of changing the discussion from whether one likes one thing or another to whether ones even childrens rights are being curbed in restricting their access to tobacco advertising i dont have to convince you i have to convince them he says referring to large audiences who watch and also to the fact that he obviously did not convince his son that one thing was better than another but only that those watching on television might be convinced that a man selling tobacco might be correctan interesting part of the film for me was his relationship with his son the talented cameron bright as joey naylor it was interesting and is credit to the sharpasatack christopher buckley who wrote the short story on which chris reitman yes that reitman bases his screenplay he also directs that someone as morally flexible as eckhart might be a good parent it seems difficult for him to resolve his talking out of both sides of his mouth for the majority of the movie but ultimately while he has seemed like quite a good parent he does make a decision which will allow him to look his son in the eyes a bit more as the film progresses and it seems that he is a good parent but a soulsucking fraud professionally the contradiction between those two roles becomes more distinct and one hopes for a positive resolution the contradiction between these two parts during the film makes for some entertaining scenes between father and son though for instance his explanation of his professional obligations to his son essentially specifies that one has to have certain lax moral standards in order to do his job he explains his ability as a parent by suggesting to his intelligent but obviously impressionable tweener son that the only way to reconcile his professional dishonesty and personal integrity was that you had to be a lawyerthe film is still very entertaining and a scabrous but not harsh take on some characters who could be reprehensible if they were not depicted as human beings with personalities and an understanding of the work they did the filmmakers are more than generous to lobbyists for some harmful interests the weekly meetings between the chief lobbyists of the alcohol maria bello very crisp and poised as polly bailey tobacco eckhart and gun david koechner as the honest and redneckoutofwater bobby jay bailey lobbies who dryly refer to themselves as the mod merchants of death shows professionals well aware of the harm that their products pose and who joke darkly about which of them has been most penalized for promoting their product they boast about which has been most sanctioned for the impropriety of their advertising and promotionkatie holmes has a role as a prominent washington reporter named heather holloway who sells out some of eckharts indefensible lobbying tactics after they become involved he claims to have been sold out while she maintains that she is not doing anything other than leveraging her sources in a way less unethical than he her presence on stage seems quite thin and she does not have the emotional or dramatic heft to convey the aura of a highly connected washington reporter william h macy is typically excellent as the supposedly liberal northeastern senator with the wacky old money senate name of ortolan k finisterre and at least an outward commitment to supposedly stereotypical liberal causes if birkenstocks and socks are some indication who is committed to weakening the tobacco lobby and who works hard and earnestly to do so he is furious when one of his top aides is rhetorically twisted in knots by eckhart and he finally extracts some revenge when he is able to reveal the essentially unethical nature of eckharts job descriptionto defend the promotional activities of tobacco companies adam brody as the assistant to a hollywood honcho is hilarious in his scene in which he spreads office pap in passing and rob lowe is at his smarmy straightman best as a hollywood exec who seems expectedly pompous and humorless but is revealed to be more than a bit weird jk simmons perhaps most famous from his recurring role as the psychiatrist on law and order is excellent as the lobbying company head who seems only mildly competent but fears the wrath of tobacco company honchos and while wishing to appear tough would drive off a cliff for his boss ultimately this is a very generously spirited film which doesnt demean lobbyists but recognizes them as people while at the same time revealing how outrageous some of their claims are,black_comedy
after trooping to the cinema many times this year only to be pretty disappointed on most occasions it was with some trepidation that i bought the tickets for this one how wrong i was the sweetest joy is one you dont expect and this film certainly proved that where do i start the casting was top class script was as sharp as a vipers tooth and the laughs were bellyaching such a clever plot with many aspects and stories keeping your attention throughout how wonderful to cover such a controversial subject in a such a way no organisation or person were exempt from the stinging attacks on the motivations and actions of good and bad guys alike if you get to see only one film then i recommend this to anyone who likes a film to challenge your perceptions and at the same time make you laugh like a drain,black_comedy
i have decided to never go to a sequel at the theater a decision i based on the following three reasons 1 sequels are generally disappointing cash cows that discourage true creativity2 it is no cheaper to go to a sequel than a fresh movie and i really dislike putting out that much money for a tired premise3 i now have a large screen surroundsound home theater that is a perfectly acceptable alternative once the movie is available on netflixhaving said all of that i loved and particularly loved the merchants of death sequence and characters i would go to the theater to see a sequel that explores the back stories of the alcohol and firearms merchants in much the same way this movie delved into the tobacco lobby although having grown up in winstonsalem i have a particular dislike for the tobacco industry great film well worth the price of admission,black_comedy
id like to show this movie to people entering business school what i liked most about this movie was that it was ridiculous in a very realistic way the business world often is just that i really felt like the casting with the exception of katie holmes was excellent personally though i know that most people would disagree with me i think thats a role that anne hathaway could have knocked out of the park with her sense of timing and grace holmes however was just a little too average in her delivery for the part the lines of morality that are crossed and sometimes trampled upon like when he says ill buy him his first pack require the viewer to become uncomfortable not because of what they are watching but rather because they know that society does include people like that heck they might even be one,black_comedy
this black comedy is possibly the best film ive seen all year and here i was thinking that xmen would be the best that hollywood would have to offer this year and was feeling morose about it eckhart as the antihero was fabulous and it was the only movie ive seen in years which made me want to go straight back in and see it again  my companions unanimously agreedi loved the way i came out hating the characters id traditionally have liked and sympathised with and sympathising with the characters i would usually loathe and despise quite aside from the cynical and engaging writing not to mention the droolworthy lead i found myself laughing with affronted disbelief at some of the things being fed through the spinwheelsthis movie will be deconstructed and quoted for many years to come and if its not it should be,black_comedy
wwwkajatmcom is a satirical comedy about the sultan of spin tobacco lobbyist nick naylor aaron eckhardt and his job as professional talker for big tobacco throughout the movie we follow nick on his career for big tobacco his struggle to raise his son joey naylor cameron bright in a way that wont go against his stance for big tobacco his meetings with his mod merchant of death friends his professional fight with vermont senator ortolan k finnistirre william h macy and his love relationship with heather holloway katie holmesthe movie opens up with nick naylor being a guest on a talk show that includes a panel of antitobacco group members and cancer boy who at the age of 15 has been diagnosed with cancer from smoking the opening scene of this movie really sets the tone by showing how nick naylor and big tobacco have the ability to put a spin on any negative situationduring the beginning of the movie nick meets up with an up and coming newspaper reporter heather holloway katie holmes who is doing a piece on big tobacco she uses nick by sleeping with him to gain information that is supposed to off the record about big tobacco and his mod friends this results in heather holloway having the ability to gain inside information to write an article that is going to advance her career this wasnt much of an acting stretch for katie as this role is very similar to her current life at some point in her life i bet that her agent came to her and said hey i have a great idea you sleep with tom cruise and youll be able to advance her career good job on whoring yourself out not only on screen but in real life too your parents must be proudrobert duvall plays the original master of spin doak the capitan boykin who is a father figure to nick naylor impressed with his ability to make any situation positive for big tobacco the capitan assigns nick to visit hollywood super agent jeff megall rob lowe to try to convince hollywood to put the sexiness of smoking back on screen while visiting jeff megall the capitan wants nick to visit lorne lutch sam elliot the original marlboro man who is dying of cancer from his years of smoking and give him a case of money in an attempt to bribe him from speaking out against big tobacco these two scenes were some of my favorite in the movie first the scene with jeff megall really shows how hollywood individuals can make anything possible on screen this is best demonstrated by one line of a dialog jeff and nick are talking about having a new movie in space where the main characters will smoke in a 100 oxygen environment since smoking in that kind of environment would cause an explosion jeff decides that this can be fixed with the line thank god we created the xxxxx which gives us the ability to smoke second the scene with lorne lutch truly demonstrates how greedy people really are even though lorne is dying from his years of smoking the case of money that big tobacco is offering really changes his mind i think that i really like this scene because nick does an excellent job of using reverse psychology to get lorne to take the moneythe movie ends with a one on one show down between senator finistirre and nick naylor in a senate hearing that is discussing adding skull and cross bones to cigarette labels so that everyone is aware that cigarettes are poison nick makes some good points in his argument against adding the labels including that everyone knows cigarettes are bad for you and showing that cigarettes arent really much worse than eating cheese from the state of vermont because in the end both of them are eventually going to kill you one of my biggest issues with this scene is that nick argues that is a parents responsibility to educate their kids on the harmful effects of cigarettes and then in the next breath he says that if his son wants a cigarette on his 18th bday he would buy him his first pack correct me if i am wrong but isnt nick kind of being a hypocrite this movie has quite the star studded cast including katie holmes william h macy maria bello rob lowe sam elliot and robert duvall between william h macy sam elliot and robert duvall this was bound to be a good movie honestly i could watch a movie of these three guys if the entire movie consisted of them just going to the zoo for the day i really enjoyed this movie and i would recommend anyone seeing it i think that i would have enjoyed it a lot more if all the good lines to the movie werent shown in the trailers that i had seen it wasnt as good at the world fastest indian or match point but it came in a close secondbut then again what do i know,black_comedy
written and directed by jason reitmantobacco lobbyist nick naylor imparts many practical approaches to lifes many problems upon all the people he deals with he tells people how to see things for a living and knows that theyre listening to him no one person is perhaps listening to him more than his own son and though nicks confidence might blind him into a false sense of security in life he is not so far removed as to not know that the molding of his sons mind is his most important job thus when he tells his son that if you argue correctly then you are never wrong it is not only the true beauty of argument but it is also a strong decisive direction to give your son in that moment he is a good father and not one of the most hated faces in america this dichotomy between person and persona is what makes nick naylor real and aaron echkarts portrayal of naylor as it is guided along its unexpected journey by director jason reitman is what makes a real smart comedyanyone i know who has avoided seeing this film has done so because they didnt want to see satirical look at smoking the shame there is that this film avoids clichs whenever it can and doesnt bother wasting its or our time positioning naylor to learn a lesson about tobacco being bad the lesson naylor must learn is about pride as his is shaken during the course of the film by a disparaging piece of journalism when life kicks you to the floor it does not necessarily mean that everything you knew beforehand was wrong ironically the last time life did that to me is when i started smoking naylor had a pretty good idea about how to make life work for him but he stopped believing in himself and when you cant convince yourself of something you certainly cant convince others further to the root of this hilarious film are purpose and drive naylors biggest criticism from those who know him is pointed at his choice to lobby for big tobacco it seems an easy place to start but it negates that naylor is good at what he does he can argue well for those who no one else would dream to argue for it therefore becomes an inspiration to push yourself as far as possible when you find what youre truly good at and once youre doing something you might as well do it as well as you can because at the end of the day everyones got their mortgage to pay for and you cant come back with nothing thats a little approach to life i learned from a smoothtalking guy named nick naylorson of director ivan reitman jason has clearly found what hes good at is his first fulllength film and it is sharp and witty it has an energy that is infectious and a style that is both cool and hip much in the way one sees smokers minus the cancer yellow teeth and bad breath from the flashy popart of the opening credits shaped into cigarette packages to the usage of split screens ironic subtitling and video reitman crafts a sexy slick film that could have easily turned any of its viewers on to smoking however in perhaps what is reitmans most brilliant touch to this film not one character ever lights up,black_comedy
i adored this movie and laughed my way through it aaron eckhart was a perfect casting choice the only other person i can think of who has that kind of millionwatt grin is george clooney but i honestly dont think even he could have carried this role so well the only flaw was katie holmes its not so much that shes a bad actor or has the tom cruise taint as that she just looks too young and given that shes ten years younger that eckhart maybe she simply is too young i dont think she was horrible just that she was so poorly cast and frankly couldnt hold her own in such a fantastic ensemblenevertheless the constant tongueincheek wittiness throughout the film keeps it flowing along even at the slowest moments naylors comeback to heather holloways expose is classic and hysterical rob lowe shines and deserved more screen time and william h macy as always takes what could have been a stereotyped character and gives it a real personalitywhere i think the movie excels however is its ending if naylor had backed down at the end and had a hollywoodstyle change of heart it would have ruined the whole film for me this movie wasnt about a happy ending it was a satire pure and simple naylor admitting he wouldnt let his son smoke and then moving on to be a lobbyist for amnesty international wouldnt have been satisfying or true to the filmreitman deserves major kudos not only for refusing to moralizing at the end but also for making his debut film such a success if he continues to follow in his fathers footsteps i expect great things to come,black_comedy
good debut for jason reitman i read about five years ago at the time i didnt know chris buckley was the son of goodole william but the book is funny satire is funny right the movie is wellacted and the parts very carefullychosen from what ive read reitman assembled an excellent cast with the possible exception of katie holmes but as long as everybody likes her   the sections that people seem to have problems with are those that didnt make it into the script for time concerns when nick naylor is forced into a van in the book after multiple investigations the police and the fbi believe that naylor has faked his kidnapping as a publicity stunt he survives in both because of his excessive smoking which allows him not to be killed from his entire body being covered with nicotine patches this is funny right the only problem i have with this movie is that no one smokes on screen a very conscious decision im sure,black_comedy
was a part comical part surreal if you will nick naylor aaron eckhart plays a hated speaker for the smoking industry and is high up in the authority chain of the business hated by all but his employees and his son joey naylor cameron brightjill naylor kim dickens divorced from nick to try and raise their son up right but every time nick gets a chance with young joey he always teaches him something that joey will use to persuade his mother to letting him do thingsin the end something occurs to him forcing him into quitting my final rating 10 of 10 a must see,black_comedy
i saw this and had a flashback of gordon gecko in wall street dont get me wrong wall sreet is a great flick but the whole carrying yourself with confidence and rolling with it was great i love the idea that you argue to win the others not who your arguing with overall i felt it was a good movie and worth the view i wish they could have expanded on rob lowes part but hey what can you expect from a novel adaptation the kid in the movie was great though the whole segue with the modsquad idea was comedic but to the point i applaud this effort seeing some of the drivel that is being forced down our throats at the box office,black_comedy
when i first went to the movie i saw the scene where nick and katie holmes are doing it and everything we the interesting thing however is i went to another screening of it about a week later and there was a short cut in the film and this scene was cut out i was wondering if anyone else noticed this or maybe it was either an error or a specific edit from the movie theater which i attend i would appreciate any feedback you guys have i found this to be quite interesting btw i thought this was an awesome movie and if you have not seen it yet i suggest you do asap it is much better than most of the crap out there right now,black_comedy
i have to say by far is the best movie i have seen this year todate i had first had my doubts thinking this movie would be one which the viewer sits through two hours of a biases political statement showing how hollywood feels if a person is willing to spend 850 on a movie ticket then the viewer is willing to listen to 850 worth of worthless propaganda my doubts were disproved when the movie in a very satirical manner showed the ludicrous ideas behind the witchhunt people in the us find themselves in trying to stop people from smoking along with that of the smoking companies trying to prove that it is not a dangerous product overall if you can laugh at a moving skillfully poking fun at the peoples shortcomings and can handle a bit of vulgarity anyone would enjoy this movie,black_comedy
from previous reviews in the media i expected a satire on smoking and the tobacco industry but this film has an even broader reach than that it also parodies the techniques and deftness of the masters of spin who can say convince a child that vanilla is a better flavor of ice cream than the childs previously preferred chocolate and the things many people will do to pay their mortgageseckhardt as nick naylor is the driving force of this movie and he does a superb job although with great assistance from other cast members i particularly liked the boy who plays his son the marlboro man and the characters played by robert duvall william macy and rob lowe but all were goodtheres liberal use of adult often sexual language plus some sexual scenes so its not suitable for children unless you want to explain what those words mean why the child shouldnt say them and why that couple kept humping each other that waybut its a fun movie for adults to see  and possibly far more enjoyable if they are nonsmokers or former smokers,black_comedy
funny how this film seems so unpretentious and yet its probably the high point of this movie season in terms of exposing an important but neglected topic aaron eckharts performance as the wonderfully written lead nick naylor is flawless and memorable his attitude as one of tobaccos top public relations men is so palpably american it seems almost treasonous to suggest that it might be as destructive as napalm but the movie courageously gives us a cleareyed view of the strategic thinking that goes on at a top pr firm on behalf of one of our most profitable industries too bad it couldnt just go on to skewer all the blowhards were confronted with in other aspects of our everyday life i smiled all the way through this film and i cant imagine any other film doing as good a job pointing out how untroubled these pr people are nicks not so farfetched handling of dubious grade schoolers is a great example aaron grew up as a mormon i understand and thats a juicy bit to try to keep in mind as you watch him do his thing he reminds me of the young bruce willis in moonlighting but with less of a conscience,black_comedy
what is most pleasing about is its skewering of the public relationslobbying professionals who shield interest groups from public scrutiny aaron eckhart does excellent work embodying the conscienceless types that inhabit these roles however his change of heart at the end is both unconvincing and contrary to the reality of washington behavior to the tobacco and gun lobbies spotlighted here one could easily add many lobbies that defend the defensible on behalf of the business sector recent performances of spokesmen for the oil and drug lobbies are a case in point william macy is a superb foil as the tobacco lobbys senatorial foe who has some skeletons rattling around in his own closet however i would have made him a senator from wisconsin instead of vermont wisconsin is the main cheesesupplying state perhaps its chris buckleys background that led him to make macys character a senator from the northeast instead of the midwest,black_comedy
yes this movie is sometimes funny and aaron eckhart is as good as you expect in his role as nick naylor but it all seems pretty tame compared to stuff done every night on american television on shows like the daily show and the colbert report not quite up to the hype and the glowing praise the film has received at some point gets a bit repetitive and seems to go on a bit too long even though its barely 90 minutes in length you get it after the first 25 minutesrob lowe and of course robert duvall are both amusing in their brief appearances in the film but their appearances seem almost too brief still this hardly seems like a must see movie in any respect,black_comedy
is one of the few movies that have nearly mastered one of the most important elements in a plot characterization the filmmakers talent is assiduously shown through the characters in the film during the film we are evenly acquainted to the lesser mentioned characters of the story while being predominantly focused on our main character even though these other characters are not mentioned as much as our protagonist we feel that we know just as much about them as we do himour story begins at the daytime talk show the joan lunden show we meet our main character nick naylor aaron eckhart a lobbyist that supports the big tobacco company on the show nick is faced with antitobacco activists and a cancer boy the whole crowd is against nick booing him as he is mentioned nick does not change his expression for he is confident that he will be able to convince the crowd that he is defending an innocent cooperation he reverses the crowds opinion of him onto the antitobacco activists saying that the big tobacco company wants to keep the cancer boy alive while the antitobacco activists want him dead so it supports their cause after this scene the audiences is introduced to nicks godgiven talent arguingafter the talk show nick is commended at his office where we meet his scabrous boss br jk simmons which is only one of the many characters we meet throughout the movie along with br we are also acquainted to the mod merchants of death squad which consist of bobby jay bliss david koechner a spokesman for the department of fire arms and polly bailey maria bello the spokesman for alcohol products each friday the mod squad meets at a restaurant and talk about recent events with sales and other subjects related to their jobs we also see nicks opponent senator ortolan finistirre william h macy a female reporter named heather holloway katie holmes and nicks son joey naylor cameron bright though i do not give too much information on each of these characters due to the risk of spoiling the movie each of these characters is wonderfully built out from the minute they speak we feel we have already known them we are given enough information of each character to fully satisfy us which is the high point of the movie because each character is memorable and humorous in their waysthe movie gives our main character two major conflicts facing his opponent senator finistirre and remaining a role model to his son while he still has many setbacks nick handles these problems with a smooth style that we love to see we are thoroughly interested in nicks life throughout the movie and we want to see morethis movie appeals to a wide audience that audience is anyone that enjoys a smart comedy children are not recommended for this movie for there are many explicit references and scenes profanity is constant and parents might not like their children to see a movie where there is a positive message in smoking although it is backed up with a fair balanced debate of how it is also terrible for your health teenagers will love this movie but the main focus is middleaged men and women for they can relate to many of the characters conflicts and beliefsi loved because it did not focus mainly on the way the tobacco company is constantly panned by the media it focuses on one mans ability to talk his way out of anything and how it benefits his life nicks philosophy in life is if you argue right you are right and this movie continuously proves that statement throughout the film the acting is great the story is gripping and the humor is smart and sassy this movie is one of the best movies of the year so far and i definitely recommend seeing it in theaters8910 z schulz,black_comedy
when i originally heard about i expected to be walking into a very funny i was quite impressed by the trailer i admit antismoking smear campaign which to be fair it is easy to see this movie becoming but directorscreenwriter jason reitman is much more intelligent than that he doesnt try to turn his movie into some huge michael moore style aggressive takedown but instead refrains from taking sides on the issue at hand as doing so would make the film no better than what it satirises instead reitman focuses less on the rightwrong of the industry and more on the man who represents it nick naylor aaron eckhart perfectly cast chief lobbyist and spin artist for the tobacco industry the film chronicles the journey of naylor as he peruses through his daily life spinning sweet talking and basically trying his absolute hardest to win as many people as possible over to the idea that smoking is cool as would be suspected near the end naylor begins to question the morality of his work  a decision which is definitely helped by a very near death experience a horrifyingly confidential news article written by a seductive reporter katie holmes and the constant nagging sense that he is being a bad father by permitting his son a brilliant cameron bright to idolise his less than morally sound profession the storyline is compelling indeed with a rapidfire and very clever script always managing to stay one step ahead of itself and the audience all the way through at many occasions during the movie the storyline seems to hint at stumbling a bit which leads us to fear the pace might be broken and the mood ruined ie the introduction of a romance element naylors relationship with his son both hint at being too sentimental needless to say this never happens reitman is far too intelligent to fall prey to such common storytelling traps and the plot moves along quickly and surely never faltering along the way one might interpret the character of naylor as an antagonistic figure but eckharts wonderfully skewed charisma keeps us rooting for the character even if his winning speeches become more and more disgusting declaring on public television that he wouldnt want a cancerous 15 year old to die because he would be losing a customer has to set some new standards of low but eckharts wonderful lead performance is backed by several other highly entertaining inputs from the talented supporting cast what seems surprising is how youngest cast member 13 year old cameron bright delivers one of the most impressive performances although it does help that he gets some of the best lines the superb script has to offer  please dont ruin my childhood when his father appears to talk to his class however some of the films funniest scenes are also provided by naylors mod squad comprised of himself and the main spokespeople for the alcohol and firearms industries maria bello and david koechner both hilarious in particular koechner and there are also enjoyable little roles from robert duvall as the head of the tobacco industry sam elliot as the grizzled former face of marlboros cigarettes rob lowe adam brody and jk simmons as naylors very j jonah jameson esq yet still unreasonably enjoyable boss all in all is one of those few films that manage to be funny profound and just draw the line before preaching and overt sentimentalism it makes some genuinely important points about media societys reaction to it and well smoking in general its also interesting to note that despite the subject matter never once do we see anyone light up throughout the entire film is a very relevant film and would prove important and thought provoking viewing for the majority of society and hell its really well made intelligent and above all else funny as well whats to lose really 910,black_comedy
having read the book i hoped that the movie would keep the droll infectious humor it did having absolutely no memory of anything else about the book i was pleased to be treated to its perverse message as a fresh experiencethis is a funny smart cynical look at the world of american spin doctors and one in particular aaron eckhardt who plies his trade with great effectiveness for the tobacco industry it is of course a satire by the lesser known  but more palatable  of the buckley brothers in the tradition of waugh or more recently condon unlike them buckleys humor zings rather than stings no blood is drawn but many a shibboleth is skewerednick naylor eckhardt works for big tobacco as a lobbyist he does this because as he tells everyone who asks to pay the mortgage to his son he is more honest because i am morally flexible roundly hated by the morally upright he manages to come out on top in many awkward and potentially dangerous public appearances his wife has left him for a self pretentious doctor and his only friends are respectively a lobbyist for the alcohol industry and the fire arms industry they have lunch once a week and try to one up each other in war stories and fatality statistics and call themselves the mod merchants of death squad on a tv talk show he is told by a caller that he is marked for death he is kidnapped and in one of movies most hilarious hit scenes he is plastered with nicotine patches and left for dead in the arms of the lincoln statue he only survives because as a smoker he has built up tolerance for nicotine now as a victim he rises to higher famethen he makes the mistake of sleeping with a journalist katie holmes who he was warned away from by his mod buddies she fs and tells all about his off the record bragging and inside information suddenly he is out of a job noone wants to see how sausage is made in the end he acquits and redeems himself in an appearance before congress one of the movies few weak scenes and goes on to sell his expertise to the highest bidder  we last see him coaching the cell phone industry in how to spin brain tumors this movie will not make much money  the american movie watching public is not big on satire  its too subtle but it will please many who like to be amused by well written intelligent droll jabs at americas delusion that style is more important than substanceeckhardt is excellent using his low key intensity well look out for a nice piece of over the top acting by sam elliot as a dying marlboro man unfortunately rob lowe falls flat in the movies only leaden too campy scene that tries to poke fun at californias zen pretentiousness it seems his departure from the west wing was his david caruso mistake,black_comedy
what a pleasant surprise a modernday satire that workscredit director scriptor janson reitman for some cool dialog clever situations and a movie that never lets down of course christopher buckleys novel obviously played a great partaaron eckhard is just fine as the man most folks like to boochief tobacco spokesman likewise cameron bright is natural as his young son reading his lines like a trouperthe entire cast works at top level allowing the viewer to empathize with these poor workers who have mortgages to pay never thought id laugh at jokes about the ravages of smoking but this film did the impossiblereally a gem,black_comedy
this film was not shown at the big mainstream theaters and was not a feelgood movie but it gave some insight to how the tobacco industry works i enjoyed watching it and had plenty of playful dialog the main characters son seems to act twice as old as he was he might have been the wrong actor to cast the movie brought some good laughs while bringing people back to earthit makes a good argument to those who are holierthanthou when it comes to antismoking at the same time when im nodding to what is said about the antismoking campaign i want to vomit sometimes when you consider the way they market cigarettes in summary its a movie that makes the nonanti smoker think hard about how an industry is fighting for survival a pleasure to watch,black_comedy
judging by the title one would likely assume that this film was satirical in nature this much is true what the audience supposed to take away from this film is something entirely different the story follows nick naylor a spokesperson for the tobacco industry played by aaron eckhart nick is probably one of the most hated people in the country but he is proud of what he does and he does it well he doesnt publicly make excuses or apologize for his career privately he is dealing with questions by his young son nick is desperately trying to explainjustify his job to him with a positive spin as time goes on nick begins to ever so slightly question the job himselfit seems that almost every role in this film is filled out by a wellknown actor or at least a recognizable face all of this talent leads to some wonderful performances and memorable characters there are definitely some laughs throughout this picture the jokes are probably best described as those you feel guilty laughing aboutthis film is in no way preachy about the harmful effects of smoking or anything of the like so what do we take away from this film its hard to say it doesnt demonize or glorify the spin and propaganda created by large corporations or the people that work for them one theme that did stick out to me is that everyone has a mortgage to pay should we question what people do for a living are we or arent we responsible for the decisions that we make this film just left me asking a lot of questions hopefully that was the intent not to lecture but to generate a bit of thought i dont know if this movie was strong enough for me to recommend everyone to run out and see it the film wont bore you but it probably wont wow you either with the current box office being chock full of horror flicks and almost devoid of comedy this might be your cup of teathursday night movie club rating 575800 mischief mayhem movies wwwthursdaynightmovieclubblogspotcom a coauthored blog by two very real people dedicated to the weekly review of a film handselected by the thursday night movie club instead of the clichd stars or thumbs after discussing a film we rate it based on the amount of money we think its worth paying to see it come check us out,black_comedy
im not a regular movie goer nor do i follow hollywood but being active in both youth smoking prevention and adult cessation i thought id share a bit different take tyfns touches on a number of tobacco control issues most importantly the influence of teen idol smoking in movies arguably the largest single influence on youth smoking initiation imagine the message sent to hollywood by a movie whose entire focus is about smoking yet never once does any character smoke the nearest thing i recall was a pack of marlboro on the mod squads tableother issues touched upon were industry funded research which is now using major universities industry funded youth smoking prevention campaigns such as philip morris liability limiting corporate responsibility tv and magazine campaign of halftruths which blames everyone but pm usa for youth smoking primarily parents and peers parents buying cigarettes for their children even if 18 and politicians always being three steps behind the industry the industry truly has coopted the liberty card smokers rights when in the hierarchy of freedoms one persons rights should stop at another persons nose and in the health hierarchy individual liberties fall somewhere between life 438000 annual us deaths about 5 million worldwide and happiness picture 12 billion nicotine addicts 70 of whom would today assert that they want to be free but just cant seem to pull if offthe wildest scene was when antismoking zealots kidnapped nick and attempted to kill him by covering his body in nicotine patches nicotines lethal dose is about three drops or 60 mg for a 160 lb person  more deadly than arsenic cyanide strychnine or diamond back rattlesnake venom you couldnt pick a better place to leave a half naked chemical slave whose master was about to take his life than in the arms of honest abe the great emancipator i enjoyed the movie and hope the underlying theme of greed birthing flexible morals is not lost on young viewers we have an ever growing list of tremendously worthwhile causes and much work before usjohn r polito nicotine dependency preventioncessation educator,black_comedy
while american dreamz is the more mainstream more accessible mockumentary of the moment in hollywood clearly blows it out of the water with its endlessly quotable dialogue and brilliant characters you cannot help but root for aaron eckharts smarmy tobacco lobbyist nick naylor as he embarks on a oneman tobacco crusade naylor does not lack in selfconfidence as he tells the audience michael jordan plays ball charles manson kills people i talk some priceless moments include his negotiations with the cancerstricken marlboro man and his assault on the cheeseeating birkenstockclad william h macy who plays a clever vermont senator who tries to stand tough on tobacco featuring similarly shining performances from rob lowe and robert duvall delivers boatloads of unfiltered fun for all,black_comedy
few movies actually compel me to take action after viewing it sideways made me want to brush up on my wine tasting knowledge harold and kumar go to white castle made me want to go to white castle and now we have another movie to add to the list all right it didnt really make me want to smokebut it could haveis a satirical comedy that focuses on nick naylor aaron eckhart a lobbyist for the big tobacco companies we meet naylor on the joan lunden show as he defends himself against two antismoking groups robin the cancer boy and lunden herself naylor keeps his cool as he turns and says its in our best interest to keep robin alive and smoking we come to learn nick naylor is not only a god to the tobacco industry but hes smart and attractive you know the guy who can pick up any girl im him on crack nicks also divorced with a son joey he loves his son and even brings him on business trips to hollywood to bribe an excigarette spokesman to keep him from speaking out against smoking in the end we see that nick is actually a good guy whos just really good at his job that and it pays his mortgage what looks to begin as a satirical comedy about an industry and one man turns out to be a comedy about a man whos just trying to keep his job his friends and his familythank you is based off the mid90s book by christopher buckley it was directed by jason reitman whos made nothing of significance until now however his father ivan is the director of my favorite movie of all time ghostbusters which is a huge plus reitman handles the material very well in his adaptation to the screen hes also pretty lucky to have gotten his firstchoice actors for every role in his movie and without knowing how the movie might have been with different actors we can safely say that reitman was blessed with his entire castaaron eckhart has always been a good actor youd just never have known it because he hasnt been given much quality material to work with until now hes great as the suave and smart nick naylor however whats probably most enjoyable about this film is its supporting cast william h macy jk simmons katie holmes maria bello and david koechner all help make this film one of the best indie films of the yearand now to end my review with a shamelessly punny sentence is a hilariously addictive comedygrade a,black_comedy
i saw this movie last night my attention didnt waver there were no lulls in the dialogue or scene changes the casting was top notch however knowing how old cameron bright is  a scene of him being carried to bed was a little too much maybe the role was intended more for a 7 year old instead but thats the only nitpicky thing i can say about this movie cameron got to say some of the best lines actually everyone in the cast got great lines somewhere this movie has a strong ensemble cast ebert  roeper were right to give this movie 2 thumbs upnick naylor is the main character played by aaron eckhart nick works as a living being an advocate for cigarettes this is eckharts breakout film credit he looks a lot like scott thompson from the kids in the hallwilliam h macy is always a joy to watch and he doesnt disappoint in this film his character name gets pronounced as senator fennastor katie holmes surprised me she was good in this movie rob lowe had a great cameo sequence as did adam brody whos character slayed meim not going to say anything about the storyline itself the script was thorough you knew exactly whowhat the characters were about there were interwoven story lines that tied themselves together very very well everything connected how rare is that seriously if youve forgotten how good movies can be this movie will remind you of the olden days where admission wasnt 10 and you didnt have to watch 10 mins of car commercials before the previews your attention span will not wander or tuneout unwanted product placements thankyou for smoking is worth seeing before it comes out on dvd ignore the tirades in the imdb forums go to this movie for what it is an excellently done movie that wont disappointi smoked for 25 years and have quit for two dont avoid watching this movie if youre a smoker nonsmoker or a quit smoker this movie addresses all types except the iquitsmokingwingnut near the ending was a nudge about something more modern in urgency that topic has been shuffled under the carpet for a few years now go enjoy this wellmade movie it took ages to make an appearance in a theatre near me it appears to be in limited release at the moment its a sleeper movie its a keeper movie its worth seeing and id like to see it win more recognition,black_comedy
i can honestly say ive never heard more laughs in a theater in my life the movie did have a good healthy dose of black humor and the final punch of the movie had to be one of my favorite lines since i hate cell phonesthe movie did take shots at not only the tobacco industry but also the alcohol and firearms  the film was definitely a good satiricallyserious look at how the tobacco industry works to exploit not only kids minorities and everyday peoplehere are some of the best lines from the movienick naylor my job requires a certain    moral flexibilitybr now go bang your heads on your desks until something useful comes out michael jordan plays ball charlie manson kills people i talk kid 3 my mommy say smoking is bad for you nick naylor oh is your mommy a doctor kid 3 no nick naylor a scientific researcher of some kind kid 3 no nick naylor well then shes hardly a credible expert is she,black_comedy
this movie is just a nonstop joy of beautiful satirical cinema upon viewing many movies of 2006 so far i find this movie to be the cream of the crop no doubt the best movie to be released of 2006 this far in the year the movie tells the story of tobacco lobbyist nick naylor who is generally in his profession because he needs to pay the mortgage seems like a good enough excuse to lobby for an industry who is responsible for the deaths of millions per year however you do see a side of mr naylor that seems somewhat human he loves his son like any father would but in this movie they really bring it to home the most hilarious thing about this movie is that nobody is safe from being bashed news reporters politicians senators lobbyists mainstream multicorporations the movie industry product placements everyone is under constant attack when i went into this movie i got more than i expected what i expected was a cute and fun comedy that might be funny but not really what i got was a hilarious fair and balanced political satire that was relentless from beginning to end who really shined through was aaron eckhartand actor who has never really impressed me at all with his acting or choice of roles he was in suspect zero which wasnt really good and the core which was just down right horrible this movie however was incredible and hilarious and eckhart was the basis of this remarkable movie making no one could have done a better job and if the movie releases continue to be as poor and lackluster as they are now i think an oscar may be in order for mr eckhart here other notable performances were jk simmons who was terrific as br he really got the characteristics of an out there hands on boss who isnt afraid to tense up his employees and motivate them i believed him the entire time and thought it was one of the most extravagant and brilliant performances by him to date others might include katie holmes who was excellent as the manipulative and insensitive reporter who used naylor to get her story out because of her terriffic tits maria bello who pleasantly surprised me due to her other poor attempt at acting in a history of violence i loved her in this and thought she was stunning beautiful and wickedly funny as well as the guy who played champ in anchorman this guy really does have a sense of comedy because i liked him in movies that really werent that good such as anchorman and waiting which actually wasnt terrible because of ryan reynolds the mod squad was perfect in their roles and did a brilliant job of making the movie how it was supposed to bein other words i was graced by this movie and would love to see it over and over and over this is definitely one on the market that i would love to buy and keep for myself so that i can enjoy it time and time again i highly recommend this movie and i think everyone who is in for a good laugh who isnt easily offended should give this movie a try it is absolutely hilarious and worth every moment of your time enjoy,black_comedy
i saw the trailer for this movie and was intrigued i wasnt sure what to think overall as i went to the movie but came out more than happy in fact i went back and saw it again the diologue in the movie is witty and funny yet continues the story along the story itself is interesting and there are many scenes that stand out in my head as i write this the best part about the diologue was the ability of it to connect to all levels of people in the theater while there was an occasional witty remark that only those politically up to date or knowledgeable would pick up on there was much more straight up comedic diologue that engaged the viewerthe story itself is solid with the main character trying to connect to his son while doing his job the job of a lobbyist i think the part that impressed me the most was how well the story flowed combined with the brilliant cinematographyif you like anything that you would deem satirical or simply like a comedy check this movie out it is by far one of the better movies ive seen in the past few years and the best of this year,black_comedy
i recently watched this movie in theaters and i have to say that i was extremely impressed by how clever and smart it was there was nothing really over the top about the movie although it had its humorous moments but overall it seemed extremely well thought out and clever i recommend this movie to anyone who has felt that there is not much out there in theaters to choose from lately and while it may not completely redefine your ideas about films you wont leave the theater feeling like you have just been tricked out of your eight dollars has a very strong cast of characters and there is a sort of chemistry between all of them that carries throughout the entire movie and reacts well with the plot line go see it and you will not be disappointed,black_comedy
one of the funniest films ive seen in awhile it refused to take sides and found its humor in the fact that it managed to insult just about everyone i loved it i think the lack of big names added to the quality of the story there were recognizable actors and actresses but all involved were the kind of ensemble players that work together that make small films really quality products if the filmmakers worried about finding an audience the theater i went to this evening had better attendance than inside man had a week ago and the audience reaction was great im going to recommend this to friends and i really think that word of mouth is going to make this film one of the sleepers of 2006,black_comedy
is one of those classic indie movies that come from nowhere and turn out to be so much better on all fronts than mainstream hollywood cinema packed by an allstar cast and a great script smoking is one hell of a funny political satire and is a definite mustseenick naylor aaron eckhart in a role that finally uses off his acting chops is a spinster lobbyist for big tobacco his job is to take the blame of causing cancer and other diseases off of cigarette companies and placing it elsewhere in an early scene he completely spins around a medical experts claims on cigarettes causing cancer in a young boy and gets everyone blaming the medical expert for wanting the boy to die in order to up their statistics to throw at big tobaccothe entirety of the movie revolves around nicks conquests doing his job and some of the lengths he has to go to in order to accomplish them while much of the film rests on eckharts shoulders the supporting cast is terrific in their roles from william h macy as a mccarthian politician to jk simmons as nicks boss to maria bello and david koechner as fellow lobbyists to even cameron bright as nicks son everyone comes out swinging of particular interest is rob lowe who while tiny in his role has excellent chemistry with eckhart its just a shame that many of their scenes are in the trailer and are not left to be seen by the audience for the first time when watching the filmas said previously the script is great jason reitman does a fabulous job making a bleakly dark comedy out of such a big political issue if you can contend and laugh at the idea of a movie about a bad guy just doing his job then youll be very impressed with this while the movie starts out great showing off nicks smartassed side right away it quickly slows down in the second act only to pick back up in the third its not a horrendous slowdown but it is noticeable when comparing it to the rest of the filmanother issue is katie holmes in this film like batman begins she serves a very big point to the film but she just seems useless shes barely in the film but her scenes really do not make anywhere near as big a splash as any of the other supporting actors you can barely see her acting muscle and she just sticks out like a sore thumb if there was any other way to get her purpose across in the film i think reitman should have taken it because you can tell why tom cruise picked her to help with his publicity stuntas a whole smoking works there are a couple of issues with it but the film is still great nonetheless yes its dark and rift with controversial elements but thats what makes the film so much fun in the end810,black_comedy
is a refreshingly witty and entertaining political satire one of the best since barry levinsons wag the dog and it qualifies for one of the best movies of the year so far the film was directed by jason reitman the son of ivan reitman the director of stripes and ghostbusters and this being his first feature directing debut is pretty impressive the film is amusing and does a good job at balancing cynical humor with heart and smarts maybe even too good of a job the film is at times pretty funny and wellpaced finishing up in only a mere 92 minutes but some of the comedic timing seems to be a little off in the beginning but as the film progresses it gets much better when it all comes together in the endthe films based on the novel of the same name by christopher buckley about the dayindayout machinations of big tobaccos chief spokesman or spin doctor nick naylor played amazingly well by aaron eckhart in a starmaking role and about the influence that his job has or might have on his 12yearold son and the moralethical questions about the job he does eckhart does a great job at creating a character that you love to hate but at the same time are still able to sympathize with even though he may have one of the worst jobs on the planet and you hate him for being so good at what he does for a living the rest of the cast isnt left in the dust either they help out the picture tremendously by perfectly supporting and matching eckharts performance taking the entire film up a notch among the supporting cast is william h macy katie holmes jk simmons who played j jonah jameson in spiderman robert duvall david koechner who youll recognize from anchorman and maria bello who was great in last years a history of violence and as witty and clever the writing maybe if it werent for these supporting performances from this cast the film wouldnt work nearly as well as it doesthis is not quite a laugh a minute bustyourgut kind of comedy but it is funny and it is smart and thats something that is very hard and rare to find in theaters these days so for that alone ive got to recommend you check out this is what last years lord of war looked like in the trailers a funny satire that doesnt necessarily push any one certain political of moral view and because of that its all the more easier to be able to sit back and enjoy so if this film looks interesting to you i would recommend checking it out now while its still playing in theaters because in just a few weeks the madness of the summer movie season is going to start up and you can rest assured that little films like this probably wont stand much of a chance against the big summer titles once they hit theaters this film lands a solid and respectable score of seven almost an eight,black_comedy
a very entertaining movie it isnt a documentary it is in fact a fictional comedy it is about nick naylor a top lobbyist for the tobacco industry we tend to consider such people as heartless and evil but they are in reality people like us who need to pay the mortgage it was certainly satirical however the guy who plays nick does a fantastic job of portraying a smoothtalking quickwitted lobbyist who at the same time realizes that his job is simply a game nick must face his role as a parent and acknowledges the importance of family parents play a vital role in the development of their children showing them the options that open up as their children grow it is however vital to let children be the masters of their own fate while tackling this the film also poked at the us government nick at one time questioning the validity of an essay question given to his son asking why america is the best government in the world it made an effort to point out hypocrisy using a vehemently righteous but clueless vermont senator played flawlessly by the everflawless william macy as the posterboy of governmental duplicity the film also brought up intriguing methods of argument and persuasion that i found highly pertinent and applicable to certain peoples methods of argument viz addressing the issue in a manner in which one can never be wrong it was not a kneeslapping comedy although some part were certainly hilarious but it was certainly a good time made possible by a strong cast generally8213 although brought down a bit by the yettoimpress katie holmes beautiful cinematography dc la and elsewhere creative filming and above all fresh ideas the movie works and is one so unlike anything else that it wont soon be forgotten and remember if it doesnt make you think its not worth your time michael,black_comedy

once and again fox searchlight has given us hope that there really is good american film and solid acting and in this film portrays all the evils of an american culture that simply brings to light the bullshit that we see today in the usa from the evils of how spin doctors can turn smoking into a pleasure and of course the plasticity and crap created by a major hollywood talent agencyto the ever present cancercorporatism which simply places the stockholder and chief executive above the rest of usaaron eckhart had better be remembered in the award season ahead as he just makes this film his own from the first frame to the last and with his great performance from in the company of men he just becomes better with every film he makes the supporting cast is such a delight to watch as they capture their characters superbly solid writing editing and the joy of intelligent performances makes one film to be remembered come oscar 2007,black_comedy
reviewed by sam osborn rating 25 out of 4last year andrew niccol put out the sly steely portrait lord of war the film followed gun runner yuri orlov objectively through his work sometimes leaving room for splashes of dark comedy and political jibes the film didnt take a stance on gun running and only because it didnt have to the portrait was message enough we understood the ethicsright and wrongof gun running and recognized the evils that surrounded it it worked through the idyllically simple principle of never trying too hard enter debut feature film for jason reitman is a film that tries too hard reitman seems to have an opinion about everything he doesnt just dislike smoking but wants to point out the hypocrisy in every mode of authority but often reitman is tactless and throws about stabs and pokes and low blows with each of his steps his point perhaps is that behind every authority no matter how noble a cause there lies an agenda reitman however doesnt approach this message smoothly he attacks it like a deranged hen often scuttling off into comic fancy and overindulgent satire the tact is missing where it should be stockpiled his film can certainly be funny but when it needs to count it clucks our character is nick naylor operated coolly by the windsweptblonde aaron eckhart reitman cuts away to a nondescript batting cage as nick introduces himself you know the guy in high school who could pick up any girl he taps the bat against his foot and raises the bat im him on crack and hes not kidding for a living nick talks and for most of we follow nick around the globe as he sweet talks everyone from nasty girl reporter heather holloway katie holmes to senator ortolan finistirre will macy to cigarette mogul doak the captain boykin robert duvall into supporting the cigarette conglomerates he even yaps his way out of a talk show pitting the lung association the democratic party and a boy dying of cancer against him hes that good joining him at lunch every day is the mod squad and acronym that stands for merchants of death along with nick theres bobby jay bliss david koechner the lobbyist of the national firearms association and polly bailey maria bello the spokesperson for the alcohol conglomerates the cast is a loaded weapon a common happenstance that seems to piggyback films packed with slant politics but doesnt leave enough room for its veterans maria bello robert duvall katie holmes adam brody and others appear only long enough to make cameo performances theyre effective in their quick draw appearances but theyre only use is to draw in audiences who would if not for the actors otherwise not spend money on a ticket aaron eckhart does well enough to make up for the flashinthepan tactics of the other roles however im surprised he hasnt broken into superstar status yet seeming to instead hover in art house film radars he similarly surprised me last year in the near perfect splitscreen romance conversations with other women a film that has struggled to find a willing distributor jason reitmans direction is quick ripe and assured but its his writing that the film ultimately stumbles on hes created a character too endeared to the audience we somehow relate to nick naylor and are continually finding ourselves rooting for him reitman paints an ugly picture of the cigarette industry but is unwilling to incorporate nick into it he doesnt let us criminalize nick and instead disconnects him completely nick is our allaccess entrance into reitmans world of allencompassing hypocrisy but nick has little to do with it lord of war worked its character to be a part of its politics the controversy stemmed from yuri orlov whereas in nick naylor swerves and dodges the punches reitman throws but this is the consequence of reitmans roundhouse punch at the world reitman wants to hit everybody with this film and probably keeps nick detached for this very reason nick taking a side would force the audience to take a side reitman wants instead for us to laugh at everyone i just came to laugh at cigarettes,black_comedy
this movie is an extremely entertaining experience for those of us with a high tolerance for cynicism and an ability to appreciate the sneaky if you think odysseus was a real smart guy for inventing the trojan horse then watch this movie if you think he was a deceitful cheater who couldnt fight fair then dontthis movie raises spinning the truth to an art form and shows the honor of a dishonorable man without glorifying supporting or justifying his messagethe most notable part of this movie is the highly original scene cuts and narration by the protagonist this is a film designed to make the user go  every two minutesthe sole drawback in this film was ms holmes performance if youre waiting for the film in which she doesnt look and sound like a little girl then keep waiting,black_comedy
not only was this movie excellently acted directed and cast but it is one of the only movies i have seen recently that has kept me genuinely engaged throughout coming out of this movie i find myself thinking if i am a bit like nick naylor is that so bad any movie that leaves me idolizing the bad guy a merchant of death no less is a quality film the characters in this film are well developed and hilarious there are one liners in this movie that i defiantly did not see coming and that had me literally gasping for air one of the best and most surprising actors in this film was rob lowe his portrayal of a hollywood hot shot hit remarkably close to home overall this film was witty sharp and insightful i would highly recommend this film to anyone smoker nonsmoker republican die hard liberal or anyone in between truly one of the best films to come out in a long time,black_comedy

i heard a lot about this movie before watching it and all the reviews have been generally positive add that to my interest in the tobacco industry and the theme of the movie a look at a spindoctor for the tobacco lobby groups i was probably expecting a little too much dont get me wrong the movie was clever well acted and there were some great lines throughout but i just felt something was missing i havent pinpointed what that is but there doesnt seem to be much of a point to the movie even with that flaw i still give it an 8 out of 10 just because of the cleverness and the actingaaron eckhart known mainly for his role in the core does a brilliant job playing the tobacco spin doctor lobbyist who can seem to talk his way out of anything i mean hes so good he can convince you that killing your friends and parents is a good thing to play this character you really need to be suave yet seem intelligent enough to convince the audience that its not just an actor reading the lines but the actual person possessing this miraculous gift that he has aaron pulls that off very well he does it so well that you actually start liking him and rooting for him near the end of the movie scary i also enjoyed all the great satire this movie provides the scenes where the mod squad merchants of death talk about who kills the most people per day and the one where aarons character convinces school kids that smoking is not bad for you are a pure joy to watch you laugh at how over the top and unpc these characters are in the movie yet if you think about it the way aaron crafts his arguments do make sense and that is the scariness of his talentas i mentioned before i wish there was a bit more substance to this movie and the fatherson story could have been reduced a bit but i still believe this is a witty and intelligent movie thats for anyone looking for a good laugh and dont get easily offended,black_comedy
jason reitmans first film constantly and very effectively shows that the most crucial qualities required for great success when selling a highly offensive product that alienates many or most people arephysical attractiveness high intelligence strong debating talent without regard for the truth and a mortgage to pay sort of reminds me of a govt administration and its oil buddies that are getting rich by selling a war that most american people dont want the film also showed well that the most important thing to do after getting those brilliant and attractive salespeople is to train them well to spin a product that is bad for people into something good for sales then hard sell that good over and above all reasonable and just opposition without any regard or respect for scientific facts again just like our govt stating that definitive research proving global warming is unproventhis forget about everything and just sell the product attitude was convincingly displayed throughout thank you and was very effective in showing us why selling tobacco in that manner still works for many who dont care about the truth but i felt a certain sadness throughout even though this film is a very entertaining dark comedy in seeing the obvious truth of the convincing message that many people sell their souls to their employers for the sake of paying the mortgage and what is really concerning to me is that it is becoming more and more obvious to anyone in our fragile economic system that real people are willing to do just about anything for their companies in order to keep their jobssame as in the movieno matter how wrong it is and how many faceless folks they may hurt while doing it i personally see this happening almost every day in jobs as low on the professional rung as film rental clerk or telemarketing cell phone salespersonwhen people working at that level will lie to keep their jobs we are in real trouble as a society this film made it clear to anyone watching that slick lies sell and immoral slick lies really sell and its not only ok the practice is obviously believed in and endorsed by our own govt i admit that my film review is a philosophical comment more than a direct film review but this terrific film showed the above truths so well plus the dark side of that unwritten but abhorrent moral code that some of us endorse either passively or actively that the damage it can do to us as a society is more important commentary see this film and enjoy its wonderful entertainment value and good filmmaking but also be outraged by its engrossing story of profitmotivated crime by and to humanityi experienced a similar social awareness while recently watching cache a brilliant and quirky french film that also really makes you think about what tragic results selfish and greedy acts can bring home when some people are not concerned with fairness or morality toward others,black_comedy
i enjoyed quite a bit back in the late 70s when i was in college i knew a girl who interned at philip morris and i used to seethe when she described the research on lung cancer as not conclusiveat last a movie thats daring enough to make fun of the whole debate on both sides it was great fun to watch the lead revel in being on the darksidethe movies motto is neither side is snow white south park pointed out in their butt out episodewhile i dont think this must be a big screen movie its worth it to go to the theater to hear everyone else laugh so hard,black_comedy
i loved this movie it has a strong message but it was so funny and moved so fast and aaron eckharts smile was so endearing that the message went down easily i love going to a movie that makes me laugh out loud particularly when i hear that half the audience is there with me it is an entertaining comedy that just happens to be based on the deadly serious issue of smoking a hearty good job to the casting director what a terrific team of actors any time i have an opportunity to see a movie with aaron eckhart robert duval william h macy and rob lowe i will take it the movie is full of fun politically incorrect humor an example is where nick naylor and his son are waiting outside the office of the hollywood agent played by rob lowe on the large television screen hanging on the wall is a video of a whale playing with some sea lions it is hilarious go see this movie you will not regret it,black_comedy
aaron eckhart made his first vivid bigscreen impression as the misogynistic chad in neil labutes scathing 1997 in the company of men since then he has been waffling in leading man roles but luckily he comes back to form as the appropriately named nick naylor tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire in firsttime directorwriter jason reitmans wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills the films perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters morally ambiguous but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors the zigzag plot follows nick from the bogus cigarette companyfunded academy of tobacco studies to the pretentiously zen office of an equally pretentious hollywood studio mogul to a dicey encounter with a former marlboro man to the welcoming arms of an ambitious reporter the unpredictable journey provides reitman an opportunity for both broad whackamole comedy to piercing observant zingers that resonate with the truths they exposereitman has recruited a firstclass cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by eckhart who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likable at their favorite watering hole nicks two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by david koechner as the bushsoundalike firearms specialist and especially the wondrous maria bello as the sharptongued alcohol representative there are also inspired turns from very unlikely sources with rob lowe hilarious as jeff megall the honeyvoiced asiaobsessed mogul sam elliott defiantly cagey as the marlboro man and even katie holmes surprisingly convincing as heather holloway the morally bankrupt reporter who appears to be nicks kindred spirit scene stealing is quite democratic with clever turns by robert duvall as the tobacco kingpin william h macy as the unctuous antitobacco senator from vermont looking to put a skullandcrossbones logo on all packs of cigarettes jk simmons as nicks immoral boss br and a very funny adam brody as lowes obnoxious assistantbeginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits the plot goes in unexpected directions and while the ending is a bit soft the overall movie more than satisfies in fact i doubt if i have laughed harder in a movie theater since last years the 40 yearold virgin but the smart provocative barbs really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful even the comparatively softcentered scenes of nick with his son have a nice edge and with his translucent blue eyes cameron bright strikes the right nonjudgmental notes as joey reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most capraesquire situation this one is highly recommended,black_comedy
greetings again from the darkness ahh the power of words in what is for all practical purposes his first major film as writer and director ivan reitmans son jason gives us an essay on how the spoken word can be a tool or even a weaponaaron eckhart is perfect as the fast talking tobacco lobbyist who smooth talks everyone from his boss to his son to reporters to students as he says charles manson kills people  i talk and what a talent he has reitman as a writer shows a nice touch for the big story and some amazingly witty moments his weakness comes from writing a complete scene so many times a scene appeared to exist solely for the delivery of one line fortunately that does not kill the enjoyment or effectiveness of the storythe other two members of the mod squad are a quirky david koechner and the sadly underutilized maria bello a terrific supporting cast is filled out with william h macy rob lowe robert duvall and a former marlboro man played by the great sam elliott in a small step forward from the usually creepy kid role the butterfly effect birth cameron bright plays eckharts son who wants to learn from his fathersome nice moments in the moments in the film and a wonderful idea make for a very entertaining film stopping it from being great are the fragmented scenes that dont seem to flow very well the film is well acted has a very creative opening credit scene and the closing song by the kingston trio make the credits worth reading,black_comedy
is a movie based on a novel by the same name nick naylor aaron eckhart is a lobbyist for the academy of tobacco his job is to spin the negative views and mindsets of smoking into a positive light but when senator ortolan finistirre william h macy wants to put a poison sticker on every carton of cigarettes its up to nick to stop it an interesting and funny movie ensuesi felt very indifferent when i walked out of this evening a part of me really enjoyed it yet another part wasnt sure what to think of it one thing for certain is is not for everyone this movie is definitely one for people who enjoy thinking when they go to the movies while the film is overall pretty predictable the movie keeps the viewer interested and thinking i cant remember a film in recent memory that actually do this as well as doessome say the subject matter in this film ie to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed i personally didnt feel that way at all i felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking personally i dont smoke but i dont mind that this film is for smoking what i liked about the film is that it kept my brain going and like i said majority of this film is predictable but you do begin to question how free the rights of the american public are should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it why the movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative viewsthe whole you can never lose if you know how to argue your point was also another part of the film i enjoyed its so interesting to see how many views in this country can be won over by just spinning a story and arguing your point thats what this movie does very nicely at the end of the movie nick says something that you would never think he would say yet he says it and still comes out on top its amazing how he was so good at spinning things around that even something he didnt think was a good thing to say turned out to be the right thing to sayits nice to see aaron eckhart play a good solid role for once i think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable i think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies william h macy also stars and shines yet again macy is one of the best actors in hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves also katie holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable i personally think holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in the gift the reason i think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like i want to fck you when i watch you on tv it seems out of the ordinary for her this is also probably another reason why tom cruise loves her shes probably a very bad girl outside the public eyeis jason reitmans first feature film he is son of famous film director ivan reitman jasons directing is one to keep an eye on i feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father being that smoking is his first film i think he has already hit a home run i think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is somedayso in conclusion i like the message behind but not the overall subject matter of the film this movie provides its audience with fine acting a good script and some nice directing the films idea also keeps its audience thinking its a good movie to watch with someone and then have a nice long talk with about it afterwards its a satirical look at the smoking issue although i still feel it tilts more towards one side than the other but at the end of the day its a good independent film which very few will be able to enjoy and appreciatemoviemanmenzels final rating for is a 810,black_comedy
this is a film that could have been good but fails in all areas the actors all of them professional with excellent resumes go thru the motions with no real interest in the production the story of a tobacco industry lobbyist could have been good satire but instead turns into a vulgar film with no need to entertain but to shock the director of this movie as capable of so much more the storyline could have worked but the movie which runs about 92 extra long minutes fails to entertain but does offend the senses rarly have i been so disappointed in a movie the film is based on a novel by christopher buckley after viewing the movie i suggest that you read the book as it has to be a lot better than this very hastily thrown together film,black_comedy

i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival at the film festival a few years back i saw an incredibly accomplished short film called in god we trust and i vowed that if young jason reitman son of canadian director ivan reitman ever made a feature film id run out and see it i kept my promise and reitman delivers on hisaaron eckhart is nick naylor the tobacco industrys spin doctor he is very good at what he does and manages to be likable while saying and doing despicable things in this biting satire eckhart doesnt really have any epiphanies but he thinks he does after an illadvised affair with the reporter doing a profile on him his secrets get out and he loses his job but after a bravura performance at some senate hearings big tobacco wants him back claiming to have a responsibility to his young son he refuses the job instead by the end hes set himself up in business advising all sorts of other icky corporationsthe film is stuffed with very smart laughs and i liked the fact that nick emerges unrepentant at the end it just sharpens the satire that this man actually thinks hes now a better person the tone of the film reminded me quite a bit of alexander paynes election though the comedy is much broaderreitman loses his deft touch slightly near the end of the film up to this point no one has been seen actually smoking in the film after a bizarre attempt on his life nick is told that he has to quit smoking its a bit incongruous and its never mentioned again i suspect that this is much funnier in the novel by christopher buckley on which the film is basedi would definitely recommend this film not only for its skewering of the tobacco industry standing in for all corporations really but also for its jabs at washington and hollywood as well no one is spared youll even get to see rob lowe in a kimono,black_comedy

i have just viewed the dvd of this film  no doubt this is the best comedy of 2005 as the 150th film i have reviewed on imdb this is the best of the newer films i have seen in a long time it is so brilliant that most audiences who missed it should make an effort to see it nowthe film has much more than smokingantismoking it has a simple message about being a parent father which everyone can understand then it has a much more complex message about how the media spins the public in the directions it wants the public to go a perfect example of this spin is any presidentpolitical campaign satan could run for office in the us and if they media helped him hed win then it has an even more complex message about the absurdity of political correctnessthe film has even more messages but these main three make the film much better than most films being put out now the cast is brilliant in all aspects of the film after watching the deleted scenes id say the editing was brilliant as none of the deleted scenes were needed in the filman old saying used to say that satire usually dies late on saturday night live which has been very true on nbc the last few years if that is the case this film was made while satire was still biting  on the mark this film is the most under rated film i have seen from films since the year 2000,black_comedy
the disenfranchised corporations absolutely hilarious take on the intricate and complex spinning and spinning and spinning done by the hired mouthpieces fronting for the tobacco industrytobacco kills ie makes dead 100s of thousands every year and still big tobacco fudges with the nicotine content and lies about itthis film is an excellent lesson in spotting all the propaganda from outfits like the fast food industry auto industry and their obsession with flash and cosmeticswilliam macy puts in yet another top notch if somewhat cameo appearance as the moralistic senator as does robert duvall as the industry mogul also dead from a heart attack from smokingplenty of cynicism to go around with this onewhy the blazes pun intended do people smoke  if youre not already addicted why start ,black_comedy
my father and i are the only non smokers in the family and even my dad was a smoker way back but quite i havent caved into the peer pressure or at least yet but probably wont why smoking from what ive learned is a very deadly and addictive substance its like putting poison in your body but i dont judge other smokers never have since i grew up around them but i always wondered why and how someone could get into it tobacco companies for years have been trying to be convincing on how they care and are trying to stop other possible young buyers lol is one of the most intelligent and funny movies i have seen in a while it mixes the truth with comedy not to mention that the lead characters voice makes such an impact and argues so well hed make you want to easily start smoking because he is so charming and smooth it was also interesting that he had a son you spend some of the movie debating wither or not hes trying to make his son like him socially or just teach him how to survive in the world of constant argumentslike i said this is one of the most intelligent movies that moves so well and was brilliantly made the cast brought so much to this story that couldve been disastrous but turned into a total masterpiece of a movie and a great debate for many you gotta love a movie that keeps you thinking way after you finish watching it1010,black_comedy
was an entertaining movie i enjoyed the portrayal of corporate shenanigans and its satire of hollywood types the acting was good and all players did their jobs well but i was a bit put off by the smirking were so smart and hip attitude of the movie a bit of humbleness is appealing there was too much youthful snarkyness associated with the jokes that arrogance caused me to feel very little towards the characters i was glad they were just characters on the screen and that i would never really meet them if you are young and enjoy the meanness and arrogant attitudes so common on tv and in popular media maybe youll like the movie better than i its a shame because there was lots to like about the movie but it was too snarky for me,black_comedy
it may be too early to begin giving films headlines such as one of the best of the year after all when movies like the shaggy dog and larry the cable guy health inspector can both crack and maintain their stays amongst top 10 weekly releases you dont have to be roger ebert to realize or hope that the best is yet to comehowever every once and a while an earlier studio release catches the eye and maintains our interest throughout all the summer blockbusters and winter oscar hopefuls crash did it last year and both the silence of the lambs and gladiator were early outofthegaters that etched a space in our frontal lobes long enough to have us remember it when the golden statues were being handed out almost a year after their releaseis one of those films based on the 2005 novel of the same name by christopher buckley stars aaron eckhart as cigarette lobbyist nick naylor nick is probably the nicest guy that you could imagine working for an industry long fallen out of public favor he has a sudden charm about him and coupled with his rugged good looks you almost dont even seem to mind if he is twisting your words or making it so that the argument becomes so convoluted that you almost forget your first original thoughtthat makes nick naylor the perfect fit for big tobacco and his unique argumentative skills are showcased in the very first scene where he sits amongst a panel of antismokers and a young boy stricken with cancer on the joan lunden talk show before the first commercial break he hasnt so much as turned the audience over to his way of thinking but he has them thinking in a different direction and that my friends is what he gets paid to dois interesting in that although it makes its argument the film uses the tobacco industry as a backdrop to tell the story of the struggles that nick endures with family with friends and with those that find him the most despicable person on the earth this side of hitlerhis family of note is an exwife to which still speaks cordially but otherwise has split with amicably and his young son joey cameron bright joey is at that age where he is curious about everything his father does and his interest allows nick to bring him on business trips where joey has the opportunity to be mentored in argumentative studieshis friends are part of a self proclaimed mod squad merchants of death and consist of one proalcohol lobbyist maria bello and one profirearms representative david koechner the three of them meet regularly and have intricately trivial and engaging conversations that include a provocative discussion on who represents the most worst product based on annual deaths in americacomplicating matters are nicks enemies which come in the form of many faces there is the horny newspaper journalist heather holloway the soon to be mrs tom cruise katie holmes who seems to be using all of her god given assets to get information from naylor for her article there is the senator from vermont played wonderfully by william h macy that has as his personal goal to warn the american public about the poisons of nicks product and to round out the trio of antinaylors is the general public that includes mysterious men who one day kidnap nick and riddle him so full of nicotine that it puts his life in jeopardythe supporting characters on both sides hit just the right notes to further nicks ego and to allow us to be fascinated without being disgusted with nicks line of business throw in rob lowe as a hollywood hot shot that is negotiating with nick to have brad pitt and catherine zetajones smoke after sex in a new science fiction film robert duvall as the captain of big tobacco and sam elliot as the elderly malboro man who is dying of lung cancer and is being paid for his silence each fascinating and how nick deals with each persons situation mesmerizingis not going to be a movie that will show up in the top five of the film grosser any week it isnt a film that is going to command the presence of a hundred copies at your local dvd store but what is is a fantastic character study about the life of someone that ultimately sells death and he does it so wellwwwrobertsreviewscom,black_comedy
isnt especially meaty and it likely wont give you much to chew on after viewing it but as a funny clever 90minute diversion you could do much worsethe chameleon actor aaron eckhart is perfect casting as a gifted spin doctor working on behalf of big tobacco companies the film is effective in that it makes the motives of every other faction in the smoking debate awareness groups liberal campaigners hollywood journalists so questionable that you have no choice but to root for eckharts character however morally repugnant you may find him to be there is some validity in his arguments for speaking out for cigarette companies after all at some point american consumers have to take responsibility and conclude on their own that smoking is an awful habit we cant allow browbeating consumer awareness groups or agendapushing democrats or scary labels stuck on cigarette packages to make up peoples minds for them if people knowing everything they know about the dangers of smoking are going to be stupid enough to continue supporting the cigarette industry then why shouldnt corporations try to take advantage of that after all thats the american way every company and politician does the same thingthis film is reminiscent of election in its satirical tone and its style if you liked that film youll probably like this one a fine supporting cast is assembled including maria bello katie holmes william h macy and an underused robert duvall but the movie sticks pretty closely to eckhart and doesnt give anyone else much to do its glib and superficial but enjoyablegrade a,black_comedy
from its ironic title down to its cast has all the earmarks of an indie satire the film hits its target on occasion but to use a cigarette metaphor its smoking with a very thick filter on what writerdirector reitman had to do was to tear that filter off and go full out and inhale all the tar and nicotine he could handlethere are some fine bits some no doubt taken from the book by christopher buckley such as the mod squad trio  tobacco firearms and alcohol here played by aaron eckhart david koechner and maria bello respectively and the way nick naylor eckhart cons the original marlboro man sam elliot into taking a payoffbut too often the satire is too mild as if it were playing it safe not wanting to take the chance that it risk going too far indeed the funniest bit in the film is a clip from an old john wayne movie not any of the original footage and may i ask why is katie holmes an alleged star if the intent were to keep the film believable it falls short there as well the films big revelation that supposedly sandbags nick naylors career is that the tobacco industry is lying to the public that could hardly have been surprising even when the surgeon generals report came out 40 years ago part of the problem with the film is that moments like this revelation feel very pass the book came out 12 years ago and the public has simply too much on the ball to believe that the public would swallow naylors riffs so easily speaking of pass having one of naylors big tv moments occur on the dennis miller show dates it even furtherin the end id compare it to in the company of men which also starred eckhart perhaps i was the only person who felt this way but i found company of men lacking because it wasnt offensive enough the master of film satire billy wilder knew how to skewer his subjects find copies of the big carnival or the criminally overlooked one two three as a former boston film critic and film professor nat segaloff once told me about wilder you know someone somewhere is being offended by him wilder is mild when it needed to be more wild,black_comedy
this film is all the way designed to get under thin skins and piss everyone off for me that is what makes it work so well and why i have to sing its praises here the characters are yet likable the satire is down and dirty yet subtle digs at hypocritical corporations sink in well laughs van is had nor not the important thing is it gives an unaplotgic uncorfstble looks at these things at big tobacco and the people who try and stop them at consumer culture the dumb nature of humans its honest that honesty steps just to the fire but never covers itself in its own glory so ironically you can respect it,black_comedy
aaron eckhart two face plays the ultimate spin doctor as a tobacco lobbyist the movie is extremely funny and educational it teaches people and aarons son not to accept the status quo in thinking that there are alternative realities depending on how one wants to use spin it a truly libertarian film to the point of absurdity great comedy no matter where your politics fallparental guide simulated sex frequent fbombs no nudity,black_comedy
meet nick naylor a smooth and charismatic  and importantly likeable  aaron eckhart hes the main spokesperson for the tobacco industry so he basically must go out and constantly promote a product that is generally believed to be harmful to human health but the way he sees it somebodys got to do it and hes damn good at it as one national magazine dubs him he is the sultan of spin eventually he will have to testify at a hearing spearheaded by a politician william h macy campaigning against cigarettesis a bright and effective satire that marked a promising debut feature for young filmmaker jason reitman son of ivan r who also adapted the christopher buckley novel its actually quite interesting and intelligent as well as humourous driving home the point that all adults have the freedom of choice  and they can choose to indulge in a potentially harmful vice if they so desire the witty story is also rather balanced in the way that it takes aim at people on both sides of the issuetheres no shortage of colourful characters in the tale eckhart anchors all of it with a thoroughly ingratiating performance as a man who has little shame to feel hes surrounded by talented costars maria bello david koechner todd louiso jk simmons kim dickens robert duvall sam elliott etc cameron bright is appealing as nicks young son whos interested in learning more about what his dad does for a living he and eckhart are quite believable together as a father and son and their dynamic adds some definite humanity to the goingsonoverall a well made and topical film certain to pique its viewers intellects especially as it regards an issue that could provoke very emotional reactions but reitman prevents things from ever getting too heavyhanded or unpleasant the dialogue is fresh and funny and keeps things moving along nicelybest of all this clocks in at barely over 92 minutes so buckley and reitman are able to make their points quite succinctly which also counts for somethingreitman cast his sister catherine in a bit part as a reportereight out of 10,black_comedy

thank you for smokingreitmans comedy satire about smoke and ashes is a home run for him since it achieves to walk over that fine line between humor and drama something that great filmmakers have failed to do so and he has done it in here with such fluidity that it leaves you in an awe of it the story itself demands lots of monologues arguments and logistics that are not statistical but social and to write dialogues and conversations whilst delivering all of that is like climbing a slope against the wind but reitman has done it and that sweetens his victory moreone of the best bits of the feature is of course the relationship of the protagonist with his son since he has to explain all his higher ideal concepts in the most literal and simple way this is the window where the writer is basically speaking with the audience in laymans terms to advance the storyline and yes it does get mechanical very quickly along with the structure of the script but this corporate world that you are about to explore endorses it before you even go in hence it is mandatory to feel like suchand with bits of humor one liners and sensational point of view through which reitman argues with you it is literally hard to argue back now amidst all these superness of the feature the plot gets rusty within first few minutes as it practically screams the entire trajectory out on a podium before it even hits the screen that extracts the heat from the soul eckhart is convincing just as his logics are and along with him rides an amazing supporting cast like simmons macy holmes elliot and duvall and they all stand up to their caliber and deliver unflinchingly feels more like a sitcom than a picture but hey it works either way,black_comedy
director jason reitman has more often polished the public image of multinational corporations in his movies if it is done for dramatic or comical effect or just for sponsoring i dont know lots of movies get money from big multinationals no problem there but when you make a movie about the pros and cons of smoking which has proven to be addictive and killing people by the thousands then it is kinda weird to see a movie defending the tactics these cigarette companies use to sell these cigarettes but in defense of this movie i would like to say that it is rather clever to learn how cigarette companies do their pr because when one learns how they sell this harmful product you can protect yourself better against it i hopethis is a very intelligent story it is not so much a comedy but rather a deliberatedly confusing story in which the cigarette companies get sold to the public as the good guys and we are even explained how this rebranding of the cigarette companies into the good guys can be done most effectively thats the real charm of this intelligent movie it is not a really great comedy there are some laughs though because it is funny to see a cigarette lobbyist use the act of clubbing babyseals to death in his campaign to promote smoking it is funny to see a cigarette lobbyist tell little children to think for themselves and not take for granted as the truth what their parents tell them it is a rather sleezy amusing movie about promoting lying and bribing but it is really good at that watch the insider with al pacino and russel crowe though if you wanna see a real classic thriller that does not glorify the big tobacco lobbyiststo summarize dont watch this movie if you wanna see a straight comedy the jokes are more intelligent or just obnoxious in a funny way i would recommend this movie though to those who long to be confused and puzzled watch it if you like intelligent movies that make you think about the subject of the story how to promote a product that kills,black_comedy
couldnt be an easy film to sell it basically tells a lot of people possibly smokers what they dont want to hear while at the same time making that smug smile that only nonsmokers wear just that little bit more hard to takehowever despite trying to offend most people it actually works its a clever and subtle form of humour which is completely devoid of any american pie jokes it features a great ensemble cast and none one of which lets the side down its hard to pick a favourite among so many you just have to put them all together and let them get on with it maybe row lowe steals every sceneif youre in the mood for something a little bit more satirical then give this a go  living proof that americans do understand satire just as much as us britshttpthewrongtreemoviereviewsblogspotcouk,black_comedy
it is difficult to tell whether this movie which is based on a book an attempt by the tobacco industry to get back at all of the antismoking sentiments that are around the place and to try to give smokers a voice or whether it is simply a satirical look at the lobby industry i would generally fall towards the second idea though i would not be surprised if funding for this movie as well as funding for the underlying book did not find its way from big tobaccookay this movie does not put smoking in a good light but it doesnt put it in a bad light either what it does is that it follows the tobacco lobbyist nick nailer around for a period of probably about a month there is not real overarching plot to the movie to point or struggle that he is trying to attain but rather it is just taking us inside the walls of kstreet and showing us that lobbyists are humans albeit very highly paid humans just like us  namely using their skills to earn a buck so that they can pay the mortgagethe reason that i suspect that there is some ulterior motive coming from this movie is the way that it shifts the perspective of the audience basically you sympathise with nick nailer and come to take him as a pretty good bloke while you begin to see the antismoking lobby as a vicious evil monster than uses underhanded tactics to get their point across there are a couple of instances in the movie where nailer is attacked first physically and then socially and these two events pretty much swing us around to his side and make us feel that we want to stick up for himin a way this movie and i suspect the underlying book persuades us to see another side of the lobbyist a side where we begin to sympathise with him to see that he is actually not a bad bloke just simply somebody who is paid to spin spin it is not so much that he lies rather it is that he changes the topic of discussion and takes control of the debate in fact he changes the debate to basically suit his own position while stealing the limelight away from his opponentin a way i am not surprised that this film was released by fox searchlight it seems to me a satirical response to the rise of independent left theatre and tries to make us see the good that is in all people so that we begin to not only sympathise with and actually begin to like a type of person that we would normally despise,black_comedy
this movie doesnt force you or even inspires you to smoke but it really opens your view towards smoking everybody knows how harmful smoking can be but still lot of us smoke so the message this movies very smartly tries to give away is that it really a matter of opinion how you view smoking play a smart comedy on the topic of smoking and people behind the scene who want to eradicate the whole smoking issue by terrorizing people of its ill effectsgreat satirical movie aaron eckhart a real good guy playing a character that some what is a bad guy type,black_comedy
aaron eckhart made his first bigscreen impression in neil labutes 1997 flick in the company of men since then he not been given good enough leading man roles but luckily this time was not the case as he stars as nick naylor tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire in firsttime directorwriter jason reitmans later directed juno and up in the air wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills nicks two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by david koechner as the bushsoundalike firearms specialist and the wonderful maria bello as the sharptongued alcohol representative the films perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters are morally ambiguous but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors aaron eckhart is used to great measure to portray a character who has a moral black hole and an eager disposition to show just how black it isnicks lobbying powers make him a god in his world he cannot do wrong he flies coach and mingles with the people and induces them to smoke and hes become the favorite of the tobacco czar robert duvall who is using his own money to bribe a former marlboro man dying of cancer played by sam neill not to talk against the industry and to use the money for a charity hes also trying to negotiate a smart move against his bosses wishes with a hollywood superagent rob lowe to reintroduce smoking in films because nowadays only europeans and psychovillains smoke  its deglamorized hollywood they suggest bringing brad pitt and catherine zetajones in a movie about smoking in space listen to them talk and listen to how they would resolve the minor issue that smoking cannot be done in space beginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits the plot goes in unexpected directions and while the ending is a bit soft overall the movie satisfies the smart provocative characters really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful  dont miss the scenes involving mod squad and how katie holmes exploits nick even the comparatively softcentered scenes of nick with his son have a nice edge and with his translucent blue eyes cameron bright strikes the right nonjudgmental notes as joey reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most capraesquire situation reitman has recruited a firstclass cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by eckhart who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likablemy rating 910,black_comedy
i appreciate a lot what the director does which is in this case really good work and a lot of dedication but the writing in this one is just what keeps me remembering this movie youve seen movies about lawyers cops astronauts firemen but how many movies are there about a spokesperson it being the first one i doubt its the first one ever but for the sake of the argument a lot had to be done in making you like this character doomed and for good reasons hated by everyone else you might hate him in real life but not here its a man who has a job who is good at is who likes it and tries to live a normal life things naturally go out of control a bit but you still continue rooting for him i recommend this movie highly i regret not watching it earlier actually its dialog based funny with its own jokes and very nice acting worthy of such a movie,black_comedy
micheal jordan plays ball charles manson kills people i talk some movies are brilliance personified case in point godfather some movies are feel good case in point the terminal some movies are thought provoking case in point a beautiful mind there are all genres of movies dished out thank you for not smoking is all that and more its subtle in its message its intelligent in screenplay and it makes you think and it made me feel good was an added bonus an intelligent screenplay very good acting by the lead actors and some thought provoking dialogues make it a worthwhile film a film in which you can most definitely invest 92 minutes of you life 92 minutes which smokers usually spend in smoking around 20 cigarettes and thus reducing 220 minutes of their life is it worth it you decide we live in a free world,black_comedy
the humour of this movie comes from depicting actual behaviour of big tobacco in the in the mouth of a completely insincere charmer the absurdity is magnifiedthe cleverest parts of the movie come between aaron eckhart as the handsome nick naylor unscrupulous tobacco lobbyist and cameron bright as 12year old joey naylor who idolises and mimics his father they even look a bit alike joey longs to be as amoral as his dadjoeys lines often use vocabulary too advanced that he can barely pronounce you realise that other characters are feeding them to him yet near the end of the movie he persists in the same delivery it is a subtle sort of joke that now the writer his handing him the linesnaylor is the protagonist so you tend to sympathise with him he is is such a sleaze that you want him punished the movie with comedic improbability tries to satisfy both audience urgesbig tobaccos arguments use the most sleazy and outrageous arguments selected from real life flummoxing the antismoking people with their audaciousnessthe movie is somewhat predictable since it spoofs real events but it is fun just the same i might describe it as a romp where seasoned actors were given reign to ham it up,black_comedy
aaron eckhart stars as nick naylor the too slick big tobacco spokesman whom uses arguments that always capable of deflecting criticism of his clients while he may win with his excellent debating abilities he is never really right although he may claim otherwise this juxtaposition of never being wrong and never being right is what nick attempts to resolve in a way conducive to bringing up his 12 year old son whom is a smart young man trying to figure out the world and what his fathers place in it is this movie satirizes virtually anything that fits into the movie including lobbyists journalists senators the film industry big tobacco daytime talk shows and more the supporting cast is great in the way they are subtle hilarious and natural william h macy plays the antagonist to naylor whom is a senator wanting to eradicating smoking by putting an warning label on every package of cigarettes rob lowe is the quirk movie executive with a penchant for everything asian and is extremely worry to naylors plan to get smoking back into movies katie holmes plays the love interest as a reporter willing to go to great lengths for her cover story of naylor maria bello and david koechner play naylors lobbyists buddies known in the inner circle as the mod merchants of death robert duvall and jk simmons play stereotypical over the top characters working with big tobacco last is the sam elliots cameo as an the original marlboro man dying of lung cancer which seems peak into reality truththis movies main weakness is that it is only 92 minutes long audiences willing to see such a smart film are willing to devote a full two hours to getting a little more complex story the resolution of the film wasnt very satisfying but certainly held well to naylors nonjudgemental laissezfaire worldview still is an extremely smart well written and stylish film  thank goodness they didnt go with the other ending,black_comedy
being able to see where this movie got jason reitman makes me able to appreciate it even more even though its good enough on its own is a satire about the inner workings of tobacco marketing think of a funny mad men nick naylor eckhart is the heart of cigarette marketing after his controversial statements on some talk show and while the bad press for cigarettes is heating up a journalist holmes throws herself into nicks personal life to learn everything she can nick has multiple social groups such as the mod uppermanagement and exfamily to start off aaron eckhart smashes the role of nick naylor and makes me wonder why he doesnt land more leading roles he was spoton while playing the egotistic and stubborn cigarette exec but he had enough charm and humor to make him feel like a real person and among his life he wants to teach his son about what he does and why he does it and i know someone who has said that this is a 1 12 hour cigarette commercial but i can assure you hes out of his mind if anything this is a 1 12 hour antismoking commercial the entire dilemma throughout the movie is how the cigarette company is going to stay alive in light of the new health discoveries it also touches on how to get fooled by spokespeople and shows you their conniving tricks the message isnt very subtle because after all this is a satirethis movie is a satire but do not confuse that with comedy sure this movie gives its laughs but it also has more heart and plot than a comedy turning your brain off for mindless laughs will not get you through this movie the comedy is there but you still have to think throughout the film and see the true emotion it gives youall in all i loved this movie its a satire for the ages that will give you laughs heart and pure interest i honestly couldnt take my eyes off of this movie hopefully youll love it as much as i did because i do know that this isnt for everyone but hey i loved it a,black_comedy
nick naylor aaron eckhart talks he could argue why america is the best government in the world igorning errors in syntax even if they sound like arguments for why it isnt what he does is spin smoking cigarettes into a good thing hes the spokesperson for big tobacco and he doesnt have to convince you that smoking is good for you he just has to convince you that its not not good for youis a satirical comedy that is as funny as it is true we follow nick as he goes through the political and cultural centres of the country seeing what he does for a living hes passionate about what he does mostly because he likes talking but when a certain pretty young reporter comes knocking hes ready to say that he does it to pay the mortgage perhaps the world would be a better place if everybody rented nick of course does both he pays the mortgage on the house that his son his exwife and her new boyfriend live in and then he rents his own apartment as attractive as eckhart is and as smart and funny as his character is its not surprising that hes single after one too many arguments turned into negotiations i would be out the door toobut the film isnt just about nick its about his relationship with his son and how that affects him and his job things said and done to a certain pretty young reporter also affect his job the certain pretty young reporter is played by katie holmes and she is just one of many supporting characters who turn in hilarious performances nicks best friends are bobby jay bliss david koechner an advocate for guns and polly bailey maria bello an alcohol is good for you spokesperson together they are the merchants of death the mod squadjk simmons plays his boss and robert duvall plays the captain and sam elliot plays a cowboy and remember cowboys dont like bribes you probably couldnt find better casting the funniest roles have william h macy as a senator from the fine state of vermont who always finds himself defending cheese rather than bringing down cigarettes rob lowe as a hollywood agent whos better at his job than nick is at his adam brody also seems to talk for a living but in a much different way than our heroone of the main reasons is a success is because of the screenplay by jason reitman based on the novel by christopher buckley its smart and funny two qualities severely lacking in most comedies when youre not laughing out loud at the moral quandaries that nick talks his way out of youre probably learning a trick or two to use in debate class,black_comedy
i did not knew anything about the film before watching and considered it would be some serious issue movie but i was glad to see a fine comedy film everything about the film regarding the subject  script and situations seemed to be interesting it keeps you attached to the screen at all times and make you guess what could be the end satirical comedies are always wonderful aaron eckhart is a fine actor and delivers what the role demanded however the role of katie holmes seemed to be laughable the film is a fine example of how films can reach different ideasa must watch for every film buff you will find everything that is in a good film,black_comedy
this was the most enjoyable film we saw at sundance smart and funny is not an easy pairing to find these days provides thought provoking content delivered through a network of great acting performances that make this film so thought provokingly hilariousthis comedy unlike many that grace the screen these days is clean enough to take your parents to and funny enough that you will forget you are at the movies with your mom it was truly refreshing how no one in the film was filmed smoking a cigarette rob lowes character provides a wonderful satire of the corporate film world i only hope that the intelligence level of this film does not keep it from gaining mainstream appeal,black_comedy
nine times out of ten when i read a book before seeing the movie i enjoy the book much more but the movie tyfs is that rare occurrence of a movie which is the equal of the book i thoroughly enjoyed the book tyfs which i still rate as one of christopher buckleys best in movie form tyfs is even more impactful due to the stronger sensory experience of the cinema while being equally funny and insightful  but not of course as pleasingly long or indepthwhat makes tyfs succeed so brilliantly is buckleys satirical behindthescenes view of how washington politics and politicians work and what they say feel and do both in public and behind closed doors which of course is quite a contrast although certain scenes in tyfs are a bit overthetop and one might quibble with certain things the characters say and do one gets the sense that there is a lot more truth about our political system in tyfs than there is in todays 6 oclock evening newsmovie writerdirector jason reitman faithfully transfers buckleys views to the silver screen and the production values of tyfs are topnotch aaron eckhart us simply amazing as lead character nick naylor he is perfectly cast as the handsome wellspoken lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry and he gives a great performance the supporting cast also turns in a series of fine performances notable are katie holmes as an unscrupulous investigative reporter maria bello as a fellow lobbyist for the alcoholic beverages industry robert duvall as the patriarch of the tobacco industry and sam elliott as the original marlboro man the settings and cinematography are outstanding and the producers even got joan lunden and dennis miller for a couple of talk show scenes any quibbles about the movie arent worth mentioning aside from the fact that the movie is definitely for adults even though theres nothing explicit about the visual imagesso if you are someone who takes a skeptical perhaps cynical view of the goingson in washington dc and would enjoy laughing at how you suspect washington really works then you will thoroughly enjoy thank you for smoking,black_comedy
without the right nick naylor this film sinks without a trace or more likely isnt madethat is because nick naylor is prosmoking or if that is unacceptable at least he is antianti smoking his day to day involves going on a myriad of talk shows and current affairs programs and being the bad guy the guy that continually says come on its not that bad or there is no medical evidence that categorically shows that and when that fails tries to distract and lead the conversation elsewhere by any means necessarywhile i was watching i kept thinking about in the company of men a film where the lead character was such a prick yet so sorta likable that you cringed whenever he said or did something horrible but you couldnt wait to see what he would say or try to get away with next in the company of men featured a virtually unknown at the time aaron eckhart guess who plays nick naylor nick knows in advance that he is the bad guy in each and every conversation and meeting but he seems to relish the challenge of taking on all the antismoking crusaders that takes pot shots at him and he basks in every glory even though he never lets down the vaguely smarmy and hurt i cant believe youre having a crack at smoking face like it is the antismoking guys who are evil and despicablenicks only friends are his employers who know how important he is to there cancercausing cause and similarly shady advocatesdefenders of other industries perceived as nasty at various times the gun and the alcohol lobbyists they regularly catch up and trade war stories about battles won and how they spun an unfortunate event into something that didnt reflect poorly on their product they also secretly fight for bragging rights as to which industry actually kills more yay alcohol nicks adventures take him to los angeles as it is decided that to make smoking cool again it must be featured in films more importantly it must be the right actors who smoke not the villains or the weak but the heroes and movie stars to cast the right light so to speakthrough the film nick meets an ambitious young journalist played by katie holmes who he promptly bangs a slick talking hollywood bigshot played by rob lowe who is willing to help with the smoking industrys goal  for a large price and the unfortunate man who was the marlboro man equivalent that is totally nonironically dying of cancer himself nicks nemesis is played by bill macy as the senator who has made antismoking his personal platform only he is constantly coming off second best in his battles and is forever wondering why when he obviously has the high moral groundis one of those clever little films that is perhaps a little too clever for a large audience even though there arent too many twists and turns a lot of the humour is in exactly how nick manages to turn a seemingly hopeless scenario in his favour and how he puts down the well meaning and basically correct detractors of smoking without ever making them look bad only confused this sort of humour probably doesnt mesh well with the drinks his own weewee by mistake stuff that panders to the 11 brain cell crowd and in truth it isnt as funny as a lot of those films what it is though is an example of how aaron eckhart might be the most unlikely likable bad guy in films at the moment his nick naylor is smooth talking smarmy quick convincing and 100 full of sht but as a spin doctor charged with protecting the reputation of the most evil of all habits he is simply the bestwhat is perhaps more scary is that you just know there are hundreds like him out there all being paid vast sums of money to do the same thing in real lifeas a guy nick naylor is essentially a reprehensible piece of work as a film doesnt merit such scorn it is punchy clever and fast paced without being laugh a minute or worldchanging and solidifies aaron eckhart as the guy you didnt even know you liked but dofinal rating  75  10 the strange thing is that this isnt the sort of film that i would normally choose to watch that doesnt mean it isnt any good though by the way i dont think i remember one scene where someone actually takes a drag on a smoke in this film,black_comedy
aaron eckhart nick naylor gives a very strong performance as a professional bs spokesman for the cigarette industry the cast was rounded with jk simmons adam brody maria bello i loved her in coyote ugly david koecher robert duvall katie holmes wm macy sam elliot and cameron bright as aarons sonjoey naylori grew up amongst smokers and smoking i tried it but i just couldnt start it i am very happy for that point this movie gets your juices rolling on whether or not you are a smoker or an nonsmoker you will make your own decisions if you like or dislike this movie but please take the time to watch it,black_comedy
nick naylor is the chief spokesman for a tobacco lobby group and spends most of his time promoting smoking by arguing for freedom of choice but when a healthconscious politician proposes a bill to label all cigarettes as poison nick will need all his debating skills to appear before a senate hearing on the issuei think theres an unfair view in some quarters that americans do not produce good satire the reverse is true whilst it may be a rare subgenre within hollywood comedies when it appears its often razorsharp dr strangelove winter kills and this movie about the awkward complicated incestuous relationship between smoking and politics is hilarious and insightful from start to finish nick may not be the nicest guy but its hard not to respond to his goodnatured intelligence love of what he does and disdain for those who take the simplistic moral high ground the story also keeps pitching him against wacky and intriguing characters particularly the amusing merchants of death lobbyist meetings with bello and koechner eckhart is great  wry unpretentious and totally focused the scene where he uses reverse moral indignation to buy elliotts silence is a little piece of comic perfection nicks relationship with his son joey is seamlessly woven into the story and each serves as a moral focus for the other the whole thing zooms along at a terrific pace with hardly a shot or a moment wasted the only bum note for me was the reporter played by holmes whos a bit predictable not to mention creepy everyone knows that all tobacco companies are just inflated legalised streetcorner drugpushers  thats hardly a secret whats less obvious is that those who oppose them are frequently selfappointed selfrighteous and patronising with questionable agendas of their own this movie takes careful aim at both sides and scores a double bullseye a funny wellcrafted and thoughtprovoking debut feature from jason reitman son of ghostbusters man ivan reitman based on a fine book by former white house speechwriter christopher buckley,black_comedy
here is a lampoon both slashing and refined a dart rather than a bullet aims at the prosmoking lobby with a bleak admiration for human nature it stars aaron eckhart as nick naylor a spokesman for the academy of tobacco studies we meet him on the joan lunden show sitting next to a chemoridden 15yearold boy dying of cancer but has stopped smoking nick steps gracefully up to the plate its in our best interests to keep robin alive and smoking he explains the antismoking people want robin to die nick naylor is an upbeat suave career lobbyist who is divorced loves his son joey cameron bright who seemed to be in a good cluster of movies between 200406 before just evaporating and addresses the kids class on career day please dont ruin my childhood joey begs yet his dad gives a little girl the third degree whose mother says cigarettes can kill you is your mother a doctor once a week he eats with the mod squad whose other affiliates are alcohol lobbyist mario bello and firearms lobbyist david koechner they debate over which of their products kills the most people it always makes me laugh because one always wonders who would be these peoples friends each other most likelythe movie was directed by jason reitman then 29 it is his least successful so far but his best so far whats most impressive in his first feature is his mastery of pitch he conveys a particular impartial reasoning to his approach such as how nick arbitrates with hollywood producer rob lowe on the question of how to get movie stars to smoke on screen again nowdays they concur no one smokes in the movies save for villains and europeans the stars would have to smoke in historical pictures because in a contemporary film other characters would invariably be asking them why they smoke or why not in the future after cigarettes are better smoking in a space station reitmans father directed twins dave and the ghostbusters films however junior has his own mo subversive and downplayed rather than occupying his movie with people smoking and coughing and wheezing he presents not one person smoking except robert duvalls antiquated captain kingpin of the tobacco industry who sports a cigar more like a pistol than a luxury instead the films delightful soundtrack harks back to popular hits that glorified smoking in the 1940s 50s and 60s and eckhart is beaming upbeat and even confiding hes not incapable of being taken advantage of himself on occasion hes just resilient when that occursbased on a novel written by no other than christopher buckley the obamasupporting son of posterboy republican william f buckley reitmans own screenplay keeps the erudite tang i greatly appreciate the films sense of form nick naylor is not pompous or vainglorious so much as an impartial witness of his own grandeur it is the movies intention to humble him but he never stoops even in an especially tight pickle still relying on his proficiency at spinning anything to his advantage his antagonist in the film is william h macy a vermont environmentalist senator whose office desk is populated with all his hoarded maple syrup bottles the senator has proposed a bill ordering a skull and crossbones to be put on every cigarette pack usurping the government health warning the insignia is superior to the words he says as they want those who do not speak english to die the films inflection is so adept that it can even make a villain out of a politician whos actually doing something about public health and environmental safety and the movie does it tastefully evenshould the movie be more biting many have lost their lives to cigarettes while many others including myself smoke themselves silly though its unlikely that more vitriol would better it all smokers and nonsmokers know cigarettes can kill you yet they stay purchasable and make billions of dollars in taxes ground zero of the movie is not nearly as much tobacco as lobbying altogether which along with advertising and spincontrol makes a vast assortment of affliction and decay tolerable to the people you can discern when something is not good for you by the amount of work done to persuade you it is innocuous or favorable,black_comedy
told from the perspective of a lobbyist this film takes a satirical look at the tobacco industry it is really not about smoking  its about spin doctoring and how big business manipulates consumers this black comedy has chuckles here and there but mostly leaves a lukewarm impression it tries very hard to be hip but the comedy is not funny enough and the satire is not edgy enough to rise above mediocrity it gets off to a good start with an amusing opening scene on a tv talk show but the script is somewhat meandering and simplistic and runs out of steam it has a terrific cast headed by eckhart well suited to the role of the slimy salesman,black_comedy
nick nayloreckhart is the face and mouth of academy of tobacco studies the dialogues and the arguments are extremely ludicrous kudos to the director reitman for a good filmthe movie is basically a satire on well many xdoings aroundu can decide for yourself what is x  good or bad to name a few  smokingno smoking hypocrite politicians fanatic bosses who keep ordering around for their own good reporters going limitless for a storythe most important part of the film is the fatherson relationship which is handled with great care the father does not force but allows his son to decide what is bad and what is good and if anything is good and then go argue for itdo not negotiatethe film has a good cast ensemble with eckhart simmons macy holmes all playing their part well the movie has a great messageno no not about smoking but everybody has a talent,black_comedy
i thought this was a great film mainly for the fact that it poked fun at all sides of the smoking debate from the tobacco lobbyists repeatedly stating that there is no conclusive proof that cigarettes are harmful to the antismoking legislators who think that putting a stamp on the front of a pack of cigarettes will actually stop people from smoking everyone gets poked fun ati though aaron eckhart did a great job in his role as nick naylor a man trying to be the spokesman for big tobacco and at the same time trying to remain a role model for his twelve year old sonall in all i thought this movie did a great job at balancing the line between sad and funny and came out with a wonderful movie highly recommendedb,black_comedy
took a subject that could have been a little iffy and really made a smart fun movie out of it the idea of a lobbyist for smoking companies fighting for smoking rights is a good idea for a movie everyone these days knows that smoking is bad for you but some people still desire to smoke so it really makes senseit is funny enough yet serious enough to play towards a couple different emotions successfully we root for nick naylor throughout the film whether he is fighting for the tobacco companies or whether he denounces them i like his character and i like the way that he deals with his kid he is not going to win any parent of the year awards but he speaks to him with intelligence and as an equali like the cast of this movie as well i have always found aaron eckhart to be likable and he continues to be in this role im not usually a fan of kid actors but i thought that cameron bright did a pretty decent job as nicks son i also really like jk simmons in most every role he is in this one includedthis is a very fun movie on a subject that could have easily failed i highly recommend it,black_comedy
it was very refreshing to see hollywood tackle the most difficult genre of satire in such a humorous and objective fashioni had to laugh when naylor proposed that the cigarette industry needed hollywood stars to start lighting up again in its filmsonly a few years previously in the blockbuster titanic a film reportedly seen a half dozen times each by every thirteen year old girl in the country featured the heroic romantic couple of kate and leo both prominently smoking cigarettes for him it was cool and for her it was rebelliousi cant recall seeing a single complaint at the time,black_comedy
takes us to the other side of cigarettes  those poor companies that manufacture them and focuses in on a lobbyist nick naylor aaron eckhart and his efforts to defend cigarettes the story starts out on the joan lunden show with naylor as the only procigarette voice up against the antis including cancer boy a 15yearold bald kid who has cancer but has quit smoking as usual naylor gets one up on a senator bill macy who has sent his assistant to appear on the show naylor also meets with two other unpopular people a progun official david koechner and a proalcohol one maria bello and the three discuss which activity kills the most people one of naylors jobs is to bring a briefcase loaded with money from his boss robert duval to the former marlboro man sam elliott who is now stricken with cancer naylor is clever in his discussions about smoking and the freedom of choice and his son cameron bright learns a lot from him as he watches him work naylor though runs into problems when engages in pillow talk with an ambitious reporter katie holmesthe best scenes take place in hollywood with rob lowe as a top agent arranging for the cigarette company to finance a futuristic film that will again make cigarettes look sexy one can tell that reitman has had lots of dealings in hollywood with the supplicant assistant the slicktalking agent the fast phony friendship and the way deals are put togetherirreverent funny and outrageous benefits from solid sharp direction from jason reitman and his clever script as well as very good performances the points made are good ones its all about the spin we have the ability to decide for ourselves and whatever happened to personal responsibilityhighly recommended,black_comedy
this movie has got it all for a comedya strong scriptgood acting and a good storythe character nick was very realistic and the acting was also up to the par by aaron eckhartthe other characters was also very well done and i personally did not find any flaw as far as the acting and character developed is concernedthe casting was superb and the director did an amazing job in putting it all togetherno offense to the nonsmokers but this movie did created a sympathy for the people lobbying for the cigarette giantsall in all it was a very nice flick and you would not be disappointed by it i would rate it as one of my favourite and would recommend it for sure,black_comedy
although there have been tons of comedies this decade that are based on nothing but swear words sexual references and obscenity there are definitely some that are smart and enjoyable is this one of them why yes it is the storyline is great the protagonist is a person who twists the truth in order to defend smoking the dialogue is pretty good there is swearing but its not nearly as much as a lot of the comedies that come out nowadays the acting is impressive as well except perhaps the main characters son who is a bit emotionlessthe only problem with this movie that there arent nearly as much funny moments as id like sure there are some parts that made me smile even chuckle a bit but overall solely as a comedy its not that great but as a general movie it definitely isin the end this a very entertaining movie though if youre looking solely for laughs look elsewhere,black_comedy
i just about enjoyed aaron eckhart in just about any role he played in but in he was phenomenal i just cant think of any other actor that could have taken his place in this film he plays a character named nick naylor who is a lobbyist and the speaker for the tobacco industry and the guy knows how to talk this film has some smart and witty humor that will keep you chuckling or at least amused just about every cast of this movie did there part well and have no complaints nick naylors son actually plays a big part in the movie as well and didnt seem like some plot device and the relationship between they is intriguing this film also does a great job with satire and although it may go a bit over the top at times it was very entertaining as a matter of fact i saw it twice cause it was just that fun and the message of the film didnt feel forced at all aaron eckhart is flawless in this film to the point every time i see him in any other movie this movie always comes to my mind this film is a brilliant satire and is definitely worth checking out8710,black_comedy
movies giving education and lecturing about illeffects of smoking doping etc can be boring and predictable  but if the same message is given with a touch of satire then the concept becomes interesting the story is about one nick naylor eckhart who earns a living by speaking for smoking and taking the side of tobacco people obviously hate him and call him a devil monster etc but he has the knack to get out of a tricky situation because of his wit and talking talent he is friends with two people having similar jobs one speaks for alcohol and the other for fire arms they call themselves the mod squad they always argue about which of them is the most hated and which obsession kills people the most all the mod squad scenes are the funniest in the movie the life of naylor changes when he takes his son with him on a trip and then gets kidnapped by one of his haters this movie can surely be called an educational movie without the lecturing you can call this moral preaching without the actual preaching aaron eckharthe became popular recently for acting in the dark knight playing two faceharvey dent has played his part to perfection he convinces that he is really taking the side of the deadly addiction the scenes with his son are also very good katie holmes as the seductress reporter who uses naylor for information is a sizzler was pleased to see robert duvall after a long time even if it was for a very short role this movie in short is education with entertainmentrating  710,black_comedy
i dont remember when i last watched this hilarious a film to get it out of the way i have not read the novel and was not aware that it existed until i came on here this is the first ive seen of by jason reitman though ive been wanting to for a long time and when i heard about this four years ago i instantly knew that i was going to watch it my high expectations were met and surpassed this movie has razorsharp powerful satire and in copious amounts the plot is excellent and it doesnt lose you at any point this is wellpaced and the almost 90 minutes seem to pass very quickly the storytelling is magnificent and the narration is perfectly used acting is spoton every performance is flawless and all roles wellcast the cinematography and editing are impeccable and the stylization hits the balance with incredible precision never taking the focus away from the subject matter dialog is welldelivered and all of the writing in this is amazing so much said with so little and the message clearly stated without coming off as preachy the humor is verbal clever pitch black and hits the mark not a single joke or gag tries too hard the subject of spin is dealt with in such a respectful manner without talking down to the audience in a way that you only an indie flick can there is a lot of strong language and brief sexual content but no nudity the dvd holds trailers and a welldone entertaining and smart fiveminute featurette i recommend this to anyone who can imagine they would enjoy it why arent all wakeup calls this funny 810,black_comedy
is the movie i recently saw with not much expectations and now having seen it i just couldnt resist the temptation of writing a comment for this movie in here  imdb only to let movie lovers know how good this movie is like many others have done in their comments after having started to believe comedy movies could not be anymore a good entertainer as it was before i got to correct the notion after seeing this film well a voguish fun filled comedy entertainer is back the movie is all about a never failing lobbyist trying to delude those people who believe cigarettes are harmful there was not a single moment when i saw the movie did i get bored the way the plot moves is great enough to keep you hooked to the film right from the beginning till the end well the dialogs were intellectual and well when i say dialogs do let me quote one the favorite one i had in this movie if you argue correctly youre never wrong its a great fun watching nick naylor in the movie using his smart convincing ability on people well that kinda sums up the movie well i dont want to get in to the plot and make this comment more of a spoiler but rather i would be doing the right thing to recommend this flick to anyone who would like to be entertained with a thoughtful intellectual and a funny movie be it a smoker or a nonsmoker  check this movie for yourself and you will know that this movie has got all ingredients to make it a perfect entertainer the acting performances by aaron eckhart as nick naylor and cameron bright as joey naylor are really good and is worth mentioning now thanks for reading,black_comedy
pictureperfect movie about a tobacco lobbyist who makes a living out of shilling fags and selling the message hey so cigarettes are deadly but lets for the love of god not ever think about banning them the movie loosely follows the concept of meet the osbournes porn documentaries and goodfellas in that it allows us to spend time with people who fascinate us but whom wed rather avoid actually meeting and would in all truth prefer to have shot or locked updirector jason reitman son of director ivan reitman of ghostbusters fame deftly uses christopher buckleys novel chris being the son of william f buckley by adopting much of the dialogue while focusing much of the story on our antiheros surprisingly unglamorous everyday trials and tribulations such as dealing with his estranged son and the ruins of his marriage i think that this is a very smart move as it gives the movie depth and story and compliments the sardonic dialogue nicelythe lead is played by aaron eckhart by the way who is the son of eckhart the elder who also had a very big chin but never amounted to anything fascinating bit of trivia there,black_comedy
this satire is mostly about siding with the bad guys nick naylor is well aware that smoke kills people and is just generally being a jerk about it but hes somewhat likable because all the other characters are even worse than him as he states they all have a mortgage to pay i love how mean some of these scenes are like when theyre forced to make an expensive antismoke ad for teenagers and immediately want to find out how to make it as unconvincing as possible i mean of course thats how it goes in real life but seeing it on screen just makes it that much closer this movie really just goes from one in your face scene to another without too much of a plot and i must say i like it that way its just some days in the life of a guy with no morals not specifically a story about him just everyday life that kind of approach really helped this movie is also really witty by the way id almost forget there are some really awesome lines in there and those are always welcome truly a great satire,black_comedy
the trailer to this movie really caught my eye however i wasnt able to watch until it came to dvd an boy did i love this movie aaron eckhart does an amazing job as a lobbyist for the tabbaco industry his ability to talk is what really made this movie william h macy does a great job as the congressmen bent on taking the tabacco industry down you have to give credit to a movie that can make a tabaco company a hero of the story well kind of smart comedies are hard to find and this in my opinion is a smart comedy a movie that doesnt nail you over the head and tell you laugh now like some movies tend to do many of the best jokes are subtle and you may miss them if you enjoy satire and movies that play on our society this one is for you a true classic i file this under my best movies that no one really talkes about,black_comedy
generally speaking there are three kinds of satire toothless effective and rabid falls very firmly into the third category while its heart sometimes seems to be in the right place its facts are sometimes dodgy and the whole thing comes off as hating america there is a scene in which the antihero tells his son why america is such a terrible place conveniently ignoring the fact that there is virtually nowhere better in asia africa or south america europe is more arguable but the movie does not realize any of this it sees the world as one filled with corruption and lies on both sides of the battle lines only the writer himself seems to be blameless in this scenario a mixed pleasure overall but this movie still has its moments,black_comedy
this movie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise as i was expecting your runofthemill comedy not only is it witty in a subtle sophisticated way but it is also extremely intelligent in its approach to the subject  spin doctors and the stories they spinit is the story of nick naylor who is the major spokesman for big tobacco and his quest to keep his job as well as establish a strong bond of communication with his preadolescent son his major foe in the public eye is senator ortolan finistirre of vermont it has been decided by the big bosses that nick should travel to hollywood in order to arrange for the romantic stars of a movie be smokers as were the stars of yesteryear  think of bette davis and paul henreid in now voyager which contains probably the greatest cigarette lighting and smoking scene ever filmed along the way nick faces the problems of an investigative reporter and the marlboro man who is dying of lung cancer and suing big tobacco probably the most subtle and humorous irony of all of this is that there in not one cigarette smoked in the entire filmaaron eckhart does a bangup job of portraying nick naylor he makes the viewer really believe this character even though such blatant lies come from his mouth all the while you wonder at this outwardly totally amoral man and his loving relationship with his son speaking of his son cameron bright gives that character just the right combination of innocence and savvy of a budding young man trying to relate to his fathernicks machinations are supported by no less than robert duvall and rob lowe who turn in great tongueincheek performancesas senator finistirre william h macy almost steals the film  as is often the case considering his ultimate acting skills as a young man macy attended goddard college in vermont having experienced goddard at that time through my brother who both taught and was an administrator there it surely becomes clear that macy used some of the characters he knew at goddard to create a humorously definitive vermonterif you love intelligent and very witty satirical humor and enjoy watching good actors at their craft you wont be disappointed with thank you for smoking,black_comedy
very funny movie not so much about the dangers of smoking but the importance of freedom of choice in the us katie holmes aside the cast is excellent robert duvall is especially great and jk simmons is hysterical as usual i would recommend the film to anybody who is interested in the tobacco industry or the incredibly twisted story of our attempts to legislate smoking in reality truth is even stranger than fiction but does an excellent job of dramatizing some of the madness of american lawmakers and lobbyists well done as the old saying goes and like the movie suggests smoke if you got em,black_comedy
this film is not a political statement or a documentary its a film about one of the most despised man on the planet nick nayler a representive of big tobbacoo this film has one of the greatest monolauges by the star and not only that it was a great pick of stars and is defintly something that will make you laugh and think of this movie but the main draw its a neutral movie and a movie about the ciggerete companys at that but it isnt advertising for ciggeretes  theres not even anyone smoking in this movie and it shows that these people are not doing it to kill your grandfathertheir doing it for the mortgauge it also shows the extremists of anti tobacco like the man who kidnaps nick and sticks almost 100s of nicotine patchs on him and the senater who tries to remove cigerretes from moviesand it all is the trouble of nick michial jordan plays ball mason kills people i give this a 910,black_comedy
although the subject matter has and always will be contentious  the film which was always created to have a comedic charm is a satirical successaaron eckhart who is engaging throughout plays a lobbyist for the multinational tobacco industry although we are meant to dislike such a figure he is so charming wellmannered wellconversed that you cannot help but be happy to be follow his escapadesthe film works very well on the satirical level the script is very good because it can mix the comedic nature of the film with the undercurrent of the issues it is trying to address on a personal level the way in which eckhart delivers his defence of the tobacco industry is an engaging insight into the world of spinit is pleasing to see a film that is not prolonged in running time and finishes at just the right moment entertaining and informative with the right amount of fun and laughter is a well delivered piece of cinema,black_comedy
it was just a coincidence that i watched this film a few days ago when the polemic approval of the law antitobacco was the subject of many debates here in mexico this film is just a perfect parody of what happened with that law and its really funny but it makes you think about that vice which is not going to be over with a simple law the film is about nick naylor aaron eckhart who is the vice president of the academy of tobacco studies he must defend and promote the cigarette industry and deal with senator ortolan finistirre william h macy who is having a campaign against cigarettes also he must be a role model for his son joey cameron bright who is confused about who is really his fathernick naylor is the classic good worker whose only goal is to be terrific in his work no matter if he must defend a killer and yes he is terrific for his job being much more clever than the people who are against the cigarette industry and because of his job his only three friends are persons who defend similar subjects like alcohol and guns their meetings are for me the funniest scenes of the film showing how those three persons dont care about anything just for what they are defending the talk of which subject kills more persons by year is just a hilarious scene showing how pathetic this persons are just for their jobs a similar scene is when the senator is angry because of the kid that they put on tv showing that he was doing everything just for his interests in the end all those situations put nick as the most honest and intelligent character in the film because he believes in freedom and in the family values leaving in yourself the decision to smoke or not because finally everybody knows that cigarettes are a cancer for usand i said that this film was the perfect parody for the antitobacco law because its a fact that now in mexico nobody will smoke in public places like restaurants or schools and thats fine because of the passive smokers but if you smoke you can do it in your place so the pollution to the world and to ourselves will be the same so wheres the damn solution its absurd all the polemic because to smoke or not is a personal decision nobody can force youconclusion i really like this film the cast is great specially aaron eckhart and the great william h macy the visual style of the film is terrific the opening credits are amazingly great and the final message too i recommend this film to anyone smokers or non smokers 85 out of 10,black_comedy
any character can be made to look heroic under the right circumstances turning a film ostensibly about smoking into a film about one ciggarette executives triumph over impossible odds is what makes the film a pretty good satire and not just a marginal comedy the lead becomes like the cowboy image of big tabacco representative of the independence liberty sex and cool morality is not an issue in the film only argument and that ultimately is what make it endearingits funny insightfull clever enough to avoid being didactic well acted and well though out this is not just a movie about cigarettes bieng bad its about a culture of spin like wag the dag where anything can be made to seem good which is a much more important and relevant idea than a movie about getting rid of something a relevant smart comedy that lets you have a cigarette and eat it too,black_comedy
the idea of the mod squad was very good merchants of death alcohol  tobacco  and firearms waits thats the atf wheres david koresh wait wrong movie this movie is very satirical what i mean is that it tells you like it is when the boy asks his father the question he has to answer for school why is americas government the best that look is classic and his response even better its basically big tobacco vs the government senators health advocates congress they even bring out the marlboro man sam elliot good choice robert duvall as the captain very good also but he needed some more screen time i loved the movie because of the wit satire and how it poked fun at the talk shows the government basically spin control if you argue correctly youre never wrong wait thats my daughter also anyway a great thumbs up to the actors actresses producers and director for this movie also i liked the opening credits and im really never a fan of credits,black_comedy
nick naylor aaron eckhart is very good at what he does and what he does is talk on behalf of the american tobacco companies as the political and health climate of america changes how will nick face off against the government the doctors a dying marlboro man and his own son can nick naylor really talk his way out of anything this film blew me away it had been talked up to me from a variety of people but i just never got around to it until now and i was pleasantly surprised this film takes jabs at the government tobacco companies antismoking advocates and the lobbies of america tobacco guns alcohol nuclear waste and more its like the funny version of the insider or good night and good luck somehow the humor makes it all the more powerful in the way the points are driven homeaaron eckhart whom im not familiar with is amazing and was perfectly cast hes supposed to be the guy who can talk any girl into a date or talk out of any situation and he does  with me believing him all the way sure many of his arguments are not logical but they also arent untruthful this is of course exactly the way the lobbyists work in real life as do advertising agencies they sell you a product with things they never actually said and we buy them on that hidden promisethe supporting cast is also great william h macy as a vermont senator robert duvall as the head of big tobacco rob lowe as an asiaobsessed media mogul and id especially like to give credit to sam elliott as the marlboro man in all seriousness if you asked yourself who could play an old retired cowboy better tan anyone else on earth who would you pick sam elliott and not just because of the big lebowski  elliott embodies the image of a cowboy even when hes not one such as road house or the legacymy only disappointment  and the reason this film received 9 rather than 10  is with katie holmes just like batman begins i found her character to be weak and just not a solid part of the film holmes is a poor actress and always has been would nick naylor fall for such a pathetic person of course not and neither would bruce wayne bruce needs vicki vale catwoman or someone strong and feminist so does nick and katie holmes just isnt herif you want something besides humor and satire theres also the fathersondivorce scenario some people like emotional movies and this has some emotion to offer as the three family members have a strained relationship each one is strained with each other i found this to be a downer of the film but it also really added a human side to naylor that was probably needed to ground him from being superhuman he may be a demigod but hes no green lanternabsolutely see this film i dont care if you like comedies horror action westerns or something else  if youre a conservative or a liberal a smoker or nonsmoker see this film and see it soon you probably wont learn anything new about lobbyists or advertisers and it probably wont change your mind but it puts the whole issue in a light that no film has yet and no film ever will again see it,black_comedy
this is a very sharp little satire that paddy cheyefsky would have wholeheartedly approved of wickedly funny the quality of this movie suggests that director jason reitman is even more talented than his father ivanincorporates a couple of real events into its storyline including a fanciful imagining of the way hollywood was influenced to have more characters smoke in films how amusing that aaron eckhard costars with catherine zetajones in his latest film given the way her name is used in this one and yes the marlboro man did indeed die of cancer though we have no way of knowing if the tobacco lobby paid him a visit as we see in this moviepart of the brilliance of is that the satire doesnt just target the tobacco industry with its i do it for the mortgage tone its really attacking corporate culture everywheresmart and quite funny,black_comedy
an excellent movie that makes no attempt to glorify smoking but does successfully glorify smoking lobbyists id never seen aaron eckhart star before and was blown away by his charisma and acting skills this movie really hits home with how it addresses the issue of deniability and the messages conveyed can be translated to help understand current day politics the plot holds up and theres no infeasibility here its a completely believable story that translates to a journey you ride with the protagonist dont be intimidated by the inferrance that the movie is prosmoking its not in any waysummary right up there with shawkshank  american history x,black_comedy
rated r for language and some sexual contenti saw yesterday on the movie networki had heard some great things about this filmits a satire about the tobacco industry and it shows how one representative of the industry smooth talks people into thinking that cigarettes are okay there are other antismoking groups trying to stop him even going as far as trying to kill himthe film also shows the relationship with his son and how he is trying to make his son understand himpretty much like any tobacco industry representativethe storyline seems interesting and there are some very funny parts in the moviebut the film was a bit boring in my opinion and overall just mediocrewatch it if you like the subject matter,black_comedy
from the hilarious and witty opening credits brilliant to the end this is a great satire very intelligentand aaron eckhart is in the jimmy stewart mold he has a wonderfully goofy look about him and would have fit well in any preston sturges film who knew he was a very gifted comedic actor without the over the top shtick of jim carrey etc he just has to use his face and i cracked up the whole cast was terrific ensemble casting at its best and william h macy just confirms that he is one terrific character actor no matter what role he plays hes a scene stealer alright but eckhart can hold his one,black_comedy
is a bold and gutsy satire that takes a politicallysensitive issue and turns it on its ear in a manner that will thoroughly entertain those who view it in the way it is intendedas a satire written and directed by jason reitman son of famed director ivan reitman the film stars aaron eckhart as nick naylor who works as a lobbyistmouthpiece for an organization called the academy of tobacco studies where his job boils down to being a goodwill ambassador for the tobacco industry his current endeavors include negotiating a multimillion dollar movie deal for a futuristic scifi movie starring brad pitt and catherine zetajones where they would smoke throughout the film opposing a campaign being spearheaded by a us senator to put a new label on cigarettes that says poison and has a skull and crossbones underneath it and delivering a suitcase full of money to the original marlboro man who is now dying of cancer in order to get him to stop badmouthing smoking between these duties and his interview with a reporter katie holmesthat reveals just a little too much nick actually finds his life in danger this is one of the smartest and most original satires to hit the silver screen in a long time and as long as you keep in mind that it is a satire the film is richly entertaining we all know that smoking is bad and this film just takes a pointed and off beat look at the issue from the side of the tobacco industry in a world where their side of the issue would matter however beautifully balancing nicks twisted world and the sometimes perverted requirements of his job is his relationship with his son whose hero worship of his dad makes nick question whether or not he should be a role model to his son in the spirit of films like network and all about eve the real star of this film is the razorsharp screenplay by reitman based on a novel by christopher buckley that humorously skewers the tobacco advertising and entertainment industries and should have been nominated for an oscar reitmans kinetic direction works perfectly for this dark and brittle story beautifully executed by a great casteckhart best known prior to this as julia roberts boy toy in erin brockovich turns in a charismatic and riveting performance as nick naylor and gets flawless support from jk simmons as his boss rob lowe as a fast talking movie studio execwilliam h macy as the senator heading the poison label campaign and in a brilliantly understated turn sam elliott as the dying marlboro man a truly unique and daring movie that breaks some bold new ground and should establish jason reitman as an important new force in filmmaking a masterpiece,black_comedy
in a divided world of smokers and nonsmokers there is little hope of harmony between these two groups of people constant conflict over secondhand smoke and smoking in public places fires up both sides nick naylor lobbyist for big tobacco spokesman for the academy of tobacco studies member of the mod squad merchants of death and an allaround jerk can talk his way out of any pickle from wriggling out of a nationaltelevision attack on the joan lunden show to stopping the cancerridden marlboro man from bashing cigarettes nick has a talent his talent lights up brilliantly in a film that dares to test the boundaries concerning cigarette smoking and the world of spin naylor never had trouble being the most hated man in america sure being a mass murderer and a profiteer oh and a yuppie mephistopheles can take its toll but naylor nevertheless happily defends an industry that kills 1200 people a day even when his son joey begs of him at his schools career day please dont ruin my childhood on the other side of the issue is senator finisterre of vermont who dedicates his life to condemning naylor and his work his endeavor has him packaging all cigarettes with a poison label represented by skull and crossbones the warning claims to be a reminder of the dangers of smoking naylor agrees and since heart failure is the number one killer in the united states naylor also feels cholesterolfilled vermont cheddar cheese should carry the label as well reporter heather holloway also has some flexible morals of her own as she employs her rather evident sex appeal in an exclusive interview with nick naylor exposing most of his darkest secrets in her poignant article naylor is unable to defend his ruined reputation but holloway like all evil villains is eventually brought to justice an incredible cast featuring aaron eckhart robert duvall william h macy katie holmes rob lowe maria bello david koechner adam brody and dennis miller shines under the directorial genius of jason reitman reitman son of film director ivan reitman ghostbusters kindergarten cop  evolution provides an originality to the picture necessary for color and a satirical tone reitman creates a unique style of humor throughout the picture a film with a message and witty delivery is rare to come by in modern motion pictures the screenplay was adapted from the 1993 novel by christopher buckley also an amazing read and maybe funnier than the film,black_comedy
the spoken lines in this movie enormously amusing and entertaining this is an intelligently written movie and ill remember many of the lines for quite some timethe lead characters son asks why is the us government the best government in the world dad responds because of its endless appeals system you really have to see this in context to fully get it the one word that sums up this movie is cleverthe movie is about a very quickwitted and intelligent tobacco lobbyist hearing him brilliantly respond to the many accusationsproblemsfacts about the cigarette industry is just plain fun to watch it is so well done both the screen writers and eckhart are to be commendedthe style of this movie was somewhat unfamiliar to me  im used to documentaries mockumentaries and normal movies this a fictional movie which is based on facts but is nonhistorical it took me a little while to start getting this movie  but was entirely worth ithighly recommended for anyone who enjoys clever use of language and an intelligently written script,black_comedy
as the spokesperson for big tobacco nick naylor aaron eckhart spends his life defending cigarettes and the tobacco companies from those who try to keep people from smoking when a vermont senator william macy wants to put a poison label on cigarettes naylor must use all of his wits and charm to keep his job at the academy of tobacco studios by launching new campaigns exclaiming the virtues of nicotineis a hilarious and successful comedy it combines a great screenplay and a fun cast i have to give most of the credit to jason reitman and aaron eckhart reitman did a wonderful job both behind the camera and with the script he didnt go over the top with the satire and he managed to produce many memorable and entertaining scenes aaron eckhart played a scumbag yet he was still very likable i usually find him to be a bland actor but here hes charismatic and he looks like hes having a blast too which always helps i know it wont happen but i think eckhart and the screenplay are oscar worthywhile aaron is good no one else is really on his level the other performances werent bad they just werent as good maria bello was okay as was katie holmes david koechner had a few funny lines though he wasnt in the film for very long william h macy and robert duvall were both pretty unnotable which was surprising given their history rob lowe was too creepy for me while adam brody was just his usual annoying self cameron bright gave the worst performance he kept the same expression on his face throughout the entire thing it amazes me that hes been so lucky with all these roles since hes a horrible actorthe first forty five minutes were fast and consistently funny it then went a little slower and it took a serious turn it still held a few entertaining moments but all the scenes with nick naylor and his son werent handled very well after a small bump the film picked up again and ended with a bang besides for a couple of performances and a weak middle the film is defiantly worth checking out in the end is a pleasant comedy rating 810,black_comedy
i had expected this to be a very boring movie that would become a challenge to finish the kind of movie you keep on the shelve forever i couldnt have been more wrongnick naylor is one of the most interesting characters i got to know this year and the storyline was so ironic original and exiting that i watched this movie twice in the same week and was so surprised by it i put it in my own top ten from 2006very nice and decent acting from everyone and interesting dialogues makes this movie interesting but definitely not boring definitely worth a watch,black_comedy
while everyone is referring to as that tobacco industry movie i think that is very misleading it is more about a good guy who has a despicable job that he takes very seriously he is a spokesmen for big tobacco and its his job to tell the truth and make it as publicly acceptable as possible that is were the movie shines it is not prosmoking or antismoking it really isnt about smoking at all its about how people spin the truth to become more politically correct not only does big tobacco do it newscasters do it corporations do it even the government does it duhthe heart and soul of the movie is aaron eckharts performance as said spin doctor nick naylor he has such a charming personality and friendly face that he could probably do the job very well in real life he hits all the right notes in the comedy and dramatic departments i think he should get an oscar nod but probably wont if you have read my other reviews you know how much i dislike the oscars among the supporters is a great little role from rob lowe as a cigarettefriendly movie agent jk simmons as head of nicks company and adam brody as lowes assistant i havent explained any of the funny parts because they cant be explained and they are very subtle this not 40year old year virgin or american pie its funnier but quieteranyway whether you smoke or not this movie will neither offend nor defend you it only uses big tobacco as a backdrop for its real message think for yourself 810,black_comedy
is about a lobbyist named nick naylor who represents a tobacco research group that helps cigarette companies battle the public outrage to retain market share the fictitious nick naylor eckhart gives a very good performance as he spins the ills of tobacco and discovers that hes not only good at spinning but good at parenting too well sort of good at parenting good performances all the way around as a very solid cast was assembled for the film my reaction to the summary as that this was going to be a depressing film but i actually liked it quite a bit i think the on screen chemistry between all the actors was great,black_comedy
going through the credits i quickly saw cameron bright and remembered his terrible acting from birth which was horrendous and ultraviolet the whole movie was terrible anyway where he didnt act at allanyway a movie about smoking and the movies title attracted me brights nonacting hopefully wont harm the movie to much though he is playing nicks son here hes quite goodanyway the movie definitely had some hilarious moments as you would think with a title like this just from the start when nick introduces us to his world the scientists lawyers and his part as spokesman is to spin it in the other direction its going to be a thrill immediately on the talk show you can see hes damn good at his job for all the money hed make youd think soremembering jk simmons from spiderman he is almost the same newspaper chief here hes nicks bossit ended well with nick making his own choice at the end for the benefit of his son and his own health,black_comedy
theres something to be said for a film that makes no apologies for being completely politically incorrect and certainly has something to saythat audiences may find themselves cheering on the bad guy will make this movie all the more entertaining aaron eckhart suspect zero stars as nick naylor a lobbyist for the tobacco companies and hes very good at what he does one of his sayings is if you argue well enough youre never wrong the moral flexibility nick has is akin to an ethical gymnast but his son joey cameron blight ultraviolet is growing up fast and is learning the ways of the father we see nick navigating these parental waters with a touch of dignity and a splash of chagrin can he be a good father while towing the line for the tobacco companies and telling everyone that cigarettes are a personal choice rather than a death sentence william h macy edmond stars as senator finistirre the good guy who is trying to get a skull and crossbones image stamped on every carton of cigarettes but hes also a politician trying to further his own career he represents a state that produces tons of fatty cheeses thus adding to americans weight and cholesterol problems and he most certainly isnt above taking campaign contributions from businesses is he that the film is filled with contradictions and hilarious moral dilemmas is a tribute to the author of the book christopher buckley that he can turn the tables on alcohol tobacco and firearms all of which are addressed in the name of business is a testament to some damn fine writingwhat makes the movie work so well is aaron eckharts affable portrayal of nick hes so darn likable yet utterly incomprehensible in the moral sense that the audience will be grudgingly cheering him on that he can outmaneuver his opponent macy makes the moviewatcher dislike whom they really should be cheering for what a turnabout the ensemble cast is incredible too in addition to eckhart macy and blight theres mario bello a history of violence sam elliot tombstone katie holmes pieces of april rob lowe the west wing tv series robert duvall the apostle and quite a few other notablesthis film must certainly be on peoples topten list of movies to watch if they havent caught it already,black_comedy
the fact that everyone well almost will do anything for money  the mortgage must be paid  is only one of the subversive elements placed on the table of this bitingly satirical film based on the very edgy novel by christopher buckley director jason reitman has adapted the story for the screen populated his diatribe with a fine cast of actors and directs the whole concept with deft precision while many not familiar with the books bite will be put off by the title rest assured that no one escapes this exploration of the tobacco industry the health industry and the political industry unscathedaaron eckhart is spot on as the tobacco lobbyist nick naylor a man of style and spin who can talk his way through any confrontational encounter and come out the winner he is supported by the tobacco kings budd br rohrbacher jk simmons and the captain robert duvall the movie mogul jeff megall rob lowe by his buddies in crime maria bello and david koechner with similar lobbyist roles in alcohol and firearms and confronted by senator finistirre william h macy in another jewel of a role exmarlboro man lorne lutch sam elliott and journalist heather holloway katie holmes how he manages to make all of these folk satisfied with his message comprises the bulk of this flimflam man story a tale that butchers the tobacco industry with the same vehemence as the antismoking brigadethe lines are fast and furious and eckhart is superb in his role somehow the emphasis of the relationship and frothy philosophy sessions between eckhart and his son cameron bright  as monochromatic a child actor as there is in the industry today make the movie fairly boring just when is should be picking up momentum but that is hollywood covering its tracks not a great movie but a movie that is much better than you would expect grady harp,black_comedy
appears on the outside to arguably be the counterpoint in every conceivable fashion to the insider that near brilliant messenger for the antismoking movement starring russell crowe this film presents us with nick naylor portrayed by bill pullman lookalike aaron eckhart a lobbyist for big tobacco with a penchant for attractive chesty women and an undying drive to oneup his exwife in the parent department he could easily be considered a morally reprehensible figure and a god awful role model for his young son if he werent so damned charmingthis is a film about spin in every possible variation whether it be what washington dc dishes out or what hollywood presents as gods honest truth or perhaps by what persuasions the media might utilize to get their story the satire here is so sharp and works so effortlessly from one unexpected scene to the next that the viewer is completely taken in and engrossed by the proceedings,black_comedy
2005 is a hilarious satirical romp of a comedy directed by jason reitman son of another comic genius ivan reitman this film had me in its addictive grips from its unique title to its intriguing plot who would have ever thought to get into a mind of a tobacco lobbyist in this case aaron eckhart who is perfectly suited for the role of the aforementioned lobbyist nick naylor his charm and charisma will make anyone a believer in whatever he says also hilarious is his rival in the film william h macy in a humorous performance as senator ortolan k finistirre  its not about the cheese the cinematography is also a big plus in this film all in all a rousing 8 out of 10,black_comedy
aaron eckhart grins and swaggers his way through jason son of ivan reitmans amusing satire about tobacco lobbying having appropriate digs at both the tobacco warlords and the people trying to take them down at the end of it all you will hopefully have a decent appreciation for the peoples right to smoke as well as a stern face of disapproval at the obvious nasties coughing up their cancerous tobacco money in corporate americanick naylor gets paid to talk a lot at the beginning of he appears be the worst man in the world a spin doctor for the tobacco companies yet as the movie goes along we start to like nick he appears to be a good father despite having a messy relationship with the exwife and at least has a winning charm owed in no small part to the films lead  aaron eckhart naylor teaches his son that he must think for himself when learning that his school has set him an assignment of why is the us government the best in the world abit strange that seeing that naylors job involves twisting the truth about nicotine addiction and lung cancer he takes his son to la where he attempts to convince a movie producer to get actors to smoke more on screen he also tries to bribe the former marlboro man to keep his dying trap shut about the real effects of longterm fag puffing along the way he and his boy learn some obvious life lessonsreitmans film isnt going to shake things up in the way that something like morgan spurlocks super size me managed to do since that 2004 documentary macdonalds have gone to great lengths to reevaluate their image and produce provided me with a perfectly fine movie that manges to achieve its goals to no real lasting effect but that isnt to say it didnt work i liked it quite a bit in most places despite the odd subplot gone wrong the kidnapping was a bit too distracting provided enough laughs and even if the satire was usually never more than requisite it would be extremely harsh to call this a failure the tobacco industry is probably a fairly obvious target for anyone to poke fun at which is why the two way system deployed by reitman makes this a more than intriguing experience the cast do there utmost with a script full of delicious lines william h macy gobbles his way through some of the best as the eversoslightly nasty senator ortolan k finistirre and the movie breezes along at an affordable pace there may well be better films on the potentially explosive subject of tobacco  michael mann made a killer of a movie with 1999s the insider  but that shouldnt deter anyone it certainly has enough puff to sustain its momentum,black_comedy
with a name like you really dont know what to expect going into this film thankfully thats what is so good about it this dark satire is a breath of badly needed fresh air and by a first time director no lessthe movie is about a tobacco lobbyist named nick naylor who as he describes it talks for a living his character which is one of the best ive ever seen is described wholly in one line you know that guy who can pick up any girl im that guyon crack the story line in this film takes a backseat to the wonderful character exploration which director jason reitman navigates with easenick naylor is played to perfection by aaron eckhart it would have been too easy to overly sensitize this character or to make him a soulless monster but eckhart strikes the perfect balance he makes the character charming and likable but never retracts naylors wicked edge its seems impossible to like much less root for a character who peddles cigarettes but eckhart will have you standing and applauding he gives the performance of a seasoned veteran bravothe bulk of the supporting cast give very good performances as well rob lowe gives what could be the finest performance of his career cameron bright is great as naylors son who idolizes him and jk simmons has never been funnier as naylors boss these entertaining performances are for the most part a product of the brilliant screenplaylike i said this is the screenplay to beat this year i dont have any idea how the oscars could ignore this labor of love the script has a very stylish feel to it that transferred very well to the silver screen every joke in this movie is funny that is an incredible feat i have never seen a movie where i did not roll my eyes during at least one of the jokes but every one in this film was good some were only good while others had me in the floor like only arrested development can especially naylors jokes his flat and dry delivery is absolutely brilliantwith all that being said this movie is far from perfect william h macy who is normally a safe bet came off feeling a bit detached from the picture he worked but it just wasnt his usual greatness maria bello is excellent in her role but feels extremely underutilized they could have cast anyone in this role katie holmes proves once again that she is nothing more than a washed up teen soap star and a horribly miscast soap star at that at least in batman begins i could see her in that role but here she plays a seductive reporter is there any other kind who tricks naylor into revealing his life secrets she is stiff and plain boring to watchim someone who watched the island and didnt hate it so im no stranger to huh plot twists but this one was a whopper i wont spoil it for those who have not seen the film but trust me youll know when it comes at first it seems like a darkly clever move by the screenwriters but turns out to be purely story serving and frankly a bit ridiculousas a whole this movie kept me more than thoroughly entertained for the entire screen time between eckharts pitch perfect rendering of a man who should have no morals but is a real person and reitmans rapidfire script this is not a movie to miss,black_comedy
this movie is an awful adaptation of the book they cut out way to much of the plot completely change the ending of the moving and add a character that adds nothing to the movie skip this movie and just go read the book how can a movie cut out one of the main characters and cut out the whole plot from the book they should of went with the role of him going to jail and changing the son had no business being in the movie this was just horrible like i said skip this movie and go read the book this is an awful cliff notes version of the book one plus for this movie was the acting was good but what goods the acting when the story is gutted,black_comedy
the best parts of concern the art of making money from selling nothing but an actual realistic understanding of that world to people who got hoodwinked by indoctrination into a vague idealism they cant even reason through these scenes are so good that its a shame the movie is structurally bland and that the good scenes are buried in average ones it should be funnier and more over the top it shouldnt be the typical motivational movie it also feels cheap and rushed many scenes look like they should have been reshottyfs has the typical problems as all crisis point movies in which a protagonist must choose between morally good and bad options neither option holds much promise he can take a preachy road to redemption like say the road to perdition or he can remain scummy in which case the movie is termed a character study there isnt much tension or satisfaction in figuring out where nick is heading here its a comedy the dilemma faced by those scripts is that they throw away the interesting unethical world for the workaday one goodfellas we all already know isnt interesting some of these movies sin city la confidential fight club seek resolution in a crescendo of violence which turns out to be equally unsatisfying because it pushes anything smart from the first half off the screen this movie makes a bet that it really doesnt matter which choice nick makes and theyre probably right as long as the movie is beautifully written but its not so nicks choice the structure has to be compelling nick should have come up with a brilliant way to play everyone as saps i dont need nick to become a tightassed bourgeois eunuch but this fails to really exalt in nicks final choiceironically the first half of this movie isnt very good the cancer boy gag which attempts to be one of the most cynical jokes in the movie is lifted without shame from the dud kids in the hall movie brain candy the bitter laughs it seeks can only come from people who havent seen these ideas handled better in network fight club etc only once nick gets an asswhupping does the movie come to life sadly the villain gets only one appearance and wo explanation fails to show up after the middle of the film its not good when the energy is so middling that rob lowe ends up stealing his scenesthis movie is all you need to know about why the democrats will lose the fall elections the dems are such limp flakes that they think the sincere embodiment of a moral position will get them votes the bush presidency proves this to be idiocy you say what you need to to mobilize a majority to vote for you and once youre in power you do whatever the hell you want and tell the same stupid voters that black is actually white the legislation you just passed to screw them fill your bank account and pay your friends is really about saving them american voters are so hopelessly stupid theyll sign on with just a little repetition if you like you can allow a city a wing of the pentagon and a pair of buildings in manhattan to be wiped off the face of the earth and still have 38 percent of the people behind you the republicans are evil but they couldnt do it without the pathetic dems,black_comedy
it was too repetitive i laughed once the tobacco companies have been hit hard for many years now so to bring it up once again wasnt too new the repeating trio at the lunch table tobacco alcohol firearms wasnt funny the first time and wasnt funny the other times it was part of the movie either basically the story didnt hold up for all the time that was allotted to it so they had to try and make the young son a focus of the film with the idea that he could learn from his dad how to be the kind of orator that st augustine was a couple of thousand years ago bottom line on this film nothing new cancer is not a joke and this was not well written enough to get humor out of it,black_comedy
pretty thin gruel a prime example of a movie trailer being ten times better that the movie  and under two minutes running timea great cast wasted on a bland version of socalled satiresome funny lines very good by sitcom standards but hardly anything to unseat preston sturges dont waste your time on this one rent network instead if you want to witness cinematic satire with a full set of choppersand what about the sex scene with katie holmes come on you were wondering after all the wellplaced publicity by tomkat  right well at best katies big sex scene looks like outtakes from a dull exercise video most american movies present sex this way of course this director despite his pedigree has a lot to learn about taking risks and entertaining the audience,black_comedy
im just out of the theater and i think misses all his marks the reason i can find is simple freshman director jason reitman confused satirical for farcical building and finetuning a satire takes a lot more than launching an overthetop character in an overthetop world hoping the jokes will be so good that people will think how clever if a joke works people laugh and are content with it if it misfires people are just bored this is the law of entertainmentin this movie some jokes are funny and the rest are simply not silly enough to emerge from the ongoing farce but the worst is that the only humane people the only people not out of a cartoon are just plain boring nicks exwife and his son are so bland compared with such a colorful character they look dumb thus nick has no valuable point of comparison with reality is he a tortured man not even close hes just a highflying professional cynic who could well end up a moral guy if thats better for him he simply doesnt live in our world thus we cannot empathize with him or even hate him since hes just a living farce after all and he spends lots of energy to make us laugh a brilliant cynical guy mocking the lame hypocritical jerksso nick naylor is colorful but that doesnt make for an interesting character hes got nothing to prove nothing to change hes always on so you cant tell if he really cares for his family or his friends more than cynical fatality urges him to hes there they happen to be the closest human beings so be itall along the movie nothing builds up around nicks personality his relations to people or simply his desire to tell whats inside of him what he is really made of but the key scene where you cant deny the whole edifice doesnt stand up is when jason reitman wants to put the final touch nick naylor is just out of the senate commission and there you can hear the thunder as the director confuses all the energy he put in the project with tune acutenessall energy and no emotions is a classic fumble with young directors almodovar was all energy in his first movies all energy but with a clear motive these movies were about exuberant life kind of touching in its exuberant naivety aims to be clever before anything else so theres no excuse the movie was not made on the cheap with an amateur cast and crew the script was based on a book and was greenlit by some guys who thought allaround big tobacco bashing was enough to make a cool picture totally avoidable approach rapidly forgettable flick a very sad outcome,black_comedy
should have been a hip irreverent comedy and it is its just not consistently hip irreverent or funnythe film starts out with a great premise seeing the eyes through a lessthanethical tobacco lobbyist it does start out very promising the protagonists twisted logic justifying a shady profession is outstandingly funny hanging out with fellow sin lobbyists representing alcohol and firearms is a great addition the main character explain his actions to his son is priceless the introduction of robert duvall as the lord of the tobacco world is tremendous casting a brilliant decision and a great characterbut then the movie goes wrong first theres the inclusion of the conscience character played by the exwife they should have scrapped that character entirely the downtoearth element saps the irreverent soul right out of this movie they should have made her unseemly that would have added somethingthen theres the decision to add in a slimy hollywood producer this is a role that has been so overdone its basically a caricature of a caricature and is decidedly unfunny next the writers throw in a highly unnecessary kidnapping sequence that adds absolutely nothing to the film this all leads to the inevitable confrontation on capitol hill which unfortunately is patently uninteresting and does not do the main character justiceso in summary the beginning is promising there are some funny bits but the writers lose their steam halfway through until its just over6 out of 10 higher than it deserves because it is a neat conceptbarky,black_comedy
what a disappointment as someone who has never smoked a cigarette in his life and who loves poking fun at the tobacco industry and all its addicted consumers who lack at least some degree of selfrespect and selfcontrol i expected much more humor in this dullasdishwater nothing of a movie its about a tobacco promoter wholl stoop to any lows to put a spin on the dangers of cigarettes to sell his product but its not in the least bit funny or clever just excruciatingly dull i cant believe robert duvall got mixed up with this thing but he and sam elliott the latter playing the former marlboro man now infected with cancer were the best things in it it still wasnt enough to make it worth investing 90 some odd minutes though i did have one shortlived laugh however the main title song about needing to smoke and being unable to stop was hilarious and a real hoot so to all you chronic puffers out there who just refuse to wise up and save your own lives i hereby sing smoke smoke smoke that cigareeettttttte bwahahahahahahahahahaha 0 out of coughcough  ,black_comedy
a one joke film badly written telegraphed predictable jokes and situations we get it people promoting harmful products without a conscience its a premise that makes for an easy laugh which means the film needs to be clever  and the writing here does not make the grade its a borea tobacco spokesman would never go on an oprahstyle talk show aimed at women to defend cigarettes its such inyourface satire that it winds up falling flat if you are going to do a bit like that it cannot be couched in such a sliceoflife genre it doesnt work the whole film is like this pass it by,black_comedy
is a satirical and cynical look at the tobacco industry not only does the movie skewer big tobacco it also impales big alcohol big guns big oil big food big media big movies and big politicsthe main character is a big tobacco industry lobbyist who shamelessly prostitutes himself in order to pay the mortgage truth to nick naylor and to almost all the other buffoons in the movie is nonexistent or at least relative integrity honesty or any other admirable virtue you can think of forget it even nicks adolescent kid is corrupti had a hard time taking the moving seriously even as a satire i chuckled a few times pondered once or twice and patiently ate through my entire bowl of popcornthe movie was drab 92 minutes of overthetop clichd nottoofunny satire makes one restless even i imagine if youre an antismoking antibusiness antiamerican antibig everything zealotplot character acting script does it matter ill score it a five why because im antibig drab,black_comedy
anyone going to see this movie and expecting a biting satire on big tobacco will be sorely disappointed though many of the set piece scenes had good potential to expose the hypocrisys of the cigarette pr industry most fell flatter then a damp packet of marlboros instead we where treated to the generic and predictable tale of the corporate joe who eventually learns his valuable life lesson from an adoring faultless son aaron eckhart from in the company of men plays nick naylor a vp of public relations in a tobacco lobby group he works his trade by pulling the wool over the eyes of a gullible and susceptible public using various devices to keep selling cigarettes to all he is good at his job and he knows it pity that the first time writerdirector christopher buckley tries to achieve the same effect on us the paying public logical inaccuracys are skimmed over characters introduced and then forgotten about standard montage jumpcuts used to indicate travel etc the ever brilliant william h macy stands out from the mire as usual as the frustrated and plausible senator trying to limit the reach of cigarettes to the teenage kidsthe conclusion is remarkable in its forced unreality where in the real world can a media expert screw up so spectacularly and come out a hero after a few weak oneliners how many in the audience will leave cheering on the frustrated cigarette industry against those pesky senate legislators even if unintended sorry but i must have had smoke in my eyes watching this farce as with the tagline christopher buckley doesnt do compelling satire he filters it,black_comedy
that this film is garnering such high votes from users is indicative of how easily manipulated most people are this movie dresses in the livery of a sophisticated satire but falls short in many ways there is one bit of dialogue for example which is representative of the inane lazinessstupidity of the writers do you know who he is yeah hes the original marlboro man he lives on a ranch hes dying not our biggest fan  why didnt the movie just use these lines will you explain to the audience who he is so they are not lost in the next scene when you go to his ranch looking house sure hes the original marlboro man he lives on a ranch hes dying not our biggest fan  also it lacks the focus to be a good satire floundering between irony and artificial attempts at sincerity a truly good satire would have ended with big tobacco winning with big tobacco as the protagonist and the victor a happy ending with them winning to top it off the katie holmes character is flat even for a comedy and pretty much completely worthless considering the love making scenes she is in reveal nothing,black_comedy
i saw this movie at an la preview a couple days before its commercial release i saw the trailers and had wanted to see the movie so when the preview came available i jumped at the opportunity it was everything that i expected and actually quite a bit more funny than i was expecting it was an irreverent look at american politics and the traditional antismoking tale i would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of political satire as it is a great example of exactly that it is by no means preachy in fact it is exactly the opposite in addition its also a tale of family and how a father copes with living apart from his son and divorced wife nick struggles with trying to be a role model for his son and balancing his life as a spin artist in addition dont discount the early role of katie holmes as the payoff will come at the end of the film,black_comedy
this movie has been in my radar for a while i have seen some people talk about it and its controversial topic so i finally decided to look it up myselfthis movie had me dying from laughter one second and then thinking about freedom and decision makingmany people wont like the main theme of the movie because its very controversial but i believe that controversy is what gives it the humour and the thoughtfulness it containssome people will say that this movie is cigarette propaganda but if you see closely not one cigarette is smoked throughout the whole film because that is not the point the movie uses smoking to give out some very interesting and hilarious ideas about our societythis has become one of my favourite comedies of all timei really loved the films style and color scheme concentrating on browns and blues which is not seen very often nowadays the performances were great specially jk playing the mean boss,black_comedy
its an old movie of 2006 10 years that i am reviewing but thought it would be worth it is one movie i feel everyone should watch and no it wont turn you into a smoker story 910 tyfs throws a satirical light on one of the less heard perspectives of the tobacco industry in the whole antismoking debate however the writer carefully keeps the main plot as a struggle of a father who works for the tobacco industry but still holds his ground in front of his son in spite of a very hostile environment the conversations between nick the protagonist father and joey his son are profound as well as humorous as rightly said if you can defend tobacco you can do anything the part on the art of argumentation is inspiring to say particularly impressive about the story is that all the characters are well defined and have a strong appeal except may be that of nicks wife however a strong character sketch of nick naylor as a handsome smart articulate unapologetic and persuasive lobbyist lifts the whole story to the next level the mod trio just scales the topic of the movie to other similar territories acting 810 aaron eckhart has probably given one of his best acting performances in the movie though i always imagined de caprio could have done more justice to this kind of a character however aaron doesnt disappoint at all the supporting cast particularly camaron bright the mod squad holmes lowe and macy do an amazing work direction 910 if the story and the topic makes the movie all so serious  jason reitmans direction and screenplay brings in the much required punch of humor or we may say satire to the movie to make it enjoyable and he saves the best for the last when nick naylor brings to the table what is actually needed for the society in the whole anti smoking debate black comedy can be difficult but reitman nails it beautifully overall 910 all in all the movie is a must watch for everyone one of the best hollywood movies that you can keep in your collection,black_comedy
personally one of the most amazing movies ive watched it is a light movie which sends out a very powerful message it not just mocks the governments failed attempts against tobacco and shows strategies used by mncs but also focuses on parenthood it is shown how society imposes its rules over the kids from a very young age instead of telling them all possible pros and cons of the topic in question and letting them decide for themselves it portrays how a parent must let the kids to think instead of forcing prejudices it shows the real face of modern day media and corporations the psychological tricks used in advertising to convince the customers is mocked as well the actors have played their part perfectly not to mention the soundtrack is amazing,black_comedy
the movie is focused around the life of a man named nick naylor who is big tobaccos chief lobbyist aaron eckhart does a great job of portraying the silver tongued lobbyist nick naylor who is an extremely charismatic man who has enough charisma o convince the entire nation to pick up the habit of smoking naylors job is to help maintain the reputation of tobacco companies and keep cigarettes in the mouth of the greater american public the movie was created as a satire trying to show the ludicrous dealings and operations of big tobacco companies there are scenes in which the shady dealings of these companies are shown to the audience in a hilarious manor such as when naylor uses a large amount of money to bribe an individual from testifying that his cancer was brought on by his use of tobacco this scene showed audiences the amount of money that big tobacco has puts them in a greater position of power in which they can easily manipulate things into their favor naylors closest friends consist of two individuals one being polly bailey a representative of the alcohol industry and the other being bobby jay bliss a representative of the fire arm industry together the collective call themselves the merchants of death and they pride themselves over how many deaths the industry they represent rack up in one of the more ironic scenes of the movie naylor gets kidnapped by individuals who want him to speak out against the tobacco companies so as a method of torture they begin pacing multiple nicotine patches on naylor they placed so many patches that naylor had a near death experience the only thing that kept naylor alive was the fact that he was a cigarette smoker so his body was already used to the immense amount of nicotine that he was dosed with towards the end of the movie there is a funny scene in which the three of them are all arguing over which ones industry accumulates the highest death tool within the year and naylor brags about how the smoking industry is related to more deaths than fire arm use and alcohol consumption this movie does a great job of informing the audience of the effects of tobacco use in a very comedic way thats so natural to the story progression that most individuals who watch this film wont even realize that they are gaining this information this is why the movie is so effective in its purpose to inform and yet entertain the audience the film never feels too pushy on the audience with its underlying message of trying to get current smokers to quit and to get people informed about the unfair tactics employed by big tobacco companies,black_comedy
what i really love about and what stands out the most about it is that it doesnt take any sides it is neither a prosmoking nor an antismoking film it actually gives both sides to the argument and it allows you to decide for yourself it is also very thought provoking and it sort of gave me another interesting side to the repetitive and combed over smoking is bad argumentnick naylor is a tobacco lobbyist and the vicepresident of a tobacco lobby known as the academy of tobacco studies the people who work there have been researching the effects of tobacco smoking and lung cancer for 15 years they claim that their research which is mostly funded by tobacco companies have found no correlation whatsoever of lung cancer being a side effect nick naylor is challenged to convince as many people as possible not to smoke one of the people he has to get by is the senator of vermont ortolan finistirre who is really antismokingthe fact that this film doesnt take any sides is what makes it so special the film is focused more on nick naylor and the arguments he used in the movie which were far ahead of the time when it came out this film makes fun of both sides of the tobacco industry the finale when nick naylor goes up against ortolan finistirre is the best scene in the film it allows you to see smoking in a different way and it is one of the most thought provoking scenes ive ever seen in cinema its timelessalso to say that its plot is daring is an understatement its very shocking in a way that the characters who promote smoking and try to get more people to do the act of it are the good guys and the characters such as the senator who try to promote good health are labeled as the bad guys in the film also the film says that big corporations are good and large body counts leads to long lasting friendships these portions of its plot make it stand out amongst most comedies and this makes it a very smart filmalso the movie actually got me to dislike that senator who was trying to promote good health with a burning passion overall i felt like the senator was wasting his time trying to put pictures on cigarette packages i think this because im willing to bet that 999 of everyone who smokes has at one point heard that smoking is bad for you that hasnt stopped them from smoking so i dont think that senator ortolan finistirres plan would decrease the amount of smokers that much im not a smoker but if i wanted to start i wouldnt be persuaded not to do so just by looking at the pictures on the boxes the warning labels we already have are just fine also i felt that nick did a much better job in his debates with him because he made his point more firm and sometimes his points were so good that the senator couldnt think of anything to say after he made his point also the senator often spent more time in the debates asking him questions which werent that good instead of disagreeing with things he said before i wont spoil what the senator does at the very end of the movie because it is really funny but he appears to lose his mind by the endif a movie has me liking a character trying to convince others to smoke and if it has me disliking a senator trying to promote good health id say that it definitely did something right some may argue whether this is a good or a bad thing but i think that this is a good thing because it shows the many things that movies can do i cant think of any other movie which has done this beforealso the acting is pretty great aaron eckharts performance as nick naylor is outstanding he easily carries the whole movies as he is able to deliver his lines with a sense of courage and fearlessness when he is in debates with other people when he goes up against big people he treats it like its just another day at the office he was the only actor who impressed me but thats not to say that the other actors did a bad job they still did a good job as well adam brody william h brady and jk simmons were good actors too however they didnt have the same charm as aaron eckhart did in the filmlike most great underrated movies however its not without its flaws the pacing can get to be a little tiresome near the middle of the film and some scenes can drag on a little too long but this is about the only thing which bothered me and even when i felt a bit bored the film always managed to suck me back in at the next scenein conclusion is a smart and entertaining comedy which will stick with you long after viewing it it doesnt take any sides and it also has a thought provoking and well thought out meaning behind it the acting is also pretty good as well it may have a few drawn out scenes which can get tiresome but this is a minor criticism on my part this movie should be viewed by everyone it is quite an experience to watch it just because it gives you another side of the argument which is very valid and thought provoking it is a film which definitely flew under the radar,black_comedy
is a satire film written and directed by jason reitman based on the satirical novel of the same name by christopher buckley the story follows nick naylor played by aaron eckhart a lobbyist for the tobacco industry we see him navigating his way through the ordeal of having to defend a seemingly evil industry while facing the heat of hatred from senators journalists and the public while simultaneously trying to be a role model for his 12 year old sonthis is a film that truly surprised me because it doesnt shy away from throwing punches considering this was reitmans debut i cant praise him highly enough for his brilliant screenplay and almost masterful directorial work the film is extremely funny and the dialogues are absolutely razor sharp ornamented with extreme wit reitman portrays both sides of the tobacco divide at their most genuine raw and sometimes hypocritical and obnoxious states without pledging alliance to either of them the voiceover narration and some other elements of the film did remind me of goodfellas but the film that it reminded me the most of was kubricks a clockwork orange this comparison is not based on how disturbing the two movies are because a clockwork orange is much more disturbing than i make this comparison because of the moral ambiguity of both films both films tactfully refuse to take sides in the morality conflict happening at the core of them another important factor that connects these two films is how critical a role free will plays in them in the end is less about the tobacco industry and more about the character nick naylor and his philosophies in life which he tries to share with his son having said that the tobacco angle in the film is still substantial and that makes this a great companion piece with the much more serious the insider you can also find a lot of real life hollywood references in which makes the themes in the film all the more relevant and poignantalthough the film has brilliant performances all across the board from actors like jk simmons robert duvall rob loweetc but this film does not work at all without the stupendous aaron eckhart he drives this movie forward at times singlehandedly he is brilliant with his line delivery he is charming and he is ravishingly funny without compromising the need to build a real character of nick naylor around the comedyin my eyes this is one of the best debuts that have materialised in hollywood after the fall of the century i have read that reitman made many changes from the original novel for his screenplay and as far as i am concerned everything worked his direction is brilliant the tone remains lighthearted and humorous even though sensitive issues are being explored which is the best thing for a satire i tried very hard to find a reservation that i might have against the movie but i couldnt find any this is a comedic near masterpiece,black_comedy
is the directorial debut by jason reitman who would later direct contemporary classics such as juno and up in the air this film is a sharp hilarious satire about smoking and how it plays a role in the political process recently smoking has become a political question due to the health hazards it possess so this this a very timely movie the script without a question is one of the best scripts of recent memory the dialog is just so smooth and witty and a good screenplay often means a good movie like we have herejason reitmans film is about a tobacco lobbyist named nick naylor who has a way with words he invokes the wrath of a senator named ortolan finistirre who vehemently opposes smoking and proposes that a skull and bones logo to be added on the cartons so now nick must try to advocate smoking while remaining as a role model for his twelveyearold sonthe film has a great cast and they all do well aaron eckhart was fantastic as the smoothtalking nick and he has great chemistry with everyone i like jk simmons as nicks backstabbing boss and robert duvall as the bosss boss katie holmes was excellent as the seductive news reporter my favorite scenes of the movie consists of nick meeting with his friends in the alcohol and firearm industries respectively played by maria bello and david koechneroverall is an incredibly excellent film as a satire it can hardly get any better than this with a great screenplay and fantastic acting the film exceeded my expectations jason reitman is a truly gifted director like father like son i hate smoking so i was pleased to see a film that have messages of antismoking even if they are subliminal a fantastic directorial debut by reitman i rate this film 910,black_comedy
some movies really fall into different territory all together just think of people who are playing the role of merchants of death like our hero nick naylor played by super aaron eckhart who is a lobbyist on behalf of companies who make billions by selling cigarettes and are root cause of 1200 deaths every day our hero just does not defend them he makes sure no one thinks of them being bad people although he has facing a personal battle where he has to justify his stand to his growing son who is so fond of him directed by jason reitman of juno and up in the air fame this movie is a little cracker with delicious and witty one liners coming at rat a tat speed characters which are so well defined and screenplay which as clean as water in mountains i wish the war with senator was given more length as i felt that movie was over before its due time i am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for it is such a delicious comedy and drama with out of box idea that will keep you thinking for days,black_comedy
now i never read the novel but god i wanted to see this concept deliver and the trailer had me spellbound in the end does deliver it gives out humor that have broad appeal along with a satirical plot that is not convoluted as its plot is brought out in style jason reitman is a boss i loved his work in up in the air and juno was fantastic he deserves all the praise he gets as far as im concerned and it started with this film with good reason takes full advantage of its comical concept and becomes a tour de force you can see it in its editing the characterization and the voice overs of eckhartdont get me started with eckhart in match with the still shots just matches so perfectly bringing out a nice appealing and straight story to get integrated with the performances of all the actors are great except katie holmes theres just something artificial about her im so sorry katie but god aaron eckhart blows this one out of the park he takes the role so simply and encompasses it with the way he talks and the body language it really does not feel like hes doing any effort at all as if its all a natural part of him comical dialogue and satire were brought in at the right times and it never felt too strange or out of place the soundtrack can sometimes be the simple use of single percussion or strings but its simplicity adds the feeling needed for the occasionis stylish witty and filled with entertainment you dont have to understand the political concerns or the general knowledge about something as controversial as smoking just go in take a load off and watch the film pioneered by the wonders of jason reitman the film is bound to give smiles,black_comedy
reitman impresses i am supposing we will lose our taste for his approach over time and he will start to submerge it under conventional emotional forms he is already well underway with up in the air so as with kevin smith we will have to go to the earlier films to see the sharp thing that made us notice the usual way of describing this as shifting the frame of reference of an ironic form to the ironic side in this explanation weve had so much of irony we are able to see antiirony as irony the flaw of course is that the term was used wrong none of this ever was irony unless you redefine the word now that would be ironic a better way of understanding this is as a narrative layering we come to stories these days less interested in the story than in how it is presented even the end of a south park episode where we are supposed to come back to the real world and get the moral the delivery is one that reverses the message i call this narrative folding reitman plays with that reversal he is hardly the first but he has the best control in terms of disciplined filmmaking even here you can see the safety valve the emotional fallback here it is the onscreen son who does not get the reversal and his earnest adoration reitman will always have this my latest example matt aselton walked without this safety net also in these things  at least for a few years  we will always have a media reminder a reminder that we are watching a movie here it is the fact that our focus is a media performer with the intent of reversing the truthteds evaluation  3 of 3 worth watching,black_comedy
jason reitman was always going to have a lot to live up to having a dad who was a successful director of the ghostbusters film and a big player in hollywood studios did see potential in him offering him the chance to direct dude wheres my car but reitman did not want to be seen living off his fathers coattails his first feature film ended up being a smaller independent dark comedy taking on the lobby industry american politics and hollywoodtells the story of nick naylor aaron eckhart the vice president of the academy of tobacco studies and their chief spokesman he has to defend the indefensible and proves that he can argue superbly against people with more moral argues but despite his skills and even humiliating antismoking campaigners on national television the tobacco industry is under constant assault senator finisterre william h macy a democrat from vermont proposes a bill to put visial warnings on cigarette packets and challenges the tobacco lobby to face his subcommittee nick believes going on the offensive accept finisterres challenge face the media lead by a young journalist heather holloway katie holmes and try and make smoking sexy again by working with a hollywood superagent jeff megall rob lowe to produce a movie nicks personal life also grown and he grows closer to young son joey cameron bright and he teaches him how to debate effective the two go on trips together and nick argues that all he is doing is enfranchising the disenfranchised but nicks world is thrown into jeopardy when his life is threaten and he has to battle the media he walks a fine line with his boss br jk simmons and with the finer moral line jason reitman shows himself to be very ambitious writerdirector taking on a wide number targets the smoking lobby the general lobby industry in american the political left and shows that hollywood isnt as liberal as the conservative media would have you believe reitman is very stylist director starting out with an effective title sequence and continuing throughout with little visial tricks and even stock footage reitman keeps the humour going throughout the film telling a very funny story that would please anyone who enjoys good satire this is film aimed for a very politically aware audience and anyone who enjoys smart dark comedy will like this film but as well as the comedy reitman does also offer some heart in his film with a key element of the film being the father and son relationship between nick and joey and how it grows and more hardhitting scenes like when nick meets lorne lutch sam elliott a former tobacco spokesman who developed lung cancer there is a fine cast in this film if christopher nolan is be believed that this film landed aaron eckhart the role of harvey dent in the dark knight eckhart is perfectly slimy as the tobacco lobbyist who could sell sand to the egyptians the great jk simmons is almost like j jonah jameson as nicks boss and he has been a regular player in reitmans films cameron bright who is more known for playing a creepy kid in birth and in the poor xmen the last stand give his best performance ever in a film katie holmes shows that she can be a good actress and it was fun to see her as a bit of minx william h macy a darling of independence american cinema is very effective as the villain who has a very moral cause despite the positives there are a few problems with this film firstly is the problem involving eckharts character nick is so unlikeable throughout the film that its hard to root for him he is too slimy and would have been better a supporting character it was hard to agree with his arguments like enfranchising the disenfranchised ignoring the fact many of these industry have multibillion dollar profits and can buy all the influence there want this story would have been very interesting if it was told from senator finisterres battling against the intensive lobbying from the tobacco industry the film also missed a trick when it could have shown the tobacco industry making political contributions to politicians at many different levels state politicians governors senators representatives being corrupted by their evil as well whilst it is mostly the democrats who take on the tobacco industry and that big tobacco were one of the biggest supporters of george w bush along with other evils like oil mining chemicals the gun lobby and logging the film could have twisted on the idea showing a rightwing republican also taking on tobacco much like ted kennedy and orrin hatch of utahthis is a clever satire and worth watching if you are interested in american politics,black_comedy
for years the tobacco industry encouraged people to smoke while denying something it knew that cigarettes cause cancer the governments of the world did nothing to stop it and continue to encourage domestic firms to exploit the export market although the us tobacco industry was bizarrely in my opinion made to pay retrospective fines for behaviour that had not been illegal and which they still engage in with the toleration of the same government that is imposing the fines for doing so in the past one might also note that if one believes that prohibition is counterproductive someone has to make the damn things and high taxes allow the nonsmoking middle classes to feel morally superior while the poor pay the bills the point of this introductory material is that theres a lot of hypocrisy and cant in the story of tobacco and the field may appear ripe for satire however while always fresh and breezy doesnt quite hit the mark its set in the recent past but in fact its world appears more distant than it is supposed to be harking back to the days when big tobacco had it far easier than at any time in recent years and while its portraits of business politics and journalism are all quite fun none of them quite ring true the film reminded me somewhat of i heart huckabees also a jaunty imaginative look at corporate america but also a film not actually interested in how the system really works indeed director jason reitman seems to think himself clever for making a tobacco lobbyist a relatively sympathetic figure but while a sense of morality is not necessary for comedy a film can only wring so many laughs by shocking us for failing to display one where expected an angrier film from either viewpoint might have been a funnier film as well,black_comedy
what can i say its the truth no matter how grim it is yes the main character nick naylor is the spokesman for a tobacco company does he like cigarettes yes he does does he know theyre bad for you yes he does but thats not the point its his job to convince people his job is to talk and win arguments and hes a master of itnow this is one of the most hilarious and most brilliant films ive seen in this year and dont let the title scare this movie does not want you to start smoking if you think so youve missed the point its about freedom put in a very dark humoured way in which the moral is are smokers that much dumber than the rest of the world there are so many bad things in the world and just because some people out of theyre own free will want to smoke something that dangerous for themselves well then thats theyre choiceits the ultimate freedom question told in a very satire form as long has you dont hurt anyone in the process you can do whatever the hell you wantand lets not forget the great acting from aaron eckhart as nick naylor and many other great supporting characters especially cameron bright as nicks son joey naylor see the film i wont spoil all the characters position in the film now i hope you dont misunderstand me im against smoking to but this movie comes with hilarious clever and rude arguments in ways you couldnt possibly imagine for a clever and darkhumoured film which definitely makes you think i give this film 1010,black_comedy
when i sat down to watch i was expecting a straight forward antismoking message but what i got was something a little more complicated rather than bombard me with antismoking propaganda it sent a message about personal responsibility and free choice whether or not i agreed with it i can still respect it for not taking the easy way outnaylor i renounce smoking in fact i will now use my powers of persuasion to bring down big tobacco believe me i was convinced that ending was coming the ending they do use makes the movie feel more realbut what is a good story without a good script the dialogue is clever and the way it is delivered is even better there is not one weak link in this movie as far as acting or writing goesi highly recommend paying special attention to the scene where eckhart must deliver a speech to a class room full of children not to mention any scene containing the mod squad the production quality is what really blew me away with this movie the cinema photography is unusually good for a comedy and the editing is incredibly unique there are visual treats peppered throughout the film i felt like i was watching a cohen brothers flick or a wes anderson film the whole timetheres this one part where naylor is scratching his sons head while he sleeps on his lap and when it cuts to the next scene of him dropping him off hes scratching his head again it creates the illusion of continuous motion a very neat trick if i say so myselfnaylors narration is another good part of this movie everything he says is either funny or insightful and sometimes its both besides one awkward interjection at the beginning of the movie it manages to cue up at just the right momentsthere are two things i find wrong with this movie firstly i think its rather impossible for someone to receive such a level of nicotine toxicity they can never smoke again in their lifethe only other gripe i have with this movie is the ending make no mistake it was a fantastic ending it just didnt feel like it had that much closure to itwho knows maybe i just didnt want the movie to end at all,black_comedy
after seeing and enjoying the pleasant surprise of juno i was eager to rent director jason reitmans first film i am happy to say this is one of the better political satires in recent memory aaron eckhart is absolutely brilliant and perfectly cast as nick naylor the main lobbyist for the tobacco industry what makes this film and this character so fascinating is that they both agree that smoking is not good for you yet they make a living trying to convince people not that they are good for you but that they are simply cool made on an indie film budget this movie boasts some great actors including jk simmons william h macy rob lowe adam brody katie holmes and robert duvall who all play their bit parts to perfection in the end however it is eckhart who drives this story home he is likable enough to root for yet he is also a scheming manipulator of the truth who tries to be a role model for his son despite its sometimes grim subject material reitman keeps it mostly energetic and funny if you love satire is one you should get addicted to,black_comedy
a great one on the same level as lord of warjust like lord of war this one confronts us with a rarely perceived part of our reality and with a hero who is in fact a bad guy and has the blood of so many innocent on his hands and still we can not hate him  what does this tell us about ourselves  very well donethis movie concentrates on the cigarette lobby but generally its about lobbying as a whole about twisting a discussion until the real topic is forgotten and than directing it in a different direction so that the others seem to be wrong so of course you are right about words as the most deadliest weaponthis is a very very cynical movie looking so happy and easy minded like the protagonist showing how one can defend corporations killing lots of people not someone who has done crimes mind you but someone who is doing them right now and will do them in the future how one can justify this before oneself and even get away with thisthe dialogues are just great and the movie performs several side blows on the system government  well a lot inside i would wish to be able to tell as well and entertaining as this movie does for being entertaining makes people listen to youthe visuals are very well done also loved the soundtrack the cast does a fantastic job and this is generally one of the best movies i watched recently  ah well i ever watchedthe directing is a masterpiece for himself  loved the opening the cigarette song and cigarettelooking introduction of the actors and the protagonist being on that show with the film holding so he can explain the situation watch itjoey naylor so what happens when youre wrong nick naylor whoa joey im never wrong joey naylor but you cant always be right nick naylor well if its your job to be right then youre never wrong joey naylor but what if you are wrong nick naylor ok lets say that youre defending chocolate and im defending vanilla now if i were to say to you vanilla is the best flavour icecream youd say joey naylor no chocolate is nick naylor exactly but you cant win that argument so ill ask you so you think chocolate is the end all and the all of icecream do you joey naylor its the best icecream i wouldnt order any other nick naylor oh so its all chocolate for you is it joey naylor yes chocolate is all i need nick naylor well i need more than chocolate and for that matter i need more than vanilla i believe that we need freedom and choice when it comes to our icecream and that joey naylor that is the definition of liberty joey naylor but thats not what were talking about nick naylor ah but thats what im talking about joey naylor but you didnt prove that vanilla was the best nick naylor i didnt have to i proved that youre wrong and if youre wrong im right joey naylor but you still didnt convince me nick naylor its that im not after you im after them points into the crowd,black_comedy
the movie paints a good picture of what the smoking industry and antismoking activists are probably like and doesnt feed us bullshit when it comes right down to it its a persons own choice whether or not they want to smoke and while the smoking industry may use shady marketing tactics every industry out there uses propaganda to get people to buy their product theres two sides to every argument and regardless of how you feel about tobacco its going to be somebodys job to defend it and somebodys job to cut it downintelligent witty hilarious andis that even a hint of sarcasm i sense great film just go see it already,black_comedy
although it is a 2005 movie i just watched last night it is the snappiest film ive seen for ages jason reitman may be a young filmmaker but he really nailed just about every aspect of this film i was pleasantly surprised by how much i cared for his charactersall the cast rob lowe aaron eckhart sk simmons cameron bright robert duvall are absolutely brilliant and it was a nice touch for a movie about smoking to not feature a single person smoking throughout clever at the end of the day this might be a serious subject but this is foremost an entertaining and fabulous filmwatch it now,black_comedy
this is just an excellent movie and its exactly my kind of humor too the script is so well constructed that it gives me fits and the movie never falls into the typical modern american comedy pitfalls of idiotic slapstick and random moments seriously ive never seen a movie so dependent on dialogue alone that works as well as this does it not only works it damn well shines the script alone carries further than one would expect and if that isnt enough the clever use of irony how nobody in the entire movie is actually seen smoking and more similar gems accentuates it furtheris not a conventional comedy but dont let that deter you  this is just a brilliant movie with multiple dimensions charming devilish wit and characters that youll remember long after the credits start to roll mandatory,black_comedy
its a wellcrafted film with an intelligent script filled with interesting characters but i didnt laugh once while watching the dvd wmds guantanamo the patriot act and stay the course promoters used all of the techniques and arguments found in this film to create the bubbling flaming exploding cauldron that is iraq i have a similar problem with wag the dog but hey its a dangerous world out here and its better to think for yourselfisnt it time has caught up with this film so im viewing the great dictator or pbs the war theres a reason that the greatest generation is admired they didnt spin anything faced with an economy that tanked or world war they didnt hesitate to step up and be counted even if it led to real estate only sufficient for a grave and headstone its a shame that theyre leaving this life just when their counsel is most needed,black_comedy

something to do while the movie studies his incorrigible character his relationship as a divorced parent to his young son carries more thematic weight yet the movies ultimate purpose is deeper than

and their unholy stringpulling in congress but also against the current legal system the entertainment industry and any forum where the slickest lie will triumph over a mundane truthis a biting rejoinder to the mentallyvapid acceptance of all things politically correct it reminds us to educate ourselves in the face of staggering obstacles and it illustrates that the obstacles to truth are sometimes the very people exhorting you to seek itif the movie is in fact sending a message about choice isnt it intriguing that no one is actually seen smoking in the movie even the mighty john wayne

anybody can watch this film with anybody else this is a great film because nick naylor is so responsive he is very clever and has an legitimate answer to everything its one of the best forms of intelligence and it comes natural to him what is funny is the way he is able to turn any negative feeling back at whoever is directing it at him this kind of genius is very rare and it is wonderful to watchit is funny because he is outrageous but plausible at the same time i will watch it again and actually learn how to do it more easily like him communication is essential in life persuasion makes life easier persuasion is such a complicated process few actually become very good at it however these people make livings from it they are sales and marketing people and likewiseremember persuasion makes life easier so people learn from this very funny and brilliant film,black_comedy
i was attracted to the movie because of its title  its not politically correct  wheres the not and the trailer looked like it was a whole lot of fun as well with a tobacco evangelist spreading the good news about smoking and cigarettes coincidentally this movie also turned out to be this weeks gv surprise screening selectioni like movies with ensemble cast too and this one consisted of aaron eckhart maria bello sam elliot rob lowe william h macy jk simmons robert duvall katie holmes and cameron bright not the usual big names but a stellar cast nonetheless some of whom you wouldve come across in other big budgeted movies like jk simmons  the james jonah jameson in sam raimis spidey or cameron bright  the most overunder utilized kid from ultraviolet and x3the opening credits played to the song smoke smoke smoke that cigarette consisting of colourful cigarette boxes already got me hooked and the protagonist of nick naylor eckhart the tobacco industry lobbyist is one heck of an interesting character and holds one heck of a dream job hes not a lawyer but can sure talk like one and has the same uncanny ability to turn black into white with his wit and persuasion there are plenty of witty lines and dialogue in this movie played out with some cheese and infused with comedy at the right moments my favourite moments are those in which nick teaches his son joey bright how to win arguments which hes the best at the business at about the flawed but soundssosexily correct logic which is employed to break down the arguments of anotherhe has few friends since antismoking lobbyists are a dime a dozen and counts amongst his circle of trust the mod squad consisting of fellow spin doctors from the alcohol and firearms industry maria bello and david koechner respectively their chill out get together dinner sessions are a hoot to watch as they go about sharing ideas spinning techniques and rant about their collective enemiesif theres a lesson to take away from this picture its not to sleep and tell especially if the reporter has glorious tits in the mould of katie holmes bent on exposing the slickest in the business you thought that nick would be beaten down with a scandal but as they say its always tough to keep a good man down besides the romantic entanglement theres a little sub plot about office politics like having a leaning mountain in the form of your bosss boss and the trouble that will inevitably knock on your door when hes no longer around compelling stuffin a movie which seemed to be protobacco youd be surprised that none of the characters actually light up on screen the closest we got to was from a movie sands of iwo jima shown on television but he got shot when he was distributing ciggies to his mates hows that for irony and i have no idea why the local rating is m18 for sexual references sure there was sex but you cant see a thing and it got truncated badly anyway why cant the censors get straight to the point that its m18  procigarette movie which would align with local laws that cigarettes cannot be sold to those under 18 years of age one wondersthen again as addressed in the movie i liked the part where there was a commotion over the effectiveness of having horrible pictures of death printed on the cigarette boxes you must watch and see if you agree with the arguments presented but the bottom line is its all about choice everyone unless youre extremely ignorant should already be aware of the dangers if you want to go ahead if not thats fine toonow wheres my cigarette should i too stick an m18 warning or attach some grotesque pictures p,black_comedy
is an excellent film i was thoroughly impressed at the quality of the film and the excellent screenplay it was a hysterical look at the debate over tobacco and how crazy people can be i couldnt help but feel sorry for the main character nick naylor who is faced with death threats and constant attacks from antismoking nazis his efforts to downplay the harmful effects of smoking are funny as he twists the facts to fit his message all while trying to raise his son successfully his main struggle in the film is with the typical democrat senator who is trying to put oversized death stickers on cigarette packages naylor is going to testify in front of the senate on behalf of the tobacco company the story follows the events leading up to the hearing including an affair with a reporter who is doing a story about him the main message of the film i think is that there are crazy people on both sides of the issue of smoking and it also shows that the tobacco companies are not satanic organizations bent on killing people as many would have us believe it is mostly the story of a man trying to be successful and raise his son like most other people only he is mostly hated by everyone around him it is one of the best movies of the year it is certain to win some awards in the near future,black_comedy
nick naylor a lobbyist on behalf of tobacco industries is a smart goodlooking fast talking sob naylor travels to different locations for these tobacco industries as their spokesman on this trip he takes his son and tries to be a role model while keeping his image good in the public eyeis there any kind of plot behind on the surface not really smoking is a film that is more character driven its in the comedic style of a david o russell film or maybe even a wes anderson film smoking is a quirky in your face dark odd comedy that actually works too often we see films that are too dark and not comedic enough with its material duplex and ice harvest to name some here reitman takes a controversial topic and puts a comedic spin on it the film doesnt take one side or the other but in the end tells you to make your mind up for yourselfit may take a pretty sick and twisted individual to laugh at some scenes such as cancer boy or the topics that the mod have at their dinner table ladies and gentlmen i am a sick and twisted individual and i enjoyed this film it made light of a heavy topic and actually make you like the lead character who is the one killing peoplemore or less how can we like such a character well it does help when the character is an intelligent smooth talking good looking guy who gets to bang katie holmes the other reason is that the character is played extremely well by aaron eckhart hands down his best role to date and hopefully one where he will be able to get more recognition bottom linbe nick naylor make me want to smoke because he is so convincing at what he does as its the only thing hes good atsmoking speaks the truth in a sick and twisted funny way the main character gets kidnapped and gets a couple dozen smoking patches slapped onto his body then left to rot in the lincoln memorial lap we then find out that it was smoking that saved his life naylors response can i quote you on that this is what the whole movie is like smart a witty dialogue with cool and funny characters some of the best scenes are between eckhart and lowe who play very well off each other in a scene where they try to promote smoking in the films the need a role model to show that smoking is cool someone like indiana jones meets jerry maguire on two packs a day the only downfall of the film is naylors son who is a kid that you may end up hating just because of the kid being the way he is its the same kid from birth and godsend there is just something about his acting that annoys me it could be his emotionless facebut then again im not a big fan of many child actors the supporting cast includes maria bello jk simmons william h macy robert duvall rob lowe sam elliot and katie holmes all holmes does in the movie is have sex with naylor then write an articlenot much more so if youre a lover or hater of the one half of tomkat she has no impact on the film her screen time maxes out at about ten minutesis a film that is definitely not for everyone its not laugh out loud funny its comedic style is a little bit more intelligent using its comedy in its dialogue and its subject matter the film doesnt say smoking is good for you or that its bad it expects you to know the answer already is an early contender for a top ten list and is an underdog in every sense of the word it wont get much recognition from the public or probably even the critics but as it stands this film issmokin,black_comedy
if you like your laughs to come at the expense of smart and clever writing then you obviously like johnny betts work but theres also a betterthanaverage chance youll enjoy thank you for smokingi know what youre thinking hey is this one of those propaganda pieces that does nothing but preach against the evils of tobacco no actually it isnt sure it has some fun at the expense of eckharts tobacco lobbyist character but reporters hollywood and hypocritical politicians with their own agendas all get a little lampooning as well its a film that never really narrows its target on one group and why should it when it can have more fun lambasting all sides what makes the movie really work is the running storyline of how william h macy wants to put a big picture of a skull and crossbones on cigarette boxes he brings in a doctor to testify that people have an 80 greater response rate to imagery than they do text i like how statistics such as this are cleverly employed in a way that educates and entertains at the same time never making us feel like were sitting in a boring college lecturea member from the hispanic community also complains that many mexicans cant read english therefore pictures are needed to warn them of the dangers of smoking not satisfied with this level of irresponsibility hes already showing mr hispanic makes the bold and ridiculous claim that they want people who cant speak english to dieeckhart on the other hand wonders why we dont just slap a warning label on everything that can cause death how about michigan propose a skull and crossbones picture for their cars and how can macy senator from vermont that he is not take responsibility for the fact that his state is proud of their cheddar which also leads to high cholesterol which leads to heart disease which is yep you guessed it  the 1 killer in america this exchange leads to the great yet most likely unappreciated line the great state of vermont will not apologize for its cheese eckhart also takes it to macy on the dennis miller show how can he advocate slashing and burning tobacco farms one morning and then later that afternoon ride around on a tractor and bemoan the plight of the american farmer it doesnt take a johnny betts to realize this is a film interested in reminding us all to check just how brightly our halo is shining before we selfishly go about fulfilling our own agendas at the expense of criticizing othersaccording to eckhart were living in a world where 99 of everything that is done good or bad is done to pay the mortgage gives us the opportunity to watch this play out in a country being overrun with political correctness and the extreme lack of desire to take personal responsibility this is a sharp political satire that is written to appeal to adults a rarity these days and simply wants to state that education comes from teachers and parents not the side of a cigarette cartonthe gist is a rare brand of smart adult humor for those of you who want to laugh but know the benchwarmers and phat girlz wont come close to doing the trick if you like your comedy a little dark and wry then give this a look,black_comedy
one of the funniest satires i have seen in years reminiscent of the ones from the 1970s and early 80s think network serial 9 to 5 aaron eckhart does a tremendous job with turning on the charm and charisma with a character who would in true life be seen as heinous and manipulative his comic timing is impeccable the narration is brilliant and he brings so much passion and enthusiasm to nick naylor that it makes it impossible to dislike him the supporting cast including katie holmes in a surprisingly good performance as a femme fatale washington reporter maria bello as a cynical alcohol lobbyist and the incomparable sam elliott as an embittered former spokesperson for marlboro cigarettes brings a flavor to the movie that makes it the perfect recipe for black comedy the remaining ingredients besides the amazing leading man are a terrific script and great direction by jason reitmana true chip off the old block of dad ivan each actor brings an energy to the film that matches eckharts completely i hope this movie goes into widerelease because audiences everywhere deserve to view this gem,black_comedy
is a funfilled satire of spin doctors with the backdrop of an easy target the tobacco industrythe plot of the film revolves around nick naylor top spokesman for the academy of tobacco studies whose job is to convince america that cigarettes and smoking is acceptable throughout the film he undergoes moral dilemma an attack of conscience and a person who wants him dead for spreading the tobacco gospelthe film is deeper than the typical smoking debates though the real power of the film lies in the impartial critiques of both sides of the issue focusing on the differing amounts of spin each side presents to sway the american public to side with their cause this part of the film is very thoughtprovoking and is perhaps one of the two great strengths this film presents at the end of the film you might find yourself questioning both sidesthe other strength lies in the supporting cast katie holmes plays an excellent journalist hoping for a big bombshell story william macy plays an excellent foil to aaron eckharts naylor in senator finistirre a man who will stop at nothing and try everything to break the tobacco industry rob lowe however might have the best scenes in the movie as the quirky talent agent to the starsthe script is filled with many moments of dark humor which might not rub everyone the right way but its placement fits with the critique of the spin doctors so while not always funny its at least understandableadditionally the film is short so at times the dialogue feels rushed some of the humor and plot points are tough to follow overall though the film flows wellis certainly worth a view or two its thoughtprovoking funny and wellacted has some excellent acting throughout the film,black_comedy
the sound bytes that i heard on nprs coverage of were the best moments in the movie it shouldnt come as a surprise that the best things in a movie about spin should be watching the process of spin in action and spin is all about sound bytes aaron eckhart is wonderful as the cigarette spin doctor and he is supported by an ateam of character actors including william h macy as a vermont senator robert duvall as the captain of big tobacco sam elliott as a marlboro man diagnosed with cancer and jk simmons as eckharts boss rob lowe steals the show as a hollywood product placement mogul only too eager to find a place for cigarettes somewhere in the future the films strength the joyful fun it has with a very deadly issue is also the key to its weakness the targets are easy and the plot turns contrived katie holmes is weak as a femme fatale reporter but so is her contrived story line the movie is definitely worth seeing for its brilliant flashes of comedy but it leaves you with a craving for more,black_comedy
were not supposed to like nick naylor the spokesman for big tobacco hes not supposed to have sexual relations with an absurdly cute newspaper reporter but we do and he doesadapted from christopher buckleys novel gives us the resulting slowmoving train wreck and gives us a primer on how to get lots more people smoking or drinking shooting drillingthroughout the film and especially during the train wreck there are cringe moments sometimes its brutal honesty we sell cigarettes theyre addictive the job is almost done for us theres the profanity which isnt strong by movie standards but sounds startlingly profane for some reason sometimes its the shaketheheadandlook down cringe when were glad were not in their shoesthe film is funny and smart and doesnt take a clear stand on the issue of smoking the issue in the film is spin and nick makes clear to his 12yearold son that a quick tongue means never having to say youre wrongthe tone of the film swings between plausible and parody and occasionally strays too far on the parody side the assistant to the hollywood superagent is overcaffeinated a terrorist plot is almost entirely removed from the original novel but it still lurks the reporter in backtoback scenes delivers one of the films best lines followed by the films worst slapstick momentall in all an entertaining and smart flick parent  kid safe minus some swear words will watch it again to catch all the hidden jokes background signs acronyms etc by the way rob lowe cameos as the hollywood super and i mean super agent warning may contain humor,black_comedy
i watched you me and dupree before this movie and as bad as that movie was this one was worse the defense for cigarettes he uses at the end of the movie is the one he should have been spouting in the beginning the whole movie is hard to swallow i cant believe it is so highly rated on imdb this movie is just another hollywood attempt to make regular joe feel bad about the way he lives anyone who rated this movie a six or higher should not be allowed to vote on this website anymore if this is what people think satire is then that explains the junk movies hollywood has been turning out for the last five years movies like this are the reason that tickets arent being sold i am glad i only rented it now i can tell the guy working at the video store that it was scratched and get my money back,black_comedy
i definitely enjoyed this movie  however the opening titles already put me in a worry i enjoyed it almost to the end when it downed on me that it was a nasty setup in which they didnt even give a chance to antismoking thoughts i have to add two things i really love jim jarmuschs coffe and cigarettes  even the new one  also i used to be a smoker  for over 10 years  and im not gonna light 1 cigarette again  no never  i used to enjoy it  but i found out that its a severe drug  totally addictive  and its very hard to quit  so thats for my aspect i am a journalist and as such creature i think its very important to take sides in smokings matter  i mean you should never send out any message that tells young or older people that cigarette smoking is good for them  its tobacco companies interest that young people think its cool to be smoking  to be a smoker  we smokers and ex smokers are supposed to have a different interest however  we should always take a chance to mention  like for the record  that cigarette smoking is very bad for you  for anyone  for humans in general  yes it is enjoyable  the first draft every day  but it takes a really huge price  health in general  anyways im saying that we are responsible for those who are exposed to the idea that maybe they should start smoking too  for them we definitely have to send the message like please dont do that my problem with this movie is that its a onesided propaganda  wrapped up as a comedy  remember  nick taylor never once says that smoking is actually bad  he testifies as if his son wants to smoke hell buy him his first pack  okay we all know that its for marketing  its supposed to stir emotions like michael mooores flicks  to sell at the box office  but in this movie they go further  they systematically take side for smoking in opposition to notsmoking  and this hurts i mean can you imagine how much itd cost for tobacco companies to air this message  the cant even buy this  they are out from tv and cinemas too  also forma 1 is getting regulated  so can you imagine how much advertising value this movie has for tobacco companies  i think i can  it is huge  and this movie doest even pretend to give a chance for kids who are potential clients for tobacco industry  nick tylor testifies like positive  alright  but hed still have a chance to give some explanation to his son in the next scene  but he doest say a word  he has no comment on that  he doest add that he hopes that his son wouldt smoke  or that his son should know that smoking is veryvery addictive  and cancer is not all that it gives you  he misses to tell him something like son you dont need this thing  so in the end this whole movie is a big argument  that amuses people  and tells them that smoking is dangerous  just like anything else  like cellphones  and thats it in my point of view if i smoke or you smoke  thats a thing  but if i send a message to clean people that smoking is cool  thats a very nasty thing  of course it wouldnt be so  if cigarette smoking wasnt that addictive  but it is veryvery addictive  so i think however funny the whole flick is  the conclusion makes it very offensive ,black_comedy
i have seen movies that brought tears to my eyes by being so blatantly dull never have i walked out of a movie though but this time i couldnt sit still at all i wanted to run away and scream in agony i couldnt stand any more of these dreadful performances these mindnumbing dialogs and the simple minded structure of this failure that they dare call a movie how could anyone ever give this movie a good rating for christs sake people aaron eckhart seems like a snotty brat in an adult suit apparently the failure lies with jason reitmans it appears as though he chose only the worst takes to end up in the movie the allover impression i got was that they tried hard to make a lukewarm film about the tobacco industry for an audience of breastfed kids you could force a man to drink alcohol to a point at which hes merely able to breathe by himself shoot his brains out and he would still grasp that endlessly blunt plot with an ease they smash this flat story right in our face  nothing to think about its all there just that it is of a quality similar to a bad joke and then its over and you feel sick like you know youve been eating too much of that junk food againi wanted to spit right into jason reitmans face when i went out of the cinema he should have flushed this mistake down the toilet instead of releasing it honestly i cant think of a movie worse to this one thats because all those worst movie ever candidates were so bad they reached a point at which they were good because of their missing quality  in the end they were amusing but this film reaches the peak of bad taste and has the brass to sustain that level to  the  endid buy the dvd  only to smash it into smithereens for my personal satisfaction,black_comedy
i just dont see what people liked about this movie all i saw was a megasleazy man turning his son into yet another one  seemingly with the mothers cooperation i dont get it he ends up defending other similar issues and makes more new friends in the end the twist of having the token allknowingbrat following him around and being ohsoproudofdaddy was just repulsiveif this was supposed to be about freedom of choice or freedom of speech it missed the mark they should come out with a sequil featuring some moralityfree jackass arguing for nambla or nazis in america or something along those lines that would be great,black_comedy

nick naylor doesnt hide the truth he filters it god damn that is a catchy taglinetells the story of nick naylor a smoothtalking tobacco lobbyist naylor is a master of rhetoric twisting language to make sure the people of america are smoking his companys cigarettesnote mild spoilers followthe biggest flaw in this movie is the lack of development in its main character at the end of the movie naylor isnt changed he has undergone no apparent ethical awakening but hes okay for some reason he gets a promotion outside the tobacco industry and has a betterpaying less morally objectionable job in which he can use the same talents he had as a lobbyist this new job is the cherry on top of a character arc that makes no sense the promotion feels undeserved and it is an unneeded happy note to end a pretty dark filmthrough naylor the film tells two contradictory stories on one hand the movie expects you to feel sympathetic that naylor has such a terrible job on the other the movie argues that there is nothing wrong with naylors job at all and he is an artist of rhetoric who deserves to be proud of his workthroughout the movie naylor seems to apologize for his career achievements he bemoans his choice in profession saying that he didnt intend to be a lobbyist and he didnt study to be one it was in his words the only thing he was ever good at and thats why he took the job the viewer get the feeling that our tragic hero was fated into this situation throughout the film he also repeatedly says that he only keeps his job so that he can pay his mortgage almost implying that hed leave it behind if he couldat the same time the film argues that its heros great tragedy isnt very bad at all he often seems proud of his work and there are a number of scenes that show naylor teaching his son the tricks of rhetoric he uses in these scenes we get the sense that naylor is clever and his job is something to be admired naylor appears to actively recruit his son to become a lobbyist even though the movie spends so much time arguing lobbying is badin the climactic scene of the movie during a court hearing we expect naylor to tell the truth and throw the tobacco companies under the bus if he does this his arc is complete even if this arc was a bit uneven throughout the movie a sudden epiphany can save his character but he doesnt have an epiphany he sings the party line and walks out of the courtroom as protobacco as ever this is frustrating and confusing for the viewerin the end the viewer feels lost what point was the movie trying to make the movie was funny enough and had solid acting et cetera but the story had no payoff and made no point i cant recommend this movie because of its central flaw others may enjoy the ride but i couldnt get over the vapid conclusion,black_comedy
lobbyists represent everything that is wrong with our country instead of voting for the common good of the people they are paid in voters and campaign contributions to vote the way big business wishes them to vote the result is laws that benefit the few and hurt the many takes an in depth look at one of these lobbyists who works for big tobacco in a satirical way the film shows how this man is able to achieve his companies goals through bending the facts bribery and out right lying in a way that is completely legal under our system of government aaron eckhart is terrific which will come as little surprise to many however the film was anything but like most films has its moments but overall the film is one short scene that just repeats its self over and over again the situations are different and the players are different but the arguments and agendas are always the same after watching two hours of the same thing over and over again i was more than done with this film no matter how charismatic the actor may be the fact is that what lobbyists do isnt terribly interesting its one meeting and argument after another and the film just completely runs around in circles the film was critically acclaimed for eckharts performance but nothing else some critics think that one outstanding performance makes a film worth seeing but i dont aaron eckhart is an outstanding actor who has been great in many other films that are worth seeing is nothing more than an insult to the american people that runs forty minutes too long and just goes around in circles its not something id recommend wasting your time on,black_comedy
follows nick naylor aaron eckhart through his eventful career as big tobaccos chief spokesman and lobbyist the plot is essentially about how he distorts and manipulates the real truth about cigarettes while all the time remaining a role model for his 12 year old son nick naylor essentially has no real friends except two other likeminded spin doctors david koechner and maria bello who are in the same business of fact distortion and public misinformation through their meetings we get an idea of the turmoil and moral quandaries the trio encounter and there ability to deal with the conflict is all too amusing and entertaining his nemeses senator ortolan k finistirre willaim h macy is head of the anti smoking lobby and his futile attempts to smear nick nailers spindoctor routine is what fuels most of the best exchanges this is perfect material for a good satire and its laid on think and fast with double entente metaphor and a heavy dose of irony thrown in for good measure for the most part it works the script has enough wit and original ideas to keep your interestin one particular scene he tries to explain to his son in simple terms what exactly he does for a living by using the analogy of the ice cream his son is enjoying during his day trip he asks his son to prove why his flavor of ice cream is more enjoyable than his dads his answer finally appeases the viewers curiosity after almost an hour into the story giving us a glimpse of the reasons behind his actions in a very entertaining fashion while at the same time giving his son a valuable moral lesson on right and wrong the cast is impressive with eckhart playing the nice guy protagonist with ease willaim h macy has a couple of good one liners but jeff megallis rob lowe a hollywood big wig  is a scene stealer katie holmes is just ok as the reporter and cameron bright as the son seemed at odds with some of the more well written lines his dialog seemed inappropriate but didnt correlate to the mind set of a 13 year old boy there a few noteworthy scenes after this with the kidnapping scene involving an anti smoking group one to admire however the court room scenario at the end didnt work for me and lacked the humor and wit that carried earlier exchanges i hoped the ending would provide some catchy tieup or amusing anecdote to transcend what was conveyed earlier on but the final scenes seemed hackneyed and failed to continue the good momentum it built up earlier on an entertaining satire let down by an average ending,black_comedy
i loved this what a fantastic funny and superbly acted satire on the concepts of truth and social responsibility its strength lies in its staunch refusal to take sides or lapse into some personal agenda while still managing to deliver a very strong message about the nature of truth and the way it can be abused by anybody there are no cut and dry human heroes or villains in this piece with the exception of william h macys character perhaps  the hero is freedom of choice and the ability to pick through the infinite layers of bullsht and information which saturate us every day it shows how people themselves become nothing but symbols for greater agendas and that the the only real truth is the one which we choose for ourselves absolutely brilliant stuff everyone gotta pay a mortgage,black_comedy
this was the classic satire film now i felt that the film was inspired by dr strangelove i know i know the two were not that similar but there was something about the humor that made me feel that this film was sending a silent homage there is only one real problem that i had with the film and its a problem that ive seen a lot lately katie holmes is not drop dead gorgeous shes not even hot by high school standards ok shes not grotesque but when a script reads for a drop dead gorgeous reporter thats what we need no not to ogle them but to make the movie believable holmes appears to be eckarts daughter not the reporter that makes him spoiler spill his secrets and ruin his careerend spoiler this was simply not believable and this is a problem is some of todays movies its a problem the same way you wouldnt cast a supermodel as a homeless beggar and no its not just about my taste in women i could care less if there are any bombshells in a movieunless the bombshell being a bombshell is relevant to the plot for the record my 2nd most distracting model being ugly is kirsten dunst as mary jane watson for crying out loud shes a supermodel in the comic not kirsten dunst sure while some men might possibly find her attractive she is not by conventional standards like holmes a bombshell now let me get back to the movie which was phenomenal my favorite was the gentleman who played the firearms guy and rob lowe as a hollywood superagent arron eckart was great and very believable and the movie is hilarious and important from start to finish now about katie holmes,black_comedy
oh this was great nothing imparticular prompted my hubby and i to see this just a free night away from the kids we were so surprised by the very clever lines and the quirky charactersrob lowe who as an actor i deeply admire was brilliantly over the top his assistant was instantly irritating and robert duvall wonderfully cringe worthy as the kindofnasty but focused boss the main characters were perfect and this funny unpredictable story was well written brilliantly acted and really wonderful to watch even katie holmes who is no personal favorite of minewas very funny unpleasant and well suited to the role of nympho journo if you want a laugh and a movie that moves along at a cracking pace this is the one for you enjoy,black_comedy
it was sometimes funny sometimes scary and sometimes it made me angry however it was never boring its the story of nick naylor the vice president of the tobacco research institute this is a cigarettecompany funded place to reinforce the idea that theres no direct link between smoking and health problems in other words its filled with doubletalk and loads of lies but it is an insiders look at how washington works the mod scenes were entertaining nick is an expert at double talk and has very little to redeem him in the beginning gradually one discovers hes not as evil as he seemed to be at first i recommend you see this film if you havent its one of the best ive seen in a long time,black_comedy
is the movie adaptation based on christopher buckleys clever satire on the tobacco industry the main character nick naylor plyed by aaron eckhart is a tobacco lobbyist and spin doctor extraordinaire he knows people hate him for representing a product known to kill thousands but he has the good looks and charm to win people over the movie is just as clever as the book and filled with memorable characters rob lowe as hollywood superagent jeff megall robert duvall as tobacco baron the captain and william h macy as senator finistirre the politico on an anticigarette crusade the story makes you laugh but also opens your eyes to the tobacco industry showing you how they work to attract new smokers you might even find yourself sympathizing with characters you ordinarily wouldnt like that just proves the power of spin doctoring,black_comedy
finally a worthy comedy of 2006 pretty much every comedy that came up this year was pure crap then comes along the new indie comedy with a stellar ensemble cast surrounding the upsides of the tobacco industry its pure satire and its pure comic gold isnt a great movie however its very good and the best comedy of 2006 thus faraaron eckhart plays a man many people refer to as the devil in the flesh  a tobacco lobbyist his job consists of lying and persuading the general public to use a substance that when used as intended kills eckhart is flawless in his role as the smartass moneyhungry bullshitter having previously wowed critics some audiences and myself alike with his stunning and captivating performance as a misogynistic businessman in in the company of men eckhart revives some of that feeling in this character the rest of the cast is perfect in their roles including rob lowe as a cutthroat hollywood executive who only sleeps on sundays william h macy as the pansy governor of vermont maria bello and david koechner as the alcohol and firearms lobbyists who are eckharts best friends in the film adam brody as the despiseable kissass assistant and of course veteran film actor robert duvall as eckharts hardened boss  father figure who is practically in love with nicotinejason reitman provides a slick script with possibly too many funny oneliners and he does a soso job directing the story is enthralling during the first hour but loses some of its initial magic during the final halfhour is a swift kick in the nuts for hollywood providing foulmouthed morally corrupt entertainment as an alternative to the soft pg13 comedies hollywood seems to produce in droves i recommend if you are looking to laugh and wont take it seriously grade b  12 out of  screened at harkins camelview 5 scottsdale arizona,black_comedy

this review is coming from someone who has read the book previous to seeing the moviei found it disappointing that they left out some of the parts of the book that may have made the movie better i was also disappointed that they changed parts of itfirst no mention of the fbi investigation against him after the kidnapping he also blamed this on the senator it may have been nice to see him under stressanother thing was that he had not been fired previous to the hearing by the senator he was still employed in the book at that timethird off the ending at the end of the book he was on larry king promoting a book in the movie he starts his own consulting firm also more member to the mod merchants of death squad what was thati sorry i may have enjoyed the movie but i enjoyed the book a little more,black_comedy
is the funniest political satire since wag the dog amidst uproariously salty language some of the humor is broad a gunladen nratype going through security and some hits familiar targets a creatively profiteering hollywood agent it has unusual heart in aaron eckharts portrayal of tobacco lobbyist nick naylor his lobbyist is just a guy who does his job and does it well  within the bounds of democratic capitalism he provides equal time within the court of public opinion for a legal product rather than doing the politicians trick of not answering the question asked but what he wants asked his specialty is i talk his delivery adds a wry touch to the usually overused voiceover narrationwhat helps to create the personal touch and more than eckhart gets in how neil labute has used his rugged handsomeness is his continuing effort to connect with his estranged son a relationship according to an interview with the creative and production team on charlie rose that writerdirector jason reitman added and was not in christopher buckleys original novel which only had him referred to in a single line what would your son think for once cameron brights old head on young shoulders works in a nonspooky context as his dad brings him along on business trips for their bonding potentialwhile william h macys senator seems a bit too easily flummoxed in a debate for an experienced politician even one from vermont maria bello shines as the alcoholic member of the very funny merchants of death who exchange tips on making tobacco liquor and firearms more palatable and who at the end are joined by an amusing array of coconspirators jk simmons does a more harddriving take on his spiderman boss robert duvalls last of a dying breed of entrepreneurial captains of industry is more than a little stereotyped katie holmes plays the sweet card well enough as an ambitious reporter the more pumping than revealing sex scene that was accidentally left out at sundance is more about the dialog than the visual just when you think sam elliotts on target portrayal of a former marlboro mantype cowboy is touching and meaningful so cant be satirized this film finds a way to throw in a zingerreal video footage of the infamous tobacco companies congressional testimony is threaded through for an amusing reality check and faux news and tv shows are recreated very realistically though the trailer does give away some of the best jokes the humor is consistent through to the end though some of the celebrity references may date the script with the hero getting more cynical not less to the kingston trio singing greenback dollar without giving any spoilers rest assured that it is delightful that unlike so many movies about such characters he does not end up on a slacker beach or doing humanitarian volunteer workeven more pop song references to cigarettes could have been selected but the opening use of the full hearing of tex williamss smoke smoke smoke that cigarette is fun the credits solemnly point out that even though there is a clip of john wayne smoking in a movie his familys foundation is against smoking and the health issues around smoking are ironically made personal to the hero the sold out audience i was with at the opening weekend matine at a theater playing it every hour had great fun laughing out loudwhile naylor references the usual example of morally flexible appearing professions in lawyers who defend serial killers ive seen his identical type among fund raisers who as hired guns can convince donors to give money for any cause or nonprofit organization at a fundraisers conference i saw a confrontation quite similar to one in the film where a health organization chastised a museum for accepting tobacco money and was coolly responded to that the donor fit depends on the organizations mission let alone my brotherinlaw the risk communicationist advising corporations around the world both my sons were presidents of their high school debate teams so im used to living with talkers who at the flip of a coin can switch affirmative or negative on any issue i just never realized they were in training to be lobbyists,black_comedy
im kicking myself for not appreciating my high school and college lit courses until it was too late because it seems like every time i go to the movies i remember back to one of the classics in literature that i callously never read it was jonathan swifts a modest proposal i thought back on after finishing because i now realize that modern satire is jokenick naylor aaron eckhardt in the company of men is as smooth as the cigarettes hes promoting as the main lobbyist for big tobacco its his job to look america in the eye and say want to smoke the film follows him as he convinces group after group that big tobacco is the victim and that those who are fighting against him are the villains there are bumps along the way including a senator from vermont william h macy a nosy journalist katie holmes and a few attempts on his life but with some good old american bs he may just make itis an almost biting satire it presents all the characters a great satire needs and its full of button pushing ideas that should drag the audience right along with it but squanders them by playing too safe by not taking sides and by coping out at the last moment great satire should end with half the characters dead lying in a physical psychological or farcical bloodbath like in swifts a modest proposal where he mentions that his countrymen would do well to resort to cannibalism the hero of the story should be standing next to god or burning in hell for his misdeeds just winks at you provides a couple of laughs and thats allthe major problem is that the screenplay by jason reitman who also directs falls in love with the main character to a degree that allows him the opportunity to get away with everything thats would be fine but the villains in the film are not drawn as well and so his victorys seem paltry his villains are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound satire without some blood and guts on the floor is pointlessas for the performances they just sit there no one is big enough that actors wander in and out of each scene and the only one we really get to know is nick but nick is not that vulnerable even when the script tries to paint him that way aaron eckhardt is too confident i didnt believe his small moment of insecurity once because the script doesnt let him fail for longis not a bad movie its pretty funny and its quite timely but as a satire its not focused enough and it doesnt pull enough punches im glad i saw it but i dont recommend it,black_comedy
this year 2008 about 565650 americans are expected to die of cancer more than 1500 people a day cancer is the second most common cause of death in the us exceeded only by heart disease in the us cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths 1 in 3 people will develop cancer during their lives american cancer societythis film is a piece of crap its simple the subject matter is not available for comedy americans would like to think that everything is open to a big joke but its not the statistics prove this there are just some subjects that are off limits this is one of them movies like this will keep being made for the simple reason that 1 hollywood is a greedy capitalist juggernaut by its nature 2 lack of good judgment from very good actors to participate in projects like this thus ennobling them with high production values and 3 did i mention the cyclopean monolith who lumbers blindly ahead without discernment on its wayward bacchanal to resounding applause without decency laughing growling celebrating the energy of sex and money at the expense of everyone else interesting that many of the one star reviews start off with didnt make me laugh cancer,black_comedy
what a great idea and what a great chance to play interesting philosophical points against themselves and others  but theres so much out of kilter here that sloppiness prevents the very point that would seem to account for such high ratings winstonsalem ive lived in nc all of my life no to everything wrong license tag wrong drink  julep go to kentucky i love duval but the accent was laughable the california types were too strongly stereotypical the david spade type character would be great on snl but spoiled the illusion here there are some very funny places though the mod squad idea was done to death this movie should be remade with a different script incorporating the real lives of tobacco farmers and real marlboro men who dont storm out of a house wielding guns and believable tobacco executives the points would be stronger the depth of the drama and the comedy would be stronger and the issues would be more believable the best comedy is made from real live and not a superficial gloss of popular stereotypes i hope for a remake,black_comedy
major spoilers aheadid read and quite enjoyed the book the commercials looked good the casting was great it seemed theyd captured the feeling of the book i was really looking forward to seeingof the people i viewed the film with both the people who had read the book and the people who hadnt hated this filmi was fine with most of the deviations from the book i know they have to cut stuff and rearrange things some minor things that bothered me i wish they had kept in the part about br having kidnapped him and i thought it was more effective for him to discover he didnt want any more cigarettes rather than have the doctor order him to stop smokinghowever the complete aboutface of the ending ruined the entire filmi felt the point of the book was to show him reconsidering why he does this for a living and turn his talent for spin to good however the movie has him continue on in successfully spinning liespropaganda for evil why on earth would you make this film and not show the growth of the character that the book does i thought this was the very point of adding the kid subplot and the only reason i tolerated it it effectively showed the kid becoming manipulative like him and i thought when he turned to his son in the court and thought about what he was doing to him and teaching him he would have an epiphany and changewhat was the point of changing it was this considered a more realistic ending well id rather have him redeemed and likable  as in the original storyespecially given our current climate of constant lies and spin from corporations the government and the media it would have been nice to see that manipulation examined and shown to be wrong not glorified with a triumphant end for the spinmeistersthe ending of the book was not to make this an issue about free choice or a message about parenting was this supposed to be ironic that he talks about responsible parenting while clearly turning his kid into a manipulative clone of himself the point i got was to think about what you are doing and the impact you have on others around youi have not seen a worse movie adaptation in a long time i am very angry at the jerks that decided to pervert the entire point of the bookavoid the film read the book its twisted but funny the satire is there but also a message510 because i loved the acting except katie the satire and for the rest of the film up to the false ending the ending deserves a 1,black_comedy
im still amazed for the accolades this piece of obviousness receives from moviegoers and critics completely lacking in any subtlety or wit and whats worse wasting a decent cast should be viewed only if decent satirical films like smile and election have already been rented particularly painful to view are the scenes where the lead character joins another couple of lobbyists maria bello and david koechner at a bar to drunkenly crack witty asides at each others business for some reason the audience i saw the film with were laughing quite loudly at their banter while all i could do was groan midway through the movie knowing very well where it was going and not having laughed once i almost got up and left the theaterunfortunately like i saidalmost,black_comedy
they are not majorthank your for smoking is chiefly about lobbies nick nalyors aaron ekchart efforts to try and stop a prosposed bill that senator ortolan k finistirre william h macey is trying to get through congress that all cigarette packets have the world poison printed on them to be accompanied by a giant skull and crossbonesthis is a very good satire that gives pokes fun at both sides equally but it seems to give the antitobacco groups a rougher ride by prorating them as some what bumbling and inept the main point that the film is making is that every person has a choice wheatear or not they make the decsion to buy a pack of marlborough and light up which makes it a refreshing that portrays the reality of smokingthis is a very good movie with some extremely funny one liners in this movie one of my favorites scenes is comes when naylor is on a news programme and receives a death threat form anonymous caller when he hangs up the phone the presenter whose name escapes me says now well take a break to fire the call screenerthis movie is a very entertaining 90 or so minutes and makes for an enjoyable watch but its unlikely to make you want to see it more than a couple of times its also nice to see a movie that knows it will only last 90 or so minutes and doesnt try and tack an unnecessary extra half hour something which is too often done in movies,black_comedy
the main character nick naylor aaron eckhart put on a wonderful performance however the movie had some questionable turns and boring moments where nothing was being donei suggest renting it when you really have no other movie to rent watch it with a friend and when the aaron goes see the marlboro man just turn down the volume and chat it up with the friend because its one of the most silly things ive ever seen in a plot its like they threw it in there to take up timesee the movie if you want to see aaron eckhart lay down some facts and tell his son and other kids that they need not to be sheep simply stated,black_comedy
with such a wide and talented cast aside from holmes one would expect something decent this movie is far from decent it isnt abominably bad but it fails to do what it aims make people laugh and possibly comment on americas mores it is a fundamentally unfunny film i laughed a few times but these moments were few and far between in some ways it is worse than movies that are truly awful for theyre funnier in the way theyre lousy this one was just fruitlessberardinelli said it best when he said hovers around mediocrity and its lasting impression is like a puff of smoke that is dissipated by a strong gust of wind,black_comedy
spoilers i can honestly say i was a bit disappointed by this movie though i appreciated the depth of the subject matter perhaps i was expecting to much i did kind of expect a masterpiece because of all the hype and incredible reviews but to me was just ok not bad but not great either aeron eckert was incredible thoughthere were a few things i didnt care for the movie starts really slow and doesnt pick up steam for a long time its also kind of narrated by nick the eckert character and though sometimes i appreciate narration in a movie here i found it distracting i didnt see where it added all that much to the moviethere were also a lot of characters that were interesting but who were not in it much maria bello was good but was very underused and incidentally i am not all that much of a katie holmes fan but she was excellent in this as the reporter the best ive ever seen her and added a lot but her part was small too there were certain scenes that seemed to talky and to long and other scenes that werent long enough there were a lot of characters who had the potential to be really interesting but were not given enough time on screen the movies somewhat of a downer too and it seems like the movie as a whole should be a lot more interesting then it is overall i was let down at the endi guess id moderately recommend it anyway because of the acting the plot and the unusual aspect to the picture as a whole i struggled with a rating for the movie as 7 is kind of a high rating for a movie i didnt really like all that much but that had its moments i guess its worth seeing but its nowhere near as amazing as many critics made it out to be id say a 7 out of 10,black_comedy
for a compelling examination of how washington works from a tobacco lobbyists perspective rent the insiderthis is a stupid movieaaron eckhart portrays nick naylor a lobbyist sometimes wrestling somewhat with the morality of what he does for a living but more often having adventures like paying off the marlboro man having a risky sexual relationship with a journalist every bit as ambitious as he is and wooing hollywood to feature smoking in as favorable a light as possible eckharts performance is not godawful but somehow it was delivered as if from on high the sudden stops in filming with the freezeframes and then the voiceoversa hackneyed technique that doesnt seem to work too well in a film depicting washingtonthe film is overproduced and not nearly clever enough wrong assumptions about washington and spin wrong facts and shaky science in a film about lobbying for tobacco are fatalyou know the film is not really authentic when it does not even show one person smokingthe title is the tip off that the film suffers from an identity crisis,black_comedy
this is a truly tiresome ordeal this is a story about people we could care less about than zero and the director writer team plows through this with no justification for making anyone watch this tripe there is nothing learned this is pure and simple just a bash in your face long cigarette ad it makes smokers look like heroes and spends every second trying to put down non smokers thats all the film does it couldve made some points but failed to do so and the characters are total bores the cigarette pushing isnt even subtle we are given a caricature of anti smoking groups who act more like the smokers in real life this is simply a poor film made to make cigarette smokers even more self righteous than they are want to give smokers equal rights than either do away with smoke breaks or allow non smoke breaks at work allow something besides cigarettes to be given to people who are incarcerated or working for you lighting up cigarettes is the only time a psycho can get away with setting fire to something in front of you that is intended solely to emit poisonous fumes i dont know of any other time that is legal pathetic movie meant only for the most self righteous smokers,black_comedy
i wasnt really sure what to think of this movie during the first actit was slow at the beginning and it was difficult to root for aaron eckharts character but when his son came into the story expertly played by cameron bright the film took off the ensemble cast is very strong headed by a great performance by rob lowe not to mention brodys hilarious take on hollywood assistants the pacing was good and no scenes dragged too longso if you dont like what youre watching i wasnt a fan of the sit downs with maria bello and the guy from anchorman wait a couple of seconds it was a good first feature by reitman and i look forward to seeing what he does nexthopefully a comedy,black_comedy
somewhere ivan reitman smiles reitman the elder of ghostbusters fame has certainly had his share of success and now his son jason comes flying out of the gate with a terrific first fulllength directorial effort in if you thought satire was dead have we ever got the movie for youfeaturing a simply brilliant lead performance from aaron eckhart as big tobacco lobbyist nick naylor is laughoutloud funny but what is truly refreshing in this will ferrelladam sandler world we live in is that this is a truly smart comedy the film is brimming with sharp wit filled with welldeveloped characters so nice to see a film which doesnt just throw some actors up on the screen and have them say and do incredibly stupid things in the hope it will get a laugh is much more subtle it doesnt try so hard to get the laughsand gets them anywaywhile eckharts nick naylor is the central figure we follow throughout there are several other winning performances william h macy is reliably brilliant as the rather odd senator ortolan finistirre enemy of big tobacco maria bello and david koechner play alcohol and firearms lobbyists respectively and their exchanges with nick naylor as they compare how many people their respective products are killing are priceless casting rob lowe in a cameo as a hollywood superagent was a stroke of genius as he creates a truly memorable character robert duvall sam elliott jk simmonsthe list of great actors giving wonderful performances goes on and on perhaps the only casting misstep is katie holmes who strains credulity as a serious investigative reporter but everything and everyone surrounding her is so good youll forgive the fact she sticks out like a bit of a sore thumbfunny throughout this film also can be serious even tender when it has to be meeting a former marlboro man now dying a rather ironic death reminds us of the very real dangers of the product the hero of our film spends the whole movie defending scenes between naylor and his son give the film some real heart and show another side to the man whose lifes work raises some serious moral and ethical issues to say the least there are a few lulls here and there but for the most part the film sustains a terrific comic energy all the way through and eckharts performance is absolutely brilliant and will make him a bigtime star if there is any justice in this world all in all a very satisfying film in every way,black_comedy
i saw last night in downtown ann arbor michigan at a private preview screening afterwards we were fortunate enough to have our questions about the film answered by jason reitman himself this movie is so much more than what it would appear on the surface the significance of small details cannot be overlooked the multiple layers within the plot will appeal to all viewers the cast is superb and it is clear from this work reitmans first major movie that he will continue to fascinate his audiences with unique approaches to untouchable subjects he does this with humor irony and a depth that surpasses his years kudos bravo best of luck to all involved in this work,black_comedy
the only good thing about this glum film is that there is no smoking done by the characters in it that is an automatic plus otherwise this picture is ridiculous as aaron eckhart looks like a dumb robert redford type caught up as a tobacco lobbyist you want him to break out of this part but he really never does he is as glib as they comein addition his son looks as though he is totally annoyed with the entire situation from beginning to endthis film would have worked far better as a serious documentary in the style of michael moores sickomr eckhart won a golden globe nomination as best actor in a comedy or musical for the life of me nothing was funny here the tragedy being that the tobacco industry has hooked countless numbers of people on a product that they will eventually succumb to,black_comedy
here are the parts that bothered me most about thankyou for smoking the fatherandon stuff suffers from the usual delusion that a child can convincingly adore his father in one scene and innocently soak up his bad attitudes then manipulate his mother with sophisticatedsounding psychoanalysis in the next scene then give his father life lessons worthy of plato in a third scene any character who can do all that is likely to be nothing but a cipher especially if hes supposed to be twelve years old i know that impossible wisdom and sophistication is a common characteristic of celluloid children but it really made this film hard to take tothen theres the scene with the gunwaving exmarlborough man where the hero gets over his fear so quickly and completely that the next shot starts with him with his back to his embittered guntotin host leisurely checking out the contents of his mantelpiece that could have been a great scene but all the tension and believability vanished in the first couple of seconds with one bit of bad directionthe idea that a professional and very talented bullshit artist could be so easily brought down by a reporter who looks about 19 years old i know shes older but she doesnt look it was ludicrous what newspaper would ever send anyone so young to deal with a notorious spunkiest alone what spunkiest would ever let sex get him so carried away that hed spill his guts so completely especially a big blond spunkiest whod have no trouble getting girlsby the way why did the heros mate in the mod squad specifically say the reporter was irish with blue eyes when she has hazel eyes and a strong american accent cant americans hear accents,black_comedy
that was the least funny film i have ever seen it had no love or compassion it had no morals or light at the end of the tunnel the sad part is the man passed his immorality on to his own son he basically told him not care about other people as long as your being successful im sure that the atheists went ko koo about it but the truth was it depressed me i dont know why everyone likes it so much it was so boring i almost had to walk out one scene was majorly inappropriate and very gross it practically said its ok to smoke kids so come on down and thats not ok so if you were considering watching this insanity may i suggest changing your plans,black_comedy
this film included and encourage having sexual affair and envy to have this kind of relations so what have to we do first buy some cosmetics of coursebuy some condom buy perfume go some place which you can have somebody make baby have an abortion or not have the baby hospital expenses when baby comes out buy diaper etc so my point actually hollywoods sexist mentality itself makes money im not sure i can make my point but this film zeroize itself anyway,black_comedy
some of the best acting you out there is a a excellent character profile of nick naylor a tobacco lobbyist the catchy cinematography and colorful environments keep you captivated in what becomes a rather insightful look into the world of politics and lobbyist we venture from one location to another rapidly never pausing to soak in what we are looking at it keeps you disoriented in a similar way to how nick keeps his opponents disoriented with his quick wit and endless arguments while you could hate nate for his rather deplorable job he becomes likable by the end because his charisma overwhelms his other traits beyond just nick the entire cast performs exceptionally giving us a host of wonderful characters to enjoy check out a more in depth review here the indepth review does contain spoilers httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnvtggwtbyfw,black_comedy
alright ive noticed several reviews that discuss the bad effects of smoking rather than the quality of the movie itself im not going to get into that i know smokers who are happy with their lifestyle and arent sick and theyve been smoking for years i also know smokers who have gotten cancer there may never be a right or wrong and i wont waste your time getting into all thatthis movie is a laughriot with very minimal crude humor and a look at the point of view of a spokesperson for tobacco nick lives a wealthy life moneywise but standing up in favor of tobacco has cost him his marriage many friendships the respect of people nationwide and if he isnt careful his career might also cost him his twelveyearold son who is conflicted between the antismoking propaganda at his school and the information from his father he has to decide which is more important his family or his jobthis is not an environmental hippie propaganda crud movie which made me ecstatic since i love polluting things on purpose it was nice to find a movie that explained both sides of the matter although it sort of shows the tobacco corporation in a bad light nick is not an evil businessman monster h truly does care about his son although taking joey on a business trip to big tobacco likely wasnt the best idea nor was the comedic parentteacher scene the real sleazeball in this movie is brad joeys stepdadif youre a smoker dont worry this movie doesnt shove all that antismoking crud down your throat anything antismoking related in it is no different than what you see on those cigarette packages i will warn that if you dont have a sense of humor with this type of movie or if you dont enjoy movies like silkwood a civil action or the insider you may find yourself bored or annoyed at the moviei highly recommend the acting for the most part is really good the soundtrack is great and the plot is original definitely worth seeing at least once,black_comedy
director jason reitman son of director ivan reitman has forged a nice little career for himself is ability to tread the comic minefield of politically incorrect sly cynical comedy has resulted in some of the most subversive mainstream comedies to come out in the 2000s the apex of his short career so far was the topical dramedy up in the air 2009 but before his recent successes he made his feature debut film thank you for smokingtells the story of nick naylor aaron eckhart a dc lobbyist working for the institute of tobacco studies who shills bs for a living with delight considered the face of cigarettes at a time when people are up in arms about their health effects nick takes on his challenging job with a level of glee and enthusiasm that would wear down a lesser man all the while the powers that be including his own boss br jk simmons conspire against him when not lobbying on behalf of cigarettes nick spends his afternoons at a local pub with fellow lobbyists and his weekends with his son joey cameron brightprotagonists like nick are a dime a dozen in modern hollywood the viewing public likes a villain like food consumers like fast food theyre not the best role models but their incredibly interesting from a characterization perspective it is partially for this reason nick is so irresistible as a character he lives in the grey area of moral turpitude that many of us have issues with of course hes not strictly speaking evil or a villain not even a scoundrel he just loves his job so much that hes willing to live with and even enjoy its more dubious moments he finds it easy while acknowledging that it would be hard for anyone else he was born to talkthe story of however is not just one about nick reitman expands on the corrosive cynicism of washington by making nearly every supporting character in the film worse than our hero senator ortolan finister william h macy leads the charge in congress against the tobacco lobby in the movie his new warning label set to be introduced on the floor for consideration is the main impetus behind many characters actions he needlessly demeans his aides and casually and privately supports terrorism against the amiable nick all while bemoaning the health hazards of cigarettes katie holmes also plays a role as an intrepid reporter who seduces nick into giving away insider secretsnick and co eventually get their comeuppance to a degree yet were meant to feel sympathy not schadenfreude for him as he addresses the case of freedom of choice the movie largely succeeds in presenting his plight in large part due to the acting the directing and the irreverent dialogue special mention must be given to maria bello and david koechner for their work as lobbyists for the alcohol and firearm lobby respectively they help bring a level of brevity that helps move things in a jaunty paceafter jason reitman directed the breakaway hit juno 2007 starring ellen page thus catapulting to prominence in the eyes of the viewing public soft enough for popular appeal yet sharp enough to evoke wisdom his films have become a mainstay on the theater marquee for me however remains the best of his already impressive budding careerhttptheyservepopcorninhellblogspotcom,black_comedy
its a well done film but its message falls on deaf earseven with the exorbitant price of cigarettes the same people smoke and the industry gains new smokers by the thousands each day often teenagers or preteensfrankly i wish more people would smoke because they would pay into social security and medicare and die before they benefited that would increase my social security benefit and decrease my medicare premium as voiced in the film wall streetgreed is good as we see from robert ringers looking out for 1 published in 1977 i am the most important person on earth abortion kills more people than cigarettes but that is another topic for another dayif the film makes us think it is worthwhile but it presents a parody as stated which will not persuade smokers or wannabee smokers from using tobacco for a never smoker like me who cares about people but not smokers the film was amusing which is why i rate it a 7,black_comedy
is to tobacco what sideways is to wine and casino is to the casinos of las vegasthe movie is about the life of a lobbyist nick naylor spokesperson for a major tobacco firm whose gift of gab and ability to shut the fellow debaters on national television draws admirers from the industry but at the same time increases the number of concerned citizens who campaign for the ban of tobacco in all forms by a manifoldnick a divorce with a teenage son tries his best to not influence his son to take up what he campaigns for tobacco and rather lets him choose what is best for himself we get to see the functioning of the tobacco industry how deals are made how dissidents are bought off with money how the company disowns its employees when a plan goes awry and how trying to save ones job puts ones life at jeopardythe movie does not necessarily edify the viewers but it does provide what we seekentertainment,black_comedy

while all of the previous comments pointed out the great production values and the amazing credit roll at the beginning they failed to mention this pure propaganda production for the left coast crowdcigarette smoking is about the least of our worries and the crazies have gone to new heights to promote the antismoking mania in this filmwhere were the psychiatry drug pushing lobbyists portrayed here the script would have been well suited to a prozac pushing psych drug popping lobbyist complete with crazed school kids on prozac how about mothers feeding 18 month old with potent life threatening psyhcotropic drugs i dislike smoke filled rooms that you cannot escape i do enjoy a cigarette every now and then the antismoke crazies have really gone too far i could not laugh is this was just too sad,black_comedy
although clever and funny was about as poorly conceived as an apologia for the kkk not that it hasnt been done hollywood makes movies good not good movies and this film is a prime example of that maxim good setup good actors good directing good camera workbad movienow before you get all hot and bothered about the fact that i didnt like a movie that you thought was funny and cute stop and think for a minute what makes a movie good is it the special effects the visuals the cute female male lead the fact that you laughed well no actually although all those things help what makes a movie good is the idea behind it and this movie was based on a very bad oneif you watch the special features youll hear a lot of people say that this movie is about spin thats pure spin the movie if you pay close attention to what the director says is about political correctness in this case since you are rooting for the bad guy an amoral liar and all round despicable person and booing the good guy the besandaled senator from vermont the correctness part can be argued is it merely politically correct to try and curtail smoking is it on a par with saying physically challenged or differently abled rather than disabled or crippled no it is not it is a hard proved fact that cigarettes do indeed kill that the tobacco lobby doesnt give a rodents derriere about that and that any laws passed through the efforts of lobbyists like the protagonist of this film will cause you direct and personal harmthe other reason this film is bad is that it simply didnt work as a film you cant make a feelgood movie about a man who is immoral the tearyeyed child who loves and supports dad doesnt make you feel all warm and fuzzy instead you feel like slapping him as much for the sentiment as for the stilted all too adultsounding and blatantly expository lines he is forced to deliver there is no godly reason for us to feel good about the son or about the exspouse for that matter who somehow inexplicably decides to support her exhubby in the end no a plot like that only works if the main character comes through with a change of heart and this one didnttwo thumbs down on this one if you want to see a good movie about spin watch wag the dog,black_comedy
this film was perfectly good but had one major flaw which ruined it for me that is one of the characters comes up wit brilliant idea to lobby cigarettes  put them back into film so that they become popular and fashionable again ok no because ummmmmm arent cigarettes already in films fight club history boys bridget jones kiis kiss bang bangneed i go on with trend setting actors like brad pitt and helen bohman carter smoking and making it seem cool fun and sexythey even mention brad pitt in the film saying they should make him smoke and asking whetherhe can blow smoke rings well he canin fight club and does in a lot of his films smokeeithier this is the wort research in the world or they hoped that the audience would have been watching shrek or batman or harry potter but thats a stupid assumption as the audience that would go and watch a black humured comedy would have seen the films i mentioned before or others where they smoke,black_comedy
jason reitman has a long and brilliant career ahead as a director and writer if he keeps putting out films like thisaaron eckhart in the company of men was simply brilliant as a lobbyist that tries to balance his clients interests with the need for his son to understand him the son was played by cameron bright birth running scared who is definitely an up and coming staralthough she has a small part the chance to see maria bello is never to be missedwith william h macy robert duvall jk simmons sam eliiott and rob lowe there is something for everyone hereit is hard not to like nick naylor eckhart who comes up smelling like a rose despite major difficulties this guy could even make bush look good,black_comedy
a film about moral flexibility fits well into our modern day society because thats what you need if you work in many of the companies thats what you need if you go shopping with a limited amount of money thats what you need if you get into your car and drive around and thats also what nick naylor played by aaron eckhart needs if he plans to continue working for smoking and cell phone companies definitely has some biting lines in it i love the meetings with the alcohol and firearm industry lobbyists but also the film is blessed with a pinch of moral flexibility by almost not showing one single cigarette throughout the whole movie to make it more childrenfriendly i guess i also just dont buy that katie holmes katie holmes should be smart and seductive enough to lure out all secrets of an unscrupulous business man like naylor all in all its a nice and funny comedy but not really a satire,black_comedy
its about political correctness and moral controversy very fast and pretty sharp i would say actors are rather capable and the story itself is amusing this kind of movie is very rare not for the subject handled but for the witty way such a serious topic may be recounted so that the plot finally turns into an astute comedy certainly able to make adults laugh aaron eckart doesnt go off the path maria bello is expressing and convincing i would watch if i were a chronic smoker but i did appreciate it though not being a smoker anyway many people should recognize themselves as the objectaim of the motion picture,black_comedy
this is a satirical comedy that follows the plotting of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry whose job is to improve the image of cigarettes put a spin on them and make them cool againeven though a senator wants to place a large skull and crossbones on every cigarette packet and state that they are poison nick wont let it happenthe focus of the film is not only on his life and how the public despise him but his relationship with his son toothis film will be enjoyed by most people both smokers to non smokers this film is satire at its best it is funny clever and true i found it very enjoyable and very different from other films i have seen recentlyit gets its point across very well to the audience and succeeds with great acting dialog and structure the character of nick naley played by aaron eckhart is portrayed brilliantlythe final word everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and that it can give you lung cancer and might eventually kill you but nicks job is to defend smokers and cigarettes and make people think that cigarettes are cool thats what makes it so funny there is nothing worth complaining about when it comes to i loved it,black_comedy
picture this a 15year old boy with cancer caused by smoking is the subject of a talk show along with him are five guests four of them are there on behalf of various antismoke organizations eager to ban cigarettes for ever the fifth on the other hand is nick naylor aaron eckhart americas most famous tobacco lobbyist now you wouldnt expect him to win the argument would you yet that happens he proves us all wrong by pointing out that his employers want to keep robin thats the boys name alive as they would lose a potential customer whereas his opponents would succeed in their campaign only in case the kid died all of a sudden the audience is on nicks side once more confirming the validity of his mantra if you argue correctly youre never wrongdefending cigarettes isnt an easy job but nicks the best at it for a simple reason hes brutally honest he doesnt claim smoking is good for your health he merely stresses the fact that everyone is free to make their own choice this attitude will come in handy when he needs to face a vermont senator william h macy whos planning to put a drawing of a skull on cigarette packs to tell people this habit is deadly before this challenge though theres still time to chat with fellow mod merchants of death people maria bello and david koechner representing alcohol and firearms respectively discuss product placement in scifi movies but wouldnt they blow up in an alloxygen environment he wonders to which rob lowes marketing expert replies probably but its an easy fix one line of dialogue thank god we invented the you know whatever device pay a visit to the boss robert duvall watch out for a mischievous journalist katie holmes and receive death threats all while trying to ensure his son joey cameron bright doesnt end up hating him not bad for a guy whose summation of his job reads as follows michael jordan plays basketball charles manson kills people i talkif you think all thats too much for one movie its true and thats the only bad thing about jason reitmans audacious directorial debut he squeezes too much into the films 90 minutes rushing through certain segments and thus denying certain characters more screen time the hollywood segment in particular is a little bit too brief and its a shame since rob lowe and adam brody have an impeccable comedic talent nonetheless reitman manages to deliver a movie which is both intelligent and very funny two qualities missing in his fathers ivan director of ghostbusters recent body of work tackles a tricky subject without taking any sides and therein lies its charm by favoring neither opinion a view strengthened by the fact that no one is seen smoking is the whole movie reitman ensures smokers and nonsmokers alike will enjoy this brilliant comedy much of the credit goes to his leading man as well since eckhart manages to turn his trademark amoral guy into a sympathetic character this aspect is a little exaggerated in the third act due to some unnecessary fatherandson sentimentality but by the time the closing credits start rolling he has regained his mojo ensuring this clever satire wont be forgotten very easily,black_comedy
a film about the inner workings of the tobacco spin game was long overdue just think of the comic potential of a story starring a man with the ridiculous task of sticking up for a product as despised as it is deadly while it is a biting satire that scores high marks for originality never quite lives up to its promisethe biggest fault of is that it tries too hard to be sharp the genuinely hilarious moments such as when aaron eckharts tobacco spokesman chiding a little girls mother for speaking the truth about smokes are much more random than the scenes that fall flat in an effort to make every bit of dialog witty and original the writers sacrificed quality for quantity the end result is empty and for the most part unsatisfying however the wonderful comic performances of lead aaron eckhart and his nemesis william h macy help elevate the picture over its weaker moments,black_comedy
satire about a tobacco lobbyist aaron eckhart i cant quite put my finger on why but i really didnt think it worked admittedly the tobacco industry is an easy target it would be too easy to villainize nick naylor so it feels kind of like they were trying not to villainize him completely which then feels like they were being too soft on him i mean isnt he a villain it always felt like directorscreenwriter reitman was pulling his punches the film is moderately entertaining i actually wish it were a tad funnier but there are a few really funny moments nicks visit to hollywood is the best part of the film rob lowe as a hollywood agent and adam brody as his assistant give the movies most memorable performances and also deliver all the best lines i also liked maria bello and david koechner as nicks friends lobbyists for alcohol and firearms respectively william h macy is also good as an antismoking senator but it makes me question reitmans intentions that the satirical barbs at him stick much better than the ones against the tobacco industry,black_comedy
this is my fist post on this fine site excuse my spelling first off i just rented this move and have not had a chance to view but after reading all the threads i will chime inas a smoker and huge bill hicks fan ive found many of the threads here interesting btw while bill has been the best preacher ive heard he did not change my already established thoughts just reenforced them by showing me im not alone here in sheb wi thats nice  first off in this day we all know what were getting into as smokers that being health and public opinion its funny how many non forget the giant tax revenue generated by smokers and drinkers that aside the world is full of choices the gov is more than happy to give us alcohol and cigs to kill ourselves and others with while bashing any and everything it has no direct control over ha fine its the united states of hypocrites but i for one as a smoker and user of other things including various opiates feel its up to those to decide what vice they care to cling to the off topic fat cracks are funny in their own sick way we all have our own vice to worry about be it money drugs family morals so on while having only seen the trailer for this film i think it makes a good and necessary point on smoking even as a smoker im fine with the public trying to do away with smoking in places i think ca has a good thing with trying to do away with it in public and even more so in the home no one should be subject to unchosen exposure to the crap its sad to think how many parents put their children through it i came from a non smokingdrugsalcohol home yet i like many other teens in high school and more so college started as a freshman with little idea what i was getting into i have no problem with people trying to remove just a little bit of corp and gov bs control from our lives at some point we must realize the neg variables that impose themselves upon us and as the fat and current topic has shown us the us ignorance factor is huge to say the least i have quit cigs but got hung up with a girl that prompted my reinitiation into the smoking world she gone and so will my cigs in due time again however its wrong on so many levels to ostracize anyone for chemical dependency my feeling is in time this drug abuse that includes legal and non epidemic that is only getting worse with time will be looked at in the same shame in which we treated minorities 50 yrs ago as bill said these people are not criminals there sick people we as a nation need to put more money time effort awareness and most of all treatment in this direction in order to remove the unsightly element of smoking and any substance this includes bad food from the public people need to hear the truth of all this and then digest it no pun intended and if anyone out there thinks the gov with do this than their more delusional than bushi too like hicks am an optimist i do see and long and very brutal road ahead of us but i like to cling to the idea we will prevail however it will take the effort of the masses to open the eyes to the larger mass once people stop viewing and treating those who do not have a cookie cutter fit to their own beliefs as criminals and degenerates we can start the process of evolving beyond these vicesim sure it will take many more needless deaths and political agendas before it sinks in but again i cant wait to see this world 50 years from now im only 26 so theres a chance and then get to hear so they put addicts in jail for the time being lets all have a full hearty gut laugh at the medias portrayal of the unfavorable of the earthbtw i know i have an odd perspective as a user of things however i feel im better suited to speak of them for this i look at the execution of tookie as a great loss heres a guy who was ready to speak against violence and gangs to the youths of the us and we kill him of course the white guy from harvard is a better rep to speaks to all the high schoolers in la wow some dayi aint never met a good lookin dame that needed to be told she was,black_comedy
biting constantly engaging lungblack comedy burns away its 92 minutes without hardly skipping a beat young jason reitman adapting the cult novel of the same name clearly steps out of the shadows of being daddys boy on his first feature film with this blistering antipc movie the film centers around aaron eckhart in his first truly noteworthy lead who plays the man society loves to hate nick naylor is the number one lobbyist for big tobacco essentially whos job requirements include nothing but spinning grey areas around the facts dealing with cigarette related deaths in a world where everyone wants to play the blame game naylor is high on the list of enemies of the public and must always be thinking on his feet to defend himself from the wildest of accusations taking this brilliant character premise reitman deftly articulates many of the finer hypocrisies underlying any such moral crusades antismoking authorities feel the need to exercises to the people at big tobacco anyone who does not relish a black or white reality will be pleased as punch with milewide grins to boot at how this delicate subject matter was intelligently and unapologetically handled in order to portray the most truthful resonance jason reitman could not have asked for a better debut the direction is focused brisk and supremely entertaining while the impressive supporting cast all make it work for this films unique tone despite the brief lapses into snootyville with its extra dosages of sarcasm the movie really does remain a balanced affair and will undoubtedly become one of the years greatest satires,black_comedy
if u want to laugh hard then this movie is the one you are looking for if u want to think deep this is also the right one it simply bring you the essence of those reports from industrial research agencies full of craps think about this way whenever you say something to people then you are facing the question of there is no physical evidence to prove there is connection between the results and the reasons and continue with if you cannot prove me wrong then i m right of course we cannot retort since we are not those nerds who spent entire life in lab proving smoking can cause lung cancer if we think this way there is nothing right existing in this world so this movie is telling you a story of how the industry uses different tool to conduct your way of thinkinggood movie it make fun of media tobacco alcohol weapon industry,black_comedy
is a smart satirical comedy about lobbyist named nick naylor who plots and speaks on behalf of a big cigarette company while trying to remain a model for his twelveyearold son the film is a jason reitmans awaited debut featuring talented wellknown actors contains numerous accurate perceptions concerning hypocritical political environment the pic goes even further and viewers learn what machinations politics use in order to accomplish their frequently dishonorable aims the script is cleverlywritten and the dialogue is witty and relevant another advantage of the film is good convincing acting from aaron eckhart without him the movie would probably lost most of its charm good performances are provided also by david koechner and william h macy in supporting roles on the other side the flick is at some points too sweet and trifling as a result it lacks not only the intensity but also memorable scenes whats more this movie is only moderately funny which is the biggest shortcoming all in all is an excellent satire but slightly fails as a laughable comedy,black_comedy
this film was so enjoyable so quick and clever in terms of dialogue casting god even locations that the subject matter somehow gets lost along the way in the mephistophlean yipee what the hell of it allthey say that the devil has the best tunes and this movie proves that he also has all the best oneliners and suits and arguments because essentially the message is that the right thing for example doing something about the millions that smoking kills globally each year is something for stuffy squares healthbores and cryptofascists the latter category is typified by william h macys character a senator from vermont who leads the campaign against big tobacco and at the end of the film is seen explaining why its necessary to digitally rework cinema classics to remove the cigarettes from the hands of stars like bogart dietrich and bergman he rationalises the action by saying that this is a way of improving the past by contrast the movies hero nick naylor comes back from being down on the ropes to vindicate himself before a senate committee and goes on to front his own successful consultancy i cant fault this film as a piece of cinema and i enjoyed it immensely from the stunning title sequence to the very end id also agree that satire is a legitimate rhetorical framework for examine serious topics see lord of war for more herebut whereas lord of war  offers a global vision of the arms business and its horrendous consequences only skims the surface of the suffering with the jokey cancer boy and the wacko marlboro man make no mistake  im not expecting any kind of moral insight on the part of the protagonist in lord of war nicolas cage also completely fails to understand why his actions are wrong but i think this would have been a stronger work if the joyful world of washington spin had been accompanied by a deeper exploration of what smoking does to people every day,black_comedy
here is one clever satire with aggressive wit profane and pungent dialog and great performances by a well placed cast young jason reitmann son of ivan of ghostbusters fame has pleased family friends and multiplex customers with a sharp take on the morally flexible world of spin sin and consumer media possibly with a bit too much swearing diluting and distracting both the message and the cleverness of jasons gen x pen smoking has hilarious and visually witty credits and a great use of some gramophone hits of the 40s underlining its 2006 tv satire targets the hoagy carmichael cigarette song have another cigarette is used on these opening credits and that alone sets the tone for a well researched and creatively aimed cough in the face of spin doctors and ciggy sellers gun honchos hamburger merchants and alcohol lobby each get a serve handsome blond cary grant style eckhart is perfectly cast as the amoral hero with william h macy his well turned frustrated exec as the cheese senator from vermont a film to be proud of jason it occurred to me half way through a sex scene with katie holmes how much she actually looks like a female version of tom cruise which really set me thinking  into a subplot nothing to do with this film,black_comedy
lobbyist for the tobacco company big tobacco nick naylor isnt morally bankrupt but morally flexible nicks job is to keep america and the world smoking fanastic at his job nick is a words smith spinning the truth and facts to his own needs youre never wrong if you can argue right and nick is never wrong part of the mod squad nick and his friends polly bailey lobbyist for alcohol and bobby jay bliss lobbyist for firearms they all protect and keep their companies running at the plight of all the activist against themis a satirical spin on the tobacco industry based upon christopher buckley novel the depths and avenues taken by nick and his boss br have such a moral corruption 1200 people die from smoking and nick is proud of this achievement there is a great cultural and modern relevance to the concepts and arguments with people are looking for an escape goat to blame though director jason reitman shows its our own decisions we need to look atright from the get go shows this no simple satire nick appears on a talk show panel of anti smoking companies and a boy dying of cancer and a crowd booing and spitting at him yet nick spins everything and has the crowd cheering him and cancer boy agreeing with him the satire is so forked tongued and the wit runs like a chain smokerthe flip side of is its equal ground for both sides while the tobacco industry is shown evil yet it runs just like any other company ie alcohol and firearms with fast food also not left alone either selling its product to its consumers government bodies trying to ban smoking and placing disturbing pictures on cigarette packets show their fascist tendencies the big picture to is peoples given right to freedom of choice and the end dollar lies in the individuals choicefinally showing some talent and growing as an actor aaron eckhart is outstanding as nick eckhart shows a great balance between nicks amoral and moral tendencies and coolly spinning every arguments in his favour maria bello and david koechner and great as mod squad members polly and bobby william h macy is amazing as always adam brody and katie holmes dont compare yet add fun in this stellar castits a 16mg hit of witty and extremely humorous satire,black_comedy
this is simply quite one of the most cleverwell constructed thought provoking and entertaining films ever made in an era of robust and unforgiving political correctness without one cigarette being seen or smoked at all for some reason the latter only dawns upon you at the end when nick moves on to coaching the mobile phone market however bringing his son into the equationin such an uncomfortable yet inevitable way seems not only dangerous and contentious but goes on to make this a truly fine display of debating one of the many moral dilemmas we all face today it is also mighty refreshing to see a director take on such a challenge and execute it brilliantly to encompass all of the above while making you laugh and also show how we are all prone to being derailed by spin from time to time,black_comedy
i wanted to see this film for a long time and on a flight to london i finally got to see it and it was worth the wait this movie is funny smart and entertaining lets face it we all know smoking is bad for you just as too much alcohol or anything else i have never smoked but i know a lot of smokers they started smoking because they choose too and now they are addictive of course smoking was once hip in the 1950s my father smoked and probably would have lived longer if he didnt at all but whats done is done you cant blame the cigarette industry for people lighting up and smoking there are few places left that they can smoke aaron eckhart does an excellent job in making us feel for the tobacco lobbyist nick nailer he plays devils advocate i found katie holmes believable as the reporter who would do anything to get a story i love maria bello playing the alcohol lobbyist and that guy from saturday night live playing the firearms lobbyist the three call themselves the merchants of death squad while lobbying for their causes in washington dc marianne m who plays nicks sons school teacher has a small but worthy role sam elliott who i always mistake for sam shepard is the retired marlboro man in this film suffering from lung cancer william h macy has a great role as the vermont senator wait until you see what his character wants to do with old films portraying smokers its unthinkable anyway the film is just too short in my opinion but the director is the son of hollywood director ivan reitman his name is jason reitman his father directed films like twins and junior with danny devito and arnold schwarzenneger for his debut as director jason reitman will probably win an oscar before his own father,black_comedy
wow an actual satire a rare bird interesting funny a really original movie after a long dry spell of mirthless comedies cleverly written wellcast and wellacted it is great to see a movie that gives you something to smile about on the way home and right away i was thinking about who i could give this dvd to for christmas most of my friends and family do not go to movies making the cut for an actual dvd purchase is a tough criteria for judging movies without a doubt i will be buying this smart and entertaining movie for several people this year i am just glad that the local theater showed this indie film there is a 12 screen theater and a new 14 screen theater but they show all of the same films many times they show the same action or kid movie on multiple screens rather than interesting films like this one,black_comedy
i loved this movie for 3 reasons 1 the actors were truly fantastic i agree with someone else who wrote a review when they said that katie holmes was the exception that girl is not a good actress aaron eckhart was funny and witty and plain fantastic as was cameron brightthe little boy2 it isnt a typical storyline its what every other movie should be freshly original and wittingly funny i have yet to see a movie with a better story and with this great a pace truely an excellent producer and great writers3 as mentioned before it doesnt take sides which is great for all those who simply cannot grasp that a movie is allowed to take sides and end up ruining the movie for everyone because they complain and loudly i might add throughout the entire movie is well worth seeing whether your a smoker or a nonsmoker its great,black_comedy
more than attacking either side of the tobacco debate too viscously this film lampoons how our modern society and government often operates and how superficially people are swayed sound bites rather than substance demonizing those of the opposing view statistics and research findings twisted and spun until data fits the agenda doesnt matter if your statements are truthful just make the other guy look more wrong and most important of all in american life justify whatever you do as worthwhile as long as it pays the mortgage the film is smart and searing in a curious undercurrent way and creates a bleak atmosphere that overshadows the dark comedy i couldnt help wondering if those in the audience laughing the loudest were the ones who most identified with these characters and were laughing out as a defense mechanism it has become an increasingly complicated conflicted society that often makes many seemingly paradoxical demands on its members and as people struggle for survival which in america means paying the bills we have become adrift and comical in the way we justify the means by which we meet that end and in the ways we try to influence social change sort of childish in the sense that well lie cheat and steal and go to untruthful extremes and feel justified as long as it gets more people to agree with our view than the opposing one,black_comedy
a satirical look at the life of a protobacco industry lobbyistlike the truman show and fight club this is a movie that attempts to engage the audience at the level of ideas and like these two movies it starts with a great premise and full of energy but then fails to maintain the pitch and fudges an opportunity i agree with those commentators who say it is not really all that satirical  more of a satirical comedy there are lots of funny moments so it is highly enjoyable and well worth the price of admissionbut i wasnt entirely convinced by the crowbar plot moves of both the seduction and the kidnapping had the movie relied solely on its wit and language it might have retained much more bite i could see the point of the likefatherlikeson device as a necessary foil for the valuefree ethical standpoint of the protagonist but by the end it seemed that the movie fell back on that old us standby of asserting family values which compromised the satirical intentsmoking isnt really the point of the movie indeed the best scenes for me were the meetings of the mod squad  a group of highly competitive sophists who compete to defend the currently indefensible these scenes are a compelling and witty illustration of the underlying theme of the movie which is the subversive power of words and rational argumentation to support the most untenable of positions the triumph is in making the nick naylor character a hero and that has everything to do with aaron eckhardts superb performance instead of a pantomime villain it seems that it is he who is a bastion of individual liberty in contemporary democracy thats the satire  but it is not unsettling in the way that characters such as say travis bickle in taxi driver and rupert pupkin in king of comedy succeed in the end and significantly you wont see anyone actually smoking in this movie,black_comedy
nick is guy who sincerely believed smoking is a personal informed choice and that everyone deserves to be given their fair share of slate to voice out their opinion the underlying message of this movie is serious that smoking kills so is laughing at it distasteful it will be only if you have no sense of humorthat aside a lot of the arguments a lot of it in this movie are very much valid either you like it or not that balanced out the humor and serious side of the topic  smokingi knew it was kind of a comedy but i didnt expect it to be this entertaining a movie that tickles you hard simply by dialogues and facial expression is priceless there isnt a single character that i can find fault with aaron as a guy with no sense of guilt for believing in his principal is simply perfect for the role of nick the rest of the big guns worked their role well too the pace was alright where you would not think that there is a good time to go ease yourself seriously i cant thank enough that someone made this movieif you like snatch this is a must to watch,black_comedy
i liked this movie liked it but the entire time i was watching it i had the nagging feeling like the material was better than the movie i never read the book and im not some insider who read the script before the movie came outi just basically kept thinking while i watched this movie thats a funny idea this should be a funny scene why isnt it funnier i saw it with my wife and our friends and my wife completely agreed with me then we found out that this movie was directed by ivan reitmans son and well i hate to be a player bater but i think we got our answerim sure this jason reitman is a great guy but lets be honest he did not work his way to the top he was not someone with brilliant talent who had to fight from obscurity to get a career off the ground hes the son of one of hollywoods more bankable directors and thats why a movie that felt like it should have been great turned out to be just all right,black_comedy
aaron eckhart delivers an amazing performance as the gleefully obnoxious tobacco lobbyist nick naylor he is so convincing in fact that you can actually feel yourself being manipulated by his characters scripted wiles as for his supporting cast they fits their roles admirably knowing not to interfere no complaints about casting unfortunately this film falls well short of its satirical aim there are plenty of deserving targets in the debate over smoking and thank you takes on all of them just not very effectively i dont know if its the outlandish premise of the film or something else entirely but something about it rings hollow on final review mildly amusing generally harmless goofball satire,black_comedy
i believe the movie did not go far enough into the dark humor or true satire such as dr strangelove for example it would have been much more effective and powerful if the issues were taken to fantastical endsotherwise it remained mildly entertaining rather than really original and topical the the mod squad is well put together eery and funny the lead character is appropriately smooth and like a true con man trustworthy the katie holmes character is too lightweight  literally and figuratively it is hard to believe that professional jaded dc lobbyists would fall for such a bimbo she should have been a katherine like kate winslet or katharine hepburn investigative journalist not a cute katie hard to believe plot twists  not frightening not deep enough,black_comedy
when i first heard of the title turned me off im a nonsmoker and i think like most people that cigarettes are death sticksonce i saw the trailer i was more interested because it looked pretty funny and aaron eckhart is an actor i find interesting i watched the movie yesterday and i really enjoyed it it was quite funny and it also makes you think about the issuepossible spoiler what it came down to was would you make something harmful illegal or would you let each person make that choice for themselves i believe in the latter,black_comedy
i have read the book and would like to say that this is one of the best books i have read in god knows when the main character nick is often compared to satan the mans wit and humorous comments and politically incorrect facts makes him even more likable nick is a spokesperson for big tobacco while trying to remain a role model for his 12 year old son william h macy robert duvall katie holmes and adrien brody costar in this hilarious comedy directed by jason reitman based on the book with the same title by christopher buckley the most interesting part in the whole movie is how not one cigarette is shown being smoked in the whole movie this film was the most popular and probably the best at this years sundance film festival jason reitman is an upcoming film director with a lot of potential as shown in this film gets 2 big thumbs up,black_comedy

i thought this was an excellent movie it was funny and smart it had an excellent cast and was very well written i love all the little stabs it takes at the ignorant people of america and just generally the world people are always complaining about things like tobacco alcohol and firearms but those are the things that are country was founded and built from the people we are attacking are the people we depend on everyone just needs to open there eyes and see the world for what it really is maybe then we could start to change things for the better all in all i really enjoyed the message of this movie not to mention the fact that it was hilarious and very entertaining aside from the message of it i highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone,black_comedy
a movie that should most obviously cause some controversy why because it spits the truth in your face and laughs about it this movie is one of few movies in recent years that tells the entire truth of organizations and the way they work nowadaysaaron eckhart is excellently casted as the overcocky spokesmanvicepresident of the tobacco studies thats not the entire name organization he disrespects you and makes you feel like a dumbass in front of the people you are trying to protect he feeds bs to the world watching him he goes home and bangs a hot reporter in his highclass apartment what a lifeis hilarious in its own right with lines like bang your brains against the desk until something useful comes out and shots of rob lowe in an asian kimono this satire shows us what it really takes to be the most hated and loved man in america promoting cigarettes why to make money duh its to sucker those who were born to be suckered watch this movie with an open mind noncontroversial thoughts and a mood for laughteri only felt that at some points the movie slowed down a little too much and bored me some but then again it quickly would pick up the pace when aaron spits some of his wittiest speeches definitely mr eckharts best performance and worth a watch at least on dvd if youre the cheapy,black_comedy

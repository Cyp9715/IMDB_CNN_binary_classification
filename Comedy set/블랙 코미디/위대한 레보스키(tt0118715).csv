its actually kind of hard to describe this movie and whats so great about it to people who dont already know it and love it as with many cult films will either speak to you in which case you will become a fervent follower of his dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life or if it doesnt the film will either leave you completely indifferent or youll even downright hate iti believe its a very funny film and im sure it can be rightfully called a comedy but dont expect punchlines gags jokes or slapstick  its not that kind of comedy if you want to enjoy this film you have to meet jeffery the dude lebowski on his terms hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their perhaps somewhat leisurely pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism theft of a car and more importantly a creedence clearwater revival tape kidnapping abstract art porn and  of course  bowling the story is actually kind of simple you see some nogood german nihilists urinated on the dudes rug  and this kind of aggression just wont stand against the dude with the help of his bowling buddies he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug  or possibly get a new one because that rug really tied the room together so he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people even jesus  who is not the messiah but a very naughty manwith jeff bridges in the leading role the coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created but its not just the dude that makes this a winner the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission the supporting cast is outstanding jturturro jgoodman and sbuscemi among many others the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest most quotable in any comedy ive ever seen this  for me  is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time 10 stars out of 10favorite films httpwwwimdbcomlistls054200841lesserknown masterpieces httpwwwimdbcomlistls070242495favorite lowbudget and bmovies httpwwwimdbcomlistls054808375,black_comedy

its a travesty that most critics only read at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a raymond chandler potboiler i simply cant begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic poppoetry as it plates gold on the silver screen and not feel so incredibly alive the dream sequence busbee berkley musical numbers are unique and aweinspiring the humor is rich subtle and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance the freeflowing story avoids even pokes fun at nonessentials like plot points and payoffs but what really makes this film such a masterpiece such a panacea is the incredible humanism the care that the coen brothers put in developing the dude jeff bridges walter john goodman donnie steve buscemitremendously endearing and brandt magnificently played by phillip seymour hoffman looking at the films use of sam elliott to play the stranger who constantly rambles about the many wonders of the dude among other things it is clear that the film is an ode to a dudist way of life and in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick stylistic showoff films what more could one ask for than a goodhearted film like this not to mention the performance by jeff bridges which ranks among the best performances of the nineties he has a relaxed slouch a goofy smile an enthusiastic dance and his buttons can only be pushed by walter who john goodman plays with charm and fury the coen brothers have always been considered cold filmmakers but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity as is the case with the coens fargo what we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you cant see that grab a white russian hit the bowling ally and find your innerdude as soon as possible,black_comedy
those coen brothers have an ear for language you feel it in the singsongy banalities of fargo and in the noiresque machinegun dialogue of millers crossing but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that ischanneling the opaque mysteries of raymond chandler the coens throw la resident bum and bowling aficionado jeff lebowski the dude to his friends into a strange triplecrossing case of kidnapping ransoms nihilists and urinatedupon rugs it is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object the dudes bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him hed much rather be bowling with crazed vietnam vet walter john goodman and pure silent soul donnie steve buscemias with so much of the coens output style is more than half the point not just visual though ace dp roger deakins paints an alluring canvas but tonal and auditory this is an insanely funny headtrip of a movie with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters down to the smallest part who better than the coens to reinvent the comedy of errorsthis is without a doubt one of their very best a personal favorite an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face do yourself and see this now if you havent already,black_comedy
my favourite coen brothers movie changes over the years as i watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre when i first saw on its original release i enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight fun movie with less depth than many of their previous works now a few years and several viewing later i have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is and it has become one of my all time favourite movies other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres styles and images in a similarly eclectic postmodern fashion but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as ethan and joel coen the big lewboski is an extremely smart film but it doesnt shout look at me arent i clever it sucks you in from the get go and bottom line it is funny and as it is a comedy thats what counts the most everything about the movie is perfect the script the direction set design costumes and the wonderful soundtrack one of the most brilliant ever assembled it includes lesser known dylan and elvis costello numbers creedence classics and songs from cult favourites like yma sumac captain beefheart moondog esquivel and garage gods the monks plus of course the actors who are well cast and virtually flawless jeff bridges fat city starman is the dude and its impossible to think of anyone else acting the role coen regulars john goodman steve buscemi john turturro peter stomare and jon polito are all on board as well as julianne moore boogie nights david huddleston capricorn one philip seymour hoffman magnolia and sam elliot mask even surprise cameos from ben gazzara the killing of a chinese bookie and singer jimmie ray gilmore i cant fault it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic its movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that hollywood continually spews out if only every movie in the box office top ten was as inspired and amusing as this one,black_comedy
with the combination of the writing of the coen brothers and the cinematography of roger deakins they created a film as beautiful as it is funny the coen brothers consistently impress me with their ability to write an interesting story with fascinating yet quirky characters without resorting to gratuitous sexual scenes like many other writerdirectors of r rated films the coen brothers manage to add the right amount of language and violence that is necessary to the story without it becoming the only reason for watching has so many clever and hilarious lines that you have to watch it over and over again nothing else needs to be said about it other than it is the greatest movie ever made,black_comedy
how mysterious certain films can be they become addictive ive seen lebowski at least a dozen time and most of the times by accident it was on tv or a friend is watching it and it is enough to catch a glimpse to be hooked completely hooked last night i saw it on purpose with a couple of friends and i think im stating to realize what is it  a unique combination of talents all looking in the same direction  the coen brothers are probably the only ones who know what they are seeing and the rest just trust their vision totally jeff bridges is miraculous his character is unique never seen and at the same times is all of bridges characters put together i love him in this part and i love the coen brothers for writing it knowing im sure that bridges was going to give it that real totally real surreal kind of life philip seymour hoffman comes in to do what he does best being memorable and then of course john tarturro john goodman steve buscemi delicious each one of them  im pretty sure will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we dont know exactly what,black_comedy
no movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film its delightfully written directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence i do admit that this is a film that i had to see six times to get every time i watch it i learn something new the genius of the film lies within a game i think the coen brothers play with their audiences there are the touches of the masters in many of their films in the hudsucker proxy it was preston sturges and frank capra in raising arizona i felt a touch of sam fuller in this film i felt many touches of greatness but more specifically i felt john sayles or even john cassevettes in spots the camera was manipulated beautifully and i felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn the performances are astounding especially goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the vietcong huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character turturro gives a fine cameo as jesus coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the eagles hotel california done in espanol i hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness it is once you dig deep a fine piece of filmmaking,black_comedy
the coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers scorsese kubrick carpenter  i am very fond of their work  throughout their irreverent career they have explored different subjects and themes  their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like raising arizona  and fargo one of my very favorites  i thought that film was fervently free  i was so ever wrong its as if the coen brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success academy award winners and now are willing to do whatever they please  is a film so meandering so wonderfully novel that i found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as i was heaving from laughter  the film is basically about mistaken identity eccentric characters and a soiled rug  this film extols the bowler the allies even the pins  we experience an actual bowling ball pov as the dude jeff bridges hallucinates  this film has nihilists feminists millionares paedophiles drugged out hippies underachieving students incompetent criminals pornographers and nam veterans  this movie is open to anything  anything some people are turned off by absurd looniness because its so grandiosely different  yet who couldnt chuckle if not explode when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling balls finger hole and the camera pans down to reveal his name as jesus i will disclose no more but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists feature abandon all solemn inhibitons though  one can not keep a straight face whilst watching,black_comedy
honestly a laughoutloud comedy that i agree with others does not get old the bowling scenes crack me up steve buscemi is hilarious in this and of course jeff bridges there are just moments of sheer comedic cringeworthy moments that will have you in stitches check it out,black_comedy
id heard a lot of bad press about this movie not as good as fargo was a much used phrase i wasnt overly impressed with fargo the atmosphere just didnt click for me but anyway that made me a little apprehensive about thisits easily better than fargo imho and its right up there with barton fink or millers crossing a true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters but its the movies atmosphere which is so truly joyous a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing achieving ones goals is important yes but its okay to set them low is what i perceived this movie to be saying as long as one is basically a good guy then thats enough well thats what it seemed like to me and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques lovely music  although more burwell would have been nice  and the trippiest funniest most absurd dream sequences youve ever seen great stuff,black_comedy
acting is one of the most key elements to success or failure of a film some film types can survive without superb acting these motion pictures can entertain the viewer with special effects or intense action scenes a film based on heavy dialog and backstory can not survive with out excellent actors one such movie that meets the dialogbased criterion is the film follows jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges and his two close friends through a not so normal chain of events the story is augmented by the supporting characters walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi written by joel and ethan coen the creative forces behind fargo the intriguing story succeeds because of the actors impeccable skill as with many other films by the coen brothers is an odd array of out of the ordinary characters slapped right in the middle of an improbable situation the dude is an unlikely hero living in the city of los angeles who becomes embroiled in a botched kidnapping this is not the average kidnapper comedy that has been seen a thousand times before the coen brothers take a fresh look at an old tired subject the story they have created is intriguing and entertaining but the true entertainment comes from the unique characters walter played by john goodman is a vietnam veteran who seems to have some parts of post traumatic stress syndrome donny another one of the dudes close friends is a quiet unassuming character who often interjects into conversation but no one pays close attention to what he saysas well as these characters are written they would not be as effective had they been played by other actors this effectiveness of acting can be seen in the opening scene at the bowling alley where the supporting characters are first introduced this scene is comprised of donny walter and the dude sitting at their lane in the bowling alley discussing the attack on the dude by some hired thugs 7min 25 sec the dude is approaching the situation in his usual lackadaisical way jeff bridges conveys the dudes overall demeanor in his laid back sauntering walk although being laid back bridges is direct in his speaking showing that the dude is not the average confused old stoner bridges facial expressions during this scene show the dude is distressed about the loss of his rug which tied the room togetherdonny seems to be an outside observer in this scene and throughout much of the film buscemi conveys his characters attention during discussion by following the flow of the conversation with his head he looks from the dude to walter and from walter to the dude depending on who is talking he may seem to be paying attention but his asking of simple questions dispels this assumption another technique buscemi uses is while he is observing the conversation he furrows his brow as if in deep thought and contemplation this look of concentration is juxtaposed with the look of confused happiness an empty smile buscemi uses when donny makes a point in the conversation these techniques which are introduced by bridges and buscemi early in the film are used throughout the entire picture although bridges and buscemi do an excellent job of introducing their characters traits to the viewer goodman superbly shows his characters inner traits throughout the conversation it is apparent due to dialog that walter is becoming upset goodman conveys this anger with facial expressions and body movement in the early part of the conversation goodman puts on a stone face to show that walter is firmly set in his position the dude begins to agitate walter as the conversation continues goodman shows this agitation by furrowing his brow leaning forward while talking and turning progressively redder as goodman continues his speaking becomes more staccato and flustered when the dude refers to one of the attackers as the china man walter continues on his tirade momentarily then quietly addresses the non politically correct nature of the dudes comment changing from this aggravated manner of speaking to a more politically correct and lower tone shows that walter has some sudden mood swings and a short fuse as he returns to his tirade quickly this scene exemplifies the acting skills of john goodman jeff bridges and steve buscemi the characters in this story have been given interesting and entertaining dialog by the writers but it is up to the actors to make the characters exude a certain feeling or trait in each of their roles the three main actors add a level of feeling to the characters that is lacking from many of the offerings of the dark comedy genre goodmans portrayal of walter as the know it all with a short fuse is downright hilarious jeff bridges steps out of his usually serious persona to portray a character as laid back as they come quite possibly the laziest in los angeles county steve buscemi is as entertaining as ever his depiction of donny the character to rarely speak adds depth to an otherwise bland side character after viewing this film one can see why actors who can actually practice their craft are worth their weight in gold,black_comedy
the coen brothers joel and ethan are the most innovative and perhaps the best filmmakers working today or they at least rank along side the likes of martin scorsese and rising director star quentin tarantino think about it blood simple was the best film of 1984 raising arizona was the best film of 1987 millers crossing was the best movie of 1990 barton fink was the best movie of 1991 and fargo was the best movie of 1996 now comes their latest effort which while it isnt in quite the same league as the above films is still one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies of 1998it tells the shambling story of a man named jeff lebowski who calls himself the dude jeff bridges the dudes apartment gets broken into and a thief urinates on his rug he finds out that the criminals were not looking for him but looking for the other jeff lebowski the disabled millionaire played by david huddleston thats all i can tell you the rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words but its bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the wordsstill what ill remember most about is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lieabout who just wants to be left alone john goodman is the real comic gem here as the foreverloudmouthed walter the dudes bowling partner and best friend steve buscemi costars as the dimwitted bugeyed donny the third bowling partner theres a small but interestingly offbeat spot for julianne moore and john torturro stops in as jesus the bowler for what is probably the best walkon performance in years if you are a coen brothers fan or like humor that is distinctly offbeat you have found your movie as a rather avid moviegoer i found the film to be a great excersise in pointless extremeties and respectable raunch rated r 117 minutes 10 out of 10,black_comedy
the coen brothers did it again just when i had lost my hope of seeing a new good american movie i went to see this it absolutely blew my mind now ive seen all the coenfilms and id have to say that this is one of the very best its about this guy the dude excellently played by jeff bridges who gets an unexpected visit from two thugs who soil his carpet this event triggers a kidnappingdrama filled with black humor and crazy characters id recommend this film to everyone with an open mind and a twisted sense of humor perhaps thats why i liked it so much,black_comedy
i like nonmain stream flicks  blue velvet boxing helena and so on i like comedy that is not dependent on stupid sight gags or scatological humor this movie had been out for a few years before i watched it it was i had heard a gem that was waiting for me i had looked forward to it greatlyi didnt find any aspect of the movie funny other than the enigma that its well liked by manyi suppose this is where i differ from most  i dont find a guy walking around with a mixed drink all the time funny i dont find dan conner overreaching as a guy who is a vietnam vet freaking out about anything funny particularly because thats been done before i dont find the italian guy acting fooling while bowling to be funny i dont find referencing a guy as the dude with article obligatory to be funny and on and on whats funny dennis miller hes funny george carlin hes funny  not funnyi really dont have any comment on the ins and outs of the movie just not funny and given that its a comedy that to me is a fatal mistake,black_comedy
spoilers aheadi frankly do not understand why has been elevated to the point of being considered one of the best cult classics of alltime why this cult around the character of the dude one of the blandest flavorless most uninteresting comedy protagonists ever to be put on celluloid hes simply some dopey hippie who loves to hang around a john goodman cardboardcutout vietnam vet gone loco real vets should raise their fists in anger over such an overdone unfunny disrespectful and insulting characterization and a seldomlyseen steve buscemi who doesnt really do much the plot winds into so many different twists and turns and includes so many supporting characters all of whom seek the dudes bag of money that trying to understand this movie is like trying to untangle the gordian knot by hand whats the point of placing layer upon layer upon layer of weird uninteresting characters to the point that you forget what the hell this movie is about nihilist german rockers some sicko hugh hefner clone a gorgeous yet incomprehensible avantgarde artist who wants to have the dudes baby a strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort of greek chorus stop it peewees big adventure had an array of weird characters but it succeeded because it had a straightforward plot and brilliant acting and writing the coens monstrosity has little wit or signs of superb comic writing and all of their characters though weird are totally boring and flavorless for weird characters to work they must act totally offthewall and twisted beyond realism the weirdos in lebowski are actually regular and seem like a mishmash of alltooreal rejects from a yuppie coffee barwho likes this stuff i have just seen no country for old men and like lebowski that was poorly written in terms of a smooth plot and like lebowski lacked any interesting characters ill give fargo a chance otherwise the coen brothers aint reeling me in with their weird clunky movies,black_comedy
certain movies you can sort of understand why they are cult classics other films such as this one seem to be funny and intelligent because someone said it was funny and intelligent and therefore must be funny and intelligenti suppose you could find deeper meaning in this or perhaps the meaning was right there on the surface but like many of the coen brothers films that i have watched i either like them or i dontthe ones that i liked usually have a strong story behind them the ones that i dont like seem to be more of a day in the life of story about people who really dont seem to matter and about events that no one really cares aboutmaybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are but i need something deeper for intellectual stimulationfor my comedy i dont need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh cynicism witty dialogue sarcasm commentary and so on not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funnywhich is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesnt make me laugh at times a very random film with very to little no substance to it a few quirky one liners here and there but in all honesty i was more looking at the clock waiting for this film to end then i was looking at the film waiting for it to be entertainingyet for some reason it has a cult following and there it is however one should keep in mind that cults generally comprise of brainwashed individuals who really cant think for themselves anyways and generally follow wherever they are pointed to like mindless sheople,black_comedy
i recently saw an interview with jeff bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with the dude the character he plays in this movie he also noted that has developed a cult following the interviewer added some praise that together with the high rating on imdb convinced me to give this a shot early on i realized that the story was not to be taken seriously this movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches well some hardly connected at all the result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for mei did not find the dude at all appealing as a person how much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white russians i do give bridges credit for inhabiting the role john goodmans character really grated on mehis passions seem to be bowling and the f word the positives the scenes with john turturro gave me some laughs the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity some non sequiturs were worth a few chucklesi guess one persons humor is another persons tedium i found this movie to be tedious,black_comedy
absolutely unwatchable tried it twice figuring one attempt wasnt sufficienti am not offended by vulgar language but when it is such a major portion of the dialogue it had better be with good reason and to great effect neither is the case herethese characters are the types of people that normal people with lives pass by numerous times a day without taking any notice there is a reason for that folks like that are uninspiring dull and generally useless to the world they inhabit centering a movie script on them is going to make you a dolt or a genius depending how sycophantic your fan base is it seems too many people checked their good judgment at the door  not only giving this movie a free pass but pumping up the votes to the extent that this turd rates in the top 250 whoa geezagain i say absolutely unwatchable,black_comedy
the title sounded funny actors julianne moore jeff bridges ok at first glance it looked promising i really thought that i was going to have such a great time watching a comedy movie with great actorsthis movie has the great rating the prominent actors that i much enjoy watch in many of their great performances it seemed that it automatically was going to be a great comedy so i sat there waiting and waiting for the next great scene that never came up i just felt that i wanted to laugh but could not needless to say i did not get this movieall the topics were funny but did not click together the rug the same name the unusual nickname the kidnapping of the girl i mean jeff bridges and julianne moore can do way much better i would not have waisted my time,black_comedy
this film was supposed to be a comedy and i admit that the very last scene was funny but the rest of the film had no humor the tremendous dependence on a single expletive and its many forms became dull and boring after the first five minutes during which it was used about 100 times the two scenes in which a topless woman appeared were obviously inserted just so she could be shown but there was no point other than that one the scene in which a corvette was destroyed was completely predictable and it unfolded in a strange way and then faded awayjulianna moore was the best part of the film and joe pescis talents were wasted on a trivial part for which he clearly had no enthusiasmjeff bridges practiced in his role for his academy award as the character was identicalonce again hollywood insists that all drug usage is good lack of moral character is good drinking is good and being a bum is good if you have a heart of goldthe film was long too,black_comedy
the dude aka jeff lebowski jeff bridges is unemployed and likes to bowl he is unfortunately confused with another jeff lebowski who just happens to be very rich when a case of mistaken identity causes the dude to get beaten up and have his rug damaged he goes seeking retribution from his namesake because the rug really tied the room together manthe dudes bowling buddies john goodman steve buscemi commiserate and offer their advice while they prepare to meet their arch rival jesus john turturro in the league playoffsalong the way the dude becomes involved in a kidnapping and runs across a number of strange characters including a fringe artist julianne moore with a great throwback accent and a group of german nihilist with a marmotweird and at times muddled intentionally i think story about confused identities and bowling the actual plot owes a lot to raymond chandler detective stories and films based upon them thus we a labyrinthine plot and a large cast of eccentric charactersfeatures good performances across the board with some wonderful character work a trademark of a coen brothers film also some surrealistic dream sequences and some effective camera tricksno really deep meaning here for me but its an interesting exercise in filmmaking not among my favorites from them but it still very entertaining,black_comedy
id been nagged by friends and colleagues for years to watch this movie facepalms all around  they couldnt believe i hadnt seen one of the best movies of all timei have a 30min rule for movies if its rubbish i turn it off to avoid wasting my life on a bad movie as this one came with such a high regard i gave it a full hour and then was forced to turned it offdont ask me how it ended it was so dull and boring i really dont care it was slow i found myself falling asleep and ive never before watched a comedy with no laughs reading the other reviews i wonder if we were watching the same moviei watched street fighter the legend of chunli earlier this year just for fun as it had such poor reviews and ratings sadly i enjoyed it more than this classic whoever invented the dark comedy genre should be put against a wall and shot,black_comedy
how can anyone not dig the dude in a world where energetic gogetters are idolised and looked up to its nice to know that there are fat indolent scruffy pot smoking beer drinking bums out there taking it easy or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential it doesnt matter its just a mere device to set the dude on his way the joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in los angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since withnail and i therefore its the perfect film to just sit back and absorbpicking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility but youd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the malibu police chief i dont like your jerkoff name i dont like your jerkoff face i dont like your jerkoff behaviour and i dont like youjerkoff and then to cap it off he throws his mug at the dudes head brilliant and making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws the dude out of his cabbut another favourite is jesus he only has two scenes but both are hilarious i hope the coens make the passion of the jesus and i love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that hes a pederast especially good is the way that a large bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door i always crack up at the breath jesus takes when he sees the man  i also noticed for the first time that jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans hes not a small guybut then theres the scene where the dude first meets maude lebowski excellently played by julianne moore im sorry if your stepmother is a nympho but and i also like the little dig at the porno film theyre watching the plot is ludicrous but the comment isnt really aimed at the porno film the film is talking about itself it knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesnt matter  its best to just let it wash over youmentioning porno has reminded me of jackie treehorn is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than the dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection well maybe there is because even earlier in the film theres the moment where the dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down pure genius and jackie treehorns brainless goons are brilliant too youre not dealing with morons here oh yes we are but the films all the better for itbut im not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again its almost impossible to pick just one but i still jerkoff manually would have to be up there as would virtually every line walter spews the chinaman is not the issue however if i was forced at gunpoint to choose id have to go with a piece of dude wisdom fortunately im adhering to a pretty strict uh drug regiment to keep my mind you know uh limber and the dudes reaction when maude tells him that shes trying to conceive is magnificentyet another brilliant scene is the larry scene walter and the dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them so walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car now at this moment i could quote the real dialogue but the tv version dialogue is perhaps even better do you see what happens larry do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the alps its even better than fun you melon farmer then there are the nihilists we believe in nothing lebowski nothing and tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson but try as they might to intimidate the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to well that and their obsession with the male memberbut i could quote lines from the big lewbowski all day i just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face its stupidity is remarkably intelligent plus in the end its actually quite heartfelt  if the films about anything its about friendshipwell that and smoking pot drinking beer bowling and keeping hold of your johnson yeah the worlds a better place with the dude in it,black_comedy
i have just written one review but this awful movie deserves one this is absolutely incredible but seems that lots of people liked it i did not found anything funny in it nor action nor story nor the way the story is told nor the script that is horrible this is a flat movie without any depth the most superficial movie i have ever seen you simply cant find any knowledge nor inspiration nor entertainment in it it is a great black hole youll only spend time watching it there is no way to found something interesting in this movie except some seconds in a bowling scene i cant find any interesting point of interest in this movie and the hilarious part is that it was recommended to me by two friends of mine there is something wrong in this world that i am not aware about,black_comedy
tbl is not a terrible movie but i apparently just dont get it my ladyfriends daughter is always telling her that she should see tbl in order to understand some of the inhumor and comments of her generation i kept telling my friend that i really didnt think that the movie would be what she expected but we watched it together anyway i had already seen it a couple times my friend was flabbergasted as she couldnt identify any phrases humorous scenes or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughters group use she didnt like the movie either and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommendedi feel the same way frankly this movie is boring and pretentious i love most of the coens work but not this film it goes into a category along with young frankenstein of movies about which other people make a fuss and i just dont get maybe im slowanyway if your idea of fun is watching a laidback dude drink white russians and a lot of unnecessary onedimensional characters get layered on go ahead its just not my cup of tea,black_comedy
the coens most endearing film perhaps was unappreciated upon release but since has garnered a massive following jeff bridges plays the ultimate slacker dude whose sole purpose in life is to laze around in his room smoking pot or go bowling with his strange friends a militant gun lover played by john goodman and a meek fellow portrayed by steve buscemi one day he is mistaken for another man a very wealthy man with the same name by a batch of inept crooks who take his rug forcefully what follows is a bizarre offbeat tale of mistaken identity and revenge this is a typical offbeat coens film ably supported by julianne moore who for once chooses to tackle a funny role and has a hilariously surreal dance sequence with bridges,black_comedy
its hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons onealmost everything said in this film is downright hilarious and twothe f word is spoken 281 times so theres not many sentences that dont contain it 144 sentences also end in manjeff the dude lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence he has no job no ambitions and no worries his days be they weekdays or weekends are spent bowling driving around or having the occasional acid flashback his pals are walter sobchak a security expert and halfcrazed vietnam vet and donny a humble mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversationthe dude is happy with his easygoing life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the other jeff the millionaire with a troublemaking wife who owes money all over town these thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and reassert themselves by peeing on the dudes rugthis very much displeases the dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the chinaman thug responsible he decides to take it out of as its now him who owes a new rug the dude is welcomed intos mansion by brandt the butler a man so appallingly sycophantic hed make weylon smithers look bad but his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give handouts and basically tells the dude to get lostat this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of expop star nihilist thugs a powerful pornographer a dejected feminist daughter a brother seamus not an irish monk a joyriding teenager a revolting pederast champion bowler saddam hussein a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make the dudes life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting the plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across la going from limo to limo never too far from a white russian or a doobiethere are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that like me youll be acting the film out for years even on a 100th viewing youll notice dramatic ironies character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head beforethe acting is superb i am a fan of jeff bridges but he completely disappears in this film he truly becomes the dude and shows little of his recognisable self john goodman in probably the most underrated role of his career is the worlds angriest man bringing frustration and smartass arrogance to every scene though hes almost always right set well over a decade after nam and during the first gulf conflict walter seems to be suffering from perpetual everlasting posttraumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation take a look at his minor confrontation with smokey for exampleits not about plot or even characters its about a certain moment in time the early 90s and the definitive man of that time was the dude the rugpeeing just happened to occur simultaneously,black_comedy
looks like while making 1998 weird nutty outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie the brothers ethan and joel coens known for their unique and dry humor sat back laughed out loud and had fun big lebowski turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made it is funny because of the incredibly offbeat characters their weirdness flaws their interactions the surreal situations they found themselves in and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs there is the story of course which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping villainous nihilists vanguard erotic flying painter the bowler named jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the moviesome reviewers call big lebowski misfire and deranged mess saying that the story is convoluted with the characters we would not care about a bit it was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to coens fargo that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridgesfargo could be coens masterwork but it does not make lebowski any worse it was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future rewatch the time has proved the predictions wrong the dude lebowski  middleaged pot smoking white russian drinking bowling enthusiast exhippie and his friends polish catholic converted jew more jewish than tevye vietnam veteran walter with anger management problems john goodman and timid little slow sweet prince donny unusually quiet steve buscemi have become the cult figures the beloved characters for millions of film lovers of different generations not only the baby boomersthe coen brothers have made twenty films and all of them are treasure including their contribution in the 2006 anthology paris je taime ive seen all their films and i want to repeat the title of my review on their latest burn after reading  the coen brothers dont make bad movies because they dont know how their films including the cult favorite big lebowski should not be missed they are clever darkly funny and beautiful without being pretty pictures in short they are first class entertainment,black_comedy
this movie is not funny it is not memorable and it is not enjoyable its a story that reads like it was written by some pinhead with add who heavily selfmedicates with marijuana a ridiculous amount of random things happened for no damn discernible reason or even a more than tenuous connection between them i am a charter member of the jeff bridges fan club and the way he was wasted was nearly criminal and the same goes for steve buscemi the movie needed a lot less john goodman and a lot more john turturro it feels like some film student decided to ape the coen brothers if i hadnt rented this movie for free with a coupon i would feel totally ripped off something about the movie made me dodge it when it came out and all the years since but i finally decided to fill in a gap in my coen brothers movie track and now im sorry i blame all of you jerks,black_comedy
i saw this movie because of good rating and expected a good movie my expectations were torn to pieces after seeing the first 20 minutes itselfi was literally bored to death but went on expecting something at the end due to its rating but the ending was something far worst than i thought well it was nothing i only understood it was the end when the credits came up this movies is worst crap ever the summary of dis movie would be weakest plot worst acting ever use of f word for almost every second maybe more than the actual words no proper ending there isnt absolutely anything good to write about this movie the lead actor was total bullshit for review i wanted to give 010 but options started from 1 if you want to ever waste your 120 minutes your energy and totally spoil your mood please watch this movie,black_comedy
sometimes the film is so good you have to say something sometimes the film is so bad you have to say something unfortunately it is the latter in this case i finally started to watch great reviews everywhere have to watch it it is one of coen brothers movies it is rated almost five stars in amazon it is rated 82 on imdb it has to be good rightnot quite i couldnt finish it  i had to stop watching itin the beginning you see a resemblance in the style of this movie and a lot of quentin tarantinos movies i dont know if coen brothers are borrowing from quentin tarantino or if its the other way around but there seems to be plenty of resemblance to this film and tarantinos films in generalthe best coen brothers movie that they made was fargo and maybe it was so good because it was based on a true story but for this it reeked of stupiditybut without comedy it seemed to border on fantasy and improbability,black_comedy
why the heck did i tell you is not funny three times because this is once for every 50 people that told me this movie was the funniest most entertaining movie ever after years of being berated at parties and gettogethers with people spewing line after line from the movie i gave in last week and rented it wowits so bad on so many levels its hard to describe let me be very very clear its not funny at all its mildly amusing in parts but of the six people i watched it with no one laughed once not once i dont think its a spoiler to tell you the language is sickeningly bad up there with team america bad like scarface bad there is one reason and one reason only that this movie is popular college aged men or guys who wish they were college aged own the dvd and watch it repeatedly after watching the movie once and not laughing they then watch it repeatedly memorizing the movie they sit around the dvd owners sectional couch elbowing each other before each big scene almost spilling their friends beer and yelling here it is here it is hes gonna say it they then laugh at how clever they are theyre part of the dude club and they are very very special indeedthis is the most unfunny movie i have ever seen other than scarface and team america the movie contains the foulest most unnecessary language ive ever heard in a movie and overall is one of top five worst movies ive ever seen and yes this includes you tube cat movies,black_comedy
this is definitely one of the most worthless movies ive ever seen in the theater  im stunned that it has been voted in the top 250 movies which shows you that this must be a movie you either love or totally loathe as i didim not going to be like most other negative reviewers and just post it sucked and not give any reasons for that opinionid gotten a ride to the movie theater so i didnt have any way of getting back so i sat through a movie i ordinarily would have walked out ofmy main problem with this movie is the dialogue  it is laced with so many swear words yet this doesnt give the dialogue any additional kick  i have nothing against swearing in movies as long as it accomplishes something the fact that nihilists feature prominently in this movie makes sense since the whole movie is pretty meaningless  no real plot random and incoherent dialogue just a loser of a main character jeff bridges and i really didnt care if he lived or diedobviously the genius of the movie eludes me  note that i have nothing against the coen brothers i thought fargo was brilliantthis movie was awful thoughack,black_comedy
i love the coen brothers worki watched all their films and fargo was in many ways the besthowever their latest effort   i found almost unwatchable the coen brothers films have always shall we say been quirky this hasnt got in the way of good acting a great script an interesting plot a relevant musical score or excellent cinematographyhowever in this film the quirkiness got in the way of everything else the plot is awful the script is dire with the dreaded f work appearing at least once every five seconds im not antiswearing but i do get intensely bored of hearing the same dialogue over and over again the acting is uninspired  buscemi is totally wasted bridges is irritatingly whining though tuturro is great in a small part the score is unmemorable and the camerawork is dull except for the dream sequences which seem forced irrelevant and pretentiousi couldnt wait for this movie to end i also cannot believe that people honestly buy into the hype and liked this movie this is not a good movie,black_comedy
this movie is truly awful its supposed to be some legendary comedy but it is not funny this movie is just really weird and stupid literally nothing makes sense in it i hate every character except julianne moores the dude is so stupid and annoying and so is john goodman i was struggling to understand what in the world the plot was about and i never laughed not once this movies only saving grace was julianne moore she actually did a good job and i liked her character but everything elsenope 210 save your time for a much better comedy and just movie in general such as plains trains and automobiles or a million other better ones,black_comedy
its such a boring movie i wasted some valuable time watching it there is nothing funny in it and i couldnt laugh even for once even though i tried i really dont understand why this has such a good rating its such a usual hollywood story with stereotypical characters as soon as the daughter of mrlebowskithe millionaire appears you know she is going to have sex with the main character such a stupid script and the message they give at the end is just for the sake of creating some sense to what they did with the movie imdb says they need ten lines of text in a review seriously i dont think this movie even deserves a review but id take this opportunity to warn those who havent watched it already,black_comedy
the movie isnt bad but as one of the best of all time hardly the scenes were bland jokes were average and not a highlight of the coens career john goodman had a small role the movie may of been more impressive if it wasnt seen as such as masterpiece worth watching ill admit but should not be raved about like a pulp fiction 2 judge for yourself but your taste of movies would of swooped to a new low if you consider this as a 90s classic fargo o brother where art thou paris they can be remembered but this was just a standard movie to kill some time best 250 films of all time hardly feel free to comment back but dont blame me if you are utterly disappointed,black_comedy
the story is so nicely lightweight that the whole case is actually dismissible from the entire movie all those crazy antics the dude does and the stupid practical jokes that his responses make is just hilarious i really like the marmot gag and the ash spreading gag they are very entertaining the character building is also very strong the dude walter and donny are nicely three sides of a coin the lazy no good bum the overly strict and cranky hothead and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger the acting overall is quite nice jeff bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum john goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role having steve buscemi and peter stormare really adds very nicely while julianne moore and philip seymour hoffman complete the angles needed for the story,black_comedy
mild spoilersthe classic hitchcock premise of dropping an ordinary man into extraordinary circumstances and watching him go is used to terrific effect by the coens who are matched all the way by their playersthe dude a permanently stoned nihilistic hippy for the nineties who likes listening to tapes of creedence whales singing and bowling pins tumbling is attacked in his apartment by two thugs who mistake him for a millionaire of the same given name  of the titlejeff bridges as the dude excited by intermittent moments of clarity is sent on a journey through mazy plots and subplots populated by outrageous characters from the los angeles netherworld confronted by kidnap deception extortion and german nihilists desperate for cash he is alternately helped and hindered by his buddy a polish catholic nam obsessed vet who thinks hes jewish and who threatens fellow travellers who commit minor bowling transgressions with summary execution the character is played with relish and perfectly by john goodman in what may be his finest hour their bowling buddy steve buscemi is underused but sports his best crestfallen facade throughout and demonstrates firstrate comic timing as his character tries to get with the programmeis not for all tastes but if you get it is one of the most engaging and sidesplitting films around and one which is eminently quotable walter youre my friend and i love you but sooner or later youre going to have to face the fact that youre a goddam moronif you dont get it watch it again and if you do get it watch it again,black_comedy
whether you laugh during the film or not is assuredly one of the most laidback of the nineties i dont mean that by saying that its main fanbase are slackers or hippies or other but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it the plot the coens construct which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40s mystery tale the kinds of stories they get inspired by the big sleep was most likely their title goof almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends lives the dude jeff lebowski jeff bridges has a good if devoid of meaning life he bowls constantly with his crazed vietnamvet friend walter john goodman also very noteworthy and quiet friend donny steve buscemi a fine performance based mostly on reactions with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him ie john turturros jesus a highlight in the films most absurd moments enter in a group of deranged exmusicians turned nihilists which include the likes of peter stormare and flea a pornographer and a rich man with the same name as lebowski and his family and the dudes cycle is turned upside down though not knocking into his chemical intakeon top of at the core one of the most odd offthewall and creative of the coens scripts with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane the casting is near perfect if not so already its been said by the coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors and it shows because its pulled off aside from some usual coen regulars that dont disappoint bridges for lack of a better term displays his versatility in taking on this role often his roles are of the normaljoe or the businessman but what the coens see is that with the right character he can be funny and make the people around him just as funny not to say there arent serious parts in the film where hes put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot but by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset another strange surreal andor hallucinogenic bit is kicked in throw in some unique production design and roger deakins expert eye on the scenes will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety and ends up as a cult classic not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex it made back its budget during its run but not by much yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and coen fans but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or gettogether in fact id say this beats films like dazed and confused and mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger and older depends viewing crowd with its ridiculous setpieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement look at it this way think of the silliest though smartest cheech and chong or three stooges film youve seen and when filtered through a mindset thats loaded with european and filmnoir influences and youll get not to mention its one of the most quotable comedies of the 90s and has a toetapping soundtrack a,black_comedy
this is just a long boring crime movie with no mystery and fewer jokes this movie has no more comical moments than any other action movie jeff bridges is not a comedian nor funny and is insolent in his satire he is just another terrible actor riding his parents coattails the coen brother are also not comic writers frankly they are the definition of overrated writing long boring movies isnt being deep its writing long boring movies this film fails to entertain unless you are some uptight over privileged classist who has never met real people and enjoy the mockery of the lower class there is a reason this bombed the box office,black_comedy
i was quite interested in watching iti thought it would be a 2 hours of laughter marathonin the end i realized i didnt even laugh a single time the whole story is hardly bears any meaning and there were some jokes i didnt get at all one more important point is imdb has been very poor in case of judging comediesi just found monty python and the holy grail the same boring as big lebowskisodont be fooled by rating like memy rating is 1aweful,black_comedy
first of all what the fk was this i found 82 rating on imdb and movie totally sucks i am still wondering what made people liking this movie so much plot was totally stupid and very much ordinary without any extraordinary element or oneliners funny scenes acting or even photography this was way too boring and pointless movie to me and it got 82 rating  are you kidding me i think even 3 stars are higher for this boring jarring pointless stupid silly worthless wasteoftime mindsucking movie from the first scene to last scene i have watched it and thought now there would be something now there would be something but no at the end credits started rolling and i simply threw the movie out of my collection i think i should stop believing imdb rating as there are movies with 4 5 or 6 ratings and they are wonderful whereas this got 82 stars and movie cut it off,black_comedy
when i saw this movie i thought how the hell can this make the imdb top 250 when it should have been in bottom 250this film is about a pair of lazy douchebags who are supposed to make you laugh but all they are able to do is make u angry with all their useless talk then the hero gets attacked in confusion with a man of same identity and the attackers pee on his rug we are treated to his stupid talk of trying to claim the carpet from the original intended victim and the man throws him outbut unbelievably he employs him as a negotiator when his young wife is kidnappedjulianne moore in the role of a nymphomaniac looks patheticand the heros friend walter tries to be funny but he falls way short of that and makes you sleep with his boring and brainless talkand i will not talk about the end but i will say it its as stupid as the movie itself so if you want to watch this movie on basis of its high rating you will be hugely disappointed avoidable,black_comedy
yes there was a plot but for this picture to exist was only because of the actors names they were not good in this awful example of a comedy either not really a spoiler but jeff bridges finally figures out what is going on with the other main lebowski and confronts him at the end also not funny the whole movie is not that funny for listing this as a comedy im sorry i wasted my time watching and am writing this so others dont waste theirs i think i may have laughed once if that also in imdb movie synopsis it states that there were two people pissing on his rug there were not it was just one of the thugs doing the pissing i really wish people would get their facts straight really stupid movie not a funny movie at all,black_comedy
well  its my first review here  i really couldnt resist  i just watched the movie because it has a high rating and julianne moore  i really was shocked of the film  gave it 210 only because of the last scene that i felt some comedy about it  rest of the movie i saw no comedy at all  the story isnt that powerful and didnt sound interesting enough to me or maybe it could have been done better i dont know why it has that high rating or what the people liked most about it but everyone has its taste for sure  the most boring film that ive ever seen till now  its my first time to leave a movie and go to sleep then continue it later  as for its genre  its not mysterious as it looks like  not enough crime and surely not comedy i was expecting much more and i am really disappointed about it,black_comedy
the story of the dude jeff bridges is a strange one indeed content to spend his days drinking white russians and bowling with his buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi the dude is the alpha bum and ultimate passivist a case of mistaken identity is what forces the dude to react first to get reparations for his soiled rug and secondly to assist in the recovery of bunny lebowski and a torrid tale of plot twists ensues the coen brothers are master story tellers that love to tell dark tales that focus on the internal truths of human nature they do not give us heroes but instead present us with realistic characters that possess questionable morals as seen in some of their other films like no country for old men fargo and more recently the ballad of buster scruggs is no exception as every character introduced possesses some form of character flaw ultimately what the coen brothers are trying to show us theme is that nobody is perfect and that even a bum like the dude can own the moral high ground over those of higher staturethe dudes first interaction with one of these characters of higher stature occurs when he is mistaken for the other jeffery lebowski david huddleston as one of the thugs urinates on his rug the dude visits jeffery big lebowski lebowski at his mansion to ask him to rectify the situation by paying for the soiled rug even though mr lebowski is clearly at fault and morally obligated to make restitutions he proceeds to deny any responsibility for the wrongful actions taken against the dude this theme continues when the dude meets jackie treehorn ben gazzara who is the one responsible for the earlier assault at first jackie comes off as a reasonable man offering to pay the dude a finders fee for recovering the money he is owed we quickly find that this was just a setup as the dude slowly drifts off to sleep from the drugs jackie has mixed into his drink on a lesser note though maude lebowskis julianne moore character comes across as cold she appears to me morally sound however she tricks the dude into impregnating her as she does not want a father that is going to stay in the picture all of these characters are elevated members of society yet lack the same morality as the lowly dudethroughout the film the dudes character is challenged mostly by his friend walter who continues to try and manipulate the dudes decisions while making the drop off of the ransom money walter manages to botch the entire operation by throwing a dummy bag and jumping out of the moving car while driving which subsequently wrecks into a tree while the dude is inside however the dude maintains his laissezfaire attitude except with walter and remains static all through the film the reoccurring theme or motif of bowling and white russians further solidifies the dudes character as a devil may care hippie that is very much lost in time his mind is never truly in the moment at hand subconsciously thinking about bowling as evident in the two beautifully constructed dream sequences the soundtrack for the film is the whos who of 60s era music including the dudes favorite creedence clearwater revival deemed by many as a cult masterpiece shows that even the humblest vagrant can be righteous if their moral compass is true,black_comedy
this movie came out when i was 5 and yet i was still able to find it years later and relate to the dude hilariously loose and laid back performance by the lead excellent supporting cast and an all around cult classic for sure,black_comedy
i like the way coen brothers write and direct this movie he always made above average films in his history in this movie he try different thing its to make a comedy genre films but i think he specialize at character depth every movie he made such as no country for old men and true grit have very strong lead character depth in the films and he also success in the big lebowsky the characters depth portrayal dudewalterdonnynearly all of the actor and actress were very exceptional and convincingsome people said the best thing from this movie was its humor they said its clever but not for me this movie has more artistry inside the strenght of this movie definitely not from its humor but from the other things such as character performances photography rich script artdecoration and music although theyre not reach a word superb we cant compare the humor from the big lebowsky with monty python and the holy grail most intellect comedy tbl was nothing but when you see the performances it is unbelievable dude portrayal was astounding even dude was a hard role to play but he did it and the supporting all took part also the music really match with the genre of the movie the script was soft and light but its clever not too much badwords like comedy genre movie nowadaysfor me this movie has good entertaining aspect because its light easy plot to follow soft and rich script with great music and extraordinary acting if you want got entertained from your stress in the weekend watch this with your warm people friends family or couple and i assure you all will got a great experience,black_comedy
i caught this film a few years after it came out with no real expectation and thought it was ok however i had a nagging feeling that there was more to it than i first realised so i watched it again and laughed or smiled the whole way through the characters play off each other so well walter who is actually never really wrong donnie who never quite manages to get involved and the dude well he just wants his rug backas i am writing this i feel a sense of pride that i rewatched this film as quick as i did i have since found other lebowski enthusiasts who agree that it was on the 2nd watch that the film really comes togetheri could quote the film silly but that would spoil it so just watch the film if you like the coens or just quirky humorous films then this is for you,black_comedy
i am in shock that the coen brothers who are responsible for fargo one of my ten best could have written such a sophomoric waste of talent most especially jeff bridges who is given the wonderful words hey man and hey dude over and over it is as if beavis and butt head have turned from cartoon figures to real flesh and blood bridges is the dude who has been mistaken for a rich guy with the same name the wealthy mans wife is kidnapped and the dude is drafted to be the go between for the ransom payoff for her safe return the dude smokes loads of pot drinks heavily and enjoys bowling on a regular basis his best friend is walter played by john goodman as a gulf war veteran with a violent temper steve buscemi completes the triad and all three have never had so little to work with what a huge disappointment from the usually reliable brothers,black_comedy
agreed the enormously popular coen brothers are an acquired taste  and the david lynches of quirky slapstick must be considered a hitandmiss affair but diehard fans are almost always left hungry for morein the indigestible however somebody really forgot to tell the boys that offthewall just for the sake of offthewall can really be bad  like the equally indulgent and incomprehensible mulholland drive this socalled entertainment misses at every step  as spoof satire revenge comedy whatevercheck out raising arizona and fargo to see real genius at work unfortunately the bros took a total sabbatical from creative filmmaking when they locked horns on this one  i guess the success of fargo went so to their heads that they decided to test their core fans  are we now so cool and so popular that we can pass anything off as long as its weird obviously from the looks of things they can  oh please imdb people  this film is bottom 250 not top 250 material  it reminds me of the time back in the 1970s when paul mccartney wagered that he too could throw out anything musically and have the gullible public eating it up  and so he did  he composed a new pop tune using the lyrics of mary had a little lamb of all things and earned his next solid hit  ugh  i fear for the future of mankind when stuff like this happens a thuddingly dull incoherent mess that purports to be a quirky comedy jeff bridges and john goodman who play bowling teammates are the primary victims of this highway robbery  sad too because this could have been goodmans night to shine as he did in raising arizona and god bless em he does give it both barrels but what can you do when youre given blanks always the professional goodman tries to act coollike hes in on the insanity  a sleazy bridges too rolls with the punches as a pothead slacker named dude who through a series of mistaken identities finds a way of making make some quick dough involving a porno king and mobstershow can such a dazzling eclectic cast who are perfect for this peculiar type of movie fodder be so abominably misused  julianne moore steve buscemi peter fargo stormare ben gazzara and david huddleston in the title role are such pros and come off looking like rank amateurs  the last vignette with narrator sam elliott on a barstool is the capper terriblejust terriblethere are two reasons only why i gave this bomb a 2 out of 10 instead of 1  john turturro as a creepy bowler named jesus literally comes out of nowhere and demonstrates the coen brothers at full potential his freakishly hilarious scene which of course makes no sense whatsover shows exactly what can happen when the bros assert themselvesthe other reason is sentimental  much of the action takes place at the hollywood lanes on santa monica boulevard in hollywood california where i use to bowl every monday night  i loved that place as it holds many fond memories  out of nowhere the district decided to tear the place down in the summer of 2002 to make room for a school  opposers like myself felt it was a landmark and deserved to be protected  anyway its gone nowthe good news  any time i get nostalgic for the old bowling center i can always rent out  the bad news  i have to rent out,black_comedy
i have been a fan of a number of efforts from the coen brothers truthfully even when they miss the mark i am still able to find something worthwhile in the effort is the exception to that rule i originally saw it in theaters where it played for an eyeblink and received mixed reviews it was one of the few films my family has ever walked out on i caught it later on cable and watched it to the end to see if i missed anything worthwhile since it had inexplicably developed a cult following the answer was a resounding noin what can complimentary be deemed a plot the action centers on a zoned out bowler nicknamed the dude who somehow is mistaken for the title billionaire and gets pulled into what must be the most illconceived kidnapping plot in the history of cinemathe ludicrous nature of the action would seem to recommend it to comedy but the film is devoid of laughs unless the idea of a young womans body parts being sent via mail is especially funny to you the film introduces one needless and ostentatiously bizarre character after another in order to drum up some semblance of entertainment but since none of them are important to the plot and have nothing of comical worth to contribute it all seems a huge wastethe dialogue is basically thinking up new ways to drop the fbomb every 10 seconds what passes for comedy is having the avuncular narrator sam elliott actually stop the proceedings at the midway point to goodnaturedly ask the dude why he has to to use such chronic foul language to which the dude responds with another fbomb how meta how coy and to rouse viewers lulled into a stupor there are occasionally pointless unrelated fantasy sequencesjulianne moore shows up to no avail speaking in some wacko oldhollywood actress rhythm think jennifer jason leigh in the hudsucker proxy but whereas leighs impersonation had a legitimate reason to be moores quite simply does not jeff bridges can be an amazing actor and has contributed some wonderful cinematic contributions this is not one of them it seems incomprehensible that a following has cropped up around this character because the dude is little more than a cipher the dude is a completely passive nonentity who spends the duration in a zoned out state he seems to have nary an opinion on anything and it is inconceivable that anyone could mistake him for the title character much less a sentient being at all the plot careens him from one improbable and unfunny setup to another eliciting little in the way of energy or emotion from him he is just not remotely interesting herethe only appealing or likable characters in the film are elliotts narrator and steve buscemi as a perpetually sunny and helpful fellow bowler alas buscemi is basically here to be bullied brutalized cursed at and finally die if most of the cast is awash in unlikable and appalling characters the worst by far is john goodman the normally reliable goodman is so overthetop that his every moment on screen is like fingernails down a chalkboard he plays the dudes best friend a completely incompetent bully who inserts himself into everything to the detriment of all involved he drops the fbomb as much as the dude and treats everyone around him with loudmouthed contempt he is an illiterate detestable brutish bore and the performance desecrates the screen yet the filmmakers actually seem to think his antics are a riot the film is pretty awful without goodmans godawful work but with his participation it descends even further into cinematic helli cannot think of anything to say complimentary about the film and the fact that this abomination was vomited forth by otherwise talented filmmakers seems inexcusable,black_comedy
spoilers hereinthe coens shine into one of the bright zones in my film universe they are intelligent and funi believe that they first select some intellectual issue related to problems of narrative here identity then they independently select a film style to exploit here screwball through busby instead of the screwball through capra of hudsucker then they run wild with all sorts of cinematic devices always cinematic narrativeof the coen films i know this is the most fantastic in terms of shifting realities hudsucker shifted often but only into the newspaper mode of it happened one night here we have an arbitrary number of realities and levels all unstructured which is the point it is also a favorite because it has julianne doing what she and very few others does best playing a character who is acting she gives us herself as the actress the character as the actress here an abstract painter and the quite different character the character plays the femnist family anchor shes a gift that the coens know how to usethe narrative ground zero is supplied by the countertop cowboy as chorus the play within is the berkeley dream sequenceteds evaluation  3 of 4 worth watching,black_comedy
i can understand that our average bongsmoking jobless couch or rug potato american doesnt see himself represented too often in the movies at least not in a favorable light so must be appealing to a sizable portion of our population but for the rest of us this movie is painful to watch have you ever tried to listen to a gang of complete idiots chitchatting for ten minutes then go figure what it is to watch it for a full length movie the worst thing is the fact this movie was done by the coen bros and has a well known cast gives it an aura of respectability it does not deserve forget for a second the names in the credits and youre watching standard cheech  chong material and thats not a good thing,black_comedy
this has to be one of the most overrated movies ive ever watched i mean i dont hate the coens and while i think that fargo is also very overrated i love ncfom and consider it one of the best movies of this century but as far as is concerned this movie is not only not funny as it is incredibly boring and clumsy i mean i dont really mind unlikable characters but when i start wishing them to just die so the movie can end faster then i know something is very wrong or maybe thats what the directors were going for and if thats the case i can just say congrats because the totally hit the right mark i do realize people have different tastes so i wont tell anyone not to watch it maybe its better in a second viewing or while high or drunk i will never know it however because ill never watch it again,black_comedy
i would like to get the last two hours of my life back its the first time that i write a review about a movie but i cant let go this one without trying to low down the score that it has on imdb honestly its unbelievable that somebody may enjoy this crappy movie even a little maybe is for all the dudes that pretend to be cool enough to understand this kind of humor maybe the only good thing about the movie is that it has good performances but i cant believe that such good actors agreed to participate hope tomorrow i will not even remember a couple of annoying characters that gave me a nice headache dont waste your time,black_comedy
jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges is an unemployed slacker whose only interest is bowling with his moronic friends john goodman and steve buscemi he becomes involved in a kidnapping case when he is mistaken for a millionaire also named lebowski mayhem ensuesi had heard for years that this was a great movie a piece of film art from the coen brothers so much for my curiosity if you like your movies pg like i do this is a movie to avoid at all costs the main character is a disgusting slob with no redeeming qualities and the f word is used 260 times in 117 minutes the movie is vulgar and pointless i give it one star only because i cant give it zero stars,black_comedy
i like the coen bros usuallyfargo doesnt seem as great so many years later but films like millers crossing the recent and very excellent no country for old men are masterpiecesbut this should be changed to the big nothing god this movie sucks so bad it was tedious to get thru it why do people love this movie so much i thought it sucked worse than house of the dead talk about bad stilted dialog poorly staged scenes and uninspired scriptinghard to believe its the coens at all since their stuff is usually really great this movie has attained almost cult status and for what pure crap id rather watch a troma film made for 50 bucks,black_comedy
this story circulates around a bum like perpetual hippie apparently living on some kind of assets as the story makes a point of him being out of work hes a lazy viscously phlegmatic and self centered personasome hired help enters his home and almost flushes his head down the wc the reason for this is not clear but obviously they mistook him for a different guy with the same name whos enormously well off and sits in a wheelchair some kind of revenge or threat anyhow they pee on the hippie namesakes oriental rug and thus the story starts rollingnow if you know anything about rugs youd know that you can actually wash off pee its done regularly in iran where almost every home is furnished up the walls in hand manufactured rugs and carpets and where young kids might pee or worse on themthis picture on the other hand is not washable after seeing it a dozen of times i still dont get what its all aboutthe story is too blurry and unintelligible to summarizeits entertaining though and the soundtrack is greati get the feeling that the coen bros really wanted to impress tarantino as tbl could well have been a comic book story just like pulp fiction,black_comedy
this movie is sort of like a circus minus the clowns and the freak show everything about it is attractive and entertaining the characters are deep and interesting and even the most minor of characters have their own unique personality the camera work is ingenious as are the visuals and costumes the comedy comes in from all sides whether subtle witty or straightforward the coen brothers use stereotypes and wording like van gough used a brush it is one of those few movies where almost every line is quotable and easily recognizable unlike most comedies if you could call it such the story is both followable and enjoyable one of the true masterpieces of our time if you dont like this movie im sure you hate to laugh,black_comedy
trust me i am a very open minded film viewer and have enjoyed a vast variety of movies this film however was a complete waste of timei got what was trying to be achieved with the movie but it just didnt get any where near where it was supposed tosorry folks a terrible movie that had good intentions but bad guidanceit seems this was a movie that tarantino would have got a few ideas from but then made a so much more enjoyable film i was just sitting watching it getting more bored and tired by the minutethis film has a serious false rating,black_comedy
i get why people gravitate towards the coens big lebowski it has a certain appeal that you dont find every day in movies while most say it has a profound wit and originality that makes it special i say is an overdone and forced film relied heavily on its weak script the dude lebowski jeff birdges mistaken for a millionaire lebowski seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it with help from john goodman as the dudes crazy friend stays away from complete failure the film never strives to do anything but portray a goofy crime story that weve seen hundreds of times not one performance feels witty or unique and the direction has zero creative input by the coen brothers the coens are masterful filmmakers theres no question its just that this film is their big flop that everyone still liked this is perhaps the most overrated movie of all time and i dont say that lightly,black_comedy
i wanted to spend my night laughing and so i skimmed through about 100 movies on imdb i came along some really funny movies but i wanted to see a really good one so i kept looking until i came across this one excellent reviews excellent rating  what more could i want i rent the movie from the store get cozy with my girl friend and wait for the fun t beginthe movie starts with a guy being a target of a mistaken identitysome bad things happento a certain extinct little funnyand the plot continues and it goes on and on and onand nothing at all is funnyby the mid of the movie me and my girl friend are both bored and pied off we couldnt take it anymore i dint watch the rest of itmoral do not watch this movie i dunno what kind of people gave a high rating to this crap,black_comedy
a highly original neonoir comedy one the greatest feats by the brothers coen great roles by all involved even the tiniest like the ones by jack kehler or david thewlis but of course jeff bridges and john goodman steal the show the story is simply a load of fun but with great attention to detail and with a perfect sense of humour the soundtrack has no striking carter burwell theme this time he only did that technopop thingy near the end but it consists of various songs and themes aptly chosen to befit the required mood from classical to country or pop music and so on  i just discovered theres even a little bit played by the dutch koninklijk concertgebouworkestapparently there are some folks even who dnt like this film or just dont get it but i certainly dont feel like the good lord gypped me because sometime theres a film sometimes theres a film  kinda lost my train of thought here but aw hell11 out of 10,black_comedy
is the 7th film written produced and directed by the coen brothers the script was written in the early 90s around the time they released barton fink in the meantime they wrote produced and directed the box office bomb the hudsucker proxy as well as the critically acclaimed and oscar awardwinning fargo they waited as long as they needed to get jeff bridges and john goodman in the cast and it paid off big timesimilar to the big sleep takes a convoluted plot to extreme measures both films include a wealthy handicapped millionaire promiscuous young women blackmailers and pornographers both films make us connect characters to one another and piece together a scattered plottaking a large step back from everything that happens in the story is essentially about nothing there is no money in the briefcase there is no hostage the nihilists believe in nothing except money the dude is not seen bowling the dude has no job and we dont know how he makes an income walter uses shomer shabbos as an excuse to do nothing on saturday even though hes no longer jewish the only reason the dude gets involved with lebowski is due to his rug and agrees to work with him for just a small portion of the ransom from the beginning the dude walter and maude assume that bunny kidnapped herself to extort money from lebowskithe bowling alley is the safe haven for the dude and his team walter takes the bowling league very seriously he threatens a bowler with a gun for stepping over the line and gets him to mark zero on his scorecard when bowling rival jesus quintana john turturro confronts the team walter reminds them hes a sex offender that exposed himself to an eightyearold throughout the story the dude shares his news to walter and donny at the bowling alley the mysterious man most likely overhears their conversations which is why he can narrate the dudes story hes seen talking to the dude at the bowling alleys bar and appears again at the end he never introduces himself but sam elliots resonant accent and thick mustache make his character memorablethe script is very funny and explicit the dude and walters dialogue often clash but it doesnt get in the way of their friendship the script was written specifically for jeff bridges and john goodmans characters jeff bridges is perfectly cast as the dude hes often misunderstood and spacing out in his own world unlike previous coen brothers films with steve buscemi donny can barely get a word out before walter tells him to shut up julianne moore puts on an interesting accent as maude that isnt distinct to any one place maudes giggly assistant abstract artwork and sexual nature make her one of the funniest characters in the film shes the centerpiece of the gutterballs dream sequence as a sexy viking surrounded by bowling pin dancersthe soundtrack is great and its referenced throughout the film the dude and walter are listening to creedence clearwater revivals run through the jungle when delivering the briefcase the cops who look for the car are worried the tape deck with creedence would be stolen and are relieved when they find it still there the song used in the opening credits the man in me by bob dylan is used again when maude knocks out the dude and takes back the rug they play the rolling stones song dead flowers by townes van zandt after donnys deaththe directing by coen brothers is very well done many of the cast members are reoccurring from previous films theyve directed the films structure was influenced by detective fiction writer raymond chandler the cinematography by roger deakins made the scenes look contemporary with the time period and the dream sequences to look bizarre deakins worked on previous coen brothers films such as barton fink and fargo as well as the shawshank redemption the editing is impressive especially during the dream sequences the firstperson camera shot inside the bowling ball as it rolls down the lane for a strike looks very sharp they use pan and zoom shots frequently to go from a wide view of the setting to the subjects they use long takes the most impressive coming in the final scene that finishes with a strikeat the time was one of the coen brothers highest budgeted films at 15 million it grossed just over 46 million worldwide can be enjoyed on many viewings and it succeeds as both a comedy and a crime film i highly recommend this film to adults44,black_comedy
great comedy great story great characters and great acting i really love this movie and i have seen it over ten times ill be watching it again soon and i advise if you didnt like it to try and put yourselves in the shoes of jeffrey lebowski and imitate him for the duration of the movie thanks,black_comedy
every so often i need to watch this movie at first it was because i would be in need of a laugh now its like chicken soup for the soul i will admit first time i watched it i thought it was ok but it needs a second viewing a deeper viewing thats when you will realise how much you love itits a film filled with career best and loveable performances particularly from jeff bridges john goodman and an insane performance from john turturroalso sam elliots stranger is the standard that all narration should be held to his final speach in this movie makes me smile and cry at the same time i can only hope that someone will say something as beautiful at my funeral,black_comedy
recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release remains on the highpoints of the coen brothers remarkable career of excellence their farcical homage to raymond chandler stars jeff bridges as the dude whose real name jeff lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake played by david huddleston blackmailers come to the wrong address rugs are pissed on and threats are made eventually chooses the dude to be the bag man for the ransom drop off a decision that all involved soon come to regret twenty years has allowed me to watch a few times and to be fair its a film that improves with each watch the plot is nothing special in fact its almost nonexistant the character revolve around each other and at the end of it youre no wiser as to who if anyone actually kidnapped bunny tara reid or what happened to the 1m dollars  but you come to appreciate that the plot isnt as important as the characters and what characters they are jeff bridges gives a career best performance as the dude mumbling and maning his way through the film which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of it is one of the funniest most quotable movies of all time full of the coens regular acting troop some of whom show up for just one or two scenes make their memorable mark and then are never heard from again it is a stone cold classic and well still be watching it in another twenty years,black_comedy
the storys message is very simple as in all coen brothers movies the symbolism is so subtle and exquisite as in all coen brothers movies and every character with or without an arc or a subplot has a thing to do in the movies plot or at least make you appreciate the movie even more than you do but despite all that the redundancy of using the allegory by using many characters and subplots with the fast pacing could make you feel the movies story is very sophisticated and convoluted even its not also i found some characters havent been merged well with the plot even they are very meaningful like the rest of the characters as i said that being said these issues didnt bother me at all as i was so invested in each character and i really enjoyed every second in the moviejeff bridges maybe give the best performance in his career its really a shame he didnt get an oscar nomination for his vivid and stellar performance in john goodman was great and he had a wonderful chemistry with steve buscemi as well as with jeff bridgesphilip seymour hoffman didnt have a lot of time on the screen but he was so hilariousroger deakins did an awesome job as usual and crafted not just a beautiful cinematography but also a very smart and shiny one that has aged and will age very wellthe soundtrack maybe is one of the best soundtracks ever put to movie its a very very underrated oneis a delightful ride its one of the best coen brothers movies and hands down its the most coen brothers coen brothers movie8510,black_comedy
the funniest part of this down and outers comedy is that i know several guys that if you took and rolled them into one they would equal the dude jeffrey lebowski thats pretty scary i dont even think that they have seen the movie but who cares jeff bridges is so stinking versatile i cant believe it from a reellive slacker extraordinare to 1998 a reelpresident the contender 2000 with out skipping a beat for all intensive purposes this movie would be a real waste of time but this was a side splitting whimsical good time from julliane moore as the egocentric emotionallysterile maude who was a suspicious investigator to the best friend goodman whos religious nationality changes because of his ex who dumped him cold but as long as he can bowl with the dude all his other shortcomings just seem to go by the wayside but through it all he goodmans character was a loyal buddy to jeff and a decent friend even if he could acquire fingers by 300with nail polish in all fairness though lebowski as a private investigator reminds me of a quote from dirty harry where harry states after the demise of a man who is a victim of his own stupidity and greed a man should know his own limitations and in this case having jeffrey investigate is just as swift as letting the fox guard that ole hen house this was a slackers delight and watching someone who is as good a player as bridges play a tremendously convincing loser is just a rare treat in the comedy section this one is an ever so often player just one that you havfta see every now and again i dont know who he studied but if i didnt know better i would swear that he got together with my two old school buds ,black_comedy
can someone explain what was funny about this movie  i know i am in the minority but i just dont get it  i found it predictable and annoying i just wonder what i missed  anyone have a clear explanation ,black_comedy
is it supposed i have to laugh with the most ridiculous and stupid characters ive ever seen i hope not id say its the most stupid movie ive ever seen there is no hidden humor or smart comedy everything goes around the big dude or id say the big asshole the movie itself is a comedy it is a parody of a comedy i have no clue why people loved this movie so much i start seeing the movie because of that and ive to say it was a complete disappoint how someone can laugh with such a bad movie no clue if someone can explain me that id really appreciate it the big fraud the big piece pf crap the big plot without any story all of them would be really nice names for this movie make yourself a favor and dont miss your time seeing this movie,black_comedy
i saw this movie when it first came out and thought it was hip funny original quirky and cool as did so many of the gushing reviewers who have commented already the problem for me is that this movie is not classic material because it does not age well in fact i could not watch more than ten minutes of it on the second attempted viewing perhaps the problem was the fact that i lost count of the number of fbombs in the first few minutes when the opening dialog would be incomprehensible if all the obscenities were bleeped you know you have a problem when the slutty wife of the rich lebowski as opposed to jeff bridges character offers a blw job for 1000 its no longer funny to me  it just makes me squirm perhaps i am just becoming stuffy as i grow older but i dont think so i think i have a better appreciation of quality and this movie aint it,black_comedy
when a case of mistaken identity results in a chinese man urinating on the rung of jeff the dude lebowski the dude looks to his millionaire namesake to compensate him  when the mans young wife is kidnapped the dude is brought in to help drop off the money and get her back  however when things go wrong he begins to see it is not as simple as he was led to believealthough they can often be too clever for their own good well sometimes  not often this is one of their cleverest and most imaginative out and out comedies  the plot is unnecessarily complicated but only serves to give the film a larger than life feel as one unusual event follows another unlikely one  while it all very much comes to naught the delivery is the key  in terms of laughs it is lighter than one might expect from a comedy in the imdb top 250 however it delivers a constant state of amusement as well as some laugh out loud moments  its just not that type of humour is allhowever the dialogue is very quotable and funnier the more you know it and understand the lines  what makes it feel much more imaginative is the many inspired scenes that run through the film  mostly dream sequences set up as big musical numbers  but also the sheer weight of unusual characters who come to life so easily and are very funny to watch  part of this is with the cast of course and they all pretty much do a good job  bridges is simply made for this role and fills it so easily  goodman gives a great performance and steals many of his scenes while buscemi does good work but in a much different role  character actors like huddleston hoffman and stormare all give good support while turturro is incredibly memorable despite only having a few minutes of screen time  i wasnt sure about moore but she was ok and didnt slow things too much for meoverall this is one of the coens most enjoyable comedies to date  i know intolerable cruelty is out soon and ill see what thats like but so far this film just has so much creative energy and imagination that although all a bit much and not a perfect film it is very hard not to enjoy,black_comedy
spoiler alerti am utterly shocked by the rave reviews this film has garnered from this site my friend asked me to watch this sickening movie and i agreed after hearing similarly rave reviews from my friends what an utter waste of time this was a few bums wandering around suburbia getting themselves into nonsensical situations and uttering obscenities every minute or so if anything this is a sad reflection of meaningless suburban existence whats with the obsession over bowling like one reviewer said this movie left me with nothingno feelings of warmth poignancy or encouragement sure there were some brilliant camera shots a handful but not enough to sustain a movie the dream sequences were just bizarrelike something a stoned artist would dream up again the setting of the movie boring suburbia did not help bolster my interest level dear me there were times when i felt like stepping into the movie and bazookaing all the characters just so it would end i was unmoved by the movie and completely bored out of my wits 2 out of 4 of my friends left halfway through the movie wisely enough the series of revelations oooh aaah at the end were trite and unsatisfying we all have our own opinions on this movie but please and 80 is way more than what this stinking mess deserves movies like this are the result of a culture that has become so saturated with material wealth prosthetic beauty and glamour that triteness and meaninglessness along with gratuitous violence and obscenity become glamorized,black_comedy
those wacky and weird coen bros have come up with another off the wall masterpiece offbeat comedy crime thriller is a phony business magnatebenefactor legless war hero who hires the lesser and seemingly loser dude lebowski to deliver the million dollar ransom for his kidnapped young wife bunny tara reid the turn over of the ransom goes wrong and the bigger lebowski accuses dude of stealing the million the much underrated jeff bridges plays the part of dude a laid back junkie bowler to a tee his best friend walter sobchack is played by john goodman in one of his best roles to date in his quest to retain the ransom dude encounters a bunch of nihilistsa ticked off and thoroughly nasty malibu police officer and the daughter of lebowski played by julianne moore the well meaning sobchack manages to vandalise a brand new sports car to the chagrin of the real owner the third part of the three stooge type bowling trio is played by the ever fluent steve buscemi ben gazzara is the smooth operator of a playboy type mansion and look out for the cameo role of sam elliott as the stranger,black_comedy
i am thinking to myself what are you people watching for those who found this film in the slightest funny this was bad just plain bad the only positive comment i would have is with turturros character he is the sole standout i found myself getting very upset and hating bridges and goodmans characters if this was the directors motivation then they succeeded big time i think that the actors  buscemi turturro and hoffman  all got lulled into a false sense by the success of the directors previous film  fargo what a shame and bad move the film totally misses its point of being this offbeat quirky comedy i cant say it enough it was painful watching goodmans character say the same stupid line to buscemi  over and over a complete waste of time,black_comedy
that i think to be nothing more than a piece of crap this is one of those films you pulp fiction was about nothing but it was interesting nothing whereas this is about really nothing and it sucks at it this film is neither funny nor exciting nor anything that represents a state of entertainment this film sucks ill never understand its rating a 77  i think the reason for the rating is that it was made by the coen brothers why they get so much good ratings for their films hell i dont know i though this was crap fargo was only average and o brother where art thou was pretty good nothing to make a fuss about in a good way was ever made by the coen brothers2 out of 10,black_comedy
here are the highlights of the opening scene with jeff bridges as a neverdowell being comically ambushed by two men in his home one of whom urinates on his living room rug mr bridges again dropping a joint on his crotch while hes driving and careening into a trash can mr bridges yet again babbling absolute nonsense trying to fake his way out of a jam mr bridges yes he being bonked in the head with a ceramic mugyou would think that these moments coupled with the fact that mr bridges plays the lead would make a deliriously funny comedy but alas its just valiantly unsuccessful for mr bridges is far more interesting than the dopey character thats been written for him by his directors the muchlauded joel and ethan coen and those highlights were predominantly jabs of slapstick the only truly funny moments in the film much more than the pseudoinsights of american culture and pornography another great moment this one featuring john goodman has him bashing up a wouldbe perpetrators car with a crowbar only to have a neighbor the real owner of the car come screaming out of the house taking the crowbar and bashing in mr bridgess car insteadin other words when the writerdirectors go for simplistic and oldfashioned slapstick coupled with their terrific widescreen techniques and misc en scene really works its the rest of their pretentious sense of humor that does not work for once again they have nosedived into a pool of complexity stretching out for something they dont quite have the understanding to reach they have the ideas what they lack is the patience to compose it in a way that not only communicates their ideas to the audience but make it fascinating at the same time for example they add some pornographic subtext to the game of bowling they might just be the only filmmakers to ever do that but what exactly it means comes up very fuzzily as is the showstopping moment where mr bridges goes into a druginduced hallucination with him and julianne moore in an unnervingly peculiar bowlingsex extravaganza what exactly do i mean im not sure and i am not about to watch the film a second time because it had me restless thirty minutes inmr bridges does a nice enough job playing a character so sloppy and whiny that it borders on the ridiculous and not in a good way its funny to have him cry out im the dude the first few times but when it happens again and again for two hours it really wears thin as does john goodman screaming at steve buscemi shut the expletive up donny speaking of mr goodman he pours a lot of energy into his role and i guess i cannot honestly say his performance is bad but it became tiring seeing him oncamera after a while the fault lies in the character who is much too obnoxious and redundant to be funny mr buscemi gives a much more likable performance for a much more likable character but is hardly on screen how sad is that well not his denouementsurround these characters with a lumpy story far too complicated for its own good and youve got a dull picture is clearly aiming to make commentaries of such as demonstrated by sam elliotts outoftheblue appearances here and there in the picture but they become lost in a pretentiously muddled screenplaythe coen brothers are good directors they have great craftsmanship a key moment is when the camera takes a bowling balls pointofview as it thunders down a lane slowmotion shots of the pins scattering though gimmicky and seen before are also fun to look at so they can direct they have talent immense talent but they really do need to hire somebody to rework their screenplays for that is where they fall short more often than not come the end of i was not pondering over what sam elliott had just said in his closing speech and what it had to do with all that happened in the two hours before but instead thisin the scene where mr bridges and mr goodman are having a wouldbe sentimental moment by the ocean who was that character i saw walking on the hill crest in the topright section of the screen,black_comedy
browsing through the other reviews here on this movie i am astounded to find that a seeming majority think it is some sort of masterpiece i may be obtuse but i found little to recommend itjeff bridges does a credible job portraying the dude a shiftless wastrel obsessed with bowling and avoidance of responsibility despite his considerable talents and efforts bridges never quite succeeds in evoking any interest in this lame character from the viewer john goodman is obnoxious playing the john goodman character the aggressive supposedly lovable slob steve buscemi is wasted as donny an apparent moron with attention span problems then we have hollywoods most overrated actress julianne moore who assaults our eyes with her grotesque naked form right from the door david huddleston usually a reliable character actor is here reduced to a whiney old fartthe movie still had a shot but the coens decided that it would be nice to have no plot no humor and no compelling reason to watch the screenthis is the kind of movie that makes one desire to reach into the screen and just smack them a thorough waste of time with apparently no redeeming qualities whatsoever,black_comedy
is simply a joy to watch and gets better with every viewing theres simply so much to see from the absurd musical sequences to the sociopathic behavior of john goodmans character walter sobchak just trying to make sense of the convoluted and completely ridiculous plot is a game onto itself the movie has an enormous amount of quotable lines and the dialogue is some of the coen brothers finestthe characters are all imaginative and memorable with jeff bridges and john goodman wrestling for the best part goodmans walter sobchak is easily one of the most unsympathetic and frankly crazy vietnamvet characters in cinema what with him constantly referring to his battles in vietnam or spouting obscenities at everyone in sight but bridges the dude is just as charming writing a cheque of 069 crashing his car after dropping a joint on his lap and constantly drinking white russians even the small characters like the sidesplittingly hilarious jesus quintana the police chief of malibu or the black taxi driver you will laugh at time and time again the amount of small but memorable characters is almost too much to countthe movie has some issues though because of the narrative being so convoluted and not being the point anyway the film feels at times like a series of isolated sketches than a consistent whole it can also be very confusing for first time viewers who will try to follow the plot to fully enjoy this movie one has to be in a certain mindsetrecommendation like all coen brothers films is not for everyone but for those who enjoy this sort of comedy finding a better film of this sort is hard,black_comedy
the coens are fully capable of making great films  this isntone of them  its imaginatively directed and the performancesare fine  but the story is so meandering and odd that it justdoesnt work  the coens are willing to risk oddity in search ofexcellence and it frequently works fargo was a masterpiecebut here it just seems muddled and pointless  i give it a 5 outof 10,black_comedy
i thought the movie was pure crap it wasnt worth the dollar i paid to rent iti am a vietnam vet and have many friends that are the same and i dont know anyone like the goodman character john goodman plays a major screwup  totally unbelievable that someone could be that stupidthe character played by sam elliot should be ashamed calling dude a hero a man for our times in the times we live in where the world is going to hell in a handbasket we need not immortalize a character who is a dope smoking booze swilling careless jobless wreck as a hero the coen brothers need to get out of their hollywierd environment and get a grip on whats real in our society the fantasy scenes with dude flying through the air and the bowling sequence are interesting and point out the best thing you can say about this movie  someone must have been on drugs who created it,black_comedy
i honestly dont understand why anyone would want to see this movie it manages to be simultaneously obnoxious ridiculously stupid and incredibly mindnumbingly boring all at the same time if one is fond of toilet humor and a seemingly endless stream of swear words coming out of the actors mouths then i suppose this movie might be appealing but i dont see the attraction the plot of the movie is virtually nonexistent and the dialogue is horrendous mostly consisting of the fword by far the most obnoxious character is walter played by john goodman whose incessant uttering of the phrase am i wrong began grating on my nerves within the first twenty minutes this movie is while perhaps not the worst movie ive ever seen definitely near the bottom of the barrel,black_comedy
all the guys at work said i just had to see this movie i was really looking forward to seeing this movie i know i know i should have seen it years ago but anyway i started watching it and made it about 15 minutes into the movie every other word starts with f thats just stupid what could have been a good movie was ruined for me i always thought bridges and goodman were great actors but since ive seen them in this my opinion has really dropped i would have thought theyd have standardsi dont know if the plot or ending is good i cant watch it that far theres no reason for a script to be like that im glad i didnt spend any money to see it,black_comedy
something about an aging hippie called the dude who is hired to find a woman whos kidnapping was faked and who was supposed to be ransomed with fake money but none of that has anything to do with the film which makes fun of just about everything fake or genuineamong the targets of the coen brothers jibes i was able to identify political correctness movies about private investigators busby berkley njinsky the psychedelic subculture pornography celebrity the ritual solemnity of funerals sage old westerners cf curly in city slickers the military mentality the violent gangs of terrorists with german accents that insist on turning up in action movies hippies and malibuthe acting is just good enough with jeff bridges and john goodman fitting nicely into their roles heres an example of some wit from the dialog bridges is a private investigator he finds his car being broken into by a stranger pulls the man out and threatens him wait the other guy shouts hes a private investigator too just like bridges a brother shamus brother seamus like an irish monktheres a lot of malice in this film but its undercut by a gentle easygoing presentation that embodies a certain offkilter charm and is more likely to lead to smiles than either outright laughter or selfrighteous resentment i forgive it its occasional misdirectionits not a masterpiece but its certainly an original piece of work and it probably ought to be seen for that reason alone if not for any other the mba committees that are currently grinding out the supersonicburgers in hollywood should be the first in line they need the lesson,black_comedy
i first stumbled onto this movie in 1999 and happened to catch it again recently and it just still makes me want to grab a glass pour that kahlua and add milk and vodka to join jeff bridges for oat soda and a slacking good time of a convolutely escapist and trashy experience with the odd character heroes of la but this film is not as great a film as it is rated as it lacks truly redemptive qualities of reconciliation or say tying together a greater purpose behind it let alone a great plot like say its parallels with raymond chandlers 1939 novel the big sleep of which it does no justice to in being loosely related however in another sense its greater purpose can be looked at differently that since its the ultimate slacker film it has no need for a greater purpose in the first place but thats just like my opinion man lets say just like the rug that held the room together bridges the dude in an oddly engaging way was the only thing that held the film together for me and save also for an unbelievably spaced out and unconventionally witty and nihilistic which is ironic considering the brilliant coen brothers seemed to be mocking nihilists script not the plot the film is one of the most antiestablishment in terms of relativismof course there is a certain sad genius to it all owing in some sense to the elements that lie in the films references to double crossing and pseudo complications of course with updated timelines 1991 sadm and iraq and antiyuppie achievement ethos coupled with unconventional heroes that is complete with the standard issue oddball fest of characters in coen bros parlance they seem to be competing with fellini for numbers of colorful characters this films best bits are in fact not the parallels with the big sleep but its unpredictably predictable plot directions which may be part underbelly psychological black comedy and part pseudo film noir laced with double entendres the plot is not the main steal rather its almost a straw man as it is just a vehicle for the hilariously zany dialog between characters to platform itself want to know just how insane the dialog was read the memorable quotes from the film on the internet there are even parallels in this film that might lead some to speak of a religion in dudism and its enlightenment of nonideals and i bet there are some crazed converts out there right now lost in its futility nonetheless because of these slacker ideals and the dudes apathy or value system relativism toward life and however i feel about the futility of it all obviously the dude character must have been classic enough to warrant such attentionin the story the dude obviously steals the plot for without him there is no impetus after all the plot is that he is forced out of slack jawed bohemia as a result of his rug getting micturated on by a pornographers thugs whose boss wants cash owed by the young trophy wife of a rich tycoon who is his namesake hilarity ensues under series after series of incredulous circumstances when the dude asks the bigger lebowski for compensation and in turn gets the big l offering a cash job for him the dude loses the cash only to find he the had been duped in a ringer for a ringer when the paraquat tycoon wanted his porn acting wife dead and handed him an empty briefcase the dude assumed the wife kidnapped herself and then later discovers that nihilists want a share of the money and are out to kill him big ls daughter gets acquainted with the dude as she opposes the plan and a pi trails the dude looking for the wife who in the end had just gone away for the weekend in a shock hitchcockesquire secondary macguffin on top of the basic macguffin of the rugsome unique film techniques are also used in this film including blending soundtracks from previous scenes by way of songs being played on radios or having dialog repeated such as when the dude constantly rehashes phrases he heard in the previous scenes from julianne moores character bushs speech etc one of the most quirky bits of the film can be described by a phrase from the dude yet again occasional acid flashbacks spaced out hallucination scenes where the cannabis smoking dude flies through the bowling lane or over la making the bricolage plot even more colorful is the character of walter played brilliantly by john goodman who is a highlight of the film representing a vietnam scarred war veteran who associates events in the world with the horrors he has experienced yet what is interesting about walter is that it seemed he is modeled as a possible cross between the jewish german walter kaufmann the irony again and an anarchistic gun crazy war machine a rambunctious combination that results in lines like at least the nazis had ethos and so on coen fave steve buscemis character adds the fragile dimension by asking the obvious questions and being constantly told to shut up in a reference to their previous hit fargo before dying off unceremoniously likewise many of the other characters are borderline offensive to the mainstream yet one cant help but crack up in wake of their absolutely crazy antics the visual gag that saw the dude trace pornographer jackie treehorn sketching a giant erection was an absolute nutjob and case in point the stranger has a memorable cowboy cameo just for style while da farinos scenes were a study in comedic nothingness and thats what this film is nothingness that served no purpose i mean as i said its the dude man el duderino for those who think brevity isbut most important now dont forget to sip that white russian

how can it be that a movie can make you feel betterwell will make you feel better and this is how it is honest it is ruthless and it is funnythe best part of the movie is that it combines reality with fantasy without exposing the seamsthe movie is flawless in its ruggedness the characters are strong and you know what they mean regardless of whether you might agree with them or not in this sense character complexity the movie is simple but it takes this simplicity through an exquisite path of interactions and decisions at then end you might question yourself how can someone end up in this type of situation and the answer is clear if that someone is anything like the dudeenjoy it d,black_comedy
this movie is the best i laugh every time like its the first time seeing it cant get enough of the dude in this classic film,black_comedy
has become a cult classic type film as the years have went and has been praised from fans and critics over the years described and given a breakthrough performance from leads jeff bridges and john goodman as well as sharp directing from the coen brothers the film is a comedy in nature but a lot of it isnt as funny as described there are some decent moments and some comedy comes from the chemistry of the characters but overall not many laughs as the dialogue is filled with a heavy amount of constant fbombs it becomes cluttered also with much of the dudes dialogues consisting of dude or man we do get used to it but it becomes annoying the storyline is there but as watching the film there felt as if something was quite missing as it was not as great as originally thought upon perhaps this is one of those films where it gets better on multiple viewings and for certain acquired tastes,black_comedy
its well acted i can see the absurdity in the comedy and so on thats all good but i just found it really uninteresting its a bit like dude wheres my rug but not as entertaining as dude wheres my car its certainly not that funny that id ever watch it again i fell asleep watching it thats not unusual however when i rewound it i just said nah this isnt worth watching and deleted it from the pvr im not much of a fan of anyone named bridges except for nash so that didnt help anything theyre in is usually abysmal i really cant imagine why this is regarded as a classic cult comedy or maybe it isnt and i just thought it was i give it 4 stars its not a bad film doesnt live up to the hype whatsoever and its just a disappointment to have watched it,black_comedy
im trying to be fair here and rating it 610 its a descent movie likely worth watching for most people i watched it a few years back before i really heard about it and thought it was ok i made it through the whole thing but there were parts that dragged and its also borderline depressing at times but has enough humor sprinkled in to get me through it is quirky and i can see how the cult classic gets attached due to the repetition of certain comedic themes throughout its definitely not a 1010 movie and likewise the 110 reviews are basically just a reaction to its overratingive heard a lot about how great it is since the first time i saw it and recently just watched it again since it was free on tv the second time felt just like the firstit was ok,black_comedy
its 1990 jeff lebowski jeff bridges is a lazy bum who insists on being called dude two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug they soon realize theyre mistaken theyre looking for the millionaire jeffrey lebowski david huddleston whose young wife bunny ran up a debt the dudes unstable friend walter sobchak john goodman convinces him to go see the rich lebowski for compensation for the rug later bunny is kidnapped for a 1m ransom rich lebowski asks the dude to do the ransom hand off walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong the money is stolen all the while the dude and walter is in a bowling tournament with donny kerabatsos steve buscemi maude lebowski julianne moore is lebowskis daughter who wants the dude to recover the money from the kidnappersthis is crazy coen movie this is a weird black comedy it reminds me of the craziest parts of raising arizona its a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes this is much more weird than funny i found only a few big laughs like the fking toe on the other hand it is completely unique a lot of it is weird for weirds sake its a lot of weird i get the sense that this is a great movie to have a good smoke while watching it,black_comedy
what a ridiculous farce this 1998 film is julianne moore is pretty funny with her katharine hepburn like speech other than that the film is from absolute hunger as the coen brothers again are trying to explore the obnoxious things of lifelebowski jeff bridges is confused with someone with the same last name whose second much younger wife has been borrowing money all over town when she disappears and a ransom note comes up the wealthy lebowski enlists the aid of bridges to act as a gobetween seems that lebowski was mistaken for the other and the crooks urinated on his rug to get even bridges takes the rug of the wealthier man as pay backof course lebowski and his sidekick john goodman a catholic who is divorced from a jewish woman and has adopted orthodox judaism by being a sabbath observer feel the woman staged the kidnappingthe rest of this ridiculous film is devoted to crazy plot twists along the way it wasnt appreciated when a certain four letter word was used to describe a synagogue,black_comedy
i honestly dont understand how this movie is so popular i wanted to watch it to see what all the fuss was about and i barely made it through an hour of the movie i laughed a grand total of once in the entire time and that was within the first five minutes its slow stupid and has little to no valuepossible spoiler the only redeeming scene is apparently a fantasy scene involving julianne moores character and bowling but i couldnt stomach watching any more of the movie for the sole purpose of seeing this scene it was a waste of my time and money i highly recommend not watching this movie its really not that big a loss even if it is one of imdbs top 250 movies its not worth the bother,black_comedy
i was told by many people that this was one of the best movies ever but after finally seeing it i feel a little bit stupider than when i started i think i may have actually lost brain cells by watching this trash a plot less movie centered around a total loser i couldnt seem to follow any coherent sense of a story and with an ending that resolves nothing i was left pondering what actually happened in the last 2 hours that made any sense to top it off the humor was crude tasteless and just plain unfunny i didnt laugh even once for a movie deemed a comedy stay as far away as possible all of yousuch a sad waste of two hours of my life i can never get back  ,black_comedy
i just had the unfortunate experience of watching for the first time all i can say is that im amazed at its popularity its hard to comprehend people actually like this overrated dud and claim its funny and entertaining as if the muddled and overloaded script and plot werent enough the characters arent the least bit interesting to watch jeff bridges character is an unemployed loser and for that reason alone were suppose to think hes really cool i bet slacker misfits must be the only ones who could identify with such character moreover john goodmans character is downright obnoxious julianne moore steve buscemi and john turturro are wasted in nonsensical roles plus the laughs are few and far between the cliff scene when john goodman scatters steve buscemis ashes but the wind blows them on to jeff bridges face is probably the funniest bit in the whole movie everything else seems forced the music is forgettable and if you want a better display of roger deakins cinematography i suggest you see a better coen brothers film  o brother where art thou to think this film came from the same people who brought us fargo and blood simple,black_comedy
saying this film is overrated is an understatement why are some ludicrous films rated so highly one might wonder if most of the viewership is amateur film goers or just stoned films like forest gump the wolf of wall street schindlers list or even art house ones like birdman are great films but is a big disappointment it is a disjointed and abhorrent mess sorry im using the word abhorrent here which might too big a word for most of the big raters of this film ill use simpler language for those who loved it it stinks this film made no sense and has to be one of the biggest disappointments of cinema what an odd bunch of people it would take to make such a mess it takes an even bigger odd bunch of people to love this film write rave reviews and praise it people obviously get a kick out of explaining something that isnt there a spade isnt a spade to them,black_comedy
the story of is as difficult as funny it begins with a lazy man in los angeles whos parents named him jef lebowski but he prefers if people call him the dude played magnificently by jeff bridges one evening two men come into his house and confuse the dude with jeff lebowski a millionaire where they want to steal from one of the two pees on his rug and the dude wants a new rug thats where the trouble starts his bowlingmates ronny steve buscemiand walter john goodmantry to help him but do more harm than good jeff lebowskis wife gets kidnapped and the dude has to help her back but is she really kidnapped is she really his wife and whats doing maude lebowskigreat role by julianne moorein all of this between all this adventure they have to play a tournament and might meet the incredible jesus john turturro who is a great bowler but also a pervert the movie contains hilarious scenes and unbelievable trips and is packed with great one liners the dude is an antihero who does the things his way and most of the time thats very relaxed its also relaxed for us as a viewer and the dude at some way is even inspiring maybe the coen brothers made with fargo a better movie i was caught immediately by this one and since then i seen it over and over again but i never got bored the film is based on a friend of the coen brothers who called himself the dude and jeff bridges did nothing more for to make this movie then to eat and drink the easiest preparation i ever had for a role as he said it proved that he did his preparation well and its actually strange he didnt even get an oscar nomination for it if you never like to bowl you will love it now you roll,black_comedy
ive read about 100 comments on this film and didnt find any negative ones to me thats very weird since this film only has about 5 memorable laughsyou can predict every single joke miles ahead the one with the ash in dudes face at the top spotthen that guy dies in the end what about that i didnt feel any connection to any of the characters so i couldnt care lessthis film could be funny when youre high on weed but everything is funny thenif youre looking for stupid practical joke stuff watch this otherwise dont ever bother and watch a friends rerun instead even that is more funny when you watch it for the tenth time,black_comedy
i love the cohen brothers ive seen most of their movies way more than once this one barely made it through onceall the characters were horrible i wanted to reach into the movie and clunk the dude in the head john goodmans character was unspeakably rude and stupid and offensive what a waste of steve buschemi the only part that was amusing was julianna moores character mostly because she was doing a great impression of katherine hepburn now that i think of it the dream sequences were surreal enough to be interesting especially the bit with a pov of the inside of a bowling ball my friend who recommended it replied to my objections by saying oh maybe i forgot to mention that this is a movie best watched stoned yeah maybe do yourself a favor skip this one and watch millers crossing again,black_comedy
i heard good and bad things about this before i saw it and now i know why there are some fantastic characters in this some great dialogue and funny lines favourite  this isnt nam this is bowling it has rules good acting but it doesnt add up to much in fact the explanation for things is a bit of a copout furthermore at other times the coen brothers are just lazy  ignoring their fantastic talent with words they rely too often on boring and inane swearing swearing can of course be funny here though it isnt its repetitive and dull so this is an average film imho a wasted opportunity though it does have interesting bits julianne moore even gives a dull performance and you can always rely on her try other coen brothers films  blood simple their first is possibly their best,black_comedy
is proof a screenplay doesnt need a story to make it today just create a couple of oddballs who have gloriously fractured conversations about any sort of bizarre thing throw in a bunch of random stuff and an eccentric supporting cast and dont worry if the plot doesnt actually go anywhere think caddyshack with more cursing a perfect film for regurgitating around a water cooler rather than watching on screenjeff bridges is the dude jeff lebowski who because of some confusion with another jeff lebowski whose wife owes money to a sleazy porn merchant finds himself the target of two toughs who soil his rug trouble accumulates as he seeks restitution and is recruited to help rescue the other lebowskis kidnapped wife complications ensue when the other lebowskis daughter seeks him out for a sperm donation a gang of nihilists threaten his johnson a detective trails after him in a blue beetle and stuff keeps happening to his car the worst part is the constant interference from his bowling buddy walter john goodman who sees parallels with vietnam for everything blows the ransom delivery and butts heads with a rival bowler with a sexoffender pasti dont know that doesnt read funny but the movie is funny especially when walter and the dude bicker getting this across from writing dialogue excerpts is not possible not because of the profanity so much as the delivery which is how it comes together if comedic acting got the respect it deserves goodman would have been nominated for an oscar his walter is a brilliant contrast of sudden rage and anal nitpicking the chinaman is not the issue here dude im talking about drawing a line in the sand dude across this line you do not also dude chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature asianamerican please even goodmans presence wearing puscolored sunglasses and a perpetual scowl under a buzzcut is a marvelbut goodmans brilliance is in how well he walks the fine line set by the coen brothers in a typically challenging film for actors bridges is very good too but julianne moore philip seymour hoffman john turturro and other good actors are so mannered they become annoyingalso the story lines just kind of meander with no direction like the coens are ridiculing you for attempting to care about how any of it turns out did the dude ever get a new rug did he and walter win the match against jesus the child molester what the heck was the point of the cowboy narrator if you care enough to ask such questions its like you are just the butt of the coens joke whos the ing nihilists herethe films weaknesses are evident even in the moments that shine like a trio of musical comedy numbers done to music by bob dylan and kenny rogers they are witty vibrant set pieces that come in out of nowhere and charge quickly into various cartoony bits but then meander and drizzle away lamely explained as acid flashbacks the dude keeps having when he is knocked out they dont add anything to the story but in that sense at least they are consistent with the rest of whats presentedthe coen brothers remind me of the 70s jazz popsters steely dan two arch standoffish types who are expert entertainers and creative geniuses but somewhat handicapped by their acerbic pose they dont like being mistaken for someone who cares the coens have made some terrific films like raising arizona and o brother where art thou and some overrated ones like fargo and this its a film designed to make people laugh and thats nice of them but when one of the big jokes in the film involves casually killing off one of the good guys you have to wonder whether the joke is really on you,black_comedy
i was really looking forward to watching because i am a big fan of the coen brothers work fargo was brilliant and they have done some other very good movies to but is overrated people tell me the whole plot is kind of a joke well if thats so its the equivalent of a knock knock joke although perhaps the dude is a great character the plot doesnt really go anywhere even though i though it had a lot of potential it just came off weird although the character jesus a strange man they go bowling with gave me a few laughs along with some other mildly amusing parts should certainly not be on imdbs top 250 because i was personally unimpressed by it,black_comedy
is completely good  that is what i heard from one person who recommended me this movie  more one fact attracted me  brothers coen directed this movie  but i am pretty disappointed  this movie has nice beginning but as movie was going i was becoming more and more disappointed  this comedy hasnt some too funny parts  two leading roles were quite good but plot is stupid  i couldnt believe that coen brothers directed it  there are so imaginative stupid parts  jeff bridges was totally good and thats why i like his acting  goodman was also good  i dont like some stupid details like carpet and i am disappointed with again jewish details  oh i cant believe  i am not fond of this movie  i watched serious man and this movie is reminding me on it  i am going to watch no country for old men on dvd  i hope that it will be good ,black_comedy
was supposedly inspired by the old humphrey bogart classic the big sleep but i dont see it unless every movie ever made with a convoluted plot is to be considered a descendant of it what it reminds me of is martin scorseses after hours with which it has much more in common specifically the story of an inconsequential character who gets caught up in a byzantine series of situations the other main feature of such a story is that seemingly anything bad that can happen to the character does after hours though was better and funnier i think what lacks is the frenetic pace of after hours this film just sort of ambles along amiable and occasionally very funny like most coen brothers movies it is determinedly odd in a lot of ways but so many films these days are that quality doesnt come across as terribly unique or even original jeff bridges is the perfect choice to play jeff lebowski aka dude the very definition of the term slacker dude doesnt have much of a life beyond bowling smoking pot and drinking white russians he has two close friends walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi and their socializing appears limited to bowling tournaments but bridges invests dude with a sly kind of laidback style he comes across as a very likable neerdowell somebody you wouldnt mind spending a few hours with at the corner bar or bowling alley goodmans walter is a hyper vietnam vet who lacks common sense to an astonishing degree and is completely oblivious to that fact buscemis character donny seems to exist for the sole purpose of being told to shut up usually by walter the film enjoys being weird and bucking convention here and there a sort of running gag is that whenever dude is knocked unconscious and yes it happens more than once we enter a dream sequence the best one is an elaborately staged dance number set to the 60s hit i just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in julianne moore plays an avantgarde artist with a surprise strange outlook on art sex and life in general shes pretty good too but some of the other oddball supporting characters like the three nihilists are more like something youd see in a very average saturday night live sketch has its own semiquirky meandering kind of charm and coen aficionados will probably enjoy it more than the average moviegoer its main appeal to me anyway is bridges performance he really inhabits the character of dude and its a lot of fun listening to him deliver the droll stoner dialogue throughout that alone makes the film worth checking out,black_comedy
the american young man who fought in vietnam yesterday became now a 40yearsold hippie allthetime stoned unemployed bum who lives the crazy world of the early 1990s america as what exactly  the possible hero of this very world  how is that  thats the knack and the crack of this black farcelebowski is the name of the rich famous billionaire and the name of the poor sluggish dude also and the irony of the situation means that both of them are men disabled one crippled and one doped  having problems yet only one is noble or at least less mean this is the main irony which the whole thing had been grounded on because that last characteristic of our good old type a idiot is the very thing which made him such a hero of his world and what a world indeed as weve been watching such a punchy bunch of the most sick contemptible foolish defeated dull opportunist criminal variety of all time or to be specific that time of 1991 which the movie chooses carefully to make its events and point of view toothe coen brothers made a sarcastic epitome of the american society by vivid sense of humor and such a dark discerning satire in the same time whereas the whole commentary vents the spleen on the powers of the big master corporations and their small beaten victims too there is that unique caricature community the rich people are good deceivers hate each others have no moralities or even a next generation  then the poor people are maybe quite the same but with some love the friendship of dude and walter some innocence and had been utilized by the rich people all along the rich lebowski and his game with the dude the powerful characters who want the dude to bring the money or find the wife maude lebowski  julianne moore wants to get a baby from the dude as a typical nonnoisy father  they form all together the ideal pieces of an antiutopian collapsed world moreover what is the art of this world anyway as the truthful reflection of it the high art of maude lebowski  julianne moore whichs absurd and too arduous to understand long tv shows which their author lives as dead maybe like his viewers who the rest of them are as deranged as walter  john goodman his biggest fan and finally the porn movies which their producer sees logically that the molds of entertaining have gone low so lets make sex as nobody needs stories anymore so in that kind of world there is no wonder at all when you have such a passive funny losers like the dude and his mental violent friend who both are dying by their vietnam past and playful present so bowling is their life which literally and metaphorically was their daily illusory victory and now it makes sense when the coens put it all cleverly in the early shadows of the iraqs war as maybe the next helpless vietnam as if nothing changed since the first sin as long as the dude is still the same lazy brainless tumbler being the perfect puppet in the hands of the perverse bossy players who had all the powers however his sole virtue is that hes wellmeaning to be everybodys fool and smart enough to grasp their perfidy and meanness after all i loved some talented touches which create such solid comic cosmos the owner of the house is a ruling man yet another loser saddam hussein the president of iraq at the time became an upcoming part of the fancy big game as in the second dream where the dude himself is the ball in the hands of the rich brats the office of the rich lebowski looks like the oval office of the american president in the white house the dude is flying over the city then falls like failed superman the fine genuine cowboy or the original american played by sam elliott is the narrator ironically named on the credits as the stranger there is no complete sane love story in here at all  and the sudden death of the poor friend donny  steve buscemi as all the young youth who died before him  to make sure that the next generation will be sick already by the defeat of their lousy mentors and theyll be weaker to get along with all of that dominating madness around although i didnt like that death as something a bit out of the drama but maybe it was made to confirm the sense of loss at the endthere were some flaws like how did the dude perceive the hidden truth  characters like a homosexual bowling player named jesus or a landlord who loves experimental theater werent comic or part of the drama being just odd characters for oddity but aside from that everything was hilariously sincere to the true lunatic nature of the lead character and its world for instance the 2 dreamy sequences as for the acting it was a dexterous comedy from everybody but i thought that john goodman did much better and more accurate job as walter than jeff bridges as the dudeall in all its some rereading of that world which is unbalanced utterly like its hero lebowski so by far you must understand easily what the meaning of is it isnt a reference to who would be the most important lebowski in the movie no its a smart hint to a big community of lebowski dudes out of the movie ,black_comedy
if you were a fan of fargo you might just like a bizarre comedy whose hero if that is the appropriate word is played by jeff bridges as a spacedout junkie who lives in los angeles unemployed with a trashy apartment and few belongings his name is lebowski but he is known by his friends as the dude and he prefers that moniker rather than his birth nameevery evening dude goes bowling with his best buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi walter is a vietnam veteran and in his perception all incidents relate to the war what does the vietnam war have to do with anything dude asks him at a fragile moment in both their lives instead of disputing walter gives him a big bear hugthe story begins with a humorous and selfaware voiceover by the narrator played by sam elliot in a few recurring cameos he informs us that dudes adventure started on an eventful night not very long ago when a duo of criminals broke into his house in search of a local millionaire who happens to share dudes last name after dunking dudes face into a toilet bowl and realizing that theyve attacked the incorrect individual the pair of idiots urinate on dudes rug and flee the apartmentdude figures that the only man truly responsible for the incident is lebowski himself so he makes a trip out to his mansion and is informed by lebowskis assistant portrayed by philip seymour hoffman with the perfect amount of nervousness that lebowskis wife has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom suspecting that she is in the custody of the two men who attacked dude lebowski offers the slacker a chance to be the courier of his ransom fee her life is in your hands lebowski tells him he promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money and lebowski agrees to help him outunfortunately the kidnappers never receive their ransom and dudes car is stolen along with lebowskis money it just so happens that lebowskis unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of german nihilists as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures and now lebowski is being targeted for the cash everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession and he is threatened that he will lose his johnson unless it is returned fearing for his life and more importantly his johnson dude takes comfort in walter who tracks down the 15yearold teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcases contents see this tommy this is what happens when you mess with a stranger walter yells at the boy as he singlehandedly demolishes the sports car we all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time but the result is nevertheless extremely funnythe coen brothers ethan and joel are extremely gifted filmmakers they burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic blood simple which starred frances mcdormand and dan hedaya the former of whom would later star in fargo as the bumbling police officer marge gundersonas usual the coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics particularly buscemi who is one of the best character actors in hollywood and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses  despite having to say anything funny at all in fargo he was the blundering kidnapper carl and in he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face completely changing his entire pattern of speech hes the goofy little squirt who tags along with dude and walter and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended youre like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know whats going on walter tells him whats your point walter he asks but its the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him and its walters crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him and its the dudes trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him the coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics but it is the coens eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else the script is wonderful and witty this has some of the best dialogue i have ever heard ranking up there with pulp fiction and the work of elmore leonard walters rants consume much of the dialogue which i think is fineis a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses yet the film seems to know this letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voiceover narration aw ive lost my train of thought were told as the stranger mumbles on about the movies plot and towards the end were all told by the stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story even if its nothing special yup that about sums it all up is a movie with a lot of joy wit and wicked humor three reasons youve got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade,black_comedy
in an eminently flaccid and insipid movie goodman delivers a remarkable performance as a polish turned jewish while julianne moore is less hot than she ought togoodman and bridges interrogating the imbecile kid is very funny goodman trying to unmask old lebowski is perhaps less funny the comedy is really scarce forced and often unfunnythe brother seamus line is also nicegoodman talks about shabbas and jewish things with conviction he remembers the asian wars and still loves cynthia yet the life the character gets comes not from the scriptbut from goodmans gustomy assessment is that lebowski is a very poorly written script the directing is needlessly classy and artsy and look at julianne moorethis babe uses to be tremendously hotwhats her role in this flick the impression isflaccidity,black_comedy
this movie is one of the greatest movies ever made it is a masterpiece thats all go check it out dude ill now have a white russian,black_comedy
to enjoy this film you need to have a little bit of that hippie mentality the people who doesnt get why this movie is great are the ones who lacks that the dude is a simple person with simple needs and hes just fine the way he is his life is not about money or chasing the american dream to get a family an expensive car or to be that successful man in the suit and its all cool man he has his own code of living he should be a life coach imo because he has nothing but still has everything he needs especially that rug that tied the room together,black_comedy
i love the dark comedy genre and this film takes the cake both tragic and very funny the dude will have you in stitches,black_comedy
this is a rare gem the most original hilarious and unforgettable movie ive ever seenis not a movie with a straight forward plot it is not a movie that is going to give you closure and if you dont pay attention most of it wont be all that funny but if you sit and watch soak it all up and allow yourself to get lost in nothing it is a one of a kind experience please watch this movie remember the one liners and become one with the dude,black_comedy
dudeness or duder or the dude is a way of thinking or life stylejust relax and dont effort too muchthat is the message of film,black_comedy
my rating  910you either hate it or love it i am in love with i love most of the coen brothers work and this one is right up there with fargo and no country for old men its super funny and can be watched again and again i think i watch it once a year and always have a great timeone that i highly recommend go watch it and then watch it again and againan awesome cult film,black_comedy
i dont hate this film i dont like it either for me it just kind of exists its understandable though why so many people enjoy this picture there are quite a few chuckle worthy moments and the characters are quite funny in how quirky they arethe actors are rather charming and the coen brothers are good directors however that doesnt make up for the fact that this movie adds up to nothing random events happen for no good reason many of the characters are completely pointless and even the story is unnecessary as well it starts off with this unique crime plot about the dudea lazy bumwho gets mistaken for a millionaire with the same name as him the dude then gets caught up in this convulted scheme by german nihilists to blackmail the millionaire by holding his trophy wife hostage but by the end of the flick i realized that absolutely nothing was at stake i dont want to spoil it so i will just leave it at that i dont mind if a story just wants to meander around aimlessly alice in wonderland does that but at least theres a reason for it they are in a dream like world that makes no sense here they set up this world like its flesh and blood reality where things are run by rules and regulations but then some things will happen out of nowhere and lead to nothinglike the plot you cant have a world run by both chaos and order it just doesnt make any sense thats it feels like the whole movie is a big joke the coen brothers are pulling on the audience you are given a tour of strange characters that are tied together by a overly complicated plot that meant nothing in the end i wouldnt recommend this unless watching a bunch of walking character quirks stumble around for an hour and a half sounds like fun to you and if you do dont worry you arent alone,black_comedy
think what you want of saddam i think of him as a traitor to his people but the fact is he was a paid cia employee dating back to 1959 probably earlier when he was part of a ciaauthorized sixman squad tasked with assassinating then iraqi prime minister gen abd alkarim qasim who was an asshole as well but he was our asshole until he made a fatal mistake and he in cia terms had to go the first attempt failed but eventually in february 1963 qasim was killed in a baath party coup which was followed by an orgy of bloodshed the leftists were all murdered and the lists of those to be killed were supplied by the cia saddam eventually became dictator of iraq and we played him like an instrument george bush sr needed to look strong so april glaspie our ambassador to iraq when approached by saddam regarding kuwait invited him to invade kuwait by stating the following we have no opinion on your arabarab conflicts such as your dispute with kuwait secretary baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction first given to iraq in the 1960s that the kuwait issue is not associated with america we were setting him up to make bush sr look like a strong leader anyone who spent the least amount of time reading between the lines knew this at the time yet a horrible slaughter ensued that was so freaking unnecessary but hey money trumps peace quote from george bush jr in reality actually its really more than just money okay enough of my rant to sum it up i loved the movie but cringed at the unnecessary propaganda that conveniently predated the release of the pnac position paper the performances were magnificent especially jeff and john i encourage everyone to watch it but be aware its really a propaganda piece designed to get you ready for the next iraq war but i must say despite my misgivings i will always cherish this film and will remember it fondly in particular the performances by jeff and john,black_comedy
the coen brothers have a unique sense of humor which they incorporate in every one of their movies features jeff bridges in the leading role of the dude or his dudeness or el duderino whatever you like better easily one of the coolest movie characters ever created the dude is an unemployed guy who passes his time by playing bowling and does not give a damn about what others think of him there happens to be another lebowski who is a millionaire so a couple of guys mistake the dude for him when they are looking for a payoff now the eccentric plot revolves around how the dude manages to deliver a million dollars to the kidnappers of the lebowskis wife that is the millionaire lebowskithe movie is filled with incredibly hilarious dialogues and some outrageous actions by the characters the cinematography is fantastic and there are certain dream sequences which have been captured magnificently has all the ingredients that are required for being a classic that will be remembered for decades to come if you want a truly exhilarating cinematic experience then go ahead and watch this movie now,black_comedy
simply the greatest slacker film ever made the coen bros script is intelligently written with characters which although larger than life are both believable and hysterically funny particularly the vitriolic john goodman the plot centres around the theft of the dudes rug jeff bridges and his subsequent quest for its return which takes in nihilists modern improv dance and of course bowling steve buscemi plays a timid donnie constantly under the thumb of the domineering vietnam obsessed walter goodman whilst it is hard to pick an outstanding performancejohn goodman is stellar consistently funnybut watch out for jesus also flea has a brief cameo all in all a fantastic film one of my all time top teni guess that sometimes theres a film which well its the film for its time and place,black_comedy
the reason i disliked this movie is becauseim not a fan of this type of comedy if you like trailer park boysand other white comedies then you will for sure enjoy this movieif you are more of a fan of vocal awkwardsituational humor rather than slapstick ridiculous selfdefeatinglaughat vs laugh with humour then stay away from this waste of timei got up to the half hour mark at which point i just couldnt bare to sit there wasting timei laughed once during that halfhour there was no visual appeal rich storyline likable characters or even a good sound track this movie was lowbudget and made just over what they put ini suppose it has a good rating on imdb because there is a large number of people who do like trailer park boys corner gas and other racially unique humours,black_comedy
i thought it slowed down  there are good comedic moments throughout but the script slows down a notch about a third of the way through  it was not clear if slow moments were intentional meant to be surrealistic or what the comedic moments are good though and i would not discourage anyone who appreciates humor from seeing iti got tired of hearing the profanity  its use was in a consistent vein relative to the movies style and supposed intent  still enough,black_comedy
i have no idea why this film is loved by many including critics all around the world and it is seen as a masterpiece for some the story is pretty interesting it is a nice film there are jeff bridges john turturro and john goodman and even more john goodman is very funny as usual in my opinion the most funny character in the movie jeff bridges is cool but no more than that moreover this is not a comedy this is black comedy no problem but i just try to say that the hype doesnt say that the hype is problematic also some critics write that it is one of the best examples of pure cinema sorry but this is not a kubrick or tarantino film i dont call a movie as pure art so that the camera follows the bowls which roll over i couldnt see anything great in the movie as known the movie has big fans who saw the movie again and again but never got bored at the end there is a speech it ruins the movie for me a sort of therefore a humorous and entertaining film but it is not great it is not a piece of art or it is not brilliant one of coens disappointing movies unlike no country for old men and barton fink,black_comedy
i realize that there are all these cinema people that have obviously voted some high marks for this movie  that would be the only way to explain the high marks  i was bored out of my mind   as far as i am concerned that means the movie sucks,black_comedy
is all about the dude who is first mistakenly identified as the wrong man he then finds the correct lebowski and his wife bunny after meeting the lebowskis the older lebowski hires him to be the one to try to turn the money over to bunnys kidnappers dude then enlists the help of his friend who is a little off his rocker and screws all the plans up each time dude also encounters with mr lebowskis daughter who knows that her father is embezzling money from the company she tries to catch him by paying dude 20000 to bring her the money that he was given in order to give to bunnys kidnappers however the briefcase is also empty and only has some telephone books in it for weight later they find out that bunny was never kidnapped she was off visiting friends and returned home safely dude then confronts mr lebowski and lets him know what all he knows and how he is actually taking the money and that there was never really a kidnappedthis film in my opinion was ok i dont really understand why they kept the bowling alley in there which i didnt feel like it had really much to do with the movie at all this movie is not one of my first to watch as it seems like the movie is really all over the place and doesnt make much sense at all the characters were all really good and outstanding actors and actresses some of the best of the best were in this movie and i think that is what made it a hit with so many people,black_comedy
i had been wanting to see for a long time until i got a clean copy from it in the blockbustereven though the film is superbly managed into the deep terrains of black comedy satire and portraying the ultimate exaggereta model of the lazy american slaking in his filthy environment its a repeated exercise in form and it uses its style too often to provoke a sense of depletion excess and tiresomenesseven that jeff bridges does a brilliant performance snubed by the academy because of the fact of being a comedy role and hilarious sidekicks like a temperamental john goodman and a latino stylish bowler like john turturrois a good comedy with a slick smart script recommended for the audiences that do not target comedies in a masslike way and enjoy acid and dark moments and laughing out loud man,black_comedy
the man in me will do nearly any task  bob dylan a noir plot is really an impenetrable web of cosmic betrayal in which our hero is trapped helplessly pushed around like a tumbleweed in the wind consider howard hawks the big sleep  a film which homages  in which we the audience feel a bit like humphrey bogart as we hack our way through hawks convoluted narrativethe coen brothers is just as confusing as hawks film filled with dead ends double crosses and confused characters who eventually learn that there was really no mystery at all but what happens the coens ask when you take a stoner a guy who just abides and put him in a noir plot what happens when you swap an active hero like bogart with a a passive slacker like jeffery lebowski jeffery the dude lebowski doesnt try to battle his way out of his noir plot he doesnt fight fate he simply says fk it and abides as such the films tumbleweeds bowling pins etc are all metaphors for a highly deterministic universe the tumbleweed itself like the dude simply goes where the wind takes it its a reversal of our typical noir herothe issue of the femme fatale is also updated maude lebowski a feminist and artist has the dude checked by a doctor she then sleeps with him simply to get herself pregnant shes a woman who uses and discards men using them purely as sexual objects throughout the film the dude even makes some subtle jabs at maudes male replacement role hey man why dont you fking listen for a change but what makes muade choose jeffery as the perfect mating partner and why does the narrator deem the dude worthy of such noble treatment the film articulates these questions itself when asks the audience what makes a man with its phallic imagery and its frequent threats of castration scissors ferret dropped cigarette etc and male rape fk you up the ass the film goes on to offer some answersfirstly all the men in the film are weak while is confined to a wheelchair smokey the landlord and donny are all dckless when talking about penises donny even says what do you need that for dude then theres jesus who lusts for kids and walter whos so whipped by his ex that he still babysits her dog then theres jackie treehorn the alpha male who quote treats objects like women man the films original script makes the themes of masculinity even more implicit in the final scene when is thrown from his chair he yells stay away from me you and these women you wont even leave a man his balls but unlike everyone else in the film the dude always in shorts his legs wide apart seems more in touch with his masculinity by abiding and not refusing to be tied down to any one cultural identity he is flexible and free do you see a ring on this finger do i look like im fking marriedall these themes have recently led to feminist writers discovering and falling in love with the film in her writings gender theorist monique wittig says that woman and man are merely political and economic categories we create personas based on external forces wittig says that the rise of the individual and the liberation of desire require the abolition of gender categories and thats just what the dude is freedom from desire and total individuality in the face of a world that wants him to conformthese writers read the dude as a noble individual who because he refuses to adhere to the films ready made male stereotypes castrated or alpha male is a more whole character and thus more appealing to the female other but they fail to realise that the dude like the cowboy is himself a heroic distortion of the male identity to the coens he represents an idealised version of the failed male one who pleasures himself with constant buddy interactions poses with cool solidarity and nonconformity and is always strictly heterosexualbut the dude is really a bum and a failure constantly playing with his balls in fear of castration the appeal and popularity of the character is essentially down to males loving the carefree masculinity he projects despite the world deeming him a failures as a man in fact the only truly successful man in the film jackie treehorn makes a living out of subjugating women has a big dck and seeks to develop machines to replace women so he can jack off with technologyso war and female sexuality are both tied into the rug at the centre of the film as such the film treats the persian rug as a mini persian war a piece of territory which the female maude eventually wins the dude thinks hes a mans man who gets the woman and doesnt have to bother about rearing the kids when in fact hes just abiding to the superiority of the female otherbut the dude is unconcerned about all this unlike the pacifists donny landlord smokey nihilists russians and aggressors walterbush in this war the dude is very much a noninterventionist he has no real desires avoids women is happy and lives life without worry hes the ultimate introvert while is the ultimate extrovert ironically both men really havent accomplished anything on their own when the big l asks are you employed mr lebowski hes just covering up the fact that hes also useless and unemployed9510  worth multiple viewings,black_comedy
this is such a beautiful movie to my opinion certainly the best the coen brothers made for anybody who sometimes gets tired of the hectic life he lives this is a must see it will make you want to be like the dude because whatever happens the dude will be the dudethis movie was made with a moving subtlety although i must admit i didnt see that at first it makes anything that takes itself too seriously look stupid its a manifest of dudeness the actors in this movie must have had incredible synergy when this movie was made without exceptions the acting is really phenomenal especially jeff bridges the dude himself john goodman walter and philip seymour hoffman brandt do amazing jobs this movie through excellent storytelling and acting shows such a comforting humanity its warm and moving on many occasions and its hilarious at the same timein the end we learn that the dude abides and i dont know about you but like the stranger i take comfort in that the dude abides,black_comedy
this film starts off a treat and for the first hour its lightning pace doesnt let up  we are introduced to a likable rogue in jeff bridges character jeff lebowski and his friends who spend all their time bowling drinking and smoking and its fun bridges gets mistaken for another rich jeff lebowski whose wife has been kidnapped for ransom john goodman is great as his psycho vietnam freak pal although coen favourites steve buscemi and john turturro seem wasted in dolittle supporting roles anyway the story unravels well until all of a sudden the razor sharp humour is replaced by the constant blurting out of four letter words while the storyline just seems to shoot itself in the foot and the whole film becomes one big muddle and at nearly 2 hours it seems to go on for far too long a shame although the film does try desperately to wrap up a mountain of loose ends at the end but by that time you will have probably lost interest in it altogether despite all of this worth a look as you will laugh at most of the jokes,black_comedy
this is the worst movie i have ever seen these kind of movies discourage the viewers from watching movies there is no such base of the movie that i found meaningful it bored a lot there is no such comedy in this movie to be called a comedy genre movie the walter guy is really irritable i dont understand why is his role included as he talks senseless all the time you cannot even laugh on what he says even nothing special in way of talking the same is the case with the millionaire lebowski he too gets irritated easily and shouts a lot another irritable role its a great sacrifice of the normal state of mind to watch this stuff you just get up out of your mind standing ovation to me for watching the whole length,black_comedy
if a movie has a good rating in imdb i usually purchase a blu ray to support good movie makers thats why i paid more than 10 euro to watch it at homei was never disappointed by imdb ratings before thus the money i have paid to watch other high rated movies was worth it however this was anything but that i waited and waited for this movie to become funny and interesting but i got nothing but totally dull moments with no humor at alli fell asleep after a hour or so and let me tell you that i have never ever slept so soundly while watching a movie i dont know what happened after a hour and im not at all interested to know i didnt even chuckle the entire time i was awake but finally the next day i was laughing at myself for spending money on this prosaic work and this was the only laugh i got from it only watch this movie if you have insomnia this movie could very well be the next step in treating sleep disorders bottom line the most overrated movie in history  waste of time and money  unimaginably dull slow humorless uninteresting  all the synonyms of boring in the thesaurus,black_comedy
slovenly slacker jeff bridges as jeff the dude lebowski is abducted in his southern california apartment and gets his head dunked in the toilet for some reason mr bridges toilet bowl looks like it was filled with milk instead of lemonade the intruders have mistaken bridges for ultrawealthy david huddleston as jeffrey informed of their error they leave but bridges is upset one left his rug soaked with urine the rug really tied the room together now it will stink bridges decides to ask the to pay damagesat the mansion bridges meets funny philip seymour hoffman as brandt and his namesakes busty blonde trophy wife tara reid as bunny she offers oral services for 1000 but bridges is broke later bridges is employed to help retrieve the kidnapped wife by transporting 1000000 in ransom money helping bridges are two bowling pals chubbier john goodman as walter and talky steve buscemi as donny there is more sex appeal in beautifullyfigured julianne moore as maude she wants to have a little lebowski memorable characterizations and good music 21598 joel  ethan coen  jeff bridges john goodman julianne moore steve buscemi,black_comedy
first of all i love the coen brothers just about every one of their films is stunningly written with enough wit in their dialogue to rival tarantino in his pulp fiction form stunningly directed riotously funny and brimming with unique and colourful characters their films are always a pleasure to watchjeff bridges portrays jeffrey lebowski a man whod rather just be called the dude however when criminals mistake him for a rich jeffrey lebowski a misinformed breakandentry results in the dudes prized rug getting urinated upon that rug really held the room together a dejected dude remarks and so he goes to visit whom he considers responsible for such an unpleasant occurrence little does the dude realise that his visit will bring about considerable more trouble than just a soiled ruglike most coen brothers films is certainly a funny and reasonably wellwritten story however i found myself slightly underwhelmed by it a lot of the time it felt like weird characters were simply thrown into the mix simply to be weird without serving any real purpose im yet to work out the reasons for including the stranger sam elliott whose cowboytype character narrates the the beginning and the end of the story with a brief cameo appearance somewhere in the middle the completely unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the end of the film just seemed out of place with the rest of the story and how did the stranger even know about the dudes story having just exchanged a few words with him at the bowling bar it beats me but perhaps im just completely missing the pointhowever these grievances aside it must be said that there are many genuinely funny moments in this film most of them arising from john goodmans perfectlyplayed character walter sobchak with stunning comedic timing the coen film regular barton fink o brother where art thou hilariously spouts out his wellwritten dialogue which usually for no apparent reason references sobchaks own service in the vietnam war or otherwise belittles his underappreciated and oftenignored bowling partner donny kerabatsos steve buscemiis a funny film and well worth your time however i was simply unable to take it seriously as a film nor should i have tried so i couldnt rate it any higher it just didnt have the professional class of the coen brothers other films,black_comedy
one of the worst movies ive ever seen total crap and not even a bit funny only when walter empties the can with donny in it it shouldnt be in the top 250 i read the other comments and i dont understand your enthusiasm about it there in almost no humor in the movie no decent crimeaction where the movie is ranked for please help to remove this movie from the top 250 i watched over 100 top250 movies and they were all worthy of a place in this ranking but this one is such useless crap that it really has to be lowered in ranking i normally enjoy this genre so its not that im a hater of this type of movies its just not a good movieplease watch it and give a comment but i needed a second watch to finally make it to the end of the movie its boring and once again not worthy for 181 in the ranking,black_comedy
what is this is this funny intelligent i know the girl sitting next to me in the theater was laughing her head off i personally didnt find this movie amusing at all i thought it was pretty boring dull and not a bit entertaining maybe its just me,black_comedy
finally watched this for the first time today and wow what a film john goodman steals the show would highly recommend and im not a big coen brothers fan but this film had me in stitches,black_comedy
i can at least say this is one of the great films of our timebowling for soup did an awesome job creating this masterpiece,black_comedy
one of the coen brothers greatest movies focusing on jeff the dude lebowski usually mistaken for a millionaire with the same name whos wife owes money around townthis movie is so powerful and what stood out most to me is the entrances from scenes to charactersi also loved how none of the characters except donnie change very much through the movie and theres something so satisfying about almost everything going back to normal after the events i was shocked that this film only had an 81 rating it deserves much higher,black_comedy
the pacifist jeffery lebowsky the duder finds himself in the middle of a crime scene just because he wanted his rug back walter his hillarious vietnam veteran friend tries his best to help him which makes the whole story a masterpiece the story is a bit confusing because you are walking by the team you know nothing more than what the dude knows so even if you can not make sense of the story at the end do not worry at all because it took the whole movie for the dude himself too to figure it out just watch it again and again this way you can die with a smile on your face with out feeling the good lord gypped you,black_comedy
i had seen this movie once before and got way more out of it when watching it recently for the second timei think the complexity of dialogue is one of this movies most fantastic aspects ironically though i think its also the reason i didnt like the film as much from my first viewing i think this is also where the movies rewatchability comes from the dialogue is written in an extremely nonlinear fashion often much of it has to be filtered through to follow the plot as there can be so much going on in a scene upon my rewatch i was able to better follow and inspect what was going on in the more dialogue heavy scenes and when youre no longer struggling to just follow the plot you can really appreciate the intricacies the cohen brothers wrote into these conversationsi found the chaos of these dialogue scenes very humorous and you really get to see the dynamic of the dudes friend group through these scenes its hilarious watching everyone talking to each other yet so caught up in their own heads at the same timethe story and wildness of the tale is captivating and the wacky premise with which it starts draws you in quickly especially with the way the dude and his pals respond and react to the events that befall themjulianne moores role in the film is one of my favorite and in my opinion most mastered storylines of the movie her introduction is particularly memorable and impressed into my brainthe narration in this movie fits well throughout and towards the end became one of my favorite parts of the film it brings a whole new path to reflect about the movie on and does a phenomenal job at wrapping the narrative in a meaningful and expansive way that adds to the movie at the same time as it encapsulates itthe dream sequences provide nice intermissions to the story and are also hilarious as well as visually a joy to watchmy biggest complaint about the film has to be the potential for it to cause confusion in its complexity but this is also what makes the movie so great and makes it worth watching again i look forward to the next time i see this movie and anticipate my third viewing to be even more enjoyable than my last,black_comedy
was a movie where going in all i knew was that it was a comedy and it is definitely a hilarious movie the story itself is what is so confusing how nothing really matters and you just follow this plotline that was linear yet infrequent with seemingly random things occurring the whole point of this is to satire crime dramas while also giving you some easy laughs mixed with the deep ones,black_comedy
this is one of the greatest movies of all time the dude is jeff bridges premier role and its rewatchable multiple times just love everything about it it has so many outstanding moments genius movie and i love this movie to bits classic,black_comedy
whenever i try to explain to someone i tell them that the film is 25 plot and 75 characters while that is a cursory explanation and neglects setting as a rather large portion i think it well portrays the priorities and attitude of the film to be sure the plot is still well crafted and exciting it is an easily flowing story of misunderstanding kidnapping and deception and it manages all three topics without a dark theme by telling it through the eyes of an unmotivated and nonchalant hippie but the film is far more than just a plot after watching it the first time i realized that many of the scenes and dialogues could be completely omitted and the plot would still make sense walter bringing his wifes pomeranian to the bowling game as well as his constant reference to his service in the vietnam war and the scene where the dude attends his landlords dance recital none of these contribute to the plot at all but contribute much to character and setting development and they are so effective that no one could really care about the extra length they make the characters funny and memorable and the film as such  one example scene where the dude first meets maude shows how the coen brothers squeeze as much theme development as they can out of a scene in this scene maude tells the dude about bunny and how the kidnapping is likely staged they could have had the dude respond to maudes statements and conversation as a normal scene would play out but instead they have the dude constantly interjecting to ask about his rug while maude ignores him and carries out a onesided conversation doing so preserves the spacey aloof nature of the dudes personality and showcases maudes persistent and independent character all while giving the scene a comedic mood the film presses the contrasting characters of the dude and walter together constantly as well their differences  the dude being an easygoing pacifist and walter being an impulsive sometimes aggressive war vet  bring out the hilarity in both characters they are constantly arguing and the dude often regrets everything that walter brings him into such as walters involvement in the hand off or walter clubbing a strangers sports car but the relationship is relatable and gives the movie a casual familiar tone much of the hilarity also comes from how calmly the dude handles all the events he rarely loses his cool or questions anything there seems to be little difference in how he handles being the courier for a ransom hand off or having his car windows smashed compared to buying cream from the grocery store he lets viewers experience the cool and calm persona they have always wanted to be the visual style of the movie is certainly memorable recalling it brings a specific set of colors to mind those being a sort of orange to tan spectrum this can be seen from the dudes gown he always wears to the wood the seats and the wall paneling of the bowling alley to the tinted glasses always worn by walter this is also perpetuated by the lighting of many of the scenes as it usually comes from warm sources like candles or sunlight when the actual surroundings are not orange in color the film is a representation of a feeling or lifestyle not merely a story the characters live outside the movies and reside in the heads of viewers as they are some of the most memorable from a single movie in film history it is no wonder the film has such a cult following,black_comedy
this is a character based comedy and you really need to watch it 34 times to appreciate itif you want a film that gets from a to b then youll hate this film if you want something to watch with the wifegf this isnt for you if you want something obvious or mainstream this isnt for you if you care about plots suspense etc this isnt going to be your cup of tea the people i know that like this film tend to be film connoisseurs intellectual males peaceful well balanced individuals the coen brothers went all out on this film every member of the cast made the performance of their career in this film the cinematography is fantastic there are so many scenes to be seen the soundtrack is brilliant etc etc but what this film is all about is the dialogue if youre a fan of films like pulp fiction and fight club where its the excellent dialogue that brings you back then this is the ultimate film for youi watched this by myself on a movie channel around the time of its release and a couple of years later when my younger brother told me to watch this film i couldnt remember a thing about it i gave it another watch and half enjoyed it my brother convinced me to watch it again so i did this time i loved it and by the time id seen it 4 times it became my favourite film of all timeafter 34 viewings you think jeff bridges dude character is the greatest movie character of all time and that he should have won an oscar but by the time youve seen it 6 you realise that the greatest movie character of all time is actually john goodmans walter and it is he who should have received an oscar for this filmthe more you watch it the more you understand the characters and find it more and more funnyyou end up with one of the most quotable films and find it hard to believe that any movie fan doesnt like itthis is just my opinion man,black_comedy
is a good movie  i do not think the best of the coen brothers  plus the script is excellent and the cast not to mention  jeff bridges is excellent  the cast still has great john goodman  the soundtrack is great  the best scenes are in the bowling alleys in my opinion  have a fun character who is jesus  and has excellent dialogue  the picture is good  the pace can sometimes be tiring  for a comedy film  i admit that i do not i gave a lot of laughs  i really liked the movie plot cast and scenes in bowling alleys  plus its a good movie has excellent dialogue and fine performances  more is not the best of coen  at least thats what i guess note 77,black_comedy
maybe i was expecting too much i read the reviews and so many were glowing i watched and waited and hardly any of it was funny some of the predicaments were humorous but the characters just werent likable i love john goodman but his character was a psycho that didnt have very many great lines buscemis talent was just wasted i found the dude to be stupid and clueless and how he survives each day is mind bogglingi did enjoy some of the characters and they were funny but nothing near what i read from reviews i have seen all of the coen films and this is the only one i did not thoroughly enjoy,black_comedy
ehmthey did not finish the storywere we not supposed to notice or were we not supposed to care towards the end big lebowski had about 5 or 6 story threads going but left 2 of them untied at the end one of which was a relatively major one there is unexplained plot point or two all in all the story ends up being kind of disappointingthen again the story is not very important because this movie is all about the characters the dude and walter sobchak the main characters played by jeff bridges and john goodman respectively are awesome and memorable creations yes steve buscemi is there too but he doesnt do a lot all of the characters in this film are eccentric on the one hand that is what gives this movie its colour but on the other hand this approach to character creation feels a step below simply having good believable people who are different from one another in a subtle but perceivable way you and i we too could come up with some crazy personalities that would as a result be memorable we can create a guy who makes racist jokes every time he appears on screen and smokes a whole lot so we will make him have two or three cigarettes in his moth at all times making ridiculous characters is easy and lazy and while the dude and walter ultimately do work as characters some of the others in this movie do notthere are a few funny moments in this film but there are equally few jokes that fail the dialogue can be pretty good pretty stupid and sometimes both at the same timethe film has a number of interesting looking scenes mostly when the main character is knocked out or drugged the music covers the visuals with a layer of rock complementary to the dudes and walters 60s persona it is safe to say that the film goes for a specific style and nails it it is only unfortunate that it is a bit more style than substancebig lebowski is like the weird friend in your party who is awkward and sometimes ruins things but he has in time grown on you and you know that the party just wouldnt be the same without him in that aspect he is very much like the main characters of this film,black_comedy
i came to this movie a fan of the coen brothers jeff bridges and nearly all of the cast members of this film i came to this movie expecting smart satire and cinematic invention the first 30 minutes of this film offended me on every level possible  it is grotesque and perverse and sophomoric i cant remember hating a film more i never had the stomach to finish this disaster of a film which is ugly to the eyes and the soul   do yourself a favor and watch fargo or the equally incomparable o brother where art thou,black_comedy
play it is fast and easy to view a good way to spend your time be the best,black_comedy
is an american 2hour film from 1998 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year it is of course by the oscarwinning coen brothers and even without gigantic awards attention this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years this is also thanks to the cast not just to the script there are 3 performers in here who won acting oscars namely philip seymour hoffman julianne moore and of course jeff bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it even if i might give the edge to john goodman argo roseanne here in terms of who id pick as the films mvp but theres also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like tara reid or flea and then theres coen regulars like stormare buscemi both fargo and turturro barton fink a lot of fun for sure the coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavior very well done and this tendency has elevated many coen films and as absurd as these characters may seem there is still something authentic to them you never get the impression that you are actually watching actors herethe result are many hilarious scenes like at the bowling alley early on eg the gun scene or also all the scenes with the dude and lebowski i had to laugh so hard at some of these yes the film maybe got a bit worse in the second half and maybe the story took two or three plot twists or roads that may have been too absurd but at this point it doesnt really matter anymore as you are truly sucked in by the entertainment its also not a film where you really wonder what will happen to the protagonists or care about them deeply instead you just enjoy the moment and what is happening to them this very instant good acting strong writing hilarious scenes i was really close to giving this one a  and declaring it one of the very best of 1998 which it is without a doubt in the first 60 minutes as for the entire thing lets stick with three stars for now i might change my opinion on rewatch though until then i highly recommend checking it out if you are one of the very few like myself until today who have not yet seen it also a mustsee for bowling lovers,black_comedy
the dude is basically a loser he has to write checks milk and has a car thats worth about fifty dollars  his life takes an unexpected turn when he is put between a rock and a hard place  the dude is in really big trouble but whatever hes the dude  i thought this was a really good movie not some predictable julia roberts movie  it has major plot turns and anything can happen,black_comedy
i just saw the tennesse williams film suddenly last summer the other night and i found there to be a distinct similarity between katherine hepburns character violet and julianna moores maude from  now i dont think that maude is a copy of violet but if you listen to the way she talks and the way she leads a conversation you can hear a distinct similarity between them  the best part of the movie to make this comparison is when hepburn is showing montgomery clift around her sons garden and the way she talks about flowers and her niece catherine elizabeth taylor and then compare that to when maude first meets the dude and she is talking about art the female form sex and her step mother bunny  i dont know maybe its just me  for other cohen brother inspiration check out the alan laddveronica lake film the glass key as inspiration for millers crossing and check out akim tamiroff as uncle joe grande in touch of evil as a model for several characters that jon polito plays in a bunch of cohen brothers movies,black_comedy
exceptionally amusing picture with a splendid cast the plot skillfully tangled and requires attentive monitoring jeff bridges is outstanding in portraying a pitiful bum john goodman is tragicomical with his references to vietnam supporting actors are equally impressive credit to the director for his imaginative touches highly recommended entertainment is guaranteed,black_comedy
is a rare comedy in that it makes you laugh at the reasons for the dudes behavior rather than at the absurdity of the situations he is in  its not a detectivecomedy and it sure as hell isnt a bowling comedy its a lifestyle movie with wonderfully written characters  jesus is a perfect example of comedic genius with a flat character  hes a pedophile bowler that has the ability to intimidate guys like the dude who probably doesnt really even care enough to be intimidated but thats the type of conflict that this movie deals with  the dude and walter never really learn any lesson or go through any major character changes  you must keep in mind that this movie is just a crazy story whose main purpose is to express the comedic traits within the characters  fans of character conflict should love this aspect  those looking for a buildup and climax may not appreciate the story so much  the whole detective story is given to the audience blatantly  but like the dude you become wrapped up in the craziness of all the distractions from the cast of characters such as autobahn that are thrown into the mix  so when the story ends you feel like the dude someone who just drifted along as everything sort of passed right by you but worrying about all of it would be very undude,black_comedy
this movie grabs me for so many reasons first of all i really dig the way the dude handles things hes just so damned lax about everything watching the dude go about his stuff is the perfect antidote for the hustle and bustle of todays overlycorporatised worldthe humour of this film is unique and enjoyable because of the strong characterisation of the film praise goes to jeff bridges for totally immersing himself into his role and really embracing it the humour of the film can be very subtle at times and as you watch it and learn more of the dudes habbits it becomes even better its a very detailed film support cast was terrific esp john goodman as the rambunctious vietnam vet go see the movie and be amazed at the production witty yet unpretentious dialogue quirky characters and an amazing soundtrack to boot,black_comedy
the first coen brothers movie i saw was fargo and to be frank i didnt enjoy it very much the first time the experience with was more or less the same fortunately i watched it a second time before i returned the dvd and my life changed i immediately started building my own personal coen brothers collection starting with of course i have easily seen this movie more than a hundred times by now in fact i can replay the entire movie in my head if i need tosome general suggestions for coen newcomers you have to allow yourself to be transported into the coens world before you can fully appreciate their movies the guys have a quirky worldview and a rather twisted sense of humour they also have a gift for writing fast funny quotable dialoguetransporting ones self to the coens world isnt very hard this can be accomplished by watching for example about 23 times say within ten dayswhat you will get out of this movie several memorable quotes which will be a source of endless amusement throughout your life and if you watch it often enough youll also end up leading a more relaxed and enjoyable life a word of warning dont overdo it overexposure may well diminish your enjoyment of the movie id say that 20 is a safe enough number of times that you can watch this movie and then maybe you can continue to watch once or twice a year for pretty much the rest of your lifeeverything i wish to say about this movie has already been said and been said better if youre already an achiever do read other users comments they are great if you were waiting for one more recommendation before you rent it here it is watch it hopefully youll like it as much as i did,black_comedy
as bowling movies go and fortunately there arent many i think we have to admit that has it all over kingpin which itself was pretty good  the dude walter donny brandt maude bunny jesus and even the stranger  the nihilists are all very memorable characters and youll laugh pretty much all the way through the coen brothers have made some great flicks but this ones the best,black_comedy
what can i say about this movie where do i start jeff bridges plays the dude  a seriously stoned bowler who is dragged into a web of deception when mistaken for all the dude wants is his rug back but he goes through a lot to get itthe main characters in this movie are all larger than life and quite insane john goodman john turturro and julianne moore all produce excellent performances due in part to the excellent script it has to be one of the most quoteable films everthis is one film that needs to be watched a few times as the whole atmosphere is a bit incoherent and it seems to make a little more sense with each viewingits worth seeing just to check out john turturro in a purple catsuit,black_comedy
this is without a doubt the funniest film ever if you have ever watched any of the coen brothers films before then you will know their like of blacksurreal humour this film is funnier than o brother where art thou fargo and raising arizona in my opinion the dude is one of the best characters ever created on film jeff bridges plays him effortlessly he is brilliant as ever steve buscemi and john goodman are excellent in their supporting roles with goodman in particular all i can say is see this film see this film see this film 1010,black_comedy
the rug really tied the room together this movie is my all time favorite and incorporates everything that you would ever want to see in a movie it has nihilists marmots bowling weed porn stars old western drifters and much more this movie gets funnier everytime i watch it if you havent seen it yet put on your shoes get in the car and drive down to the video store right now before you know it youll be howling with laughter at walters continous shouts of shut the fck up donny go see it now,black_comedy
this film is absolutely fantastic  it stands up to many rewatchings this is mainly due to the quality of the dialogue  the whole film is just so quotable and they become part of everyday speech  all the performances are amazing especially the three friends and john turturro is brillant as jesus,black_comedy
bottom line if you need to laugh and laugh hard rent it  watch it twice watch it five times  dont watch it 50 like me or youll find yourself conversing in lebowskian dialectits the story of the dude bridges who through a case of mistaken identity becomes mixed up in a debacle involving a host of characters from all walks of la life  the screenplay is terrific the casting is nothing short of brilliant and the story line tho difficult to follow due to some er zany twists in plot and misinformation from the players is very entertaining  the cohn brothers invoke some marvelous theatrical tricks especially video cuts in the middle of a conversation and extensive use of repetition if something is funny once its bound to show up 235 more timescall it a cult flick a sad commentary on the state of affairs in california if not the us bogus  this movie is top notch and it pokes fun at everything it seems to hold dear  give it a second screening if it blew over your head the first time as was the case for me and i promise youll be renting to own d,black_comedy
this movie is one of just a few comedic masterpieces  if you dont believe me just watch the scene with jesus in it bowling  his dance will make you fall out of your seat  this is definitely one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time,black_comedy
quirky bizarre and darkly hilarious tbl isnt for everyone for the precious few that appreciate its inherent hilarity and comic genius  its a treasure to watch  it gets funnier every time the quotes the characters the music  nothing could ever top this film definitely the coens best  scores an eleven out of ten,black_comedy
with characters ranging from walter sobchak the angry vietnam vet to jackie treehorn the infamous pornographer this film has it all i often find myself repeating lines from this movie to my friends just because they will be forever impounded in my mind no matter how many times i watch it i will still laugh at every scene for my money this is the greatest comedy ever producedthis film not only provides nonstop laughter but it teaches us an important lesson about life we must adopt the dudes carefree attitude this movie teaches us that all you need in life are a few good friends and a recreational activity in which you enjoy greatly in the dudes case bowling was what he enjoyed the most whether we put this lesson to use ourselves or not its like the stranger said its good knowin hes out there the dude takin er easy for all us sinners,black_comedy
while there is nothing outright terrible about from the very beginning it lacks the wit and intelligence of many of their other efforts  the doubledealing twists and turns cant hold a candle to the level of intrigue in millers crossing nor the humor which is mostly missing in lebowski nor does it have the dramatic photography of fargo which it resembles quite closely in both plot and tone to keep it interesting  it is a lukewarm film that could have easily been directed and written by any of a dozen writerdirectors out there  while there are a few quotes they are fairly few and far between and do not stand on their own in any meaningful way and to all you who think the dude abides is a great quote then you know why i call this the lowest common denominator to paraphrase from an earlier coen film we all have that coen brothers feeling but since this film was by the coen brothers we figure it should have it in spades  unfortunately it doesnt and it suffers because of it410,black_comedy
this film had glowing recommendations from so many people  had an intriguing plot idea and some very good performances eg from john goodman in particular it is just that i cant bear the oh so clever style of the coen brothers films it seems they put a lot of effort into being quirky just as an end in itself and this film was no differentthere is nothing wrong with dream sequences off the wall dialogue etc far from it they feature strongly in some of my favourite movies of the last 30 years i am a huge fan of david lynch for example but this film has a sense of desperation on the part of the filmmakers that feeling of end of year film school project about it like the geeks who watch the great movies and want to distill all the best bits into their own creation but just dont get that you can overegg it and whackify it so much that it simply becomes awfully tedious there are probably a lot of people out there who admire the intentions of a film like without stopping to think did they actually laugh i felt like i ought to at times without actually getting near,black_comedy
i am shocked that this movie has received such glowing reviews i am more shocked that i watched the entire movie i am shocked that jeff bridges and john goodman who have had such exceptional roles in movies and tv would lend themselves to this movie acting was so over the top in the pursuit of lampooning stereotypes that i failed to see the humor i suppose some of the action was meant to be slapstick but only seemed stupid the movie was so gratuitously laced with obscenities throughout that it seemed to serve no purpose and lost its shock value after the first couple of minutes the only redeeming value of this movie are some of the interesting camera shots like the bowling ball cam and some of the hallucinatory dream sequences and the soundtrack the coen brothers have been asked if they came up with this storyline while under the influence perhaps but i think you would have to be under the influence to find any enjoyment out of this waste of time,black_comedy
so i fell for all the hype and finally rented this turns out its an unimaginative storyline lifted from any number of thirdrate gangster flicks peopled with onedimensional cartoon characters and bogged down with a profanityladen script that doesnt even offer one memorable line if this is what passes for a great film in the current hollywood climate that only goes to demonstrate how far hollywood has fallen from the glory years of the 1940s through 1970sjeff bridges spends the entire movie doing his best tommy chong impersonation john goodman wastes his affable and agreeable screen presence on a vietnam vet still fighting the war in his mind and the rest of the characters are shabbilyconceived caricatures the filmmakers desperately tried to make this hip by introducing a steady parade of john watersesquire oddballs but the ones in this film are like prefabricated oddballs they picked up on the clearance rack at oddballmart and have none of the quaint charm and humanity of waters charactersthe inevitable plot twists and attempts at black humor are so predictable you can almost draw a schematic of the film while youre watching it when one of the characters smashes up a shiny brandnew car you can see the joke coming a mile away sorry but i couldnt find anything in this film with any originality or even any entertainment value if youre unfamiliar with the coen brothers films  trust me on this point the only good film they ever made was the man who wasnt there rent that one and forget the rest,black_comedy
i couldnt follow any of the plot because all it seemed to have in it are these two men swearing  i dont mind the swearing when it serves a purpose but this movie was ridiculous  it seemed to me that every other word was the f word  if you can get past the language you might be able to tell if there is a story to it,black_comedy
okay so read so much about this movie on internet and the ratings of 82 really will make anyone to watch this movie how do i tell you how many times did i see my watch and waited that something will happen in the movie i waited that somehow someway the movie will pick up its pace plain movie with no characters you will feel to remember all foolish guys with no remarkable dialogs stupidity with no humor so the clear hint is dont ever ever watch this movie if you liked snatch or fight club etc do watch if you liked moves like the lost highwaybrazilkiss kiss bang bang and other such crazy movies take my wordsif you dont obey the above hintyou are to suffer 2 points for i laughed may be twice between 2 hours there should also be a faq section explaining the movie cause even though i understood all mindfck moviesand i really liked many this one has clearly made me frustrated all day i guess this one is really for the americans cause may be there are cultural jokes which only the americans willunderstand really hoping that the people all over the world give genuine ratings to this movie so that others can avoid getting fooled,black_comedy
i honestly really did not enjoy this movie and actually think that it is highly overratedi am thinking of watching it again because i must have missed something there was absolutely no storyline acting was average all in all i could see nothing that separates this movie from the rest despite it being bad ok let me not be so hard there were some elements in the movie that were not bad and the movie did display unique traits i guess i was simply expecting more based on the very high imdb rating and the other comments posted i only hope that my comment will at least level the expectations of this film so that others who view it can be satisfied customers because i for one was not in summary i am giving this movie a 4 out of 10 as said above i do intend to watch this flick again and hope that i can see what others have seen anyway this is just my two centsmr blunt,black_comedy
what a product of modern lack of morals  i heard this movie was funny and it had an interesting plot  boy was i disappointed  im not one to wince at a bit of vulgar language but this movie had nothing but sexual references horrible vituperation youd think movie writers could build up their vocabulary a bit and on top of that progressed so slowly i think watching paint dry could have been more exciting  i feel sorry for anyone who was entertained by this hollywood slop  i didnt even make it to the end of the movie what a waste of 450,black_comedy
so its in the imdb top 250 i had to see it it was not funny at all it actually is a movie about nothing there are some characters thrown in for good measure that really do not serve any purpose for eg julianne moores character it was boring and at no moment in the movie did i feel like laughing hard jeff bridges is good in his role if this movie can get an average rating of 82 then by that logic the pineapple express too should be up here within the confines of the imdb top 250 the fact that it isnt and this movie is means that there is something horribly wrong with peoples perceptions my opinion is dont waste your time on this one instead go watch the pineapple express you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
my close pal persuaded me nuts to watch this movie the fact that i agreed to his persuasion shows that i learned nothing from my experience from obrother where art thou and no country for old men the fact that i was persuaded to see this movie is the reason why i am still eagerly looking for this close pal with a poison dripping machete in the hand hope he doesnt read this review till we meet againits said everything in the life has a reason behind it of course those who say it havent seen or they would have furiously denied ever having said such rot apparently cohen brothers dont believe in making a movie with a reason behind it or within it whats more apparent is that they also dont believe in making movies with any storyline plot devise characterization or a rudimentary sense of storytelling so in this respect can be held as one of their crowning achievementsthere is nothing much to say except that even your best of pals are not to be trusted these days the guy i spoke about in the first line just called me and hearing that i have forgiven him for his sin he has agreed to come over for a drink i am going to get my machete now,black_comedy
im a huge fan of the coen brothers and even their weakest films with the exception of barton fink hold some allure for me i think they simply lost their way with there is an interesting premise there  somewhere  but it gets awfully muddled up with allusions that just never go anywhere but its the coen brothers so i make an effort ive made the effort several times as a matter of fact ill hear someone whose judgment i trust lauding the film and ill think maybe this is the time ill get the beauty of this film i strive to find meaning when none is there and i cant just enjoy it for the slapstick comedy for thats not there either there is a grotesque perversion of slapstick but it doesnt work on that level and then the movie commits the greatest sin of all it just ends im not the type of guy that needs things neatly wrapped up i love the ending of no country for old men that was a great film that didnt provide easy answers and a pat ending no i fear that the coen brothers themselves didnt really know where they were going with i think the film is a failure and in no way deserves the cult following it has received5,black_comedy

no film has disappointed me as much as this one did i walked out of the theater swearing i would never watch another coen brothers film as long as i lived i felt insulted it was like they were giving us all the middle finger saying heres some mindless crap for you enjoy your happy meali had come to expect so much more from a coen brothers film now they were just cashing in on fargo and making something that would finally generate a mountain of cash the whole thing was nothing more that a giant commercial to sell a soundtrackit was the same old cast john goodman yellingagain the script is rug thin and the characters are some of the most shallow and unlikable stereotypes to ever appear on film happiness im looking at youthe movie has its moments but for people to rate it higher than raising arizona almost angers me the simple mention of this film still raises my blood pressure,black_comedy
the coen brothers joel and ethan have fired several shots here at another one of their obscure targets in this instance unlike the triumphs of millers crossing and fargo the big lebowsky misses the mark on most countsit is hard to work out what the lads were actually up to here this film contains the coen regulars such as a reluctant hero and a double twist in the plot yet so much appears to be misplaced strange dreams containing trampolining nudes and giant bowling alleys and a narrator come stranger played by sam elliott are all a little confusing maybe the coens always wanted to work with the legendary elliott as for the weird dreams well thats anybodys guessjeff bridges is ideal as the dated dude a throw back to the sixties when drugs and hippies were cool playing his close friend john goodman surprises as the shortfused vietmanvet who specialises in getting the dude deeper into trouble other bizarre roles go to the sexdeviant bowler john turturro and peter stormare as the ringleader of a german kidnapping group steve buscemi always fun gets too little time on screen playing the third of the dudes trioit is a shame the big lebowsky didnt have the focus coen brothers films normally have the pic just tends too much towards fantasy to have any real impactfriday november 27 1998  astor theatre stkilda,black_comedy
the coen brothers reached what may have been their zaniest with about stoner jeff lebowski jeff bridges getting mistaken for a tycoon david huddleston leading to complete wackiness needless to say the wacky factor dominates along with jeff theres his slacker friends the motormouth walter john goodman and the loopy donny steve buscemi as for the side characters i liked maudes julianne moore remark about conception and the narrators sam elliott note about saddam hussein its just a great hilarious even humanizing movie also starring are john turturro as a sex offender and philip seymour hoffman as a servant fyi when john goodman said all that stuff about judaism you may have thought that it was total nonsense given his character but it was all totally accurateto think john goodman starred in four movies within two months of the ones that i saw this one was great fallen was obviously ripped off of wes cravens shocker and i must have been the only person who liked blues brothers 2000ps did you notice that the date on the check was september 11 1991 hmm,black_comedy
watched at home on video with a few beers  even this did not elevate this rueful film  the bad language was funny at first but soon became tedious  a word that just about sums up this mishmash of wasted actors  fing in just about every sentence how puerile  teenagers should love itbridges made a fine 90s hippie but that drink he was forever embibing made me feel ill  booze with milk in it  he always seemed a bit like a sloth that had just ate a valium and prozac sandwich  quite humerous    goodmans character was a bit twodimensional but his vietnamrelated rants were quite funny  as for the third guy who died of a heart attack  why rubbish ending etcplot  what plot    it was disjointed and far too quirky for me  not recommended unless you are a bit unbalanced and love tenpin bowling that is,black_comedy
i guess i have trouble appreciating the coen brothers blood simple and raising arizona were very good the otherskeep em is a confusing mess that is i presume supposed to be funny steve buscemi is completely wasted as is john turturo jeff bridges is all over the map none of it makes any sense at all and if you insist that it does then turn in your amateur movie critic card i agree with so many others what a waste of time,black_comedy
this has never been my type of comedy im not a cohen bros kind of guy i was in the mood to watch this for the first time the other night 20 years lateri love jeff bridges character he is great i love john goodman as an actor but his character here was more annoying than anything i think steve buscemis character should have been more developed and involved and taken some screen time from goodman a little goodman in this character would have been hilarious but not overly played out,black_comedy
i saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and i guess i was too young to understand just how good it was because i have not seen it again since now this movie is just perfect with outstanding writing from the cohen brothers who always find new ways to make interesting stories and quirky fun characters with all the actors doing such a bang up belieavle job this movie does everything rightthis movie is about jeffery lebowski everyone calls the dude bridges an unemployed loser who does nothing pretty much other then bowl one night two young thugs bust into his place thinking he was a million of the same name after figuring out he wasnt they peed on his rug and took off so the dude went to the million for compensation for his rug but when he gets there the old millionaire has a proposistion for himthis movie was just so good it felt so real and believable mainly thanks to the awesome writing and acting it is interesting and hilarious it really is a must see,black_comedy
the coen brothers is a quirky oddball comedy which succeeds in providing original characters and scenes of comedic wit however the eccentricities at times are too outlandish and frustrates the viewing experiencethe film follows the dude played by jeff bridges who is mistaken for a richnamesake the consequence of this mistaken identity leads the dude and his psychoticfriend walter sobchak on a journey of doublecross and bewildermentthe film is creative and supplies a number of good oneliners on the whole you are happy to go along with the oddity of the story the lebowskis one big drawback is its rather impeding dream sequences which are rather illfitting without these dream sequences the film would have flowed a lot better however instead it leaves you aghast at the incongruity of there inclusion these moments together with other eccentric creations shifts strength as a storywithout doubt jon goodman is the star of the film jon goodmans character walter sobchak is a somewhat jekyl and hyde individual walters actions and words are the underlying strength of the film his predominantly psychopathic exvietnam vet reactions contorted with his apparent intellectual mind make him one of the most memorable characters unfortunately steve buscemi role as donny is more the opposite and i disliked the gimmicky inclusion of the characteris not an altogether bad film jon goodman provides a great performance which invigorates the story but the coens quirkiness was just a little too overbearing for me and i felt at times an unnecessary distraction,black_comedy
you i have never seen me shut the  up donny you im sorry me youre outta your element you youre scaring me now me ha it dont matter to jesus you what listen who do you think you are me im the dudethats what you call me you okay dude i am hanging up now me and a good day to you sir click 10 seconds later ring ring ring ring ring phones ringin dude this was an imaginary conversation between me and anyone who has not seen so please save yourself a lot of trouble and see the movie you do not want this conversation to happen to you what can i say that hasnt already been said about this film nuthin youll just have to see it for yourself,black_comedy
the first time i saw i was incapable of speaking during the movie it was literally so hilarious that i could do nothing but laugh during its running time at some points i was laughing so hard that i nearly fell off of my chair and tears ran down my face i had already seen several coen brothers films before seeing this movie including the masterpiece fargo and the hilarious raising arizona so i had high expectations going in these expectations were more than exceeded they were shattered by nonstop laughter john goodman gives perhaps the funniest performance in any movie ive ever seen and jeff bridges is the dude nobody else could have played that role the day after seeing it for the first time i watched it again and it was even funnier than the first time if that is possible in the multiple viewings since then i am still laughing out loud and finding new quotable lines is rare in that it is not just hysterical but it is also smart while i enjoy stupid comedies like zoolander and dumb and dumber it is so much better when the humor is both hilarious and clever is the funniest movie ive ever seen and one of my all time favorites i give it my highest recommendation 1010,black_comedy
i have seen many comedies and to rate a comedy will be hard because there are not too many good comedies its rarely you can laugh trough a whole movie but this is a comedy to seeand its rare to find a comedy that has the rating 9 but this movie is anines when you seen this movie you want to watch it over and over and over again jeff bridges is so good as the dude and you will find the character so cool you want to be himhe represents how a unemployed can be a good thinggoodman is almost as funny as jeff is with his aggressive characteryou dont want to miss when he get angry as for recommendationsgo see it if you like comedys this is the movie that will make you laugh almost every second trough the movie very funny movie to enjoy,black_comedy
a typical coen movie  plot intertwined with subplot intertwined with another subplot intertwined with seemingly genuine and lovable characters as well as lovetohate characters whats not to love about the dude i aspire to be more like him everyday and even if thats the only thing you take away from this film it would be well worth it this guy introduced me to white russian caucasian cocktails  vodka kahlua and cream try to keep up with the plot learn to love donnie but overall enjoy the laid back humour and classic one liners that youll be repeating over and overand overand over again,black_comedy
this film still blows me away even after about 30 viewings it is a blend of film noirdetective filmthe big sleep maltese falconall through the nightcomedy the funny thing about it is you dont even realize that it is a detective film until youve seen it 23 times i was loosely aware but it really sank in after the 3rd viewing im slow i know the dudejeff bridgesis in just about every scene if not every scene you get so caught up in watching him his laid backness and his compatriots that you forget they are actually involved in trying to negotiate a ransom drop and recover a kidnap victim the dude is a reluctant hero along the lines of rick from casablanca although not so self centered and altruistic as rick it is evident from the start that the dude would much rather be bowling and have a drinka white russian or as he called it a caucasian than have the responsibility of saving anyones lifethere may not be as many classic lines in this film as there are in the great films i compared it to abovebut there are as many if not more lines that get quoted by those who know and love this filmthe last time i saw thisbig lebowski i kept asking myself what film does it remind me of the most then it hit methe big sleep ,black_comedy
is a brilliant comedy but it also has a very unique plot if you liked fargo you might also like this because it involves a simple plot but involves several incidents that add to the story and make it funnier as it goesthere are several unique characters like the artist played by julianne moore the hispanic bowler named jesus played by john turturro and one of my favorite characters is the boisterous bowler named walter who is played by john goodman the story is centered around a lowlife bowler named jeff lebowski or the dude as everyone calls him one day his house is broken into and his beloved carpet is soiled all because he was mistaken for a multimillionaire with the same last name as him he tries to get help from but doesnt get anything until the big lebowki needs help and the dude and his bowling buddies decide to assist him the result is an entertaining and wickedly hilarious trip to regaining the dudes prized possessionthe plot is simple at first until it gets more complex the film requires more viewings to appreciate everything but there is still plenty to like the first time you see it such as the humor the camera angle shown through the finger hole of a bowling ball and the clever dream sequences see this film once to be entertained but see it several other times to realize the genius that was involved in it,black_comedy
is rare in the world of motion pictures its like a well written book like dune or lotr in that you can walk away with something new from it with each repeated viewing the cohen brothers put a lot of thought into their films and is no exceptiontalking crap about a movie is the easiest thing to do and ive read a few reviews that have done just that about lebowski in these peoples defense its easy to jump to this conclusion because at first glance it appears to be a meaningless film but if it were meaningless why set the film during the first gulf war why do a period piece set 7 years before the movies release because theyre playing with allegory here trying to say something about americathere is much evidence of this the perceptive viewer will note that were dealing with clearly cut characters that embody archetypes of american culture were also dealing with events that mimic the political and sociological landscape of 1991 in addition most period pieces splash nostalgia all over the screen but theres hardly any in lebowski this movie is a humorous tongueincheek statement about the health of the american character circa 1991but even if you take the meaning of the movie out of the equation is a top notch film the characters and their interactions in the movie are entertaining the direction plums the depths of their potential and brings it out for us to enjoy the scenes work to promote the themes of the movie and give us a good laugh in the process the cohens did their job and then some on this one and it seems to me like they had a damn good time doing it,black_comedy
this is a great movie with no flaws my opinion of course also the performances were impeccable although no awards or nominations were given it was still great this is a movie you can watch over and over again and still laugh every time but this movie is not for some people like those who are contradictical of bowling drugs kidnappings crime or nudity it received and deserved its r rating that statement is mabey the only negativity ill do on such a great film but to e honest i almost didnt see this on account of i thought it would be completely different and because of no nominations of any awards but this movie actually has made me think outside of the box for movies why else would i see malibus most wanted,black_comedy
when a couple of guys pee on the dudes rug everything goes out of control and i do mean everything backed up by his two bowling buddies donny the looser and walter the crazy veteran the dude gets pulled into a chain of events which drags him through the movie the leading bridgesgoodmanbuscemi trio is outstanding both bridges and goodmans best performances as actors buscemi only bettered this one in fargo the screenplay is hilarious every line is a joke the supporting actors are as good as the main trio ive watched this movie over a dozen times and im still discovering new jokes this is really a masterpiece it just keeps getting better and better,black_comedy
is one of the most talked about comedies ever created when i first saw it i hated it then a year later i ended up rewatching it and liking it then loving it then i was hookedthe movie opens up with some old random dude telling us a story he explained all about his fascination with the dude then we see how the story all begins in the middle we meet a lot of bizarre characters such as the laughing man the fat boring kid the nazianalysts and the bald guy in the little buggyby the end of the movie you will probably dislike or be confused with the film but by the 4th time around you wont ever understand how you could ever dislike it,black_comedy
i have to say first off that this movie is not as good as people said it was in fact i found it to be very disappointing  the humor is subtle and in my opinion barely existant  john goodman was the main reason i continued to watch the film as he offered a character whose unpredictability sparked some interest in a almost uninteresting plotits not a bad film it just never seems to go anywhere or offer anything id recommend to watch it if you have the chance with nothing better to do just for the sake of seeing a movie that isnt trash  however at the same time dont expect a masterpiece of cinema or a great filmthe movie isnt funny for the most part but i guess that depends on what makes you laugh  in the end though its safe to say i wont be watching this movie again,black_comedy
this is one of those films i watched because i thought i would look cool when i told my friends about it but in fact i would not tell them about it because i wanted to keep it to myself  it captures a mood and tells a very simple story along the way i watched fargo and thought it was ok but did not think it was that good but this was just the dude,black_comedy
is a movie to watch again and again  and yet enjoy its subtle humour and great atmosphere everytime the coen brothers truely are great filmmakers  constantly providing us with witty original scripts and deep memorable characters as with all the coen films  is driven by sharp dialogue and excellent characters the dude is the personification of laziness acted to perfection by jeff bridges always wearing the same tatty clothes and hilariously drinking a milky white russian hey man i got a beverage here we first meet the dude in a shopping mall  with milk on his moustache  hilariously writing a cheque for 69cents john goodman is the jewish vietnam veteran walter schobchek  taking every opportunity to shout about his dead buddies from the war and shout at donny steve buchemi donny is a quiet man with very little impact on the narrative  however the comedic relationship between him walter and the dude is a charmthe atmosphere created here gives superb viewing with top notch cinematography and genuine if obscure relationships between the odd characters but what you will remember most from this film are the hilarious quotations  f it dude let go bowling well thats just like your opinion man and obviously your not privy to the new st man to name just a couple,black_comedy
is the greatest movie of all time except for maybe taxi driver but these films cant be compared  i live in the real life big lebowski i am exactly like walter my best friend is the dude and donny is a friend who is 6foot6 and pure irish  we also have jesus who is my next door neighbor he is italian a sick pervert amd everything but the coolest thing about this movie is the entire thing is about the dudes rug it ties the room together man,black_comedy
i have seen numerous times and each time it only gets better  this has to be jeff bridges best role and he was flawless  john goodman was also amazing  essentially the coen brothers are making it happen 24 hours a day churning out great movies and the insane style of this movie cannot be overlooked as pure genius,black_comedy
its not all that not all that funny not all that imaginative not all that entertaining etc it is however a disappointing turn by some of my favorite actors  jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi  in a showcase of unrealized potential under written and overacted this film does nothing but tarnish the sterling reputation the coen brothers previous and subsequent works accomplish by far not the worst movie ive ever seen it just doesnt achieve must see status,black_comedy
i watched this movie with high expectations it is a regular movie with famous actors,black_comedy
this is a cut and paste mishmash of caricatures and stereotypes as most coen movies are the shame is that the caricatures are awkward and insult ones intelligence as well as the targets of the caricatures they even manage to insult and degrade 1930s musicals all that might be partially forgivable if it was funny but it never gets past the cringe stage as for the story there really isnt one there is just an excuse to wander from one absurd meaningless barely coherent scene to the next in one sense it is truly post modern ie there is no meaning no theme other than impossible dysfunctional characters thrown together to no purpose and you cannot feel good about any of it or take away anything useful from watching themcritics and people in the industry seem to give not just the benefit of the doubt to the coen brothers any paint they throw at a wall is hyped and sold as some kind of high art but there might be method to that madness if this kind of thing can be elevated to high art it allows anything slapped together with a splash to be likewise elevated in the mean time movies as an art form and a cultural expression are down graded again while presumably the profits continue to flow if that is what is going on then this movie starts to make sensethe only redeeming things i can see about this movie is that john goodman tried to do something with the wretched material he was given and sam elliot just manages to maintain his dignity as the writing and directing attempts to drag him down into ridiculousness but if i think about it too long i might conclude that they became caricatures of themselves again that might be forgivable if it was funny but it isntas for jeff bridges he seems to be deliberately trying to act badly ie blatantly artificial to what end i am not sure did the directors want that possibly the coen brothers have certainly used unnatural characters beforedid juliane moore enjoy her incomprehensible role it didnt make sense even in the vacuous context of the movieplease dont fall for the hype see garbage for what it is this is not classic or significant in any positive sense,black_comedy
just do a language analysis of the reviews obiously the coen brothers paid fake reviewers to talk up their crap movie save your self the pain do not watch this movie,black_comedy
i had no control of the video when it was shown and due to circumstances could not leave the language in this movie is sickening no one needs to hear f this andor f that practically every sentence what i will do is to tell people not to rent the movie,black_comedy
i have no idea why this movie got such high rate i have read 30 reviews for other users what i see is i need to see it at least 4 times to find its genius ideas or thingsbut i am not that patient after 2 times really annoyed and hurt for see this stupid and hear lots of f words i finally have to give up on it,black_comedy
sometimes theres a film i wont say a masterpiece cause whats a masterpiece but sometimes theres a film and im talking about here sometimes theres a film well its the film for its time and place it fits right in there hardcore film nerd or not many of us probably have a goto film that weve seen countless times and know the lines almost by heart but still enjoy it as much every time well to me is that filmtrying to deconstruct what is so funny or brilliant about it is probably somewhat counterproductive but i will say that it is one of the best scripts i have ever seen and the characters as well as the cast behind them are nothing short of perfection and most of all it is so insanely entertaining and quotableyou know hes got emotional problems man you mean beyond pacifism,black_comedy
coen brothers are famous for their inventiveness as they never repeat the themes of their filmsthe same thing can be said about their erratic choice of actorsinwe see some of the best talented actors of hollywood doing highly unconventional rolesthe beauty with a brain julianne moore plays a hard to believe adult movie starjeff bridges is nice as a bumjohn goodman and steve buscemi are good too as a bunch of good for nothingsregarding the best comment should concentrate on the films raison dtreit is about creating funny episodes out of nothingsometimes it is a nice feeling when while watching a film people decide not to bother about plotcamera etc and start enjoying the poetry of nothingnessit is this senseless yet charming session of mirth that has been created by coen brothersa different yet unusually similar film comes to my mind a wish called wandathose who have seen both the films will not hesitate in declaring that both of them provide a century of laughs,black_comedy
if you see any greatest film lists or if your looking for top award winners you will never find film critics will not praise it as it doesnt really have any underlying message on life love or the dangers of drugs or whatever they would feel ashamed to admit that this is one of the best films ever fortunately thanks to the regular film viewers on imdb gets the praise it so rightfully deserves and a cemented place in the top 250it offers so many things it has the usual brilliant coen bros script with its twisting plot and humour it has so many unusual and wonderful characters it really is one of the funniest films ever they could have easily taken the script and made it into a good thriller but the coens made it into so much morethe characters are just brilliant jeff bridges is great as the dude who never fails to have a drink in his hand and ends each sentence with man john goodman puts in a terrific performance as a vietnam veteran who turns into a raving lunatic at the drop of a hat but doesnt roll on shabbah my favourite performance comes from steve buscemi despite only having a relatively small part he maintains a rather puzzled expression throughout only to interrupt conversations at random intervals the coens could have easily left donnie out of the film but its little additions like him that make this film greattheres so many great quotes and scenes in the film and showing the dreams in the weird mind of the dude such as the scene with the flying carpet just adds a bizarre yet wonderful quality that most comedies dont haveat the end of the film after viewing all the wacky characters danger and plot twists the dude brings to your attention that all he wanted was his rug this just adds to the comic approach the coens went for and leaves you feeling happy and warm inside as you have just witnessed such greatness on screenwhen i look at the fact that won just 1 minor award it just proves that there is no justice in the world of film and i find it hard to swallow that such genius can go unrewardedby my reckoning this is one of the coen brothers finest achievements to date up there with fargo and millers crossing and believe me that is some achievement their unique and clever scripts show they have so much more imagination than most screen writers and despite the fact they havent made a really great film for a few years i hope they are just laying dormant and will give us another wonderful film such as,black_comedy
all folks is very excited about this movie in asked myself if i maybe didnt get the point for me its just an average light comedy nothing special,black_comedy
1998 was written and directed by the coen brothersit features some great actors jeff bridges john goodman julianne moore steve buscemi and philip seymour hoffman however in my opinion their talents are wasted in this filmits about getting high getting hit and getting out maybe it would work better if you watched it when you were stonedthis film has an amazing imdb rating of 81 everyone liked it even the top thousand reviewers who rarely like any movie i gave it a 30 its one of those films where i say did those people see the same movie i sawis considered a cult classic and you cant say you know movies until youve watched it at least once in my opinion once is more than enough its a loser,black_comedy
the fact that it has a very slow and boring narrative is uncontroversial even the most avid and diehard fans agree about that  as one reviewer rightly said that ppl are fan of its characters and their style not its story i happen to believe after reading both sides of the story and patiently finishing the movie that those who have embraced dudes lazy toexistonly for fun and avoid hard work by lying to oneself routine will identify with the characters and become huge fan of the movie while those who abhore his way of living and his even taking a kidnapping for granted and making excuses  lying because he doesnt want to get out of his comfort zone kind of attitude will absolutely detest the film i would say the lazy narrative was a mirror image of life of a slacker and i commend coen brothers for making such a tongueincheek kind of movie on the life of slackers  lazy ppl who find excuses to avoid work and getting out of their comfort zone and the sad fact of the real world remains that there are slackers every where,black_comedy
hilarious performances from jeff bridges and especially john goodman telling the story of slacker jeff lebowski this movie will make you die laughing plenty of random stupid hilarious moments watch it dude,black_comedy
when you set out to relax and forget about your mostly miserable lifethis is the type of entertainment you should seek the characters are superbly portrayed  the story written perfectly for them so many great things i could say but i dont really like typing soooo just watch the masterpiece and rate it 10 stars here when your surfing the web looking for for nothing remember tune inturn ondrop outculture is not your friend and its just a ride,black_comedy
20 year old movies do not usually get better with age but this one certainly does lifes absurdities personified in some unforgettable characters an awesome cast and some of the best and most quotable dialogue in movie history every time you watch it you see something different and really appreciate the painstaking planning the coen brothers go through to make a movie truly theirs quirky as hell and not a comedy for those who need to be hit over the head with jokes and gags see what condition your condition is in and watch it again for the first time you wont be sorry,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies ever made after watching it for the first time i liked it but when i watched it again i just simply loved it its just one funny ride from beginning to the end you can watch it as many times as you like and still find it funny jeff bridges at his best with perfect john goodman steve buscemi julianne moore and others coen brothers just gave us something rather special and you just cant go wrong with this movie its hard for me to understand why some people giving it only one star as its clearly 910 stars moviebut as dude said yeah wellyou know thats just like your opinion man,black_comedy
one of my favourite movies great comedydrama amazing actors in this movie jeff bridges greatest movie im the dudepunchlines are perfect film gets slow at times thats they only reason why its not 1010 id say 910 would recommend this movie,black_comedy
one of the most watchable movies of all time quirky in all the best ways,black_comedy
if is a comedy then why did it fail to make me laugh out loud sure i chuckled at one scene that i can recall but on the whole it didnt make me laugh and i didnt find it to be all that funny while may be a big hit with some it wasnt with me pass,black_comedy
a movie about a rug bowling buddies why not make a movie about a lost toothbrush and friends in a chat room the fat slob is supposed to be entertaining i have nothing against jeff bridges i vaguely recall him from my young adulthood and i liked him in kpax as the main character in this movie his part was a slob i dont know why this movie is rated highly you would have to be a really great actor with lots of help from the creative departments to overcome the slobbery character he didnt do it for me maybe its the nostalgia that most people like an actor must be enjoyable to watch regardless of the character this just wasnt if youre a big fan of jeff bridges and you must see this movie i hope you find it much more entertaining than i did,black_comedy
i love this movie so much anybody who doesnt like it must be name donny why because he must be out of his element so shut up donny it felt like a live freeflowing work of comedy action and mystery is an american classic that defied initial critical and box office failure to become a treasure of a film this is one of the coens brothers most cleverly devised and executed stories the plot surrounds the story about the laziest man in los angeles county unemployed loser jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges who get mistaken for philanthropic millionaire jeffrey lebowski david huddleston by henchman hired by pornographer gangster jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude is a fairly good character with white russia in hand every time you will hear that name a lot about 161 times in the movie they rough him up and urine on his rug before last threaten to kill the millionaires sexy young wife bunny tara reid who the dude has no clue of with his bowling buddies securitystore owner and suppose vietnam vet walter sobchak john goodman and mildmannered exsurfer donny steve buscemi take a raymond chandler like journey into the world of crime violence sex drugs and rock n roll to find another rug this movie has a world of its own there is nothing i can think of comparing it to and it was a great experience and i still enjoy watching it donnie walter and the dude were made for buscemi goodman and bridges the supporting cast is great as well i like julianne moore as maude lebowski philip seymour hoffman as brandt peter stormare as karl hungus and last john turturro as jesus they all had memorable scenes and many unforgettable quotes the character jesus potential was totally wasted in my opinion as he didnt serve anything to the plot lots of profanitylaced repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue that was a hit or a miss for some viewers i got the humor but for some people they might see this as dumb the editing needs some work as there is a lot of continuity problems some crew visible and a few audiovisual unsynchronized talking about audio theres a soundtrack worth checking out i love the spanish flamenco version of the eagless hotel california it was awesome another song worth checking is just dropped in by kenny rodgers drifts through an elaborate bowling fantasy sequence titled gutterballs nearly all of the visible symbols in the dudes second dream sequence are taken from earlier scenes while its pretty good scene it was kinda out of place it was pretty pointless was i the only one totally lost when this scene played the first time watching it theres something incredibly philosophical about the appearances of saddam hussein and the gulf war in this movie theyre like an antithesis to the dude while the dude signifies the spirit of peace and and calm in the movie saddam symbolizes violence and war by being one of the greatest villains of the second half of the 20th century the movie is often use for use as social and political analysis of many topics such as carnivalesque of modern society commodity fetishism neoconservatism etc etc in my opinion while it does talk about major topic it never does finish or make sense in the end of the film there isnt a complex climax to the film sam elliot appears at the conclusion to spout some bewildering nonsense thats meant to tack an explanation onto the end deep i guess so that might disappoint some people what is it all really about who knows lets just go bowling time heals all critical misconceptions i guess as the movie fail when it came out but grew into a cult following this movie is like a good rug really tied the room together when looking at it,black_comedy
funniest freakin movie ever the characters in this movie are some of the best ever the dude has got to be my favorite person and john goodman the vietnam vet was hilarious as well gosh what happens when you put a fantastic script in a room with some of the most talented actorsyou get a great movie in the case of a fabulous moviewarning if you are an anally retentive person you might not be able to handle the unconventional approachalso beware it is r rated so not for the younguns,black_comedy
the dude lebowski just wanted to get his rug replaced after a couple of thugs mistaken the dude for a big shot millionaire of the same name and urinate on his rug this simple act of degradation starts the dude on a path of absurdity involving a trophy wife german nihilists a crippled millionaire a neoexpressionist feminist artist kidnappers a vietnam veteran and porn producers all vying for a million dollars in cash to further complicate matters the dude has to deal with a good ol boy police system and a bumbling private eyecomplications idiots schemes cons and doublecrossing are all ingredients needed to make a successful cohen brothers film and that is exactly what this is one of the cohen brothers biggest hits is considered one of the best cultclassics of all time in true cohen brothers form this film is packed with big name stars that all turn in superb performances jeff bridges john goodman julliane moore steve buscemi phillip seymour hoffman peter stormare and david huddleston are all on top of their game and the cohen brothers bring out the best in them the dude lebowski who wants nothing more than to bowl with his friends in a local bowling league gets wrapped up in a kidnapping plot involving a million dollars of course there are several other players that are interested in obtaining that cash a true antihero the dude is a remnant of the late sixties counterculture movement living in the late 90s as he lived back then smoking weed drinking white russians and just taking it easy as the dude stumbles throughout the film in his own lovable way he starts to figure out all the ins and outs and whathaveyous of the current game being played by the players in the film very very loosely based on the raymond chandler novel the big sleep pays a certain amount of homage to the original source material without being an obvious portrayal of the novel the cohen brothers have successfully transformed the gritty hardboiled detectives novel into their own unique form of comedy and entertainment and as in other cohen brothers works the mystery doesnt ravel in a traditional form with all the answers being given to you at the end with an exposition instead each subplot ends at some point in the film and you the filmviewer are responsible for picking up that fact one of my favorite aspects about the cohens is that they respect the audiences intelligence a bit more than most thereby not patronizing with endless expositiona smart slick comedy this film is highly recommended for those who enjoy films that fall under that category the excellent acting and directing by all involved have truly formed a cultclassicthe dude abides i dont know about you but i take comfort in that its good knowin hes out there the dude takin er easy for all us sinners shoosh i sure hope he makes the finals the stranger,black_comedy
i would say that big lebowski has to be one of the funniest movies ive ever seen and i have seen a lot there is kind of a circle of life thingin the world of la slackers everything works out man dont worry donnie dies little lebowski is born thus it continues but you dont watch this for the message its got an excuse for a plot at least big lebowskis wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped the dude lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pied upon in a misunderstanding seeking compensation for the rug which really tied the room together he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks introduce a trio of nihilists with marmot a halfcrazed feminist painter julianne moore a porno film industry and a gay pedophile whos extremely competitive about bowling john turturro and youve got itthe ultimate stoned slacker comedy jeff bridges is far out as the dude and hilariously understated while john goodman is his psychotically violent nam vet best friend who carries a piece to a bowling alley and john turturro is forever etched into my memory as jesus quintana spoken to walter you got a date for wednesday baby whoo walter hes cracking steve buscemi was adorably pathetic as donnie the third wheel one of the best quotes donnie are these the nazis walter walter no donnie these men are nihilists theres nothing to be afraid of it was very memorable with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watchingthe coens signature style doesnt come through here like it does in fargo and its not overly artistic wellin parts maybe but its so funny excellent excellent especially the dudes stoned dreams which feature saddam hussein renting out bowling shoes,black_comedy
i recommended this movie to a friend of mine and he asked me what kind of movie it was i answered its the best movie ever made why he asked and i answered why not seriously why not it has the most amazing characters you can pick your favorite sure but non of them sucks and they are all played brilliantly it has the most amazing dialogs everything that is said in this movie is just so brilliant if you dont agree then thats just like your opinion man it has the most amazing story its both strange and interesting and the way its told keeps your eyes on the screen the whole time ive probably seen this movie about 20 times now and i enjoy it every time every god damn time its brilliant and mindblowing and funny and enjoyable and etc so i ask again why is it not the best movie ever made why the hell is the big lebowsky not the best movie ever made,black_comedy
i first watched about 12 years ago and i was extremely underwhelmed by it  i liked it  sure  but i couldnt see what all the fuss was about since then i have had a love hate relationship with the coen brothers movies some of their films i really have not liked such as o brother where art thou and the ladykillers and recently i have enjoyed the likes of no country for old men and burn after reading  so i decided to go back and watch again and see if  with age  i had become accustomed to their humour and the answer is yesand no jeff lebowski is the victim of mistaken identity two thugs break into his apartment in the errant belief that they are accosting jeff lebowski the pasadena millionairenot the laidback unemployed stuck in the 70s jeff lebowski who calls himself the dude the dudes first mistake is paying a visit to his wealthy namesake in the hopes of getting a replacement for his soiled carpet but instead of a persian loaner our reluctant hero and his buddy walter are swept up in a coenesque comedythriller of extortion doublecross deception embezzlement sex and dope it takes guys as simple as the dude and walter to make a story this complicatedand theyd really rather be bowling there is no doubt about it that has some memorable moments the characters are fantastic  jeff bridges as the dude  jon goodman as walter sobchak and john turturro as jesus quintana are the standout performers and they have the best lines in the movie i love the way jeff bridges is the dude he is so perfect in that role that it could have been written for him  maybe it was  goodman is also outstanding as the wannabe jew who is highly strung and aggressive and again the role is perfect for him now for the problem with the film the plot i really feel the story is too weak and at times a little too confusing  i know thats maybe the idea the coens had when writing this but it does spoil it a little for me there are times when i felt myself drifting because it was becoming too convoluted also the julianne moore character seemed unnecessary and became another distraction the best way to explain the way i feel about is that the characters are far too big for what is a pretty lame story and at times they swamp it im glad i went back to watch this movie again but i still feel its not quite justified in the admiration it still gets i first watched about 12 years ago and i was extremely underwhelmed by it  i liked it  sure  but i couldnt see what all the fuss was about since then i have had a love hate relationship with the coen brothers movies some of their films i really have not liked such as o brother where art thou and the ladykillers and recently i have enjoyed the likes of no country for old men and burn after reading  so i decided to go back and watch again and see if  with age  i had become accustomed to their humour and the answer is yesand nojeff lebowski is the victim of mistaken identity two thugs break into his apartment in the errant belief that they are accosting jeff lebowski the pasadena millionairenot the laidback unemployed stuck in the 70s jeff lebowski who calls himself the dude the dudes first mistake is paying a visit to his wealthy namesake in the hopes of getting a replacement for his soiled carpet but instead of a persian loaner our reluctant hero and his buddy walter are swept up in a coenesque comedythriller of extortion doublecross deception embezzlement sex and dope it takes guys as simple as the dude and walter to make a story this complicatedand theyd really rather be bowlingthere is no doubt about it that has some memorable moments the characters are fantastic  jeff bridges as the dude  jon goodman as walter sobchak and john turturro as jesus quintana are the standout performers and they have the best lines in the movie i love the way jeff bridges is the dude he is so perfect in that role that it could have been written for him  maybe it was  goodman is also outstanding as the wannabe jew who is highly strung and aggressive and again the role is perfect for him now for the problem with the film the plot i really feel the story is too weak and at times a little too confusing  i know thats maybe the idea the coens had when writing this but it does spoil it a little for me there are times when i felt myself drifting because it was becoming too convoluted also the julianne moore character seemed unnecessary and became another distraction the best way to explain the way i feel about is that the characters are far too big for what is a pretty lame story and at times they swamp it im glad i went back to watch this movie again but i still feel its not quite justified in the admiration it still gets clear rating,black_comedy
the coen brothers are freaking geniuses their body work is amongst the best ever they keep getting better  better each time they get us something new known as a cultfavorite today is undoubtedly an outstanding film in all respectsis zany entertainer where the dude explores event by event happening simultaneously the dude  walter are the funniest movie characters ever believe me on this one guys this ones a masterpiececoens writing  direction both are astounding the journey of the dude is hilarious making you relish every moment roger deakins cinematography is of internationalstandards acting wise jeff the dude bridges delivers a chilledout  relaxed performance hes a legend john walter goodman is excellent delivering his careers finest work steve buscemi is superb moore looks beautiful  delivers a killer performance david huddleston is fabulous as mrleboswki hoffman has always been a superb actor and overhere hes as good as ever tara reid is funny in her partno more discussions here the dude rules,black_comedy
does this film big lebowski presage the 911 tragedy even though it was produced in 1998 3 years before the tragedy if it does what does that imply  let us first examine the evidence that support that this film does indeed presage the 911 tragedywhat evidence is there to support this claim you ask  evidence that will support the claim jeff bridges dates a check for half  half creamer with the date of september 11 then the camera immediately pans to a tv broadcast of king george herbert walker bush the 1rst decrying the aggression saddam was greenlighted by us ambassador to un april glasbie under the direction of king george i to attack kuwait as this was their concern not ours glasbie to saddam has no opinion on interarab disputes such as your border dispute with kuwait effectively double crossing their agent saddam just as they did their foolish change agent  prescott bush protg and financial aid recipient hitleralso in the film there is a scene where a man working the shoe rack  a bowling alley an obvious double of saddam points to the number 11 on a giant tower of a shoe rack stretching up to the moonyou be the judgesimply youtube 911 hidden in hollywood,black_comedy
there never was before and there probably never will be a film quite like it has a typical film noir story arc mixed with a couple of stoner characters and a hip setting in the early 1990s los angeles that creates a great atmosphere to watch the action unfold this is raymond chandler on vacation relaxed and willing to stretch out and let loosewhen it first premiered this was quite a misunderstood movie people couldnt believe that this was written produced and directed by the same team who made that brilliant crime thriller fargo from two years before yet this kind of movie shows how creative and daring the coen brothers are they dont try to make just one kind of film they branch out and try different ideas until they hit upon one that works and they had to know from the start that a character like the dude would work with the wonderfully laid back jeff bridges in the title role the dude abides as one of the greatest of all movie characters perhaps the coens have ever written and one that will be remembered for agesof course where would the dude be without his able partner walter sobchak that vietnamcrazy screaming jew who takes his bowling almost as serious as his religion john goodman gives perhaps his most memorable performance and it is a great one thoroughly entertaining as well as very funny and then there is donny played with sweet naivet by steve buscemi donny doesnt do or say much but i think he represents the audience just there for the ride and seeing the story unfold only because he enjoys the company of the dude and walter despite his constant yelling at himthis is a movie that could be discussed and analyzed forever in terms of its plot dream sequences and ways it adheres to oldfashion storytelling with modern film making but perhaps the coens simply wanted it enjoyed on its most basic level as the story of a man called dude who had his rug peed on and sought destitute for it and that is because that rug really tied the room together this is a completely original and unforgettable movie that must be seen by any coen brothers or modern movie fan,black_comedy
possibly the funniest movie ive ever seen perfect character development and acting combined with an outthere but flawlesslyinterwoven series of plots are the perfect combination for laughs i cant get enough of this movie and neither will youthis story follows three bowling buddies lebowski aka the dude jeff bridges an aging burnout hippie with a carefree laidback manner walter john goodman a large vietnam war veteran who approaches his daily life and philosophy as if he were still at war and donnie steve buschemi a dimwit follower placed mostly for comic relief a case of mistaken identity gets the three caught up in the aftermath of a kidnapping and watching their antics as they try to sort their way through the situation is as funny a thing as ive seeni think the beauty in this movie is that there dont have to be any jokes or actual attempts to be funny to produce a laugh the characters just by being themselves make the movie funny every scene where theyre in the bowling alley talking to each other theres no joke or attempt at humor just a burnout a dimwit and a gun toter with posttraumatic stress disorder sitting there talking for five minutes and i die laughing heck there doesnt even have to be dialog the scene where lebowski is driving down the road smoking a roach two minutes go by from start to end without an intelligible word of dialog and i must have laughed 3 times or his reaction to being forced in the limo watch out theres a beverage here he was being serious and that by itself made it funny just by being themselves the characters are funny and hence the movie is funny well that and a few wellplaced dream sequences if you havent seen this movie drop what youre doing and run to the video store you are in for a treat,black_comedy
a strong cast excellent performances a sparkling script a belly laugh in just about every scene and a delightfully absurd shaggy dog story plot that nevertheless holds you all the way the best honour i can give it is to say that ive seen it more times than any other film in fact recently i rented it out for a week and watched it every night for three consecutive nights a tad obsessive by anyones standards maybe  but it still had me rolling about each time those who find it stupid boring for potheads only etc well i can only feel sorry for them theyre missing something fundamental this is filmmaking storytelling performing and writing at the very top of the game easily for my money the best that the coen brothers have ever made a unique distillation of all of their considerable talents absolutely 10 out of 10,black_comedy
the thing about tbl is if you have never seen it it sounds like the most boring film of all time i find myself chuckling to myself and when my wife asks why i will quote a part of the film laugh some more and then she threatens to leave me the film is clever on so many levels first of all it picks a time in history where very few movies back track to it pick a subject matter that very few films pick  bowling porn movies nihilists etc etc great performances jon goodman especially was just made for the role above all the script for this film is so tight that you can watch this film time after time and not get tired of it and goodmans speech on the cliff to the dead donny is one of the greatest bits of film ever,black_comedy
is perhaps the most surreal film from the coen brothers who have made their careers on surreal dark comedies there are numerous diversions but the main plot is a take on ransom films the film would have been a massive failure if not for some key performances jeff bridges is the dude aka jeff lebowski who is mistaken for a millionaire of the same name whose wife owes money to a pornographer the dude is an unemployed layabout who bowls with his two friends walter and donny walter is played by john goodman who portrays the character as a shorttempered vietnam vet who uses his military service to justify his behavior he constantly yells at donny steve buscemi for no real reason and waves guns at minor bowling infractions the dude finds himself caught up ins ransom as the millionaire hires him to give the ransom to the kidnappers the millionaires aide is phillip seymour hoffman who plays a sycophantic named brandt hoffman is the third most enjoyable character in the film with his forced laugh and yesman linesthe simple ransom goes horribly wrong and the plot gets ever more complex as more characters are added this one of a few comedies that warrants multiple viewings just to understand it there are enough quotable lines to be entertaining upon first watch but you have to see it again to discern the genius of the plot turnsthe dream sequences take away from the film as they are too long and dont really move the movie forward or even introduce a sideplot still the film is one of the best coen films not as great as fargo but what is and it remains a cult classic and one of the best comedies ever made,black_comedy
this movie didnt interest me much the first time i watched but i eventually purchased the movie on dvd you have to really dissect this movie to understand how good it isthe characters seem random at first but as you watch it a few times the way in which the dialogue flows becomes very funny credit to the writers because the dialogue is really what makes this movie not much of a plot no real ending a silly premise  throw in a kidnapping and thats the movieif youre a type a personality you might not like this movie much but for the type bs and further on down the alphabet the further the better great movie,black_comedy
this is nothing but a remake or maybe the original i would know if i had checked the dates but you know laziness and it is funny to remain fuzzy like the coen brothers themselves of what we know under the title of pulp fiction the coen brothers get rid of the shuffling time line and have episodes and chapters in order but it is just as intricate as the other except that it is harmless more or less and funny in the punk beatnik post 1968 style if you like that and the unemployed who play the greek philosophers it means that the mistake in pulp fiction becomes the rule here and everything is overreacting and mistargeting the true victim of the explosion of temper of course never of any firearms though quite a few are moving and travelling around just like bowling pins and bowling balls thats a way of looking at suburban social sprawl that deserves some attention and time the best debunking of pulp fiction is in the bardiner scene a lot of noise and ruckus for very little i like the breaking in out and through of all sorts of cars the coen brothers dont seem to like cars probably because they are the best representation of american wastefulness and extreme vain arrogance but pulp fiction seems to debunk cars too though in a different waydr jacques coulardeau university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines cegid,black_comedy
maude lebowski what do you do for recreation the dude oh the usual i bowl drive around the occasional acid flashback that just about sums up this trip some bowling where we meet one of the most interesting characters i have ever seen in jesus quintana john turturro and where the staranger sam elliott pops in from time to time to offer such sage advice as sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes well he eats yousome driving around in a comedy of errors where john goodman really shines as walter sobchak with friends like that you certainly dont need enemies we also meet really colorful characters like maude lebowski julianne moore who just wants the dudes seed bunny lebowski tara reid the porn star turned golddigger and of course david huddleston and his faithful servant brandt philip seymour hoffman and when steve buscemi started talking about the in and out burger i almost lost it i swore he was going to go into the old in and out routinea visit to jackie treehorn ben gazzara brings about an amazing thing that could only be described as an acid flashback i have to admit i had my mouth open the whole time it was going on it was just that incredibleyou should get the idea that this is not a film about kidnapping and money and criminals it was a film about the characters i only touched on the main ones there are plenty more interesting gems to findonly the coen brothers could have dreamed up the story of a slacker caught up in a bad situation it was one of the funniest films i have ever seen,black_comedy
is a hilarious movie it makes you laugh scene after a scene and that makes it a fine piece of quality comedy it has a rather bizarre story which sometimes gets a bit silly but its still enjoyable all the way through the story tells about a man named jeffrey the dude lebowski he is accidentally mistaken for a millionaire jeffrey lebowski and this leads him to things he wouldnt want to have experienced with his bowling buddy walters help he tries to get things right but is constantly failed in his tasks mainly because of walters strange personality and anger issuesthe best thing about this film is the characters and the role performances done by the actors the characters are just great theyre vivid and they all have odd personalities and different ways of interacting jeff bridges plays the character of the dude a total looser who would have preferred bowling instead the things he accidentally mixes up with bridges is so real in the role though the character itself is so surreal sort of an ignoring person who pretty much defines stupidity although bridges is superb in the role i thought john goodman was more entertaining in the role of walter sobchak the character of walter is just so bizarre he is a vietnam veteran who constantly deals with his anger issues and thinks hes right when it comes to solving things yet being pretty much wrong in every case trying to help the dude he just makes things worse and doesnt even admit that hes been wrong ive never really found john goodman as entertaining as in this movie so thumbs up for that there are also other characters worth mentioning the always enjoyable steve buscemi as theodore donald donny kerabatsos who never seems to be able to speak up his mind as he is always bothered by walter being a bowling buddy of the dude and walter he still remains as one member of the group and there is some sympathy showed towards him in the end julianna moore is also in a so surreal role the role of maude lebowski who is obsessed with sex the british daughter of the real millionaire lebowski we also see for example philip seymor hoffman and peter stormare in one of the rolesthe screenplays very well written written by ethan and joel cohen it definitely mixes up everything from the beginning till the end this what also makes the plot a bit confusing at parts you really need concentration as there is constantly this fast dialog between the characters and its just impossible to know what is important for the plot and what is not there is just so much fillings in the dialogs that it gets a bit messy the directing pretty much does the same directed by joel cohen it can be described from what i described the plot and the dialogs being precise entertaining and swift it also blends up with the story so well making the whole movie this one big entity where the main theme is never lost although it does get a bit confusing its still that definite quality and you just cant go wrong with thatis a good movie its nothing phenomenal but its definitely something worth watching if you dont want to watch something that serious as it just does include these irrelevant and silly yet hilarious parts which in their way are simply one crucial part of the movie you will laugh if not because of the great jokes or the dialog then the odd silliness it has inside it great characters superb role performances a plot that evolves to something you couldnt have imagined and a guaranteed laughpacked ride does what it needs to it doesnt have to exceed that,black_comedy
this movie works on many different levels its a hilarious film in which you could watch it over and over thousands of times and every time you would find something new to laugh about this is officially my favorite movie of all times the coen brothers are just magnificent if you have not seen this movie yet i would recommend that you rent it or buy it right away it has a very interesting plot and the character development is amazing most of the comedy in this film arent just mindless potty humor but instead deep funny and mature humor i have shown many of my colleagues this film and everyone has loved it rent this film right away i promise you wont be disappointed,black_comedy
this thought provoking hallucinated greatly written comedy is so funny you will hold your guts i have watched it perhaps 7 times and it still is not only entertaining but really funny and just great time to spend watching a moviejeff bridges at his best ever i think it is so funny this man the dude should be everyones hero the movie is also about peace in his own intrinsically and curiously unusual way looking at it after now 10 years after it was made is not only still a great laugh but also inspiring its good now and then to get back in to rock and roll i think the movie tackles important questions about life in an intensely comical and intelligent way i live in europe and it might just be that people who are not so familiar with the american culture would not be able to catch the great humor but i feel blessed to be able to understand the hero that the dude is playing i truly wish i was like him,black_comedy
this is the funniest movie ever watch it you wont be disappointed i wouldnt hold out much hope for the creedence even tara pre lipodappled tummy reid is good as a gold digging trophy wife of but hands down funniest greatest role of the movie goes to dan goodman as walter he will have you rolling in the aisles as they say go get yourself some jellies a man cardigan and a caucasian and enjoy this delectable offering from the coen brothers about one mans quest to get his rug back this movie is original funny features bowlingwhat more could you want there is a reason that random strangers can quote lebowski with you  every line is a gem,black_comedy
when i first happened upon this movie i did not yet know what i was getting into i knew the makers by their previous works but was not yet a fan the first time i saw it i didnt understand what was going on the second time i watched it i knew the plot and could therefore concentrate on the subtleties that is what makes this film greatness is a shining example of what film should be a perfect marriage of superior quality writing and heartfelt acting from the masters of their respective professions with an attention to detail unlike any other materials of the finest quality mature with age and stand the test of time this film never gets old and only improves with each sequential viewing the way summer blockbusters never can take a chance give this one another look invest ninety minutes of your life into this film,black_comedy
detailed in every scene rich characterization diverse soundtrack witty real life dialogue this movie is god i feel that it takes a lot from a movie to make me leave with a sense of satiation but this movie does it for me wonderfully written and directed by the coen brothers it is yet another masterpiece from them another thing is that this movie never tries to be funny it doesnt have random quirky characters or punch lines it all comes from the scenes very naturally 10 out of 10 and how cool is the scene when the sheriff throws and hits the dude in the forehead with the mug and the mug doesnt turn while its in the air so many great scenes,black_comedy
ive lost count of how many times ive seen this film and each time it seems to get better and better yet the first time i saw this film i didnt think it was a great movie since i didnt realize the true greatness of it in fact i think no one did this is because the movie is not about the plot or about the message this movie is great because of its characters dialogue and aesthetics things that are most appreciated with successive viewings its the little details that will make this your favourite comedy of all timejeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi are outstanding as the three bowling buddies and excellently supported by philip seymour hoffman and julianne moore in fact i think most would agree that jeff bridges and especially john goodman gave awardwinning performances the dialogue is truly amazing i mean how many movies are bestowed with so many memorable lines as this one it is also truly unique for a goodhearted and laidback sort of film to contain that many and different subtle references to cultural idiosyncrasies really says something finally and i think this is what gives the movie defining cult status its the aesthetics you can tell the effort made by directors and actors alike in carefully constructing each character each character has been embedded with a particular style and ethos which explain their way of going about things each character is both cause and effect of different generational prototypes mingling with each other in that psychedelic fauna that is,black_comedy
i enjoyed watching this movie and i have to say it is just a good movieit definitely falls into the category of must see films due to its very awakening dialogs and its great players without too much talking about it i give it 2 thumbs up and if i had more rest a sure they would be up too a lovely film about one dude who finds him self in the wrong place at the wrong time steve buschmi is great as always john goodman gives his thoughts to the situation and jeff bridges in one of his great rolls  as the dude any one who likes this type of movies will not only see this movie he will buy an original dvd of the movie to keep in the house i have seen it at least ten times threw out the years you never get tired from it,black_comedy
its nice to see a movie where the protagonist is even lazier than you jeff bridges excellently portrays such a hero the very lazy dude lebowski who deals with stressful situations by swearing and drinking he has no particular powers or giftshe is instead refreshingly honesthowever he doesnt shove this honesty in your face overall bridges provides a unique performance which is built by other name actors like julianne moore john goodman david thewlis and philip seymour hoffman whos also just awesomedont expect too much of this intellectually and the dream sequences are a bit strange but otherwise this is a great funny sort of rainy day movie,black_comedy
awesome seriously this was one of the funniest movies ive ever seen i have no idea what its about but i liked it i kind of detected a circle of life thingin the world of la slackers everything works out man dont worry donnie dies little lebowski is born thus it continues but you dont watch this for the message its got an excuse for a plot at least big lebowskis wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped the dude lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pied upon in a misunderstanding seeking compensation for the rug which really tied the room together he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks introduce a trio of nihilists with marmot a halfcrazed feminist painter julianne moore a porno film industry and a gay pedophile whos extremely competitive about bowling john turturro and youve got itthe ultimate stoned slacker comedy jeff bridges is far out as the dude and hilariously understated while john goodman is his psychotically violent nam vet best friend who carries a piece to a bowling alley and john turturro is forever etched into my memory as jesus quintana spoken to walter you got a date for wednesday baby whoo walter hes cracking steve buscemi was adorably pathetic as donnie the third wheel one of the best quotes donnie are these the nazis walter walter no donnie these men are nihilists theres nothing to be afraid of it was very memorable with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watchingthe coens signature style doesnt come through here like it does in fargo and its not overly artistic wellin parts maybe but its so funny excellent excellent especially the dudes stoned dreams which feature saddam hussein renting out bowling shoes,black_comedy
theres almost no point in commenting on theres no way of summing up exactly what makes this movie so tremendously entertaining to the people that get it and theres no way of convincing the people that dont that theyre just stark raving mad nonetheless i feel compelled to say something here as ive insisted on several occasions that friends and relations watch this film and no one ive recommended it to has complained yeti have a theory which is probably complete hooey about the genesis of this film for years the coen brothers had made wellreviewed films that were usually overlooked by the academy once fargo broke through and earned them their deserved degree of industry acclaim the coens had a degree of freedom theyd never really had before so when they went to make a film to follow up what was considered a masterpiece they chose the silliest subject matter they could come up with a noir comedy starring a unemployed stoner named jeffrey lebowski a business tycoon of the same name a porn king a feminist conceptual artist a wayward young wife a buddy who can never get a word in edgewise a gang of german nihilists and a best friend named walter sobchak who doesnt so much have flashbacks to the vietnam war as he simply refuses to acknowledge that the war ever ended oh and i left out the bowling pederast named jesusnever before and never since have the coens made a film with this much sheer unadulterated glee as has been said many times in earlier comments john goodmans performance as walter is an awardworthy amalgamation of loyalty hyperrationalism and homicidal rage jeff bridges as the unemployed lebowskihe prefers the dude has never been funnierthe scene where he tries and fails to throw a cigarette out of his car window is especially brilliant as he aimlessly navigates the dudes way through a kidnapping plot that is anything but routine the coens pepper the script with some of the sharpest dialogue theyve ever come up with and theyre fearless in simply following their storytelling instincts wherever they lead any film that includes a musical sequence set to kenny rogers and the second edition and features both julianne moore in a viking costume and saddam hussein as a bowlingalley attendant has more than its share of gutsdo my comments explain why this film has become the cult classic that it is of course not if i could write that well id have written the big lebowksi myself at one point the films narrator a cowboy played by sam elliottdarn left him out too is trying to describe the dude and he says something like the dude wasman i lost my train of thought its ridiculous as narration but its also instructive this is an entire movie that quite often loses its train of thought and its all the richer for it,black_comedy
is without question my favorite movie i would urge the masses of people here who seemed to get bored before it was half over to watch it again watch it again and finish it this time remember a few things 1 funny movies are not always written for 12 year olds 2 some of them dont have any of the wayans brothers or adam sandler in themim not trying to be harsh on these actors  im trying to point out that this movie is more than slapstick its not hysterically funny that the dude carries a drink with him and sometimes spills it its not hilarious to have someone pee on the dudes rug its not funny when walter explains how easy it is to obtain a toe with green nail polish on it ok that was pretty funnywhat is funny is how all of this fits together the worlds biggest stoner solving a fairly complex mystery the interaction of 3 longtime friends who dont really get along all the time the crazy plot twists that we can barely follow much less having the dude follow them after endless joints and white russians as the coens said in the extended dvd  this is a buddy movie above all the story of 3 friends of differing qualities with very different outlooks on life watch this movie again if you didnt get it the first time then again if you still dont get it and if you still dont get it after 3 watches  try the farrelly brothers  the coen brothers probably arent your style 1010 without question,black_comedy
its difficult to describe a coen brothers movie because the thing that makes the distinct is the flavor the atmospherelike a stylish fairytale and the characters which are very atypical to movies in general because they cannot be described as heroes and also the original point of view and the use of music this is the case of this tale of a bum bowler on drugs lebowskijeff bridges his two friends an idiot steve buscemi and a troubled veteran john goodmann who is confused for a millionaire and gets his rug pied on by a gang of self proclaimed nihilistspeter stormarefleaa hallucinating story unfolds with occasional musical blackoutsfantastic vision what condition my condition is in as he aided by his idiot friends tries to recover the rug from the millionaire who in turn offers him a job to find his young and slutty wife a porn actress allegedly kidnapped by the nihilists as usual for coen brother movies acting is top notch along the way lebowski meets the most interesting characters the pederast bowler jesus brilliantly played by john turturro the porn movie producer ben gazarra the painter daughter of the millionaire lebowski julianne moore and her crazy friend david thewlis or the strangersam elliottthe coens have made some great movies in the past raising arizona barton fink fargo to name but a few but clearly they refined their craft to an art form with this one,black_comedy
all of the elements that comprise this film are superb the script is hilarious upon first viewing but becomes ingenious with each subsequent viewing afterwards i try to use big words to sound pretentious because the film makes me feel inadequate because of its amazing craftsmanship the filming itself is beautiful especially the slowmotion tracking shots the mannerisms and characters are what truly make this film shine the repetition and overassertion of each character is so over the top that it reaches the point of absolute hilaritybefore you watch this film ask yourself one question mind if i light a j,black_comedy
yes it is rude and crude but that doesnt mean it isnt hilarious the writing is brilliant especially if youve seen or even read the maltese falcon the directing is also great provided by the coen brothers who brought us fargo but the high point of the movie is definitely the acting jeff bridges is the dude it is a believable part and most importantly hilarious he does it all the laziness the swearing the acid trips steve buscemi also from fargo is great as donny his dialog though few and far between complements the dialog of the dude and walter which brings us to walter as played by john goodman im not sure who swears more walter or the dude but i would put my money on walter the point it is walter who fulfills every stereotype youve heard about this movie the rudeness the nonsense the lack of coherence etc of course there are numerous supporting parts as well jesus etc that only add to the film in the end if you love movies like spaceballs and bad santa youll love this if not at least give it a chance and keep an open mind,black_comedy
first of all you must excuse me for 1 my grammar since im not from either the uk or the usa and 2 ignoring the guidelines for writing a comment for i think is the one film where rules do not apply i being a fan of the coen brothers will always have a positive prejudice on everything they make still i think that this movie is the most wonderful thing they have ever made fargo was great barton fink i will have to watch a few other times in the hope i once will fully understand it and oh brother where art thou what can i say loved the music wacky george clooneygreat homer must be smiling from above the dude however abidesthe dude abidesps watch it rent it love it,black_comedy
this film is totally unique in a world of sequels copycat and cookiecutter films this movie is absolutely hilarious with an immensely talented ensemble cast and sharp coen brothers writing its one of those films that gets better with each viewing because you notice more detail and nuance jeff bridges was made for this role john goodman proves his genius the bit players are all perfect this film turns the private eye noir genre on its head and into a truly enjoyable and unpredictable twister game along with millers crossing its one of the coen brothers movies that has the dialogue and writing to stand among the classics like casablanca,black_comedy
i bought this movie before i watched it and i am very glad that i did this movie was so good but you can not fully appreciate all the jokes and humor until you see it 2 or even three times but you still will get your laughs on your first time i went to california this year and i couldnt leave without a ralphs card or a visit or two to the innout burger which has fantastic food i highly recommend this movie to anyone if you dont understand this movie you just havent watched it enough or payed attentionyou can pick this movie up pretty cheap from most movie stores it is definitely a good investment to your movie collection,black_comedy
like many other lovers of i was baffled by this movie and didnt really care for it all that much after the first viewing and didnt realize what a fantastic piece of work it was until i watched it again late one night on usa network while rocking a new born baby to sleep despite the edits and commercial interruptions everything fell into place for me and i rented it again and watched it over and over each time finding something new and wonderfully funny i now own it on dvd and watch it at least once a month and it just gets funnier each timefirst of all im surprised that i have never seen anyone notice that this movie is the coens fractured version of a modern day western the tumblin tumbleweed the cowboy music and sam elliots narrative at the beginning should have been a huge tip off in addition the structure of this movie broadly mirrors that of john fords classic horse opera the searchers though many of the elements are inverted most westerns have a hero who is an outsider who only wants what is rightfully his in the dude is a social misfit who just wants his rug back like the girl who was kidnapped by native americans in the searchers this movie has a girl who has been purportedly abducted by a group foreign to the settled community german nihilists and like every western movie there is a violent showdown at the end though most westerns dont have a showdown anywhere near as funny dipsh with a ninetoed womanantisemitebut its not the amateur film school analysis that makes this movie great its the acting the characters the dialogue and the many twists and turns that are tied up at the endthe dialogue is richly funny though you have to watch the movie several times to catch everything said since the characters are constantly interrupting one another and trying to talk over each other i think this is one reason that people who have only seen this movie once didnt like it the humor in what the dude donny and walter are saying to each other is killer and its even funnier when you realize that none of them are really listening to each otherfor those who havent seen the movie yet you might want to remember this if you see it and dont think the movie makes any sense remember that many people who love this movie didnt get it either the first time around,black_comedy
i saw this movie for the first time 5 yrs after it came out for firsttimers let me just say one thing this is the best movie to watch if youre ahem on something   the dude an intellectually sophisticated bum is classic very funny since the main characters take their petty lives so seriously and are played very memorably,black_comedy
now i am not one of those who like to read too much meaning into everything and no bible thumper either but i couldnt help noticing the following similarities between the dude and jcthe obvious physical similaritieshair beard sandals and loosefitting plain clothingthe simple and impoverished lifestyleboth are baptised early in the significant part of their historiesboth have visionary dreamsboth turn the other cheek this is the dudes most noticable traitno matter who beats on him or what indignities he suffers he never offers anyone the slightest threat or violent reactionboth have close associates who tend to take things a bit too farboth are called to selfsacrifice in the promise of reward from the big guy who ultimately lets them down and proves to be less than he appearedboth are importuned and tempted by a whore to whose feet they pay homageand finally what about the sam elliot line at the end about the dude out there layin back fer all us sinners i wouldnt want this to distract from the simple of enjoyment of yet another coen bros masterpiece of dark comedy but i cant help wondering if this is just my imagination or if the brothers actually did this on purposeif so they tipped us another little clue by throwing in an almost demonic character named jesusnot pronounced heysoos either ,black_comedy
as i entered the cinema i wasnt convinced at all i thought that it would be quite a crap after the film i was amazed it is some kind of mix between fargo and pulp fiction i rarely saw such a good film don t miss it,black_comedy
im a big fan of the coen brothers ive seen all of their movies and while was a pretty good film and was basically very entertaining i would rank it right near the bottom of their movies i thought bridges and goodman were very good but there just wasnt anything in the movie that really grabbed you and held your attention as there is in blood simple barton fink millers crossing raising arizona fargo even the hudsucker proxy although i was essentially disappointed if this is one of the worst of the coen brothers offerings and i think it is thats not too bad of a thing because its still a pretty good flick one of the reasons im such an admirer of theirs is the fact that their movies really are not only unique compared to other popular movie makers but they are truly unique from each other they are very inventive really as good as we have today,black_comedy
to point out the less obvious john goodman has already played a nutcase character in other coen brothers movies raising arizona as the prison escapee and barton fink as the arsonmurderer in this he plays a disgruntled vietnam veteran and steve buscemi for the hundredth time plays a pedophile its starting to look a little tacky and routine maybe now that the coens received academy awards for fargo they should reconsider to hire other actorswell i marginally recommend this film it seemed like another version of fargo kidnapping ransom only this was stranger and fargo was much better theres really little to recommend about in this movie but it was one of the better films to be released in the early 98 year worth seeing once,black_comedy
was a great movie with probably the best cast ever assembled  add that to the fact that it was made by the coen brothers was god informed that something like this was going on  john goodman should at the very least be considered for an academy award for best supporting actor for this  and you know what the best part is the movie teaches you that when youre lifes going to pot you can just say forget it lets go bowling,black_comedy
those guys is really a true genius all their few movies are amazing the great lebowski is another notable achievement from them what a concept odd idea smart screenplay a lazy and easy man called the dude jeffrey bridges are mistaken with a millionaire who has the same surname lebowski thenceforth his life becomes in a true nightmare the crooks are abusive due his wife dont pay them moreover a chinese crook piddle in your rug he finds the real and married old lebowski who has a wife when all seems settled more trouble comes whens wife is kidnapped he asking to the dude delivery the money to kidnapers he told to his racist closest friend a true troublemaker john goodman has an unerring plan to put a final point in the whole mess fabulous near masterpiece from cohen brothersresumefirst watch 2000  how many 2  source tvdvd  rating 9,black_comedy
i watched this with my dad and it was absolutely hilarious and i know the coen brothers always rate this 1 but i thought it was a little bit sexual so i wouldnt recommend it for small children,black_comedy
this from the makers of fargo and raising arizona stars jeff bridges as jeff lebowski a cranky unemployed foulmouthed pothead slacker embroiled in a mistakenidentity farce ive never liked bridges ponderous acting and he doesnt score any points for me here as the selfproclaimed dude eitheranyway two goons break into his apartment thinking hes pasadena millionaire jeff lebowski and proceed to rough him up and piss on his throwrug  that rug really tied the room together the dude moans miffed he tracks down the real jeff lebowski and steals a persian rug unwittingly becoming jumbledup in a kidnapping caper  then hires the incompetent dude to make a money drop for lebowskis kidnapped trophy wife bunny tara reid but his short tempered pistolhappy vietnamvet bowling buddy walter sobcek john goodman bungles the plan accelerating the two into a bizarre state of affairstheres a lot to like but not enough to keep the viewer seriously engaged thats due to the fact that half of the characters are amazing and half are routine oddballs  sexcrazed latino bowlerpervert jesus quintana john turturro is worth seeing and sam elliots mustache alone is worth the price of admission but elliot is some critically wasted talent here plus ive never seen an actor overact as much as john goodman does in the first half and if i see steve can i get any other role buscemi play another little creepy loser im gonna die  on the other hand julianne moore boogie nights plays erotic artist maude lebowski sexy and rough  theres a memorable scene where she covers part of her body with paint and hurls herself through the air in a leather harness to create a piece  pluss righthand man brandt played by boogie nights philip seymour hoffman is equally absorbing  nevertheless its a patrol officer played by michael gomez who gets the biggest laughs as the dude picks up his recently stolen car from the police corral  blink and youll miss itthe film offers bursts of enlightenment in an otherwise quirky indiefeel movie but doesnt really commit to the audience at any given point perhaps the cohens are purposely treating us to the languid uninspiring existence that is the dude in hopes that well be quiescent enough to enjoy their blundering film,black_comedy
was the first coen brothers film i saw and although i cant say its an equal to the man who wasnt there or fargo in terms of intricacy or overall style  it still remains my favourite by  the coensjeff bridges is perfect as the dude and john goodman delivers his best performance so far as walter an annoyingly loveable vietnam veteranthe music is used brilliantly to the point that the film and its soundtrack seem to be insperatable  a feat only accomplished by two other movies in my opinion  reservoir dogs and natural born killersmy only complaint would be that steve buscemi was a little underused and that his only lines seemed to be a lead into him being told to shut the  up by walter but maybe thats the whole pointdeffinately a treat for any fan of film coen or otherwise10 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie is one of my all time favorites the casting is perfect and goodmans role suits him like a im all out of metaphors its just perfect in fact the more i think about it everything about the movie is perfect great story telling very funny movie dont miss out,black_comedy
some people have the star wars or star trek movies some claim citizen kane but there are those of us out there that hold this movie as our ultimate favorite movie of all time reasons its the cast its the dialogue the cinematography the comedy the zaniness the memorable lines everything i couldnt even ask for a better castbut damn i wish the dude got his rug back shut the f up donny,black_comedy
by far the best coen brothers filmonce you watch thisyou will wish the dude was your buddywatch it at least twicethere is so much funny dialougethe interaction between dudewalter and donny especiallynever has there been a film with so much great charactersyou will also realise that life should be like it is in the dudes worlddont set your sights too highjust take life as it comeseven with all the stuff that comes his way,black_comedy
this movie has to be funnier than fargo  although it didnt have scenes in it like guys shoving people down wood chippers it had plenty of dialogue that is a lot more comical than that of fargo or raising arizona or o brother where art thou  better yet it has an awesome cast that really seems to like their characters  jeff bridges is the coolest as the dude who only wanted his rug back  john goodman has the best lines of them all with his psycho vietnam vet persona  i was especially surprised to see steve buscemi in a nonwomanizer role but his part could have been biggerthere were some characters i didnt get though like the jesus person and the treehorn person  but scenes like the one with maude and knox laughing on the phone the fight with the supposed nihilists and the spreading of the ashes make up for anything that doesnt make sense  this is a must see i give it a 95 out of 10,black_comedy
a hilarious movie a treat for fans of the coen brothers jeff bridges and john goodman are great especially when they are interacting in scenes together just one small complaint steve buscemis role is to small other then that this film gets a 10 in my book,black_comedy
if the movie were a car it would be a finely crafted rollsroyce more technically it is a very efficient film i couldnt identify a single boring or irrelevant minute the casting is superb jeff bridges downatheels bum is in perfect contrast to john goodmans uptight vietnam veteran with steve buscemi perfectly in between the constellation colourful and entertaining characters is another feature of the film the dudes wierd landlord into strange amateur dance routines the militant feminist played by juliana moore the sycophantic personal assistant played by whatshisname hoffman played george in scent of a woman the gang of nihilists the porn king the bimbo kidnapee and  topping them all  the sexually perverted bowler player called blasphemically jesus if these characters didnt even interact  i mean if there was not plot at all to the movie  it would still be fun to watch them from hours on end just doing everyday thingsas it is the plot is rather good most importantly at the end of the film it becomes known that the dude will become a father this is good news because it creates a good foundation for a sequel the little lebowski perhaps the characters and humour of this film are so brilliant that it would be a sad waste if they were confined to just one film,black_comedy
you have to love the way this movie just ambles along the plot more or less takes a back to seat due to the characters who simply shine all the way the dude simply rules the movie and walter and donny are the perfect foils for his laid back attitude the dialogue is just sublime i believe this movie requires a number of watches to get every nuance of the comedy and the classic lines lose nothing with repetition the best that thing the coen brothers have done which says a lot and should be the benchmark for every movie of its genre,black_comedy
im obviously in good company here if i could choose only one comedy to watch for the rest of my life this would be it put simply the funniest movie ever writtenthe chinaman is not the issue hereglorious,black_comedy
to say this film is a masterpiece is perhaps a little generous however it is not far off  is a tribute to the real people out there people trying to get through life exerting the shortest amount of effort necessary whilst drifting in and out of trouble  i think this sums up the film perfectly  ive watched this film so many times and i still cant find anything wrong with itthe acting is sublime jeff bridges is at his comic best and with john goodman and steve buscemi as support theres always going to be laughter and suspense  the script is faultless each person blends into the script with effortless precision resulting in a feeling that the actors really are the people theyre playing which makes it all the more better because you feel their joy their anguish and their feelings of the often baffling but wonderfully written events happening around themnot only is the acting sublime aswell as the script and directing but the musical score is so good you think that the songs were written especially for the film with them evoking a feeling of lazyness a feeling of laid back carefree attitudes which in a way is what the film is all about  in essence as a whole acting script directing and music this is the ultimate feel good buddy film and is an absolute must a real modern classic work of filmmaking and shouldnt be missed  i feel it must be watched from start to finish though without any breaks to fully grasp the magnitude of this film1010  splendid one for the collection,black_comedy
the only thing that bothers me about this well crafted masterpiece is that the coens did not get the sufficient praise they so richly deserved  i am also terrified  i am actually awake at night thinking about this  that john goodman has no idea how much the public loved and was even staggered by his brilliant performance in this filmthis is the funniest movie ever made period,black_comedy
the coen brothers have a reputation for tight scripting dark humour intricate plots and of course original types of violence and this film is no exception  focusses on a rather lazy and casual seventies dropout by the name of geoffrey lebowski who gets caught up into the world of rich billionaire geoffrey lebowski already you can sense the coen atmosphere  the film focuses on the seventies drop out who refers to himself as the dude and two of his closest friends the other two members of his bowling team  the plot isnt really important bearing in mind that it is actually very hard to define which element of the film is the plot because it changes so rapidly the coens bring together all sorts of odd ideas and peculiar settings and bind them tightly into one compact film and its one of their best  the script is absolutely impeccable its coen what do you expect including elements of slapstick razor sharp wit marvelously original scenarios and an enormous span of diverse characters the directing is also sublime the lighting effective the camera techniques subtle and almost comical in themselves and the performances by the cast are the height of all their careers  jeff bridges is perfect as the dude and steve buscemi and john goodman play his bowling buddies to perfection  julian moore is also excellent and tara ried makes a marvelous debut as bunny lebowski such a shame that she started to do less sophisticated comedies such as american pie the film is accompanied by a brilliant soundtrack and has a nicely relaxed atmosphere the film also manages to never take itself too seriously and reminds us that it is after all just a film for our entertainment theyre not trying to proove a point or change the world just make a good film they succeeded with flying colours i wouldnt change a single second of it,black_comedy
great moviegreat cast and great story this movie has such great characters and they are so original to sum it all upi can say that this movie is very funny with a great cast who acts their roles perfect and by the waythe dude has a great lifestyle,black_comedy
wow  thats all you can say about the comic genius that is this film not only is the trio of the dude walter and donnie hands down the best comedic team ever sorry three stooges fans but they were never funny but the story line behind this movie is a great dramatic thriller  the offbeat characters such as the jesus brant and liam add to the hilarity of this flick  this is easily one of the greatest movies of all time and the coen brothers will be forever etched in time as two of the wittiest screen writersdirectors of all time  see this movie at all costs,black_comedy
hilarious the coen brothers put together a comic gem involving jeff the dude lebowski played masterfully by jeff bridges as an unemployed whiterussian sipping bum who only wanting retribution for his soiled rug stumbles into a kidnappingransom scenario that has several twists and turns along for the ride are walter john goodman his highstrung vietnam veteran bowling buddy maude julianne moore the ultrafeminist daughter of another jeff lebowski this one a millionaire and whos wife it is that is kidnappedif this sounds a bit confusing well just watch the movie and itll all make sense a pornstar and a group of nihilists oh and john turturro is uproarious as jesus walter and dudes bowling rivalwhat makes this movie so good is not the story itself but rather how the hapless dude and walter stumble around changing allegiances and theories as to what happened tos wife again just watch the movie the backandforths between walter the dude and donny their 3rd bowling partner are wonderfully written and delivered the dream sequences are great saddam hussein handing out bowling shows priceless and the soundtrack is excellent this movie is a classic among college and high school guys and im sure youll realize why when you see it all in all a well written acted directed and funny film,black_comedy
i must admit that big l is one of the best films ive ever seen and believe me ive seen a few this is an ultimately cool and strange flick filled with cool and strange charactersjeff bridges in one of the best and most interesting roles in his career as the dude john goodman gives an unforgettable performance as the dudes guncrazy friend walter sobchak superb acting together with great casting make this title a sure classic great soundtrack alone makes big l worth watching and listening wellwritten welldirected and wellproduced if you like other films by coenbrothers be sure not to miss this,black_comedy
sometimes its good to wallow in an epic dramatic narrative other times its good get on the edge of your seat and wait for an explosive pay off but its also good to just take it easy slump onto the sofa and watch a film ladies and gentlemen i present to you the ultimate slacker filmwatching this film restores your faith in the cinema industry theyre not all bitesize easy to swallow lightweight moneyspinners and they dont have to be dark sombre dramas either they can be fun bouncy hilarious comedies as well with this film the coens prove their mastery of film to the world the heavy style of blood simple and barton fink has been replaced by a palpable cool and and a nature so easy going you almost dont feel it the writing is wonderful and the scenes hilarious the dudes dream sequences will have you in stitches while the marmotinabathtub routine will have the male audience crossing their legs ferociouslythis film is driven by the characters so its good to see that theyre as well written as they are acted the dude is so laid back hes almost horizontal and every line is spoken with such a super calm take it easy style that its impossible not to love him as soon as you see him all he wants is his rug back and rather than suddenly solving the baffling mystery he merely wanders around the edges waiting for his treasured persian to arrive its a wonderfully warm and human character effortlessly played by bridges the same can be said of walter donny and maude each are so lifelike that you want to reach up and touch them but the show is stolen by or rather handed over to john turturro as jesus quintana see this guy and laugh till you burstall in all a comedy for the simpsons generation enjoy,black_comedy
this film is completely excellent  in addition to the wonderful acting and scenes mentioned by everyone else how about  the landlord  the landlords pathetic interpretive dance  and walter goodman showing up at the landlords pathetic interpretive dance wearing a coat and tie because by god thats the proper thing to do  when you go to a cultural event you dress for the occasion am i rightand dont forget the cameo appearance by the greatest hamburger in the world  in and out,black_comedy
this movie had a great plot but every other word was a curse word i think the dude was played well and so was the stranger or the narrarator i actually think that all of the parts were played well i just dont think you know who should have died i dont want to give it away for those who havent seen it but after you see it youll know who im talking about some comedy and some action this movie was slow a  out of ,black_comedy
seeing this movie for the first time i was entertained and delighted by it fargo was wonderful and i have recommended it to everyone but this one was not as confusing as fargo with all the subplots john turturro was funny as jesus the bowler and steve buscemi who is wonderful and eccentrically cute as well as julianne moore who gives a bohemian performance jeff bridges and john goodman steal the show though as the dude he is a typical laid back la slacker walter john goodman is always yelling and recalling vietnam and dude always tells him to shut up it is a funny witty original comedy that is another showstealer by the wonderful cohen brothers i have not seen one film of theirs that i did not enjoy this one compares with raising arizona rent it today and have a ball,black_comedy
i hadnt heard much about this film but it was recommended to me highly so i rented it out from the video shop and couldnt bring myself to take it back the next day or the day after that for that matter amounting to a couple of days worth of fines but what the hey it was worth it from the very beginning when the china man pees on his rug i knew i was in for a cracker and i was right the characters are excellent the lines are sharp and funny but best of all as the narrator claimed it is a really cool storythis is my film of the year yes i know it was released last year and i know its only february but its that good watch it now before i send the china man round to pee on your rug,black_comedy
hmmm bowled me over dude knowing look oh john g how good were you i didnt laugh i didnt cry i simply was finish start middle in no particular order i have joined the cult of coen amen strike,black_comedy
nothing else comes to mind when i hear somewone mention it is simply the best movie i have ever seen the more stupid and outrageous it gets the more hilarious it becomes this movie includes everything that an excellent movie calls for awesome casting job jeff bridges john goodman sam elliot steve buscemi etc humor nothing can deliver bowling some lazy guy named dude to some selfdescribed nihilists the coen brothers have once again made movies more enjoyable i highly recommend this flick for anyone who needs a good laugh,black_comedy
you cant describe this movie its so weird its so inconsequential its so darn funny call it what you will comedy blackcomedy filmnoir thriller action drama fantasy but what lies at the heart of this movie is a genre all of its own the coen brothers genreeach of their films are distinctive and have that radiant flare about it classics such as fargo and barton fink all of them unique the big lebowsky does not disappointjeff lebowsky or the dude as he likes to be called gets involved in a case of mistaken identity two hoods trash his apartment and one of them urinates on his rug it really tied the room together he whines to his bowling buddy walterso seeking compensation for the rug he finds the real jeff lebowsky the millionaire and demands that he is reimbersed hes turned away and from there the plot spirals out into an hilarious and delightfully contrived messnine out of ten,black_comedy
is one of the very few comedies that actually gets better every time you watch it  the characters are some of the best to ever be created in movie making history the dude walter donny jesus quintana and the nihilists  there are about total 20 slow minutes in the movie and the rest of it is absolutely hilarious  john goodmans performance as walter is oscar material and definitely my favorite character of any movie ive ever seen from giving his choice words to donny to relating just about everything that happens to vietnam  the conversations at the bowling alley are classics  in 1998 i saw two of the best comedies ive ever seen theres something about mary and and wins hands down  ill just leave you with thiswalter speaking about quintana he spent 6 months in chino for exposing himself to an 8 year old  when he moved to hollywood he had to go door to door and tell his neighbors he was a paedorastdonny whats a paedorast walterwalter shut the f up donny,black_comedy
for a long time my mind was divided between monty pythons the life of brian or monty pythons search for the holy grail as the funniest film ever after seeing this latest coen bros production ive had to change my mind the drugsthe sexthe bowling and the carpet all summed up when goodman looking very unimpressed turns to the dude and says eight years old dude eight years old,black_comedy
donny died youngyou lord took him in all your wisdomlike so many others you took at kai santhis was a hell of a movie gets better every time i see it bought it on laserdisc one of the great beer movies where you sit and laugh more than you should so you and your friends tell each other that youre having a good time while drinking and watching moviesbridges is great  still the greatest underrated actor of our time tutturo is awesome as jesus the psycho bowler goodman is fantastic as walter and buscemi is good as donny the sam elliott character was slightly annoying but that was the only minor bitch i have about this funny funny flickwhen i rate a comedy its based on how many genuine laughs it gets  people saw something about mary and thought it was great i gave it 8 of 10  this is better9 out of 10 dont mess wit de jesus i pull that trigger till it goes clickyou mean coitus,black_comedy
possibly one of the most stylish and amusing films of the 1990s along with pulp fiction and goodfellas this film pulsates throughout with the coen brothers crazy offbeat humour and contains many exciting and clearly hallucinogen influenced scenes all linked together by the common theme of ten pin bowling tbl contains some of the funniest characters ever committed to film most notably the latin american paedophilic bowler played by john no one fs with the jesus turturro  the dialogue in this film is as sharp as a very pointy and sharp thing and this is definitely one of the films that must be seen if you are to raise yourself above all the mass produced hollywood nonsense and gain a true appreciation of what constitutes a damn good film,black_comedy
i think this is on of the funniest movies of all times the characters especially goodmans are so weird that you have to laugh on almost every line they say go buy it i gave it a straight ten also dude people keep telling that the plot is not good or at least not as good as fargos well that may be but  therefore it was so funny and i think that the plot isnt so important here anyway youd miss most of it anyway cause youve got to laugh all the time also try some white russian during the movie itll improve a lot if you dont like it,black_comedy
this picture is just grand man  but like thats just my opinion dude its all about the rug  it tied the whole movie together man  and whats a coen brothers film without a rich man behind a desk and a few weird dream sequencesman  nods to bridges and especially goodman,black_comedy
dude the dude thats his name only his real names lebowskiyour average slob drugs bowling and drinking he has two real friends his bowling team buscemi and goodman and he runs into trouble with a mob looking for another guy named lebowski a rich guy weird comic adventures occur crossed with the base story of a mystery results in a successful movie that works see it see it again,black_comedy
the film is quirky and funny but its much deeper on an intellectual level if thats what youre into  the portrayal of california as the final outpost of the mythic american west is subtle but definitely present dude jeff bridges and his pathetic loser friends are quite content with their pathetic lives and make no excuses as they feel none are necessary this symbolizes the freedom represented by the american west and the promise of the frontier  aside from this however its very funny particularly in the use of film angles and perspectives  dude note the western allusion is suddenly embroiled in a case of mistaken identity a kidnapped millionaires teenage second wife and his efforts to remain calm in the ensuing mayhem in which he finds himself it is well written and well worth seeing especially with a few beers and a few friends,black_comedy
this film is so laid back it nearly falls over a wonderful piece of film making there are so many good points about this film but notably the dream sequences only the coen brothers would put a camera inside a bowling ball and the john turturro cameo as jesus quintana the acting is first class with the casting of a high standard the coen brothers are yet to do a bad film in my estimate and are fast becoming my favourite film makers we need more films like this just a hugely enjoyable film that can be viewed over and over again,black_comedy
its very hard to release a completely original movie and it be worth watching  example  natural born killers  not worth watchingbut yet completely original is one of the best coen brothers movies  the best being o brother where art thou  i am not a big fan of fargo  i like my movies good  fargo wasnt anyways is about americans other favorite past timebowling and a few bums who play it jeff bridges proves he is an awesome actor in this movie playing the dude only a great actor can play a character like the dude and then a few years later get an academy award nomination for playing the president of the united states in the contender the dream sequences in this movie are the funniest i have seen since national lampoons european vacation this movie rocked,black_comedy
i love this movie  people i know usually point out the constant use of the f word but i barely noticed it  the performances are so compelling and the dialogue so inventive it had me from the very beginning  i loved how the dude learned new words and phrases throughout the movie and used them this will not stand man  one small observation even though the dude loves bowling you never see him bowl in the movie  apparently hes so complacent he cant even embrace something he loves,black_comedy
you know you love them  coen movies have that quirky something or other that at times will make you laugh out loud or squirm in your seat sometimes at the same time  the only movie i think that doesnt fit this mold was blood simple less funny than the rest  but it was still very good  some movies are more funny  some are more violent  but there is always a mixture of the two  its refreshing to see movies these days that dont resort to spooge jokes and cgi fx cheating and hiphop soundtrax im starting to ramble  anyway i love this movie  love love love it when i got a dvd player last fall this was the first movie i bought and i have watched it on average of once a week since then  im no expert by any stretch of the imagination but i know a well made movie when i see one and i know when a writerdirector cares for the characters and it really comes through in this movie  and its funnier than anything thats been made in years  even after all the times i see it i still laugh out loud at certain parts  my wife and i quote it constantly to each other  my favorite parts possible spoilers ahead1 the scattering of the ashes its wrong but it feels oh so right 2 the dude in the eagles cab i too fervently hate the eagles and 3 the marmot in the tub so i recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh and a weird plot with some truly loveable characters see this movie  1010,black_comedy
similar to the measured brilliance of fargo the coen brothers joel and ethan again delivered a perfectly structured and aimed tribute to the slacker in all of us the slacker in question is jeff lebowski selfproclaiming himself the dude  jeff bridges gives a startling performance far from his usual troubled semiaction roles like blown away and arlington road and proves himself to be one of the most consistently underrated actors in hollywood the dude reigns supreme in his own personal sphere of creedence white russians and above all bowling  the performance i think can be favourably compared to his last great role in fearless and jeff bridges can be proud of his work as can john goodman steve buscemi even julianne moore and most hilariously john turturros cameo as jesus the uptight paedophilic rival who represents everything the dude dismisses  it seems a brilliant quality in a director im talking about joel coen here to consistently extract good performances from any actors regardless of their standing in hollywood i could keep on about the relaxed directing or the inspired music selection both perfectly complementing the ideals vaunted by the film but i wont  every aspect of this and every other coen bros film is succintly placed within the whole it is this film particularly that makes the coens directorswriters ones to watch  and remember to take the advice proffered to the heart the dude in all of us abides,black_comedy
i havent stopped watching this movie since i first saw it about 2 months ago i guess by reading some of the other user comments that this is the kind of movie that you either love or hate  and i love itthe story is fantastic the running theme isnt particularly complex but it doesnt need to be it puts the incredibly laidback dude in a series of outrageous situations that no stoner should ever be exposed to i guess the funniest thing about the movie is that i know a guy who could be evenly compared with the dude and i suppose im not the only one  havent most of us known or been a lazy stoner at some point the story is perpetually fuelled with a line of eccentric characters all quite different from the dude in personality and lifestyle the dudes interactions with them in his quest to obtain a replacement rug are hilarious especially with the malibu chief of policejulianne moore is fantastic as the artistfeminist millionaire the line she delivers to dude while bunnys porn film is running is a classic the story is ludicrous she says with disdain viewing the porn flick with her critical eye postirony at its besti did think that the inclusion of sam elliot was a needless one essentially the story didnt require the insight of a narrative and although i appreciate the comic value of his inclusion perhaps he might have been better utilised on another projectessentially and i think this is the case with more than one of the coen brothers films is that the dialogue is excellent  it is nearly always the way the lines are delivered that makes the scenes so funny not the actual lines themselves this is true for many different characters in this movie from himself to the chief of malibu police whos scene with the dude is comedy geniusanyway i cant knock it  i love the movie his dudeness is one of the funniestbest characters i have ever seen and i cannot recommend this movie enoughparticularly if youre a middle aged jobless stonerim not by the waymiddle aged that is,black_comedy
my new alltime fave flick  a meandering plot  if you can call it  plot a bit like being stoned and forgetting what you were going to say next  then just changing the subject completely but it doesnt matter  all the characters are perfect  even though we dont see much of turturro and buscemi  jeff bridges is superb  and looking very good  the dialogue and scenes make it a cult classic  and it didnt even make it to my local cinema,black_comedy
what can i say this is one of my favourite films to date the coen brothers have done it again have they ever made a bad film well barton fink was odd but still not bad jeff bridges is the dude literally i find it very strange that the hero of this story is a loafer who just wants to drink white russians get stoned and bowl but it works a treat i found myself getting caught up in their world john goodman played a great role as the dudes friend walter and steve buscemi filled the part of poor old donny the story is humorous throughout although brief sadness is found but even this is used to humorous effect okay it isnt one of the most intricately woven plots ever but the dialogue is expertly written and the characters superb i recommend this film to anyone who is a coen brothers fan that really goes without saying and anyone who sees a bit of the dude in themselves which if we were honest might be a lot of us oh and anyone who likes cool movies,black_comedy
when i saw the trailer for this movie i didnt look all that appealing but when they aired it on television one night i watched it and i have to say i laughed myself to death john goodman and jeff bridges are just so funny in this movie lots of swearing especially from goodman but most of the times its hella funny steve buscemi has a role here to its not that big but he appears in some scenes as bridges and goodmans buddy donny hes pretty funny to though he always seems to be talking to goodman and never bridges john torturro appears in a minor role as well but as all other roles in this movie its hilarious i cant praise this movie enough its just so perfect and if youre looking for a movie with a killer soundtrack this is just for you,black_comedy
i checked this site and couldnt believe the low rating that this film received  i know youre thinking that 78 isnt particularly poor but it is my belief that the majority of those who have rated it have only seen the film once  okay so you might not be into the whole multiple viewing thing but give this film a second chance and i promise that you will notice one of the most sidesplittingly funny films youve ever seenjohn goodman gives a career best as the nam veteran with a chip on his shoulder and jeff bridges was born to play jeff the dude lebowski  i have watched this film so many times that i have lost count and still new sh comes to light every time i see ityouve seen it once now why dont you give it a second chance  if you do watch this film for the second time and enjoy it more than the first you can contact me to express your opinions  even contact me if you still believe that it is poor and i will eat my hat,black_comedy
arguably one of the funniest movies of all time  this film had it all lots of laughs great acting and the hero went by the name of the dude  the movie is hilarious without a doubt the coen brothers best work  i hope they can do another project like this sometime soon,black_comedy
its not just another movie its a guide of how to live life seem a little over the top watch it base your life on it and enjoy life enough said,black_comedy
outstanding performance by jeff bridges  john goodman did well also its a fine movie i liked it  jeff definitely is a great actor and he seems to like this kind of characters  he did something alike in american heart its a good portrait of lazy man a pacifist a man who just doesnt like problems or complications  he just wants to bowl as well as his friends see it,black_comedy
it seems to me that most people who do not like have only seen it once i hated after the first time i saw it but then i saw it again and cant stop watching it i had to go out and buy it the next day ive been trying to figure out what its all about cause it seems to portray itself as really being about nothing but there are all these different characters that portray different ideologies and perspectives like nihilism or feminism or capitalism or fascism pacifism especially the list goes on the movie seems to be about the struggle of these different ideologies during a time of war that no one seems to care about i know everyone says jeff bridges does a good job but personally i think john goodman does one of the best acting jobs ive ever seen of which the writing has a lot to do with the only thing i have no idea whatsoever that belongs in this movie is sam elliot am i wrong i mean who drinks sasperilla anyway haha but i do highly recommend this movie one of the few films i can watch over and over and enjoy more every time,black_comedy
for the life of me i couldnt understand the acclaim the coen brothers achieved over the years i could tell their films were wellcrafted and executed but they didnt strike me as anything remarkable i was particularly puzzled over the success of fargo which i initially found monotonous and flat then i saw and my attitude about the coen brothers changed 360 degrees this explained to me perfectly that  in my estimation  the coen brothers films are not about stories as much as they are studies of culture and characters however lively or lazy the plot may be  its beside the point the joy is to be found in the dialogue of the characters and the world they inhabit has easily make itself one on my favorite films of the 1990sset in los angeles in the early 1990s jeff bridges seems to smile and grimace with delight as jeff the dude lebowksi a lofty 40something pothead who wastes his days smoking pot and drinking white russians while practically living inside his regular hangout  a bowling alley the dude is accompanied by his buddies walter john goodman in a hysterical performance of an angry triggerhappy veteran and the babbling clueless donnie steve buscemi the dude is soon mistaken for a millionaire with the same name as his whose trophy wife bunny has racked up a debt with a local pornographer it seems bunny has been kidnapped for ransom and the real lebowski hence the title would like the dude to serve as his courier for the payoffs daughter  a pretentious performance artist played by the alwaysreliable julianne moore  intervenes suggesting that the instructions the dude has received from her father may be misleading  a series of complications ensue that involve a private eye a missing toe a sacred jewish holiday a trio of bumbling germans and the dudes beloved rug that really tied the room togetherdamn i may never tire of seeing this film the ingenuity the coens display here is endless and tireless have you ever noticed that so many coen brothers films feature characters you love to watch but would probably hate to know in person jeff bridges totally redefines his breadth as an actor by completely disappearing beneath the dudes shaggy beard sloppy wardrobe profane vocabulary and rotund pot belly for a character who seems pretty clueless we have an easy  enjoyable time following the dude through his travails employing john goodman again the coen brothers put him to terrific use as a gunloving veteran obsessed with making a spectacle to enforce his point no matter where he is as well as honoring the religious duties of his exwife despite the fact that hes not jewish but nonetheless pledges himself to it shomer fking shabbus  most great filmmakers have themes and  or  an era they tend to revisit over  over this is not evident with the coen brothers like stanley kubrick and mike nichols the only reoccurring element in all of their films are that they are well made and very unique from all others if youre not sold on the idea of seeing yet its worth viewing just for seeing the view from inside a bowling ball as it travels down an alley this is a wild wacky movie thats nonetheless intelligent and crafty basically the big lebowksi is a dumb comedy for smart people,black_comedy
this movie is so fun to watch the coen brothers are magicians with dialogue and characters i love their style of filmmaking and writing this film like many of their films is very characterdriven a great soundtrack and some great cinematography round out this effort this film gets quoted by my friends and i as much as any film there is if you get a chance go rent this coen classic right now as a matter of fact get them all910,black_comedy
i loved this movie loved itmind you it doesnt seem many critics liked it that much i can think of many reasons why one is that i have bad taste and the other is that they are so anal that they missed the entire point of the movieive heard the plot sucks well ive watched this several times and i have yet to even notice the plot the plot isnt the point this movies point is the dudewant me to sum up the plota guy called the dude is forced from his daily routine to go on a hunt for a new rugand thats about it thats what drives the dude when faced with the prospect of getting several thousand dollars he remains concerned only with his rug getting serveral thousand dollars might force a change in his lifestyle after all something he tries desperatly to get back throughout the course of this moviethis movie is looked at mostly from the point of view of the dude as such you see the world through his eyes a bunch of events stopping him from getting a new rug jeff bridges plays the part perfectly out of place and annoyed by everything around him taking up his bowling timei found the entire movie hilarious in a typical over done coen way nothing anyone says is predictable its very well acted well paced and well shot of coursejust sit back and relax dont look to hard and enjoy the situations the dude ends up in because everyone around him refuses to adopt his life style whats the moral message of the movie i dunno who cares,black_comedy
this is awesome the dude is who everyone wants to be he doesnt care what happens to him well he does but he doesnt get all crazy about it hes mellow he says all the cool stuff he is just sooooooooo cool you cant go wrong with the dude joel and ethan coen are genieusesor however you spell that,black_comedy
without a doubt the best movie ever made  funny as hell lots of smokin drinkin cussin and bowlin  donnie youre out of your element  are you employed sir  if not rent this movie immediately and watch it all week if you do have a job watch it after work  havent you heard  your war is over mr lebowski the bums lost  well ive had enough of this movie review  mind if i do a j,black_comedy
is one of those movies that i didnt love the first time i saw it but now that i have seen it 20 times i love it  now just the thought of watching it makes me laugh  i am laughing while i am putting it in the dvd player and i am laughing now as i think about jeff bridges playing detective all of a sudden and finding a cartoon picture of a man with an enormous penis on the pad that jackie treehorn had scribbled on  i mean come on is this not cinematic genius  whatever the reasons this film just gets better the more times you see it similar in that regard to office space  this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seenhe doesnt care about anything hes a nihilistmust be exhausting,black_comedy
my friends and i have seen this several times and we agree that it is a dark comedy up there with dr strangelove  it has elements of greatness on so many levels that are not apparent at first the bad box office turnouts were easily overshadowed by its popularity in rental and vhsdvd sales very similar to what happened to a lot of great movies such as blade runneressentially this film in a nutshell is about a slacker in the early nineties whom in the first several minutes is beaten up by two thugs in his own home one of which soils his rug then realizing that they kicked the proverbial crap out of the wrong guy they leave  this slacker lebowski goes on an odyssey to find the men who saturated his carpet which ultimately gets him mixed up in a kidnapping case involving german nihilists trying to cut off his genitalia including a late night bathroom attack by a trained attack marmotlots of memorable scenes characters such as jesus the perverted bowler and very twisted humor some of which may be considered offensive seeing as a scant several scenes features brief nudityits symbolic for society some might say as is a very achieved man where as the hero the little lebowski is a foulmouthed slacker but in the end through confusion the little lebowski turns out to have been taken advantage ofa four star comedy,black_comedy
is a wonderful comedy with a twisting somewhat complex plot not usually found in this genre john goodman delivers an especially humorous performance as an vietnam vet who never really has anything under control and jeff bridges plays the slacker dude who gets thrown into an amazing twist of events thanks to merely sharing the same name as a millionaire highly recommended if youve never seen it,black_comedy
i watched this film on tv before i watched it i thought it would be great anyway but after watching i thought it was great the coen brothers have exceeded themselves once again the styl wit and charisam of this film is great the dream sequences are the most original scenes i have seenamerican beauty eat your heart out the twisted humour of this film is nothing like i have seen before everyone should watch this film its greati cant wait for thier next film the man who wasnt there,black_comedy
what can i say about this film ive recently watched it on video ive watched fargo and that was the main reason why i purchased this movie i thought the coen brothers have a gift and wondered if this same gift is used in this movie in my opinion this is probably better than fargo steve buscemi and john goodman are absolutely hilarious in this movie especialy when donnie says one word in a conversation with a quick reply of shut the fk up donnie from goodman but lets not take any thing away from jeff bridges who as the dude is so good at being so chilled makes me laugh the dream sequences made me crack up as well with jeff or the dude doing his little dance down those huge steps all in all a pleasure to watch one of my top 10 movies well at least im house broken,black_comedy
the coen brothers have scaled dizzy heights in the 1990s  barton fink and millers crossing showed an outstanding knack for serious comedy if such a phrase can be used  the unfortunate failure of the hudsucker proxy was followed by fargo their most critical and commercially successful film to date  when came out in 1998 it was met with some critical division and was not the commercial success many had envisioned it to be  it is a shame because is an outstanding comedy filled with great characters and brilliant dialogue  it is also technically superb with meticulous attention paid to every detail  add in careertopping roles from jeff bridges and john goodman and you have a movie that will be held in the same esteem as some of the greatest comedies everits los angeles 1991  jeff the dude lebowski bridges is mistaken for another jeffery lebowski a millionaire paraplegic whose young trophy wife has been acumilating debts around los angeles  the dude as he is known has his home invaded by some thugs who have come to collect the debt  when realising he is not the correct lebowski they urinate on his rug  angry the dude seeks payment from the other lebowski for a replacement rugthe dude a sort of hippy who has only slightly modernised and grown up since the 60s  all the dude does is bowl drive around and get stoned  what is so great about the dude is the ease at which bridges plays the character it is almost the perfect role for him  with long shoulder length hair a goatee beard and pajama like attire the dude is slacker cool before it became a early to mid 90s chic  the dudes friends are similarly eccentric the dim and permanently off the ball donny steve buscemi and the aggressive walter sobchak john goodman who is caught up in the past especially his experiences in vietnam  why the dude hangs out with such different characters is unusual but it only adds to the comic genius of the filmother characters are superb as well  phillip seymour hoffman is excellent as brandt the anallyretentive assistant to who is also brilliantly played by david huddleston  however perhaps the most memorable character is jesus quintala a bowling opponent of the three friends played by coen brothers stalwart john turturro jesus is a hilariously disgusting latino bowler who wears skintight pink and blue jumpsuits to his bowling games  this character almost outshines the dude as the most fun character to watchfurther on in the story the dude walter and donny get caught up in a botched kidnapping plot which is sometimes confusing and ultimately anticlimatic  this film is more a series of hilarious vignettes rather than a cohesive story  the film is packed with witty memorable quotes that hit the mark more often than you think  the coen brothers construct outstanding set pieces the dolly and slow motion tracking shots of the bowling hall the dudes dream sequence and the citizen kanelike drawing room of  all of these combined with the fine performances make this an unforgettable comedy,black_comedy
this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen smart clever and very well acted very refreshing thank god for joel and ethan coen jeff bridges is absolutely hilarious as the dude and john goodman what can i say priceless philip seymour hoffman made me laugh so hard and i dont think he was supposed to highly recommended,black_comedy
this movie is hilarious the casting in this movie couldnt have been more perfect  jeff bridges does a great job as the dude a pot head from the 70s who doesnt seem to do much but bowl and have the occasional acid flash back  the dude then gets caught up in a kidnapping and him and his buddies have to figure out what to do i recommend this movie to people who are not offended by vulgar language and are in the mood for a good hearted movie about buddies,black_comedy
man he is like so cool  ive never seen a movie that showed such a slacker and made being a slacker seem not so bad and hey i could get used to him  the cohen brothers are always petulant but here it seemed like they just said lets have fun and were gonna film every minute of it  hey theyre basically good eggs  those squares bug the dude they really bug him  the dude may sleep it off a bit too much but hes got it all together upstairs  somebodys after his rug and he smells a rat a big commie rat  the main problem is that lebowskis being terrorized by some hoods and keeps wondering hey are these guys employed by anyone  the movie sure keeps you guessing and the cast of the movie help to really dress it up  jeff bridgesthis is some of his best acting john turturrohes good cause he has nothing to do with the film and julianne moorewell settle on looks  im kidding of course  also catch sam elliot as mr exposition its a good thing hes here to walk us around this movie rating 1010,black_comedy
i love this film  i own the video and have seen it 4 times a different comedy i recommend it to everybody who hasnt seen it the characters play excelent especially john goodman as said before a must see ,black_comedy
i have seen this movie more than a dozen times i often just play it on the dvd while i am doing something else why  well this movie is unlike any other one i have ever watched  you cannot really categorize it in a particular genre  it is unique it is funny the performances are outstanding and the story line is very original  the best thing about the story itself is its simplicity for the lack of a better word  this movie does not try to teach us or get a point across it is just about dudes life who enjoys doing nothing  now the coens took dudes life and turned it to one of the funniest wittiest and most amusing movie of all times  the soundtrack complements the story very well the coens always seem to have the perfect touch for their soundtrack choice and sam elliots voice for the narration was the perfect choice that being said i just have to watch the movie again,black_comedy
this movie has spurned a cult following in the last two years simply quoting lines from this movie to others familiar with it sparks immediate commaradarie  oh nice marmut  you cant help but chuckle at that this is one of the best modern day film noirs i have ever seen  at first glance its a great comedy watch it again and you notice its also a noir brilliant   if you like the cohen brothers watch  millers crossing other movies that may interest you chinatown the big sleepthe cohens actually based parts of lebowski on this film look for the guy in a wheelchair also easy rider,black_comedy
this is by far my favorite comedy of all time  the acting is so real and the situation is so insane that it probably has happened somewhere out there  jeff bridges john goodman steve buscemi and john turturro all give excellent performances and give the movie such depth that you cant help but grow to know and love there characters  the music is terrific especially just dropped in by kenny rogers and the new edition which is now one of my favorite songs  this is one of those movies that if you carried the script in your pocket could provide you with a thought provoking and extremely hilarious quote for any occasion  truly a masterpiece,black_comedy
not a viewing goes past that i dont laugh at this movie whether it be the rammblings of walter the constant drug referances or the jesus i cant say much about this film surprisingly enough all i can say is this it has more of a complex plot than you think it has a distinctive style and gives more than a few laughs try it out sometime dude,black_comedy
this is quite possibly the funniest film ive ever seen  the more i think about it the better it gets  there are so many classic scenes in this movie that just stick in your memory and never lose their hilarity jeff bridges is stunningly good as the dude and john goodmans performance is as ever brilliant  john turturro also appears in surely one of the most memorable and humorous cameos in cinema history as the perverted rival bowler jesus  my only gripe is that the vast talents of steve buscemi were a little wasted in his relatively small role but he still shone through as the timid donny it is impossible to list all the great points of this film  see it at the cinema then rent it then buy the video  i know i will,black_comedy
i dont have much to add to the comments already posted here except to say that if this movie didnt catch your funny bone the first time around give it a second chance  it gets progressively funnier with each viewing  the quotable lines therein are innumerable and every performance deadon 85 out of 10 and still rising,black_comedy
is contrary to critical opinion the best of the coen brothers movies it seems that every line has been crafted with the keenest of eyes for hilarity every word out of almost every characters mouth is funny bridges is genius as the slackerbum john goodman is extremely entertaining as the putupon aggressive vietnam vet youll be quoting jesus quintana john turturro for weeks after the movieif you like intelligent humor a plot that will keep you guessing and movies youll be sorting out for weeks after viewing youll love,black_comedy
if youre not one to be offended by a lot of swearing you cant afford to miss this movie  ive never laughed so much or found so much quotable material in one picture as i did in  if you havent seen it do  if you have seen it lets go bowling,black_comedy
this is a great movie or you love it or you hate it the thing with is that the whole story isnt that important its all about the weird characters and the conversations plus that it has a great soundtrack and the you get to see the nicest shots of the beautiful game of bowling even viewed from inside of a ballits about this guy named the dudebridges whose real name is lebowski  that usually hangs at the bowling with the crazy vietnamveteran walter goodman who screws up everything and the shy little guy named donny buscemi the dude comes home after another day of bowling and finds 2 guys in his house that are after a lebowski but after a little brainstorming they realize that this isnt the rich lebowski they were looking for before leavingone of the intruders the chinaman urinates on the dudes rug the rug that really tied his room together but the dude is gonna do something about it this aggression will not stand manthe next day dude decides to go to the lebowski they were looking for to report the incident and to maybe get some money for a new rug this is the beginning of a hilarious adventure with very funny scenessee this masterpiece by the brothers coen and laugh your head offyou can watch it more than once,black_comedy
is simply put as a hilarious movie  the characters are funny for many reasons  the dude minding his own buisiness walks into his house and is ruffed up by two thugs  as they leave one of them pes on his rug  after that event a bunch of other bad things happen to him hes just this incredibly confused unemployed pothead and his entire life is changed just because he has the same name of a millionaire whos wife owes money all over town  the plot wanders and changes so much that sometimes you have to pause the movie and ask someone next to you what is going on the characters in this movie especially john goodmans character walter sobchak are just so funny that its hard to describe  walters always rambling on about something stupid that has nothing to do with the subject like how he fought in vietnam and scolding donnie for just asking a question  this movie has a good plot good characters and good dialogue the music also isnt bad creedence clearwater revival or creedence as referred to in the movie bob dylan and kenny rogers are included not too shabby  rent this movie  youll be satisfied  enjoy,black_comedy
has got to be one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time the film centers on the dude jeff bridges a white russian drinking hippieslacker who is seeking reparations for his soiled rug and is then ensnared in a sinister kidnapping schemealthough the convoluted plot makes less sense the more you think about it where this film really shines is its ensemble of colorful characters and much of its humor is derived from quirks in their personality in an era where it seems most movie characters are nothing more than one dimensional cardboard cutouts it is refreshing to see fully fleshed out characters in a good example of this is the dudes bowling buddy walter sobchak john goodman at first glance he seems like a pretty shallow character a boorish belligerant loudmouth he has no second thoughts about smashing up a corvette or biting a nihilists ear off to aid the dudes quest however when it comes to issues in his own life he is rather powerless notice that when the flamboyant trash talking bowler jesus quintata taunts walter he just sits meekly and takes the abuse he takes care of his exwifes dog without any protest and is still observes her religion judiaism walters character flaws in turn causes the normally mellow dude to lose his cooloh look at me im rambling again this is just one fun movie to watch with a message that just bumbling through life doing nothing isnt such a bad thing whenever im feeling down watching it cheers right back up definitely recommended,black_comedy
the coen brothers big lebowski is without a doubt the best comedy movie of all time jeff bridges plays the character of the lazy potsmoking dude so well you actually believe the hilarious remarks he makes are genuine his friend walter john goodman is the stereotypical vietnam vet that manages to relate everything to vietnam no matter how remote the situation is this movie is great aphrodisiac after a long stressful day at school or work unlike most comedy movies gets better every time you watch it i recommend that a person watch it at least twice to get the full effect of the coen brothers genius better yet buy the video or dvd this movie just keeps getting funnier every time,black_comedy
now i know people have complained about this film stating it was stupid and that it didnt make any sensewell ill speak for myself i loved it the coen bros are the best filmakers of our time and this was no exception jeff bridges was superb as the dude and surprised me with his transformation into a slacker john goodman steve buscemi and john turturroall coen vets put in memorable roles and made the film that much better watch for jon polito as the private detective following the dude he was also in millers crossing and barton finka word of advice if you loved fargo do not expect a sequel youll be very disappointed expect the unexpected and enjoy it for what it is a very funny comedy,black_comedy
if you look beyond the outlandish plotline and the unique characters you will see that this is unquestionably one of the best movies of the 1990s the characters are real they are symbols of the mixedup weatherbeaten allbutforgotten world in which they live  the press did not like this movie and therefore it was not treated fairly  if you open your mind you will relish the experience of,black_comedy
this is a great little movie and bridges is hilarious  tho im not sure exactly what happens in the end i think its a bit confusing i still watch it all the time  i bought it on dvd and with the widescreen format its even better than having seen it on vhs full screen  the film has a really nice look and the scenes have a soft comfortable feeling to them if that makes any sense i watch it and i just cant help but want to be with the dude and walter  they might be lazy slackers for the most part but theyre fun and that comes out in this movie im a big way  the scenes in the bowling alley are funny and steve buscemi is hilarious as well as donny the guy who has barely two words in the entire film  this is a great film and its funny as any of the other films by the brothers check it out,black_comedy
this is one of those great movies you run across from time to time that isnt trying to be a 4 star classic its just trying to make people laughand that it did this is a great movie to watch at a party or even by yourself unique feel good comedy,black_comedy
alright so i am a coen fanatic and that might make me biased however the coens did make hudsucker proxy and i did not really like that so you can believe me when i say this is one of the greatest comedies ever right up there with raising arizona that coen brother thing again to sum it up simply the dude has a rug that really ties the room together it gets miterated upon by some guys looking for bunny but bunny is not the dudes wife oh yeah some nihilists are also looking for bunny they believe in nothing walt is going to help dude get his rug  a new one back and find several analogies to the vietnam war to sum up what is going on the dude does get a rug but it was maudes rug bunnys stepdaughter but dont call her that oh yeah maude will have dudes baby after her assistants beat the dude up even though the dude would prefer getting together with bunny she was in logjamming but brandt does a good job of preventing that oh yeah the nihilists cut the toe off one of their girlfriends they pretend that it is bunnys toe so they can get ransom from who is not the dude donny sadly dies the little lebowski urban achievers lose out on a million dollars dude gets the credence back but the car is totaled is this helping or should i stop,black_comedy
greatest jeff bridges movie ever i absolutely loved this film it has everything woman drugsgunstheftpornbowlinghumorand a great cast nothing better than a bum who bowls with his 2 loser friends one who never listens and the other who is a vietnam vet who is always reminding you of his experience one stolen rug starts off the heist of millions and the dude is stuck in the middle of all of it hes pulled in every direction while trying to figure out who kidnapped the wife of a millionaire who happens to have the same name jeff lebowskithrown into this film are german nialists we believe in nossinglebowski eccentric naked painters and a bowler accused of pedophilia thrown into the mix are a bunch of great scenes that may not make sense if i tried to explainsooooorent this movie as soon as you can her life depends on ityour life will change my life will change the dude only wants his rug back go now,black_comedy
this movie is simply fantastic  the coen brothers have once again outdone themselves  amazing imagery coupled with a fantastic though brief performance by john turturro paints a hilariously poignant picture of the bowling subculture  the coen brothers have long been known for paying less attention to the plot than they pay to the visuals and the interaction of their characters and this film is no exception  the plot is somewhat confusing and contains innumerable twists but what lies at the heart of this movie is solid the relationship that is developed between john goodman and jeff bridges is funny and it reveals quite a bit about their characters  overall i thought this movie was outstanding  even though it didnt reveal any eternal truths about the human spirit i had fun while watching it and thats all the truth i need,black_comedy
like many other reviewers here ill confirm that achieves higher planes of brilliance with each viewing there is not a single detail of this film that is not intentionally placed and youll never catch them all the first time yet alone the third time repeat viewings are like peeling away the layers of a magnificent onionafter at least ten viewings over a two year period i finally saw the true light this is an offkilter remake of the big sleeprent the classic bogarthawkschandler film the big sleep and then watch again they both have a twisted plot a rich man in pasadena in a wheelchair dangerous daughters a rich and dangerous playboyentrepreneur nitwit thugs instead of philip marlowe we get the dude a bachelor a bowler and quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county which would put him in the running for laziest worldwidei agree with all the other great reviews of this masterpiecelaughable  ha ha,black_comedy
where to begin this is my all time favourite film thats a start i suppose this like pulp fiction is one of those films that just exude coolness cool is the best way to describe the main character of the film the dude a man who ambles through life in a haze of ganja smoke and freaky dreams he also loves bowling featuring some of the greatest characters and indeed performances in film history tbl tells a wonderfully imaginitive story that although is disjointed is held together by the coens trademark flair for dialogue and repeating of themes a celebration of every nohoper in the world tbl has a lot to say  it just cant be bothered to say it come on man lets go bowling,black_comedy
this is superb the coen brothers have given the world another classic after fargo millers crossing and barton fink there are so many great quotes in this film and the perfomances are excellentparticularly good is john goodmans walter and in a smaller roles philip seymour hoffman as brant and john turturro as jesus in the main role jeff bridges is totally convincing as the dude,black_comedy
the coen brothers prove their aptness at creating quirky wonderfully engaging and often hilarious characters as well as snappy dialogue between them  is a wellwritten offbeat comedy filled with gutbusting scenes of absurdity and charmstars jeff bridges as lebowski or as he prefers to be called the dude  when he is mistaken as another lebowski millionaire lebowski he stumbles into a kidnapping ransom moneylaundering plot between millionaire lebowski and a group of nihilists  in between this he takes the time to go bowling with buddies john goodman and steve buscemijeff bridges hilarious dude is a wonderful amalgam of laziness and lowkey wit  his performance is marvelously engaging and entertaining with bridges making his character slovenly meandering but ultimately an allaround nice guy  john goodman gives one of his best comedic performances to date as the dudes whacked out extremist jewish nam buddy  he and steve buscemis harsh scenes create a caustic and very funny chemistrythe dream sequences are in a class by themselves  they are probably the oddest ever filmed with bridges getting caught in a bowling ball a bowling balls eye view and an unusually militant worker at the local bowling alley  at the very least they will put a smile on your facewith its quirky offbeat characters jeff bridges brilliant comic creation that is the dude and a wonderfully funny supporting cast is one of the best comedies of all time  while the plot may not be at the same level of the coens other masterpiece fargo its still very enjoyable fun after all who would have taught a film with bowling as a backdrop could be so fun 9 out of 10,black_comedy
i wasnt sure if id like this film or not i really wasnt going to give it a chance but came across it one day and was pleasantly surprised i thought it was very funny and jeff bridges was just great as dude thats all you heard throughout the film it was so funny if you feel like having a good laugh than this film is for you,black_comedy
is one of those rare movies that is still funny after watching it a dozen times  it is so hard to make good comedy that is even funny the first time through but the quirkiness of the characters in this film and the brilliant dialogue create a world and story with depth and style  the writing has a strength to it reminiscent of the princess bride albeit with slightly more profanity and pulp fiction,black_comedy
this film is one of the greatest comedies if not one of the greatest films ive ever seen  but heres fair warning this is not a film to be watched on a night of drunken partying with your loud buddies  every single word must be paid close attention to  otherwise theres just way too much great stuff to be missed  not only that but it begs for repeat viewings  i guarantee that if you watch this movie five times youll pick up on hilarious new lines you didnt catch before every time  the dialogue in this movie is perfect  its some of the smartest comedy ive ever heard i have to cut it off there because if i went on to write about all the great things in this movie id be here all day  just take the advice of a complete stranger rent the movie and watch it immediately  then watch it again the next day  if its a fiveday rental watch it every day you have it  you couldnt possibly be disappointed  that is all,black_comedy
this movie i saw for the first time in winter of 1999 i didnt really pay much attention to it because i was tired and i had seen two other rentals prior to this one i thought to myself nothing special then about a month to a month and a half ago i saw it at the flea market here for sale at 5 there wasnt much else to do or buy so i got it i watched it again and it blew me away it is such a well constructed plot with many twists and turns and incredibly well developed and sympathetic characters i found a new respect for john goodmans acting abilities i had always thought that jeff bridges was ok but his performance here made his stock go up in my personal opinion then you have other people who made the movie a delight like john turturro steve buscemi and julianne moore the coen brothers have an amazing talent for screenplay writing and i cant wait for their next project it has even inspired me more to write a little something myself,black_comedy
a magnificently wellthought out comedy that draws its material from philosophy politics and bowling  the brothers follow a seemingly apathetic character who refers to himself as the dude or your dudeness or el duderino if your not down with the whole brevity thing as he unwillingly becomes responsible for the life of the missing trophywife of a wealthy cripple who shares the same last name as the dude  lebowski  rather than relying on simple fart jokes and sight gags this comedy revolves around the question of how one is expected to behave in modern american society and how one exists when one no longer considers oneself to be a member of society the protagonist is an outsider a contradiction to the values of the politics that surround him and our willingness to embrace him is the core of this wonderful film,black_comedy
bowling beer and drugs what more could you possibly ask for from a movie how about a show dogwith  papers  bowling as it is meant to be played is the key element in this movie  donny is without a doubt one of the funniest characters in any movie ever madei love walters take no  attitude  he always has a plani also heard that he was in nam  he refuses to give in to any opponent calling them all  amateursthe dudeneed i say more,black_comedy
is one of my favorite comedies of all time  it follows the unlucky trail of the dude lebowski jeff bridges an outofwork lazy bachelor with bowling and doing drugs his only hobbies  one night he comes home to goons who dunk him in his toilet and pee on his rug  they leave when they find out that the man theyre trying to get money from is a different lebowski a millionaire dave huddleston whose wife owes money all over town  dude goes to lebowskis house and takes a rug despite lebowskis rage at dude for being a slacker  from there on the movie gets more and more confusing with more and more plot twists and characters added  i would make this movie a 10 out of 10 if it hadnt confused me so much the first time i saw it so instead i gave it a 9  rent it or buy it tonight,black_comedy
although initially difficult to watch with a blur of confusing plot turns and twists is a movie that really rewards repeat viewings things become clear the coen brothers quirky sense does wonderful things donnie becomes the true hero of the film its a great movie one of the funniest ive seen in the last few years with some truely humorous visuals 45,black_comedy
i would have to say this is without a doubt one of my top 10 favorite comedies  i dont think this movie is for everyone and certainly not for children but this movie is great  there are so many scenes that you can act out and have a great laugh with your buddies  i just saw this movie for the first time less than 3 months ago sometime in june or july of 2000 and ive seen it 3 or 4 times already  i havent seen many of the other coen brothers movies but i have seen fargo witch i have to say i wasnt all too fond of ill have to see it again and i just saw barton fink last night  i also saw raising arizona a while back and loved it  id have to say from what ive seen so far is their best work yet  i have to see blood simple millers crossing and the hudsucker proxy and im dying to see their upcoming o brother where art thou  anyway if you are open to interesting comedy please see and pay attention to every word  also make sure you think about everything they say some of the things they say are hysterical if you think about it at first it may not seem so funny  and one last thing make sure you pay attention to how the characters interact with each other and put yourself in their shoes  i love this movie  thanks for reading cortex,black_comedy
this is a really really really good movie people the thing i really love about it is that the story shot right past me the first three times i saw it i hardly noticed many of the intricacies of the plot because i was so caught up with the fabulous conversations oneofakind characters great music and awesome imagery but each time i watch this film i notice something new about it were it not for the ridiculous atmosphere and nonsensical nature of this film it could be a great detective flick the story is magnificentany aspiring writers should take note this movie seamlessly blends good dialogue good characters and good story most of the scenes in the movie carry several different purposes combine this with an excellent cast and great performances from bridges goodman and buscemi along with just about every supporting character and you have a classic comedy i do not use the term classic lightlythe last thing i really like about this movie is that after all of the humor i found myself deeply involved in the story and the wellbeing of the characters at first some might find it a little melancholy i certainly did but after watching this movie as many times as any other ive ever seen it lifts my spirits every time this is the kind of movie my friends and i will be quoting every line from until were senile an absolute must see,black_comedy
sha la la   la la la  la la sha la la   la la la  la la sha la la   la la la  la la  lalala la la   la lathe man in me will do nearly any task but as for compensation there is a little he would askfantastic  my favorite movie for sure  please everyone go rent it  but just a fair warning it took me maybe 23 or more times through it to really appreciate all the language and detail that make it so artistic and hilariousim talking about drawing a line in the sand here dude across this line  you do not also dude,black_comedy
i loved this movie when i saw it in the theater  and it never gets old there are so many moments in this movie that you just think about and chuckle over for days afterwardsjeff bridges is truly awesome as a lazy antihero  but i really think every eccentric character in this movie shines theyre all doing something very different herethis is my favorite movie of all time  i laugh every time i see it  i really do,black_comedy
 but i dig credence just like the dude  actually ive known two dudes and a walter and a donnie  could have been the dude myself if i didnt have a family  every characters quirk in this movie rang true to somewhere in my past except the chicano sex pervert jesus with his purple jumpsuit bowling ball in hand  strutting on the lanes never seen that before ive seen this movie more than ten times and loved it each time not so much for the story as the way the dude moves smoothly through it while walter always makes things more difficult for him thru harsh rashness  its odd that two guys so different such contrasts in style and substance would be friends connected only by bowling  add some outlandish contrivances and you got max eccentricity great music dream sequences acting i think jeff really is a dude that he wasnt really acting top ten movie for me because i love the humor,black_comedy
i have never seen a movie that i can watch over and over again and still laugh out loud at every classic moment  does it for me all the way  many people told me it was stupid and not funny  of course those were the same people who regard american pie as the funniest movie ever not that slapstick comedy doesnt make me chuckle but i cannot hold a conversation with somebody who thinks dont be a menace to south central is a classic  this movie gets my vote for good wholesome family fun,black_comedy
as i look over the other comments for the coen brothers film i see that i am not alone in my appreciation  when i first saw this film in the theater it was a bit of a letdown coming on the heels of the brilliant fargo one of the greatest american films of the last 20 years and thats no understatement  but when i first rented it on home video i was sucked in by the charm and the atmosphere of the film it has such a laidback easygoing style that i can see how it might not appeal to those looking for nonstop action  but if youre willing to surrender to the peculiar charms of this film you too might begin to see it for the work of genius it is  ive since purchased the film on video and have watched it several more timesit really is a film that grows on you and it is hilarious to boot  john goodman has never been better than in the role of the insufferable walter who knows everything and will never admit hes wrong even when he clearly is  but hes a true friend to the dude played by jeff bridges and donny played by steve buscemi  the three of them are bowling buddies and in the course of preparing for the big tournament they get pulled into a weird little mixup involving a carpet a wayward wife and who just happens to have the same name as bridges characterive seen this described elsewhere as a sort of antimystery and thats one way of enjoying it  imagine jeff bridges as a sort of stoned clueless philip marlowe stumbling through his investigation  the comedy though is just so relaxed and unforced unlike that in the coens raising arizona a film ive never been able to watch  the acting in this film is amazing with a cast of independent film allstars  the more i think about it the more i wonder if this film might not be just that much better than fargo  if not its a very close second  if you rent the film and it doesnt appeal to you at first give it a chanceyou might find that it grows on you too,black_comedy
the only movie i watched three times in cinema thoroughly funny john goodman alias walter sobchak is outstanding the introduction of jesus is one of the highlights in cinema history although the character itself is as unimportant as the whole bowling matterthe movie even doesnt tell you who won the semis,black_comedy
this is definitely one of the smoothest movies ever  the dude is such a great character no cares in the world  john goodman is also great i love all his vietnam flashbacks and his slamming donny is hysterical  if you havent seen it then this is definitely a great movie to see,black_comedy
theres not much to tell about the plot thats not what this film is about its about the life of the dude excellently played by jeff bridges his laidback nihilistic view of the world is absolutely hilarious some may regard this as commentary on todays generation x maybe it is but above all it is a brilliant comedy great role for steve buscemi by the way,black_comedy
usually very good films have substance to them and very bad films have none is an odd ball because its thin guy is mistook for someone else and has caused the other lebowskis wife to be kidnapped or so they think thats it sure their is more parts but not much of a plot yet it is wildly fantasticthis is a small film but it is made larger than it is supposed to be it is hilarious and the humor never gets old like maltin said a film used for introducing wild characters it does and wonderfully i never felt the film sucked at all i never thought it boring i never disliked anything in the film it was just a film the coen bros just made to entertainjeff bridges does a great job as the dude and john goodman was really underrated for his great performance as walter and even as smaller of a role he had steve buscemi did a good job as the nice guy friend of the dude he was just likeable and it was sad to see him die and how mean walter was to him but you knew walter loved him alot but probably the greatest acting is john tuturro as jesus not the savior the bowler he is just so incredibly amazing the nihilists are just downright hilarious flea proves he kicks ass as much as he does as a musicianthe soundtrack is good it really brings the laid back feel of the dude to light good songs by bob dylan kenny rogers creedence clearwater revival and the gypsy kingsi think thats what the coen bros wanted to make the direction is just fantastic the imagery is beautiful and looks great the best scenes in the film are the dudes knocked out sequencesthe film is just like any story a stranger would tell you to bring a smile to your face thats what some people dont understand its just supposed to be one of those funny stories you hear from a guy in a bar one daythe only draw back is that some questions go un answered and you have to go in depth to really try and figure them out who stoles money was it larry or did he actually keep the money then why did maude say that the 1 million dollars was missingthis is a very underrated film and should have garnered more attention and positive reviews but oh well fk it as the dude says this is a good film about a simple story with colorful characters and great cinematographynow i feel like bowling5 out of 5,black_comedy
speaking as a guy who like his art film including ingmar bergman works and the more heady coen brothers films please believe me when i say i would not expect to like a movie with such lowlife urban american characters and swearingno i would not have expected it but there it is something about the constant use of the fword and they way these characters say it is just funny add that to the fact that the plotline is wellconstructed with several amazingly humorous moments in the dialogue and i think its reasonable to call as classicof course the wellconstructed plot only matters when youre done watching it and you actually have time to think about the course of events during the movie its too easy to focus on the dialogue which while emphasizing the speech patterns of those not as skilled in language makes great use of a wide range of speech characteristics from john goodmans characters rants tos the other lebowski educated dialect and of course maude lebowskis feminist rhetoric some men find it very uncomfortable to say vagina the dialogue is actually intelligent at least in the way its written its easy to forget that when you can see the characters delivering the linesits quite hard to say enough about this movie but ill sum it up here i laughed hard i often find things in movies that make me chuckle but this one makes me laugh over and over again i recommend this highly in the genre of comedy alongside films like rushmore which had a similar effect on me,black_comedy
of all the films on my shelf this is the one i watch the most every moment of is a gem bridges and goodman are hilariously funny the only real flaw is a somewhat unengaging plot but in the company of the dude and walter you hardly even notice the coens really are the greatest living filmmakers,black_comedy
this movie is like a big great threes company episode in a way  constant misunderstandings  note that all the characters misread the dudes motivations for doing whatever it is hes doing  jeffrey lebowski believes hes trying to rip him off  jackie treehorn thinks hes trying to muscle in  the detective thinks hes a brilliant sleuth playing both ends against the middle etc  and so on and so on  everyone finds it impossible to believe that hes just the dude takin er easy for the rest of us  also why wasnt jeff bridges nominated for an oscar for this  this has to be his best performance ever and it stands out among a host of them here,black_comedy
a truly brilliant film typical of the coens ability to twist genres here they deconstruct the ransom movie but plant in twists dream sequences and bowling if all this sounds odd to you then trust me it is steve buschemi as ever is superb if a little underused as butthead donny john goodman is a superb shouty nam vet with a brilliant catchphrase am i right or am i wrong and to complement these two superb coen regulars jeff bridges does a superbly relaxed turn as jeffrey the dude lebowski he bowls in his dressing gown man the searchersesque intro is brilliant and the stranger is one of the funniest voiceovers ever apart from the british one that does earthworm jim in short enjoy the twisted world of the coens,black_comedy
since i saw for the first time in the movie theaters over two years ago i saw it twice in the theaters i have probably watched it between 5075 times  i was awed by the overall atmosphere the movie conveyed upon first viewing and was shocked that every subsequent time i saw it it just got better and better  even to this today i notice something new and different upon each viewingcritics who complain that the movie doesnt have a plot miss the point first of all there is a plot albeit a wacky and zany one a coen brothers trademark that many people may not fully understand on first viewing second the plot is only there to serve as a background for the amazing characters scenes and dialogue that the movie focuses on   the interplay between the dude  walter is absolutely hysterical  just one example that comes to mind i couldve picked just about any bowling scene  is walter commenting on the gulf war comparing the man in the black pagamas to the current adversary a bunch of featers where towels on their heads trying to find reserve on a russian tank while the dude is painting his nailsi could go on and on about my favorite scenes but id just have to recite the entire movie because every single scene is so exceptional  from the repeated dialogue this aggression will not stand chinamen pilar to the incredible fadeouts and transitions that wasnt here toe dude you really have to see it multiple times to understand just how incredibly wellcrafted this movie really isin my mind is the best of the coen bros movies outdistancing barton fink  that is an enormous compliment because i love all their movies  it is also possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen and holds a spot in my top ten movies of all timearthur digby sellers,black_comedy
this is one hell of a film  i first saw it in the theatre as a preview my teacher at the time often gave us free passes before i had heard any bad press about it  i was so confused the first time and wondering what was this about that it made me want to see it again  that is when i know that i am going to like a movie when i want to see it again  the main character the dude or el dudarino if you are not into the whole brevity thing is quite simply the laziest person in the world  the dude whose life revolves around drinking white russians which i now drink mostly because of the movie and mostly cause i like um and smoking grass while driving and listening to some creedence is taking it easy for all us sinners  the plot revolves around him and how his soiled rug gets him into a fandangle that no one could expect  the movie does so much with so little kind of in a seinfeld show about nothing type of deal  but what makes this movie a 10 is the superb acting  what a cast jeff bridges john goodman steve buscemi jullianne moore and of course the gorgeous tara reid  this movie has so many intense conversations that you could practically watch it with just the sound on and still laugh your ass off please ignore what anyone says and watch this film and then watch it again cause it gets funnier every time,black_comedy
joel and ethan coen have a unique ability to populate their films with fantastic quirky characters and unbelievable imaginative visuals and they have never done it as good as inthe coens again delve into the world of kidnapping this time the story centers around the kidnapping and ransom demands of a famous millionaire the acting comedic timing direction and sharp writing make this film the funniest film in a longlong time how could you forget this film afi,black_comedy
every once and a while a true life style movie comes along and you can relate to one or more of the characters  well like homer simpson all of us has a little dude in him  thats a good thing we need more dudes then attitudes in our times  although all might not agree with him one gets the feeling of what the films message is and thats what ties it altogether did it not grade a,black_comedy
when a director does such a masterpiece as fargo its very unlikely that he will repeat the same level of excellence in his next film with the coen brothers not only did a good movie but a truly excellent comedy i was laughing so hard when i saw this movie that i almost cried i have seen it three times now and the impact is always huge its hilarious its also smart full of quotable lines and remarks and gripping to the very end in fact i was enjoying it so much that i didnt want it to end the characters are memorable and all the actors do a magnificent job but john goodman steals the movie to me its his best film ever a must see,black_comedy
enother one of joel and ethan coens greats it is very very funny smart ass jeff bridges works great with john goodman john tuturro juilane moore steve beushemi flea philip seymor hoffman ben gazzara and sam elliot all give very interesting performances a definate must see,black_comedy
this is by far the funniest movie ive seen in a long time  its also the most original and creative of the coen brothers films  if you like sarcastic humor or flatout violent in yourface comedy i suggest this film  dont miss the hilarious scenes inside the characters local bowling alley or john goodmans hilarious performance as a jewish friend of the dude  my grade 1010,black_comedy
if you like intellectual slightly surreal slightly more subtle and sophisticated humor than slapstick then i recommend you try this  the characters were flawlessly done and the timing was perfect  there was no predictability i could detect  this movie has so much of what hollywood is good at and so little of what is infamous for unfortunately i prefer more inyourface humor so i didnt find it funny but i enjoyed seeing how well puttogether and perfectly executed this film is  if you are even slightly into this type of humor then this is a film that you will enjoy watching over and over,black_comedy
i have never seen a movie that has made me laugh this much every time i see it this movie is so hilarious not only that its pure genius everything from the twists and turns of the kidnapping to the laughoutloud dream sequences every one does a great job acting and it has more memorable lines than almost every other movie ive ever seen i recommend this movie to everyone i know,black_comedy
this is raymond chandler on acid from the classic lowlife with a heart of gold hollywood denizen protagonist the dude visiting the captain of industry in pasadena to set the plot in motion to the great dialogue making clever use of misunderstandings and failures to communicate  just check the huge list of quotable quotes on this site and imagine them delivered by the excellent castsome additional favorites  to the dude hello  do you speak english the flunky bragging that was when she was first lady of the united states not californiamr lebowski did meet with the president unfortunately there was no photographer present dude replies nancys pretty good meaning as a trophy picture for the ego wall  flunky oh wonderful woman  and finally the guy in the vw to the dude  im a brother shamus dude what like an irish monk,black_comedy
i loved this film incredible plot twists keep you engrossed jeff bridges is perfect as the hippie bowler dude as a matter of fact everything is perfect here i generally like all the coen brothers films although at times they have a tendency of getting too offbeat just for the sake of being offbeat this is not the case here all in all this and barton fink are their 2 best films in my opinion,black_comedy
this film is one of the most mindblazingly funny and i use that expression for no other reason than wanting to say mindblazingly comedies ive ever had the pleasure of viewing perhaps its my penchant for hypersurrealist humor monty python kids in the hall upright citizens brigade south park i could give two craps if youre insulted by the grouping theyre all warped and theyre all hysterical perhaps its that i finally found a movie that can satisfy the intellectual in me and still hold the attention of the slightly cerebrallychallenged around me whom i usually have to trick to see my kind of movie dude you better not have been lying about woody allen making a movie about navy seals but this film ranks up there with my alltime favorites incredibly quotable and utterly hysterical this movie should be seen by anyone and everyone and if they dont like itwell thats justliketheir opinion man,black_comedy
after the darkly surreal snowswept landscapes of the minnesota depicted in fargo 1996 the coen brothers have wisely opted for a different locale with set in los angeles circa 1991 during the persian gulf war this film tells a decidedly unconventionaltale about a man known as the dudejeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is a laidbackkinda guy an aging hippie who spends his days drinkingwhite russians smoking pot and bowling with his buddies one day this all changes when two thugs invadehis home rough him up and urinate on his rug it seemsthat they have the dude confused with another lebowskia rich millionaire whose young wife owes money all overtownbummed at having his prized rug ruined the dude decides to contact the other lebowski and in doing so becomes immersed in a very strange convoluted plot thatinvolves nihilists a kidnapping busby berkley dream sequences british performance artists and bowlingsound a little strange its all par for the course with thecoen brothers a clever filmmaking duo that loves tweakingexisting genres to the point that they become somethingvery different and distinctly coenesquethis includes fullyrealized characters both major andminor that have their own unique habits and mannerismsmost films do not take the time to flesh out their respectiveworlds or the characters that live in them but this is not thecase with the coensthe world that the coens create in ispopulated by a humourous and often bizarre collection ofcharacters that range from an obnoxiously narcissisticbowler john turturro to a feminist performance artistpainter of the british persuasion julianne mooreyou would think that all of these wildly eccentric characterswould overshadow the main character but they merely enhance the wonderful performance by jeff bridges who isthe heart and soul of he creates mannerisms and habits that flesh out his character perfectly from the first time we see him bridges is thedude and even though he is a downandout loser thereis something undeniably likable about him and this is duein large part to bridges performancemay not have the dramatic weight or substance of fargo but it has a distinctive charm uniquelyits own instead the coens have done what robert altmandid in the 70s with the long goodbye use the hardboiledworld of raymond chandler has a starting point to satirizelos angeles culture like altmans filmdispenses with conventional narrative in favour of atmosphere and colourful characters the joy of this film isin watching the entertaining diversions subplots and minorcharacters and how the dude interacts with them all youre not supposed to really care about what happens tothe convoluted storyline or how it is resolved that is merelywindowdressing for the coens to showcase this highly engaging world that theyve created,black_comedy
you must watch this film at least 3 times to fully appreciate its brilliance  jeff was born to play this part  he does dude so well that whenever you see him in any other role you will think bl  the acting in this film is truly the finest i have ever witnessed  many people disagree because it is a comedy  they think that oscar caliber acting should be reserved for dramas  rent this one and watch it alone concentrate let the dude embrace you  let yourself embrace the dude be one with the dude and you shall see the light  grasp the greatest lesson abide,black_comedy
has to be for of the single funniest films i have ever seen  i love the coen brothers and think their sense of comedy and character is one of best in hollywood  as in most of their films they deal with a lot of seemingly simplistic story lines that seen erratic and confusing at first but you have to dig into their movies see then a few time and watch the magic of the story unfold  the characters in this film are all incredibly done  they are so well written you can taken any of them right out of the movie and they would still be more interesting alone then the entire cast of characters in most hollywood movies  the cast is flawless  the dialogue hilarious like i said you have to see this movie more than once the humor is fast and the dialogue often overlaps so its hard to catch every thing the first time and the direction is awesome  not many films can boast that them have covered all the bases so completely  oh course the coen brothers have unusual ways of telling a story  here they have kind of turned it into an old west legend as the narrator tells us of the man named the dude  of all the awesome characters in the movie  not taking anything away from jeff bridges  i have to just love john goodman the most  he is just so under rated  and so incredible funny i cant believe that he is not used more in hollywood as a total manic he is the best   if you see this movie sit back and watch every scene unfold and you will find a bit of humor in every single scene of the movie  and  what you are left with is a testament to the early 90s commentary on the human condition  war politics social standards and some truly hilarious moments all through out  this movie will be a cult classic and should be praised thanks to the genius of the coen brothers,black_comedy
each scene stands alone as a gem of absurdity and harmony  its great the dudes clothes  perfectly ugly  beautiful  walters expression during jesus warning for me by far the best line first time through was i dont f roll on shabbos  being shomer shabbos myself if i had been drinking milk at the time i feel sorry for the people sitting in front of me  i do wonder how that line and the following explanation struck those who were not familiar with the jewish sabbath now my favorite line is well thats just like ah your opinion man i love it and lets not forget we still want the money lebowski i think this movie must be the greatest provider of great quotes everi also enjoy the flashbacks now brought to me every time i hear just dropped in or lookin out my back door oh no he has health problems thats my robe thats your name dude the landlords dance the pd off cabbie eagles fan fawn knudson opening scene of the joy of bowling the dudes id again his clothes a string of gems,black_comedy
it dont matter to jesusjust one of the many funny lines in this classic movie  this is a truly original movie and it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen  in fact this movie gets funnier every time you watch itjeff bridges portrayal of the dude is terrific and in my opinion the best peformance of his career  furthermore i think this is john goodmans best work  he is the perfect vietnam veteran assholesure the plot has some holes and is hard to follow but that doesnt matter  this movie isnt about the plot  its the characters and the dialogue  some people are probably going to hate this movie because it is so confusing and weird  but my friends and i frequently watch this movie for a consistently good time,black_comedy
as a huge fan of the coens arguably the best film makers in the entire industry i was waiting for this film with all of the excitement of a child on christmas day present in hand just waiting to start ripping  fargo was the finest black comedyfilm noir update i had seen for a long time so i figured would be something maybe slightly more low key an above average film but perhaps nothing overly special  i was wrong  this film is in my opinion the best coen brother movie if not the greatest black comedy ever committed to celluloid the characters are established immediately each needing only one line of dialogue to make you feel like you really know them which really invests the audience in the films plot  the dialogue itslef is the best of its kind witty and stylised banter that could only be put together by joel and ethan coen in short this is an amazingly well crafted film that deserves to be recognised in the highest echelons hmmm is my spelling correct of movie making  as close to perfection as you are gonna get from a black comedy even better than dead mans curve which is certainly saying somethingwatch this film,black_comedy
of the coen brothers works i must say that this and raising arizona are without a doubt my favorites  they never back off of saying or doing something that is not just shocking or provoking ala farrelly brothers rather they show something that is simply perversely funny and for this reason i will never grow tired of their filmslebowski is held up by a strong cast of coen brothers regulars including the timeless buscemi stormare goodman and turturro all extremely skilled in their tradeand behind it all if you look very very very closely youll find a moral its a theme throughout the movie so it wont stick out in any particular partmost of all its a fun romp through those carefree days where nothing really matters  watch this with friends  watch this with other coen brothers fans  keep on laughing  its a good movie and i hope you enjoy it as much as i have and continue to do,black_comedy
my thinking about this movie had become so uptight man its like well you know uhh better than uhmm fargo man great soundtrack hilarious characters and situations from the demented mind shared by the coen bros,black_comedy
not only is funny but it is also one of the best written and acted films of the 1990s  the coen brothers mix dialogue with imagery like none other  the genius of the film is the script  each characters lines help build each scene by interrupting one another contradicting each other and ultimately make the other funnier  plus where else are you going to find the line the dude abides or dont fck with jesus  no where  you may have to watch the film more than 20 times to really appreciate it but its a feel good movie  not like armageddon but one that can make you realize what is truly important in life and how often fragile and humorous it can be,black_comedy
is perhaps one of the funniest most intriguing and most enjoyable movies i have ever seen  it combines the genres of mystery comedy satire and drama by using a long drawn out plot full of twists and turns that keep the viewer interested  aside from its obvious humornice marmot the movie is basically a satire arranged around themes not necessarily chronologically although the movie is fluid if you could follow that  the movie at first is very confusing but after one views it once or twice the nuances of it become apparent for example pay attention to what the dude says first about the kidnapping  everything that seems to be completely out of order comes together at the end  as a satire it makes fun of the traditional romantic hero one who goes against the common social mores of the time  the dude is the typical american slacker with no real dreams or ambitions except for winning the county bowling competition this is a kind of slap in the face of those who would accuse the youth of america and say that they will fail just as doesbowling to the dude comes to represent a new kind of religion a purity in an otherwise futile life  in no way does bowling give the dude or walter or even donny a set of rules to follow rather it does give them a sense of inner peace  bowling is almost a zen activity to the dude everything melts away all his cares and sorrows reduced to how hell roll that nightthe movie isnt an endorsement for drugs sex rock and roll or even bowling but it is an advertisement to stop and think about what we are all doing in our humdrum lives,black_comedy
i use this film as a vitamin pill it is so well made with so many small crazy or should i say normal things that goes wrong some of it reminds me of myself when i am having one of those days where everything goes wrongdid i laugh when the dude hammered the chair to the floor against the door so nobody could get in jeff bridges plays so well he should have had an oscar for this role i keep watching this film again and again and new things to laugh at appears every timethis is just my sense of humor it is brilliant and cleverly made fargo was great too i wonder if there are any other films made by these same people in such case i must watch them,black_comedy
such an original movie its hard to describe anything that even is similar to virtually any aspect of the film the script is just incredible with so many memorable lines virtually every page has a gem  the acting is just superb but its the way the film is put together that makes it so special i challenge anyone to guess anything that will happen next  but in the end it makes a lot of sense  these guys know what movie making is all about,black_comedy
another great movie from the coen brothers  even though ive seen it al least 5 times theres still parts that i cant figure out  anyway john goodman steals the show again  the film is full of laughs with the best line being you want a toe  shit i can get you one by 3 oclock  with tail polish   dont wast more time reading this  just get in on video or dvd,black_comedy
this might not be the best movie you have ever seen the first time you see it you probably will not love it but after you see it a couple of times and start thinking back on it it becomes a favorite the characters really jump out at you even the nonmain ones,black_comedy
this movie is a masterpiece the coen brothers are at their best here movie purists might argue that the film lacks a coherent plot but the fact that the film succeeds without one is precisely what makes it so entertaining jeff bridges as the dude reveals a comedic and indeed an acting talent i never knew he had not to be overlooked a standout performances by john goodman john torturro and julianne moore to name a few the dialogue of the film is fast paced and witty with some acid induced dream sequences as stated earlier the plot is incomprehensible but how many coen brother movies arent the soundtrack reminds you that music can add to the plot and movement of events and you are unlikely to ever come across a more unfortunate protagonist than the dude i recommend this film to anyone i emphatically stick two thumbs up,black_comedy
i finally saw this movie on the strong recommendation of a soon to be exfriend had i known it would be so bad i wouldve spent the 2hrs clipping nose hair or cleaning out my chimneyi expected a story on line with fargo which i thoroughly enjoed i expected twisted humor interesting characters and a complete story what i got in my opinion was about 23 really good characters some spicy dialog but a very weak story told in a poor wayi wanted to like it some of the dialog was rich in keeping with the fargo lead but there was really nothing holding it all together the coen brothers got desperate and leafed back through their writing journals and collected bits and pieces of interesting characters and thought they would just magically fall together and compose a moviebig disappointment i now must watch a chickflick with my wife since i made her watch thisbetter luck next time,black_comedy
the general consensus is that the coens best film was fargobut they have never been funnier than heredisplaying the simple pleasures of doing nothingjeff bridges is the dudea bowler who somehow finds himself mixed up with a kidnapping and a toea problem he would have dealt with competently had he not had help from exnam veteran john goodmana bowling obsessive who demonstrates to the dude exactly what happens when a stranger fcks you in the assthe film comes complete with the funniestdrug addled dream sequences youll ever seeand the requisite sparkling coen dialogue is thereall the way through the filmslapstick comedy is mixed with violenceand it never slows downsustaining the laughs for over two hoursno coen film would be complete without tragedy thoughand it comes with the departure of donniethe downtrodden sidekick who barely gets a word in when surrounded by the unflappable dude and the volatile walterlebowski beat the record previously held by goodfellas for most f wordsand you could hardly watch it with your motherbut as a film for the guyswho arent interested in bruckheimer testosteroneit is unbeatablecoen magictheir best so farbut do they have to use so many cuss words ,black_comedy
i found jeff bridges performance in this movie to be delightfully haunting the supporting cast is strong the plot is unpredictable and the laughs are frequentthe dude is straight out of the late 60swith bridges absolutely nailing the character great movie great portrayal,black_comedy
if there was ever a perfect movie it would be  the coen brothers outdid themselves with this story about the dude an average joe who grew up in the 60s likes the leaf and loves to bowl  stealing the show are john goodman as walter the vietnam vet and john turturo as the jesus a flamboyant spanish pedophile  also making an appearance is flea from the red hot chili peppers who makes a great technoplaying nihilist but above all theres the dude jeff bridges most loveable character everto tie everything together we have the narration of the stranger  the best movie ive ever seen and can watch it over and over again,black_comedy
when people talk about the coen brothers movies such as fargo and raising arizona are mentioned i however see as their all time greatestthey have turned a story about a guy known as the dude into a comedy masterpieceis rather controversial in a way that you will either love it or find it dull and boring either way take the time to watch it and decide for your self i promise you that you are to find at least one of the characters in this movie extremely funnythis is also one of these movies that are worth watching several timeswarning do not expect mindboddling revelations on the meaning of life from this movie just sit back and enjoy two hours of truly original and at times hysterical comedy,black_comedy
i love the coen brothers  i once thought to myself how can they top fargothis movie does it  all the performances are great and allow you to get a real feeling for the characters even if in cases such as john turturos they are only on screen for a few scenes  the script is amazing in that it keeps you guessing introducing surprises all the way through not just one kaiser sozeesque twist but dozens of them  and the direction is ingenious  any film maker who wants to insert a dream sequence into his film must watch this movie because they cant be done any better,black_comedy
the more i watch this movie the more i enjoy it  that is a statement that can be made for almost all of the cohen brothers films  john goodman gives his best performance ever  the over the top performance by philip seymour hoffman was right on and overlooked  this guy always steals the scene no matter what movie hes in  except twister which no one could have saved when i first heard jeff bridges was doing a cohen brothers film i was kind of surprised but he did a good and convincing job as the dude  a give this film a 9  by the way i got in an argument with my friend over the cohens here is how i rank their films1 millers crossing 2 fargo 3 raising arizona 4 blood simple 5 big lebowski 6 barton fink 7 hudsucker proxymy friend ranks hudsucker higher  i love the cohen brothers but this was a disappointment,black_comedy
 a virtual masterpiece  stunning visuals from excellent dolly shots to amazingly trippy aerial sequences  add to it the wacky perspective which made fargo so great and you can see why lebowski is another hit  great performances from bridges goodman buscemi and turturro  turturros character alone is enough to get the repeat viewer laughing  and everything else will take care of the first timer  read drewzus review  this is hilarious  sidesplitting  a comic masterpiece which cannot be overlooked  yeah  the dude duder el dudorino if youre not into the whole brevity thing,black_comedy
the cohen brothers are the kings of dark comedies other movies such as fargo hudsucker proxy and milllers crossing are classicsbig lebowski is a story of mistaken identity and the spiral of bad fortune which trancends for the dude from a pyschotic veitnam vet to a guy who thinks hes bowlings answer too jesus this movie is hilariousjohn goodman gives of of his bet performances ever and in my opinion was over looked for a supporting actor oscarthis movie has all the regular cohen brother actors steve buscimi john turturro and john goodman who frequent the cohen brothers projectsyou will love this movie twists and turns and laugh out loud comedyfantastic,black_comedy
the great lebowskiits hard to be objective when your first viewing of a cult movie comes 20 years after it was released you are certain to have heard a lot about it from many people over the years and most of it was probably favorable if its a comedy you might expect it to be hilarious or at least funny in a quirky way all movies age but none age worse than comedies everything from set pieces to asides are creatures of their moments and usually dont remain funny 2 decades later ive found that an exception to this rule is silent film comedies buster keaton and laurel and hardy silent movies are to me as funny now as they were thenback to tgl yes ive heard a lot about it over 20 years most highly favorable i did not avoid it i just never crossed paths with it not until this weekas a funny movie i can put it no higher than a 5 i never laughed out loud but there were some moments when i was edging in that directionsilly and stupid are the 2 words i would use to describe tglcasting silly and stupid usually describe jim carrey and i can certainly see him in this fiasco but wait were they acting or merely mugging for the camera those 2 and sam elliott and steve buscemi did nothing more than play caricatures of their on screen personas john turtorro is one of our best actors but not here ben gazzaras cameo was the best part of the movie but he had little competitionplot reminded me of a bob hope road movie all over the place and not coherentstyle the busby berkeley scenes reminded me of blazing saddlessilly and stupid should not be confused with funny,black_comedy
so much hype on this movie so so much i have been told by countless fans that i had to see this and i was missing out and why have you not seen it yet and go home and watch it right nowmaybe its just one of those cult classics that people love for the nostalgia factor but i just really didnt get it it had a couple of funny moments and some really good quotes came from it but other than that the plot was a little messy and it lost me about halfway throughi feel like we all know someone whos just like the dude and i am glad that i know what people are talking about now but i dont know that ill ever rewatch this movie i guess it was just a little before my time,black_comedy
i doubt anyone will read this since there are pages and pages of great reviews but i had to comment since i gave it only a 5 considered a 4  spoiler alert  watching someone buzzed is funny for about 10 minutes unless theres a good story to keep me engaged racy dialog for 1998 i guess its now 2007 and it felt weak sorry your stepmom is a nymphomaniac etc just wasnt that funny or clever more like cute believable characters but i really didnt care everyone was just so stupid there were a few funny lines but the majority of the jokes were more about overwhelming ignorance than humor i chuckled a few times after an hour of the ignorance it was predictable the chair falling forward was no surprise stupid low brow physical comedy mixed with sort of high brow comedy like laughing at someone for using their salad fork during the entree no deep belly laughs it really tied the room together was funny the first time he said it decent twist but after viewing it a 2nd time since a few reviewers said they hated it the first time then loved it later i still dont know what proof the dude had of the husbands motivations the ashes in the coffee can  another chuckle them blowing all over dude with him just standing there stupid,black_comedy
there are all sorts of ways to make a bad movie excrescences as diverse as home fries showgirls nothing but trouble  dune come to mind after hinting at true originality with their first effort blood simple the coens chose instead to coast and make a certain type of bad movie over and overits clear that they make more effort than most of hollywood but success can lead to a standard  safe approach to the work the coens return to the studio after each release and exert the exact same effort making a similar movie shifting locales emulating the known favorites of a genre changing a detail here or there including the required amount of eccentricity that their fans expect all signs are painstakingly arranged for the perception that its a fine film your reaction has been engineered into the equationbut the coens efforts are identical and the movies suffer from a debilitating sameness its as if they are most concerned that the production levels match from movie to movie rather than trusting themselves to actually see and evaluate each addition to the coen canon a devoted group of film nerds eagerly wait to observe what genre has been been fed though the coen bros moviepoopingmachine so they can be the first to declare it a masterpiece the endless feedback loop of praise and regurgitation has pretty much stopped the coens developmentits clear that its turned into just a job is the film one would make after coming to resent even the intellectual laziness that produced the previous halfdozen pictures the lousy pointless work that inevitably follows a bunch of easy raves i hated every insipid overwritten precious moment of this movie which i find astonishingly asinine,black_comedy
i guess this is the coen bros version of dumb and dumber dumb is jeff bridges as lebowski a middleaged boozing and dopesmoking burnout and dumber is john goodman an emotionally disturbed vietnam vet throughout i was uncomfortable with not only the premise of the movie which is that stupid and pathetic people are inherently funny but with the portrayal of those characters which was either accurate to the point of being unpleasant lebowski or annoyingly unconvincing walter the vetrealism has worked for the coen bros in the past because theyve made it amusing or startling here realism is stupid people with limited vocabularies saying fk every other word someone ought to count the number of times the word is used its got to be a record i have nothing against the word it has its place and can be a regular bon mot but no word can be used that much and retain its meaning  it just becomes a sound an annoying sound like a barking dog the script must be fairly ugly to see with that same all over it like a printer glitch or somethingthen surrounding the two dipsticks you have an assortment of poorly conceived oddballs who are supposed to provide both the color and the framework of the plot such as it is that this is their purpose is so transparent the purpose is defeated and we seek in vain to be amused by them for some  any  reason their sheer number is meant to make up for their shallowness i think we have a pedophile a lesbian an expensive whore a couple of moron tough guys some german nihilists a porno king a cripple a geek who goodman shouts at to shut up every time he speaks  oh thats rich a fascist cop a creepy gay weirdo a smirking kissass etc what fertile ground for comedy yet nothing grows there at one point after being drugged which in lebowskis case was redundant and then hit in the head with a coffee cup lebowski tells a cab driver to change the music because he doesnt like the eagles and the guy throws him out of the cab oh chuckle chuckle thrown out of a cab hahhah its all about as amusing as having a tooth drilled even the musical interludes with spacy dream graphics are tediousin summary no good music bad acting boring plot and vapid script to see this tripe in the top 250 along with movies like the original planet of the apes or from here to eternity  thats a mistake all i can say it must be all on coen bros brand name alone either that or i fking dont know what the fk is going on know what i mean,black_comedy
i only recall one movie which had as much foul language as this  planes trains and automobiles i walked out of both after about twenty minutes i am sure there are others but i try to avoid them it is a sad reflection on todays society that writers and producers think that it is not possible to yet a laugh without lacing the dialog with obscenities in place of conjunctions maybe there was a story to this movie because others seem to like it but if there was then i completely missed it i think jeff bridges and john goodman are good actors and this is one reason i checked out this movie but this one did nothing to enhance my opinion of thembe warned unless you are immune to the type of language which is all to prevalent in movies these days give this one a miss,black_comedy
i tried watching this film on tv a few years ago but i made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby in the first 10 minutes of so i heard f a word you are not allowed to use even once on imdb dozens of times realizing that the film was not familyfriendly i turned it off despite all the very positive reviews id read for it however considering ive seen all the coen brothers films except this one i knew that eventually id get back to seeing it nearly a decade has passed and i finally got around to seeing this cult favoriteconsidering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film i wont bother discussing the plotits been explained to death besides the plot believe it or not is not all that important as a mystery film the mystery is figured out early in the film so despite this why is the film so goodgood enough that i gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever well the coen brothers bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head i can only think of two of their films i liked better the hudsucker proxy their most underrated film and oh brother where art thou their film that gets better with each viewing this is very good company as these two other films are absolutely brilliantand i consider to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed fargo which inexplicably won two oscarsdespite not being among the brothers best films because its way too normalsort of like a coen brothers film for those who dont get the more bizarre coen brothers filmswhat in particular did i like well the characters were the best part of the filmas only the coens can create such quirky and unique characters simply put there is no one like lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films id seen beforeand uniqueness is something i value most in a film the alcoholic lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero youll ever see in a film the usual quirky characters are here as wellin spades what i also loved were the little movies within the movie when lebowski got knocked out you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreamsparticularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish believe it or not the dream is a phallicfilled song and dance filmdirected by a famous porno director though without actual nudity it just has to be seen to be believed and only hudsucker proxy had stranger and more entertaining interludes in fact i found myself laughing out loud at this great sceneand a few moreoverall a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing not familyfriendly or a film to show your mother unless you do want to give her a heart attack but still well worth seeing oh and by the way the version often shown on tv recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed the original actors provided alternative words for the fbomb and its done reasonably seamlessly frankly i dont think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed,black_comedy
one of the lamest movies i have ever seen dont believe the hype,black_comedy
i thought the movie was a good film but didnt see the fuss that everyone raves about with it,black_comedy
i didnt think it was funny it was occasionally interesting but i was mostly bored and almost didnt finish it 1 viewing,black_comedy
ok the first half of the movie was great and i was really starting to get intrigued into the story but after that it wasnt that intriguing at all all the thrill from the first hour of the movie did not carry on through the movie and it started to get a bit boring during the middlepart i was expecting something exciting to happen towards the end of the movie but it didnt happen it was such an anticlimax i also didnt like how the plot twists were presented to easily and how it lacked any sort of drama for me the movie could have been better if it had a better ending,black_comedy
just chiming in after reading and laughing at some reviews by obviously teen and 20 somethings based on the literacy level they seem to be feeling a bit left out by the vibe humour storyline and characters they just dont seem to get the whole dude hippy perspective of the world and his current situation the dont get the nihilists the loose cannon outspoken viet vet donny the much ignored bowling friend that the dude and walter know almost nothing aboutanyway it seems that a bit of background generation knowledge is required to enjoy this movie always will be a unique classic in my book,black_comedy
the cinematography is solid and the dialogues are wellwritten bridges gives an unforgettable performance however the story lacks credibility and there are too many illusional or disturbing scenes that have nothing to do with the plot the style is strange and this is below average among the movies by coen brothers,black_comedy
really liked this movie i heard from a friend that this was his favorite movie so i thought id give it a chance its a movie that i would watch multiple times because apart from the great plot it was also very funny and the music was well chosen jeff bridges makes you believe that he really is the dude and you start too sympathize with him even though he is a lazy unemployed man when the film started with a voiceover of an old man i thought oh this is gonna be so long and boring but it wasnt until 5 minutes later that i totally changed my mind and i was sucked into the storyline  i gave this film eight stars and i would definitely recommend it,black_comedy
first time ive watched it i think ive fallen asleep ive seen it several times but in parts which is also rather funny considering there is no story in this film only a confused plot and there are so much great scenes in this its hard to count them all i just saw it altogether and its a must many of the actors have been seen in previous coen brothers films goodman buscemi turturro polito stormare they must have did something with their food because they are stunning in this one especially goodman except for the fact that hes a using a fourletter word a lot its funny vulgar well made and played you cant ask for more,black_comedy
after reading all the reviews and seeing how much people liked this cult classic i was all ready to watch this and have a good time by the end of the film i had to change my judgement i did have a good time but i was disappointed that i did not love this there are some fun quirky moments but this movie was too strange for my tastethis is about a guy named the dude who is trying to investigate a case of his missing carpet and missing moneyjeff bridges is a great actor but i he was a little annoying in the movie as the dude however john goodman had a classic performance as the dudes best friendoverall this is a decent at best film it has some funny moments but not enough to justify the high rating this film got i thought it was something of a letdown at least i finally saw a movie that depicted bowling i rate this film 610,black_comedy
a stoner called the dude is mistaken for a millionaire who shares his name this rich mans wife owes cash to a goon she is subsequently kidnapped and assigns the dude the task of being the bag man in return for a load of money the mission is screwed up however when the dudes friend walter joins in and messes things up this leaves the dude in a shaky position where he has to attempt to reclaim the moneythis is a defiantly pointless film its a crimecomedy with very little emphasis on realism its played for laughs pure and simple it benefits from an impressive cast jeff bridges is good in the lead role with some funny support performances from john turturro as a sleazy bowler and philip seymourhoffman ass personal assistant although i found john goodman a little overbearing and annoying to tell you the truth its a highly stylised film which you would probably expect coming from the coen brothers it isnt always as funny as it thinks it is though although there are admittedly a number of very funny moments it was nice to hear some good sounds in this one though in particular a couple of ultracool laid back tunes from early 70s italian movies namely piacere sequence by teo usuelli taken from the giallo amuck and traffic boom by piero piccioni taken from the comedy all screwed up  the latter of which was the soundtrack to the film within a film hereits storyline is very unfocused maybe thats the point i suppose but it certainly means that in order to enjoy the film you need to be able to overlook this its surely no coincidence that lots of people say they werent too keen on this film the first time they saw it and it took subsequent viewings to appreciate i myself am pretty much the same and this no doubt explains its lukewarm performance at the box office and then its slowburning success on home video having said all this despite being an entertaining film i still find it kind of hard to understand the real appeal of this movie an amusing enough flick for sure but not a grade a coen movie in my opinion,black_comedy
big lewbowski is one of the very few comedies that still cracks me up every single time i watch itfor what some might dub as a stoner comedy theres quite a lot going on this movie and its damn near impossible to catch everything on the first viewing i wont get into the plot details since i think its best to watch it for the first time without knowing anything about it then watch it again a couple weeks later ill bet you laugh more the second time you see it office space was the only other comedy that had this affect on me oh and one other thing do not watch the edited version on tv this movie is rated r for a reason and if you watch the edited version you are missing half the movie,black_comedy
there are several things that can make a great comedy you could for instance have some effectively planned and executed comical moments a cleverly funny written script or some amusing characters that can make your movie is however a movie that has this all in itwhen watching a coen brothers movies you always know that you are going to get something special and unique their comedy style and just overall way off filmmaking are very distinctive which is not in the least also due to the fact hat besides directing and producing all of their movies they also write and edit them themselves so all of their movies are really being their movies with some exaggerated characters dark comedy and violence and lots of eye for detail with its filming as well as with its writingthing that catches immediately the attention about this movie is how incredibly well written and layered the movie is just when you think that they cant possible throw in another storyline with different new characters they do and it also manages to work out well for the movie which is all the more a great accomplishment there is really a lot going on in this movie even though its main character itself is extremely laid back and manages to get himself into trouble by basically doing nothing at allyes the dude makes this movie what it is and also makes it work out as well as it does its a great character who basically seems like a left over product from the 70s and has made no attempt to adapt himself to the new world or just normal society in general he simply does his thing which is bowling driving around and having the occasional acid flashback its good that there are guys like him being around who go against the flow and simply follow their own path not to be a rebel but just to simply do only the things he wants to and simply life his live without worrying about tomorrow or yesterday yes jeffrey the dude lebowski has grown into an iconic character already which of course is also thanks to jeff bridges performances of himbut the whole movie is being filled with some real great and memorable comedy characters all of them are quite overthetop which suits the world the coen brothers create with their movie it really has a dream cast and what is it with john goodman and the coen brothers who always seem to bring out the best from goodman john goodman always seems at home within a coen brothers movie no matter what type of role he ever playsthe movie does not only handle its comedy extremely well its also simply technically a very well made movie the directing is truly great and it uses all kinds of different techniques and tricks which help to give the movie a very special warm and amusing type of atmospherebut yeah well you know thats just like my opinion man910httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,black_comedy
nb ive only seen this film once and it may be the type of film that grows on you the more you watch it however at this point i dont understand the raves the coen brothers are incapable of making a boring film and this was no exception whether its a great film fargo blood simple no country for old men millers crossing to name a few or merely a puzzling one barton fink comes to mind their films are inventive interesting and memorable lebowski is closer to barton fink than the great films there were many wonderful scenes lines and performances however to me the overall effect was less than the sum of the parts even putting aside the numerous plot holes because this film was clearly not about its plot i found myself waiting for some narrative thread or theme to tie together the nearly random eccentric scenes i left feeling the movie was strange interesting but ultimately unsatisfying it wasnt a waste of my time mind you but no way should it be ranked as high as it is,black_comedy
there is a youtubecom video somebody laboriously strung together of all the numerous effwords in this movie and the order in which they appear the thing goes on for at least two full minutes and it is very very funny trouble is the entire movie is little more amusing than this little clip only it lasts much longer too long in fact for years i had put off watching after seeing various snippets of it i began to develop suspicions that the entire ordeal might not be worth the time to watch it unfortunately my suspicions were confirmed after a recent viewing of the whole thingthe story and i use the word story loosely deals with an exhippie loser trying to get revenge and restitution from those who urinated on a rug in his tiny apartment a case of mistaken identity causes jeff lebowski to be assaulted by goons in an early scene and his home and possessions violated lebowski played wonderfully by jeff bridges has been mistaken for a seemingly wealthy man and he feels that the real target of the assault at least owes him for the rug lebowski goes to the mans mansion to ask for restitution but ends up getting involved in a kidnapping scheme involving the mans trophy wife nothing else must be said about the plot you just have to sit back an experience the rest my guess is that many people whether they will admit it or not may find this movie a tad bit tedious yes it is full of talented and funny actors and yes it was made by the coen brothers but the plot involving nihilists hit men eccentric performance artists bowling alleys and god knows whatever else is just too much to take in one dosage my guess is the coens were just bound and determined to tell some kind of story about the dude and the plot of that story was ultimately inconsequential to the actual act of telling his storyas mentioned earlier bridges is pretty funny as the dude jeff lebowski this is one of those roles an actor doesnt have to do a lot for no trips to the gym no chiseled abs like in against all odds heck he even used some of his own clothes the rest of the cast is pretty good too they just arent always sure how best to use them if anyone out there doesnt know who john millius is trust me john goodman nailed him tara reid ten years later seems like a casting mistake though back then i guess someone thought she had talentthe coens are living gods in the minds of many for my money they are pretty hit and miss theyve given us duds like o brother where art thou and the ladykillers little gems like raising arizona stellar efforts like fargo and maybe the best film ive ever seen no country for old men but is a slight miss for them if you like it then i guess the hound abides but can only give it 6 of 10 stars himself,black_comedy
pacifists vs nihilists comedy from joel and ethan coen is predictably and amusingly weird and lively and so full of comic tension and malice that it is nearly irrelevant the plot as such does peter out after the first hour a bearded unemployed potsmoking holdover from the 60s becomes entangled in corruption after hes hired to be the ransomcourier in a kidnapping as the dude jeff bridges gives his all to this loose shaggy character the dude is not just a textbook hipster slacker or fish out of water hes a laidback guy cartoonishly naive of the craziness inherent in this new generations loss of morals and hes so generally goodhearted that hes blindsided by violence and craven villainy the coens nearly outdo themselves in creating eccentric mercurial characters cutting twisty corners with an irony that isnt condescending or too obvious and their cinematic conception of this material is often dazzling  from ,black_comedy
its a rare thing when movies like this come along its the kind of picture where youll either marvel at the highly woven plot and genrehopping genius or deplore it for being a completely random stupid and unfathomable piece of crapthe dude jeff bridges is an iconic laconic slacker instantly likable the dudes own slant on life is that most things can be solved by taking it easy or going bowling his partners in crime are walter a deranged nam verteran john goodman in superb scenestealing form donny one of his bowling buddies steve buscemi in an understated role and david huddleston as the title character complete with assistant brandt philip seymour hoffman turning the smarm right up to ten what starts as a simple case of mistaken identity and damaged property quickly becomes a rollercoaster tale of backstabbing and caricature characterisation which gets faster and more twisted as it reaches the final minutesthe first time i saw this i must say it just seemed ludicrous and not at all humorous i wasnt really sure whether it wanted to be a comedy or a surreal drama after getting about two thirds of the way through i got up and walked out convinced that this was the worst film in the coen brothers canon but on a second viewing i stopped taking this film too seriously and it was then the offbeat comedy and plot really came togetheringenious hilarious and unexpected you really dont have a clue what is going to happen but the direction and cinematography make it seem like it was inevitable all along challenging and rewarding,black_comedy
seriously seeing lebowski so near the bottom of the top 250 is pretty damn unsettling to say the least this is certainly beyond the shadow of a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made and im really holding back when i say that and seeing this ignoble rating certainly begs the unpleasant question could this film actually ever fall off of what should be a coveted 250 list the sheer vastness of this error in taste makes me question seriously the movie viewing competence of those here and im not even elitist can someone help me out here please explain thanks in advance jb,black_comedy
the plot of this movies is pretty dumb and doesnt ever seem to go anywhereat the end of the movie one of the characters says something to the effect that he hopes the story was worth telling and im like dude what story are you talking about manhowever it is a very funny nostalgic and even thoughtprovoking character study and for that it is definitely worth a gander the dude as lebowski calls himself and insists everyone else call him is perpetually annoyed and irritated and at the world around him in the opening scenes a couple of strong men break into his house and plunge his head in the toiled in order to obtain information from him that he has no way of possessing and his response is something like dude what is your problem where a more natural reaction would by fury or terror i think that sums him up pretty well he doesnt care enough about all the stuff people normally care about so his interactions with events and people are intriguingand then he has the typical perhaps even clich but you never get tired of that type of character friend who will get you in the worst kind of trouble because of his utter lack of sensevery funny,black_comedy
i enjoyed many parts of the movie  quite a lot in fact  jeff bridges as the laid back luzer dude was brilliant john goodman a nam vet more than did his character justice some of the situations were really funny and made sense  some made no sense and were funny  other situations just made no sense as a whole piece its a really flawed movie most of the situations revolved around the whereabouts of 1 million in ransom money the ingenious plot twists usually hang together but not always what was the point of the volkswagon dectective what did that contribute nothing  it was just another point of confusion the nihilist gang which at least provided some funny dialogs never fit with the rest of the movie which was irritating the cowboy narrator never fit either although i found his folksy drawl to be comfortingthis movie does a seriously poor job with its female characters the male lead characters are well developed and most of the male secondary characters are well drawn also  the women characters are all flat and bizarre  more like creatures from outer space than real people  the millionaires trophey wife bunny is a dumb blond ho the adult daughter maude comes off as mechanical and inhumanso we have flashes of brilliance interspersed with a fair amount of gimcrack movie making there is no ending to speak of  the story just stops for no reason  many situations set up earlier are left dangling and unresolved in fact the whole thing about what happens to the missing million dollars is just forgotteni think most people will find something to laugh at and something to like when they watch this movie  but its really not a satisfying movie experience,black_comedy
tells an enjoyable shaggy dog tale with jeff bridges playing the shaggy dog  slacker dude lebowski who gets bizarrely caught up in a kidnapping scam  there are lots of laugh out load moments but this is a very peculiar film varying between downbeat black comedy and pure standup interlaced with selfknowing references to numerous different styles of movie making and peppered with a pointlessly astonishing expletive countthe coen brothers are very clever but sincerity is never their strong point and although it pains me to diss any film with townes van zandt on the soundtrack the net result is rather unaffecting and its not that i dont like weird movies but in defiance of its heros philosophy seems to try just a little too hard,black_comedy
one roger lebowski is a slowwitted la waster who spends most of his days in a drug induced haze and lives in a low rent apartment another is a rich businessman with a wayward trophy wife and who lives in a mansion witless debt collectors mistake one for the other and start a chain of funny offbeat and intriguing eventsthe coen brothers are simply not capable of making a bad movie they couldnt do so even if they tried they are masters of taking things just far enough to be strange and offbeat and yet not let it all fall apart completely something that david lynch should learn from even if you are not taken by the plot they throw so many extras at you that you can just enjoy the productions for those alonethis is something of crossbreed movie indeed it takes from raymond chandler to the odd couple stopping off at pulp fiction star turn is not jeff bridges hippie lebowski but his bowling buddy john goodman who puts in an amazing performance as a damaged and deranged vietnam vet and some of his lines are laugh out loud funny  especially how he deals with a fellow bowler who has stepped over the line a little scene that stands up to the best of the funny business in pulp fictionmaybe if you want to be harsh they do turn this in to a bit of a variety show that goes from the bowling alley smalltalk to surreal dreams scenes to the tale of a how a pair of dimwits try to dig themselves out of a hole four letter words come thick and fast and you wonder whether we really need them this is  after all  a silly comedy why cut off part of the audience equally why is roger the dim one only called the dude throughout and never by his first name good entertainment and sure to become a cult  if it is not already,black_comedy
this was a freaky film it took me a while to get going on it but when i finally got into the thing it became very enjoyable and i began to get the comedy angle as usual bridges was first rate and goodman was totally bizarre as the knowitall kooky vet who simply refused to be mistaken about anything way too small a part for one of my fave players steve buscemi strange picture man by the way the language would freeze a 6 striper sailor,black_comedy
the absurdity the coolness and the essence of just being are present in a cocktail of so like the brothers coenat first i didnt want to go to see this movie as i am not into lazy time wasting slackers or bowling  i know now that i have truly underestimated the importance of bowling and that god is in the details,black_comedy
very offbeat highly original movie that provides tie ins for mistaken identity some effective and hilarious characters and off the wall situations unpredictable and free spirited the dude our protagonist gets caught in a web of intrigue this intrigue seemingly and annoyingly takes him away from his happy life of apathy unemployment and bowling is strictly coen brothers madness in the vein of raising arizona the visuals dream sequences et al are very funny and fit well in the movie unfortunately the last half starts to slow down as the characters start to seem repetitive in their reactions the humor also waned due to this and the plot not the films strong suit to begin with wears down with it is still yards ahead of most mainstream releases yet weve grown rather accustomed even spoiled to expect so much more from the coens recommended,black_comedy
two of my favorite movies are raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy and fargo was pretty good too i expected a lot from this movie but was somewhat disapointed the plot was harder to follow than their other movies and after seeing it twice it still seems kinda stupid there were too many groups working against and with each other to really pull the end together smoothly i think there was a lot of great acting but it didnt really help the movie but i think they are coming out with a new movie soon so maybe it will turn out better,black_comedy
i was very disappointed i really liked fargo and so many people i know had such good comments on this film but i find it just dumb and somewhat predictablethe characters dude and walter are great though they are complex and interesting yet i find the plotalthough its complex and full of twists mainly bland and forgettable the story starts to become messyreally messy after an hour an a half and you start getting that anything goes now feeling and whats with dudes constant tripsdreams they are not funny and they only detract from the story,black_comedy
the coen brothers latest movie is really disappointing i really liked fargo and wanted to see because fargo was so good the film went nowhere a useless plot and unlikeable characters made this film sink into the depths of disaster watch it if youre bored and can i ask what julianne moore was on when she decided to be in this rubbish,black_comedy
ive heard so many good things about this movie and was majorly disappointed the only reason i continued to watch this movie was because of john goodman movie is such a terrible story with no plot and no good characters the dude sucks,black_comedy
you may think my 1 star review is unfair but seriously i would give it minus stars if possible i was really considering turning it off around an hour into it but i thought id watch the other half as it must get better with it having great reviews nope nothing in this movie makes sense you cant follow the plot and therefore not be able to relate or care for the characters there is comedy in there but nothing i personally found funny i watch a lot of comedies and have a huge sense of humour and it was just a waste of my time 2 hours long avoid if you hate terrible movies,black_comedy
i love so many of the actors in this film and was really looking forward to seeing for the first timeafter just watching it with such great expectations im left seriously wondering what the heck is wrong with people this movie was a waste of an amazing cast this movie goes absolutely no where and is just a bunch of random ridiculous incoherent and implausible scenarios lazily strung together on a weak gimmick of a storyline i really wanted to like this movie but it was just awful,black_comedy
has some mildly funny moment but no laughoutloud bitsthe plot is overly convoluted,black_comedy
my dad absolutely loves this film it speaks to him on a spiritual level or something i personally dont understand the humour and when i do find it too subtle to be funny however doesnt fit into any other category of movie so  what is itfor me it was a disappointment it having been so hyped up by my dad for others it was an absolute triumph if youre into that kind of film it takes a very specific person to enjoy a movie like that but if you do it will certainly be one of your favourites i guess its much like marmite a kind of loveit hateit situation personally i saw the funny side of it and the reasons for it being such a cult classic but it just didnt fit my stylewatch fargo instead if youve seen it watch it again and then think could the coen brothers outdo themselves if the answer is no dont spoil your own opinion of them by seeing this film if you think they could do something more outthere or interesting sure give a go,black_comedy
at first i blamed myself for not liking this film its been out since 1998 have heard about it many times even achieved the famed cult following but not until i saw an interview with sam elliot in which he said this movie was his personal favorite did i make an effort to watch it even the opening monologue by elliot had me sitting on the edge of my seatwith the tumbleweed blowing and elliot introducing us to the dude and how in whatever time and place there always seems to be a guy that is designed to be therea true man of his timesi was preparing myself for greatness an then it just seemed to all fall apart i thought i understood because i too consider myself the dude maybe not a man of times for the 90s but certainly for the 70si mean i was meant to be there i understood everything about that world so maybe that was the problem and then i thought maybe it was because i didnt grow up in la maybe its an la things i was missing i ended up fast forwarding through the middle of the movie because it was so boring and only gave it two stars out of homage to elliot and bridges whom i both admire i still blame myself for not getting this highly valued and brilliantly reviewed work i guess im a failure,black_comedy
dude wow first of all do you love john goodman as much as i do if you are a fan of mr goodman this is a movie you have to watch but of course his role is not everything thats good with this movie but maybe the best part after watching this movie you will think i want to watch it again but after realizing how amazing goodman is it will be changed to i want to watch it again right now i watched it because i love joel and ethan coen plus i had watched one of the car scenes hundreds of times on youtube so it checked it out well wow this movie chocked me goosebumps tears of joy and laughter is what joel and ethan brings up in this comedy it is a comedy that will bite your arm and never let go it is pure awesomeness and happiness at some point you will find this movie a bit bad use of scifi effects to someone a bit pointless and for someone maybe a bit boring but who cares about this when you have the coen brothers a perfect written screenplay and outstanding actors cooked together i recommend this movie with all of my heart it is unique,black_comedy
this movie has been on my to watch list for a loonng time i wish it stayed that way lots of people told me it was a brilliant film but i dont see anything brilliant about anything spoilerslots of simpletons good for nothings fake german and italian accents making fun of nihilists pacifists artists without any point lots of curses f this f that simplistic scenario lots of characters doing nothing bowling so what i laughed at 2 or 3 scenes thar is allno wit in dialogues or jokes everything predictable brutish sexual physical jokesi have never been disappointed like this not offending the people that like or see something in this i am just not one of them,black_comedy
i cant believe the ratings this is so bad if you like cursing and childish humor this is for you,black_comedy
is a really good film it folows the adventure of the dude mr lebowski trying to get back his rug with his two freinds that are also his bowling partners the movie never slows down to explain it all but instead slows down during the dialogue for me i really liked this because of how interesting it is there is almost never a dull moment in the film basically what the one gripe i have with the film is there isnt really a payoff sure thats fine sometimes but with all that had happend it kind of seemed weird not to have one still though it doesnt change the whole movie and its score so i give it 810 and a recommendation aswell,black_comedy
but i never heard about any lebowski here in poland so the winner is walter,black_comedy
the masters of eccentrism strike again yet another outstanding coens film i cant speak highly enough of their talents a film thats not scared of embracing the sleazy world of adult entertainment and conspiracies these filmmakers have mastered the art of comedy and many of the contexts it can be used in with moments of morbid black humour and a strong well thought out plot the story of the dude stumbling his way through a conspiracy and life in general is a brilliant watch well worth your time,black_comedy
im so glad i can see that movie on the big screen far out men i love the style of dude lebowski how very chill out no tension at allwhatever the situation plus his favourite drink white russian well actually i like the drink toolovely  how entertaining and unwind movie of the 90s makes me always smile ,black_comedy
i havent cracked up more during a movie than this one the situations will make you cringe and the characters are so unique and readily identifiable definitely worth a watch  still cant believe it was released 20 years ago,black_comedy
the coens most endearing film perhaps was unappreciated upon release but since has garnered a massive following jeff bridges plays the ultimate slacker dude whose sole purpose in life is to laze around in his room smoking pot or go bowling with his strange friends a militant gun lover played by john goodman and a meek fellow portrayed by steve buscemi one day he is mistaken for another man a very wealthy man with the same name by a batch of inept crooks who take his rug forcefully what follows is a bizarre offbeat tale of mistaken identity and revenge this is a typical offbeat coens film ably supported by julianne moore who for once chooses to tackle a funny role and has a hilariously surreal dance sequence with bridges,black_comedy
i saw in the theater the 20 year anniversary showing of this cult classic the dude is a still an interesting character as he deals with an array of individuals with competing interest it is a funny and witty tale about finding your way and discovering how you fit in a complex situation long live the dude,black_comedy
this is probably my favorite movie of all time i can sit on my couch and watch this movie with the beer like talking to an old friend the comedy is timeless and the characters in this movie are the best ive ever seen so many great quotes from this movie that only lebowski lovers will repeat over and over again till the end of time john goodman jeff bridges steve buchemi and many more filled the screen in this coen masterpiece,black_comedy

follows a man who after being mistaken for a rich man with the same name seeks vengeance against the people who mistook him and peed on his rug its a weird concept and thats where a lot of the comedy comes from most of the comedy here is pretty good i found myself laughing a fair bit a few jokes fall flat and by the end the movie is just grasping at straws to get both a good ending and some good comedy in there but as a whole its a weirdly funny movie the writing is pretty good too while it is again quite weird and unconventional it was fun to watch the characters awkwardly live their uninteresting lives meanwhile balancing the whole rug situation and the characters were pretty well written too they were consistent and theres that word again weird the coen brothers have this way with their movies where they all tend to be quite unconventional and sometimes give off a bad vibe like its just too unconventional and thus sometimes hard to fully enjoy dont get me wrong i like their movies theyre just really different and not always in a good way and is one of those movies moreover it could be a little slow from time to time the plot made little progress throughout basically the entire thing and all the characters really stayed in the same place right up to the end overall is a good movie but its far from the classic people seem to think that it is sure its funny and mostly well written but its a little slow and overly weird and not everything always works in the end id still recommend it but its not as good as people seem to think it is not in my book anyway,black_comedy
so it seems that all the online new versions of this film have the jesus scene with walter discusses the pedophile activities of jesus removedpizzagate has had its effectthats too badchanging a movie to fit with the occult political times a kind orwellian memory hole to take a very ugly spotlight off of many politicians,black_comedy
in my quest to see every coen brothers movie i finally got around to seeing the big leboski although not remotely close to being my favorite flick of theirs inside llewyn davis and no country for old men have that honor this film was exactly what id hoped for  a truly quirky nonpredictable well writtenacted satirestarring oscar winner jeff bridges as the dude he played the lead role to perfection other amazing actors in this comic farce were john goodman steve buscemi julianne moore  and john turturro an absolutely brilliant actor who has been cast in several coen movies now including barton fink its hard to detail what this movie was about with specificity suffice it to say it was a supposed kidnapping adventure intertwined with a heavy dose of bowling and a bunch of dysfunctional friends with issues trying to assist the dude out of his outrageous predicamentfor its superb acting and very unique storyline gave 7 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie is certainly original  yes that is the perfect word to describe that movie i watched 3 times  never love it but i didnt get bored during the movie at all  i dont know if i may watch this movie again or not but it is certainly an original movie while watching this movie your face is in the same shape  never laugh hard dont get upset or anything your face will be in the same form at the beginning of the movie and when it ends if you have time and dont know what to watch it is a good choice but it wont be your favorite movie ever after that movie i realized that laziness is maybe a very smart choice to really enjoying the life,black_comedy
ive never been a huge fan of american stoner comedies as somebody who is staunchly antidrugs the type of humour in these movies doesnt appeal and i usually just find them dumb not so with the big lebowsk the cult classic movie by the coen brothers this ones wellwritten and features an endearing cast of typically kooky characters in a plot that is very reminiscent of the coen brothers stylejeff bridges plays the likable lead as an exasperated chump who refuses to lose his mildmannered world view despite getting mixed up in a plot involving reclusive millionaires and revolutionary weirdos it helps that he has a fine supporting cast in particular john goodman who is cast completely against type as a farright nut job who word has it was modelled on john milius steve buscemi is also a delight even though he doesnt appear much i tend to find everything that comes out of this guys mouth to be completely hilariousthe script is incessantly profane and yet as in a tarantino movie the bad language has a natural flow and rhythm to it it never feels forced or unpleasant the oddball plot flows along nicely and there are few slow spots or mistakes along the way an excruciating turn from julianne moore unwisely attempting a british accent being my only real problem with this although not my favourite coen brothers movie due to the subject matter is a lot of goofy fun nonetheless,black_comedy
after being beaten by thugs who mistake him with somebody of the same name jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges confronts millionaire jeff lebowski on the mistaken identity a confrontation that will lead to several bizarre and unforeseeable twists for him and his two bowling buddies john goodman steve buschemiill be the first to say i do not see what all the buzz is about with this film for some reason hipsters like to blow this up to be an absolute masterpiece which is endlessly praised quoted and cos played i like it a lot but to me it doesnt stand out nearly as well as some of coens others even though i still enjoy it to me its a clever fun stoner comedy with a great cast and characters but thats where it stops for me honestlythe characters are very colorful jeff bridges is perfectly cast as the dude an icon that is mercilessly cos played and he is funny in the movie john goodman as former vietnam lieutenant walter sobchak is a great backup for the dude as he mostly plays the muscle for all the predicaments they get involved in steve buschemis character was good overall even though he doesnt get much screen time whats great is that even the small roles in the film who get one or two scenes still make an big impact on the film in the few scenes theyre in i cant very well make a big lebowski review without mentioning jesus the bowler for an enemy team of the dudes bowler team excellently cast by john turturro one of my favorite coen alumni others like philip seymour hoffman and julianne moore are also quite entertaining for the few scenes they are inwhen i first watched it i thought the plot was very bloated lots of scenes and subplots that really go nowhere even though it adds to some funny scenes overall it doesnt amount to much but oh well regardless of my small complaints with this movie its a very fun well made film with some entertaining characters with some slight editing issues solid nonetheless,black_comedy
theres not much to say about this movie i enjoyed it of course not as much as i would enjoy a movie that i myself rated 8 or higher but this was indeed a good movie the actors were all on the same line and what i liked the most about this film is the film setting and the mood that movie puts you in especially with the astonishing soundtracks that got me in the movie from the start the only reason why this movie isnt highly rated is because its slow paced many times which is not something that i enjoy but after all this is a perfect movie you can watch on a sunday afternoon with friends and thats exactly what i did maybe dont watch this with your family you know swear words,black_comedy
i must say that i didnt get what i expected to get out of this film it has a high rating but i dont think this movie deserves it it isnt as funny as people claim it isfirst of all the problem for me was the main character itself the dude just wasnt funny he didnt react to anything and was just chill all the time on the other hand walter was an awesome character quite enjoyed watching him the movie doesnt really show what happens to any of the characters the most irrelevant character dies nobody really cares about that they got this bowling rivalry going on but the movie didnt even show a second of the big match the last half of the film was just plain having many unlikable and irrelevant characters just threw me off if it was not for walter i would consider this movie thrashin my opinion a little over hyped there wasnt anything that great or unseen in the movie at all,black_comedy
today i saw for the first time somehow i missed this movie in 1998 and never saw it on dvd in the years after its release about the only thing that i knew about the film was that jeff bridges was the dude now i know the rest of the storybefore moving on ill offer up this quick disclaimer this is in no way a family friendly film that should be expected from the coen brothers but since i went into it not knowing what to expect at all and my only perception of the film being that it was mostly a comedy i thought that it might be somewhat lighter than most of the coens stable of films and it was but theres still language throughout the movie along with some fairly adult themes at points several times along the way i found myself feeling that this was the coens answer to pulp fiction the chasing of the brief case the remark about the quality of the innout burger the fact that bridges dresses like travolta and jackson at the end of pf etcthe film is quite funny in that dark style of humor that the coens are known for sometimes the humor is so prevalent that it becomes banal nevertheless the film does feature quite a few good laughs but then mixed in with those laughs are the odd coen brothers moments such as what ill call the ear scene in which the mixture of humor and horror blends in a way that challenges the viewers comfortmy main beef with this film is that it doesnt end with a resolution yes all ends well spoiler alert but the dude abides still you never find out what happens to the briefcase or whether it had money in it another similarity to pulp fiction the situation with bunny sort of gets forgotten too all in all the ending of the film just felt anticlimactic to me i nevertheless did enjoy the movie though it is what it is a coen brothers film that makes you laugh all while pushing boundaries still just as there are elvis people and beatles people i think that there are coen bros people and tarrantino people and im a tarrantino person so i think im going to go with 710 stars enjoyed it but not in my top tier,black_comedy
is without a single doubt one of the funniest movies of alltime its that kind of movie where you just cant stop laughing at its glorious achievements at humor i literally hurt myself with laughter multiple times during this moviethe great thing about other than its amazing humor is how good of a movie it actually is along with the laughter you get an awesome movie with a fun storycomedies do not get much better than this stands among the top not just in comedies but in general good movies its highly recommended to anyone searching for a new favorite movie,black_comedy
is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast with its very goofy set up and even its characters you wouldnt expect very big performances from the cast but they all deliver superb acting they were all taking a huge risk with this very unusual film and they ended up making a good choice my favourite scenes are definitely any one between jeff bridges and john goodman the chemistry between the two of them is terrific they both play very unique characters nothing like any of their previous roles its definitely longer than it needs to be its nearly too hours long and with the story being as ridiculous as it is this can get a little bit tiring after a while but it is mostly entertaining and hilarious throughout very different and packs in plenty of laughs i would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy a man must cope with being mistaken from a millionaire who owes a lot of money and receives the help of his bowling buddies to seek revenge best performance jeff bridges worst performance tara reid,black_comedy
i will start reviewing every movie i see from now on  new to me or ones i choose to rewatch  with careful attention and this is the first movie i will officially review i chose this one since i have seen it most recently and it is a pretty simple film with a seemingly complex plot this is one of the coen brothers best films  not necessarily in the sense of great cinema but rather in relation to the factor of entertaining the audience i showed this film to my good friend spencer just a few months ago and he wanted to watch it again tonight it is easy to see why since i was quotingenjoying a lot of the film for its great comedy such as the many times walter says shut the f up donnie how the dude repeats things he hears from other people in order to get his point across or how ridiculous the narrators moustache is i remember that on first viewing i did not appreciate this film since it is revealed by the dude towards the conclusion that the macguffin of the film  the briefcase filled with a million dollars  was never really filled in the first place like fargo deals with the idea that most will go out of their habits or comfort zone in order to obtain an amount of money  however it does so in a more ridiculous manner than fargo after a few rewatches i have found it important to appreciate this films comedy rather than make sense of the almost nonexistent plot in order to enjoy it does it matter that the dudes journey turns into a dead end no his journey is still progressive as he goes from not giving a damn about anything to confronting people of the seemingly upper class about using him and the journey has a great deal of laughs making this a great cinematic experience to enjoy and reflect on the importance of taking things easy in everyday life 3540,black_comedy
the big lebowskis beginning monologue was enough to make me want to sit down and forget about everything so i can watch the movie in its entirety the dialogue although filled with the f word sounded genuine coming from real people in real situations the acting seemed so natural that it was on par with movies like the godfather i can watch the movie several times and see something new simply because of the acting there is no one who can play the dude better than jeff bridges the role was made for him the plot twists and ongoing zany adventures kept me smiling throughout the film until the end spoiler donny dies what a bummer i thought this ruined the movie otherwise it would have been perfect if he died because he was shot it would have been better if there is one thing this movie should not have is a meaningless tragedy,black_comedy
what is there to say about what was not said beforenothing because it is one of the best movies ever and i proudly say to have 5 different versions of this movie going back from vhs to newer onesin my opinion the best movie the coen brother ever made and if not the best then at least the funniestafter seeing this movie almost the whole main cast became my all time favourite actors and the coen brothers became my no 1 movie makers ever i wish i never would have seen before because then i could watch him again for the first time and could enjoy it with laugh tears in my eyes againi find it ridicules not to say anything bad about the movie the cast the music or anything else but the only bad i can think of is that the coenbrother and no one else for that matter made a funnier and better movie then this till todaybridges and goodman have the greatest dilalogs ever and every singe character is just awesome and well played from everyone i even think i will watch it right now because during this review i remembered all this awesome scenes and have lo laugh without even watching itso do it like me and get your fingers on this movie and enjoy,black_comedy
is one of the funniest movies that has come out in such a long time jeff bridges stars as a loser named by his buddies the dude throughout the film he just swears up a storm plays bowling with his buddies and drinks white russians he goes to the mansion of a millionaire named larry lebowski because some guys peed on his rug and broke into the wrong larry lebowskis place one of my favourite scenes is when in interviewing the dude and then the dude says im not mr lebowski youre mr lebowski im the dude its that or duder your dudeness or el duderino if youre not into the whole brevity thing and hands off to john goodman as the dudes foulmouthed buddy is a true guilty pleasure,black_comedy
is a movie which requires repeat viewings to appreciate the characters situations and the humour which comes from their reactions or lack thereof to these situations the dude is a manipulated man the coens have manipulated a man to whom getting up and going to the toilet is far more a concept than a realitythey have placed a reluctant antihero in the middle of a plot he is forced to participate in the characters he encounters within the story manipulate him all for their own selfish ends and many moralise at him whilst they are pursuing their own nefarious schemesthe dude abides this treatment either through inability to challenge it verbally or physically or in some cases through lack of understanding he is being manipulated but as he endures the films indignities he never wavers and in the end returns to his normal pattern of living whereas the go getters the schemers the users the proactive people have all been undone by the own machinations hoisted by their own petards the dude is vindicated in his lifestyle by defaultwe are all asked to participate to some degree in our everyday lives in the plotting or social mores of others we feel we have to answer to the dude reminds us to step back from time to time and let the cards fall where they may control through opting out thats why we love the dude and thats why the dude is the dude ,black_comedy
full of characters and wonderful quotable moments great memorable scenes john goodman steve buscemi and jeff bridges are outstanding if that werent enough the movie put john turturro on the maplike most coen brothers movies an injustice that starts a chain reaction of strange eventually coming full circle to right a wrong the plot is dark hilarious and complex hit the pause button if you get up to go pee this is one of those rare movies that actually lives up to the hypedefinitely a movie that deserve multiple viewings even has bowling would have to be one of the greatest cult classics ever,black_comedy
i had waited a long time to watch the infamous cult classic the big lewboski i was sort of afraid that the coens has made a very raunchy film that didnt fit in with the rest of their filmography i had a blast this is definitely one of their more lighthearted films and its a straightup comedy it had me laughing my ass off in many scenes it is known as a stoner film and it is raunchy in a way without being too aggressive or without leaving a bad taste in your mouth i was glad about that because the coens always seem to find a goodhearted approach to all their films and im glad did this too the star of the film was john goodman who had me laughing around 80 of the time he was on screen very enjoyable to watch the films isnt incredible but it only adds strength to their resume that i have seen,black_comedy
so theres this dude who lives in la  wait  not this dude the dudethe dude jeff bridges is a bearded slob his casual hippieesque drawl is peppered with profanity and he calls almost everyone he meets male or female man when dressed up he might wear a tshirt and shorts this is not often standard attire is an open robe and slippersthe dude hasnt worked for some time and he lives a simple meagre existence in rented accommodation with few friends his only nonnegotiables are bowling and white russians an alcoholic beveragethe dudes only known friends are his bowling buddies members of a league team a league that they take extremely seriously there are many scenes in this film set in the bowling alley during play however we only see one of the team ever bowl three bowls from memory speaking of the team aside from the dude we have walter john goodman and donnie steve buscemiwalter is loud opinionated and obnoxious not exactly a winning combination but he is loyal to the dude and even though he frequently gets it wrong he seems to want to do the right thing he treats donnie with disdain and almost always brings everything back to a nam storydonnie is the opposite simple friendly and curious he is always questioning and inserting randomly pointless comments into proceedings i am the walrusthe fun starts with a case of mistaken identity a message made for a lebowski is served to the wrong lebowski being the dudes aka this leads him in turn to the right lebowski specifically for a chatthe chain of linked but totally unpredictable events that follows this simple mistake are realistically largely irrelevant to your enjoyment aside from facilitating the introduction of various characters and providing the dude and often walter with a purpose for a short time the convoluted plot is often broken up with insane yet totally entertaining dream sequences generally bowling related and short sequences involving red herrings and bit characters not the least of which is named the jesushighlights though includea ransom request leading to a botched payoff  german nihilist pornographers  an inconvenient stolen car  a freaky naked feminist who paints via flying fox  a moustachioed cowboy narratorthe banter is often hilarious and always profane the ridiculous situations are often hard to follow but this never seems to matter anyway and the cameos and brief gonowhere scenes make the film even better more highlights nobody fcks wit de jesus the dudes use of spy techniques at the home of the pornographer brings hilarious results that are not what the dude  or anyone would expectthough you will be relieved to know that come the conclusion of the film the bowling team does make it to the finals or maybe that was a spoilerfinal rating  8  10 never has a throwaway film been this indisposable apparently this is a ya get it or ya dont film i myself cant see why ya wouldnt wanna get it,black_comedy
the coen brothers is a friendly clumsy comedy about a man named jeff lebowski who calls himself the dude and is illustrated by the narrator as the laziest man in los angeles county he lives merely to go bowling but is taken for a millionaire named with calamitous results we all know people like the dude and so supposedly do the coen brothers they rooted the character in a producer named jeff dowd both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderlinessthe dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong lebowski but before they discover that one has already peed on the dudes rug sparking intense hostility that rug really tied the room together the dude laments john goodmans walter sobchak leads the vendetta sponging lines straight from bush 41 he declares that this aggression will not stand and insists the dude draw a line in the sand the dude drops in on the real lebowski leaves with one of his rugs and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaires conspiraciesrich lebowski wheelchairbound like general sternwood and staring into a fireplace like major amberson wants the dude to deliver his wife bunnys ransom this plot is countered by maude lebowskis eccentric daughter from a past marriage julianne moore who played a porno actress in the great boogie nights here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness la in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters one of the funniest is a latino bowler named jesus the dude is prone to lively fantasies when hes punched out or knocked unconscious which occurs frequently and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful pov shot from within a bowling balltears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere that isnt so much a failing as its technique the dude who rocks a lot of ganj swigs white russians mixed with halfandhalf begins each day full of determination but his devices steadily melt into a fog of lost chances and misconstrued intent the atmosphere is set up right at first when the narrator begins sufficiently well but ultimately admits hes lost his own gist a droll curveball drawing our attention to the incidence of screenwriters who will never be unwilling to remove all support from us even after it has been literally soiled by a shaggydogstory character we may or may not ever see again in this chaotic plotthis could never equal its predecessor fargo but its bizarrely winning like its hero played by jeff bridges with a goatee potbelly ponytail and bermuda shorts so bulky they may have been scrounged from his sounding board and bowling partner walter sobchak their other teammate is donny who may not be too sharpwitted but its difficult to know as hes never permitted to finish a sentence set at the time of the gulf war here are characters whose language was created by earlier times vietnam flower power and the twilight zone as with raising arizona shows us a protagonist whose doofusy simplicity appears to be his sole defense from the real world he and walters very idea of real life may be wrought by the narrow ways they have to express it bridges does more with his downcast physical expression than countless comics can manage by laying it on thickfrom its opening credits indeed appears and feels like a shuckandjive thats why the recognizable premise of a staged kidnapping complete with betrayals is only outwardly commonplace crime and reason are not the concerns here what matters is how hardwearing the two or three characters were most concerned for are despite the misfortune generated by their own ineptnessa surrealist farce cooked up by the unruly coens out of odds and ends of the deeprooted and the newfangled the philosophical and the primal in a fraction of la where heightened reality crashes with autistic character interactionamounts to noticeably less than the sum of its frequently lively and entertaining parts,black_comedy
god i dont even know where to start with perhaps at the beginningmy then boyfriend practically forced me in 20023 to watch this against my will  holding me down as he was bigger and stronger while propping my eyes open a la clockwork orange okay fine he suggested it i hesitated and gave inis how it really went down at any rate i only mildly liked it then when he was rolling with his signature and usually contagious laughterthe movie grew on me however over the years  and thats not with extra viewings in fact until last night 242011 i hadnt seen it since i have thought about this feature discussed with others and found myself laughing at scenes and dialogue that i hadnt seen or heard in years damn im glad i decided to finally revisit it in order to finally review itthe movie was enormously well written and original hilarious spot on and had some of the best deliveries when i tried to find the one scene i loved the most or the one line i favored above the rest it was incredibly difficult i ended up picking the sexbowling dream even though all scenes with the caucasian or white russian in his hand especially when he shouldve spilled it but didnt had me cracking up and the lines throughout were clever ingenious and memorablequotable but to narrow it down i simply picked the shut the fck up donny line thats repeated many times each time i heard that even the 15th made me laugh out loudbut the movies strength wasnt just in the comedy its incredibly creative and has a novel approach to the old mistaken identity plot throw in great cinematography convincing twists and wonderful acting and you have a nearperfect film and probably my favorite coen brothers featurefurther the characters really drove the film even above and beyond what was already mentioned most were excellent and original but jeff bridges actually should have received his first of many deserved oscar for his role as the dude the uniqueness depth and believability alongside bridges own spin and acting made the dude one of my all time favorite characters in filmscaucasian drinking robewearing unemployed and lazyass the dude struts through life while bowling with his wacked exnam buddy walter goodman and donny buscemi untilone day hes mistaken for wealthy jeffrey lebowski huddleston who shares the same name as the dudes real nametheres been a kidnapping of the appropriately named bunny reid the wife of the bigger lebowski for a million bucks and the dude as sluggish as he is pays as close attention to this as would a pet gerbil to its surroundings but one of the bad men pee on his rug that sets off a chain of unfortunate events that get the dude and walter into trouble as they investigate and try and disfuse the situation sothey can get back to their bowling leaguemore clues and kookier characters blend into the mix and the coen brothers dont even miss a beat in making this unbelievably realistic example jesus turturro and yes you pronounce it as the same man on the cross wanders in and out of the movie setting up a hilarious but completely irrelevant character thats how it is in the real worldsure the movie actually goes on for a little longer than it should  the movies only real flaw but its worth the entire trip yeah literal trip also theres a hell of a lot of swearing i kinda matched that in my review which is something i normally dont do but here its relevantis a prime example of how to make a movie and quite frankly this movie can be broken down and studied for line by line its pure craftsmanship,black_comedy
i only gave this movie a nine out of ten because well sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you i recently sustained a head injury and i like this movie even more now i dont know if those two things are you know correlated or whatever im rambling now my point is its a great movie but you might be left wondering what its all about i guess thats just how this whole cult movie thing keeps perpetuating itself on down through the ages i dont know about you but i take comfort in that its one of those movies that makes you want to grab a bottle and a ball and have yourself a good time its what donnie wouldve wanted at least we think so and by we i mean i you know like the royal one man,black_comedy
has some of the best dialogue in any movie i have ever seen there are so many oneliners in here it is hard to keep up the dialogue is very crude which of course makes this a movie that truly deserves its r rating the dynamics between the characters all work out wonderfully it is fun to watch all of them interact with each other and their opposing viewpoints an example of this is the pacifism exhibited by the dude that contradicts the war hawk attitude of walter it is hard to say who stands out more than anyone elsethe plot of the movie is so simplistic but yet it somehow works i recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a good comedy that also has some good action in it,black_comedy
its pretty good if you like movies made by the coen brothers you will laugh a lot with this one its one of those movies where is more important to enjoy each scene than to sum all the scenes together to make a central storyline for plotobsesives this might not be what youre looking for but it still has a good story jeff bridges is known for any other movie rather than this one but for me this is his best performance also the character he plays is the coolest in filmaking historyalso has a good nostalgic soundtrackhas clever humour the best catchphrases and the best main character ever if you re into the coen brothers i think this is the real masterpiece yeah better than fargo and brother where art thou i said it dont kill mei love this movie i think the dude is the product of perfect parenthood fck it man best movie eevaaaaar,black_comedy
before i met the dude and the rest of the cast i wasnt sure if the coen brothers could ever top their citizen kanefargo after watching the big lebosky i found out just how talented these writerdirectors were the big lebosky is a genre trend setting masterpiece with dialogue so close to perfection i would not change a single sentence this is a movie of pure clever genius and has tremendous replay and stay power mark my words when i say you can watch it a million times and you will never get sick of itthe story begins with the raspy southern drawl of the strangersam elliot preparing us with narration as the ever schlepped dude jeff bridges jeff lebosky isreturning home from buying some milk at the grocery storeupon arriving home he is greeted by a couple of jackie treehorns notorious pornography producer looking for jeff lebosky after realizing that thedude was not in fact the right jeff lebosky and one peed on rug and thus plot set up laterthe henchmen exit thus we are brought along on one of the funniest and darkest tales of redemption slacking anger mistaken identity and league bowling i can honestly say the best ride of my life was on the not so righteousand lethargic tale of the dude while he tries to seek reparation for the soiled upon rug in his living room and finds himself in the midst of doing so getting involved with so many different forms of deception unwanted responsibility and paranoia as the dude agrees to act as courier when the other millionaire jeffery leboskysdavid huddleston kidnapped trophy wife bunnytara reed allegedly gets kidnappedneedless to say the dude is in well over his head and murphys law soon becomes reality to the motley crue of characters this movie is so cleverly written you wonder just how the plot gets pulled off with such grace and the answer to that question lays in the a the dialogue b the character development and c the amazing acting from the entire castas also starring walter sobcheckjohn goodman theodoredonny karabatsossteve buscemimaude leboskyjulianne mooreguest starring jesus quintanajohn turtorro brandtphillip seymour hoffmanetcand all these actors no matter how small the part all make a juxtaposing impact on the all around greatness factor of this films hilarity and tightness but make sure you relax your face muscles the night before watching this moviebecause the best of the best in my personal opinion comes from the dude and walterbridges and goodman as the dudes pacifism mentality counteracts with the ever un predictable and over steam headed vietnam veteran walter sobcheckgoodmanwho will take any chance he can get to turn a conversation into reminiscing about his life in the war with that being said also turning in an unforgettable performance is julianne moore as maude lebosky the daughter of millionaire business man jeffrey leboskydave huddleston the on screen chemistry between these cast members is extremely memorable and sometimes confrontational but always entertaining and clever when you view it for yourself youll find yourself quoting and watching in aweas these actors quickly become your bowling buddies and transform the silver screen into pure gold this masterpiece of satirical cinema will intrigue your intellect and challenge your sense of humor and boundaries as the big lebosky will invade your personal space by remaining in your mind and everyday references of the films idiosyncrasies will become adjacent to your vocabulary pare all that with the groundbreaking camera work and all star soundtrack and you have a film that comes as close to perfection as you will ever findall in all and pound for pound the big lebosky is a 10 a true timeless piece of film the coens sistine chapel if you willso ever thus to the deadbeats that choose not to enjoy but hey  thats just like my opinion manby anthony s timo,black_comedy
no matter how many times i see this movie it never gets old at this point ive easily seen it more than half a dozen times and i still find myself laughing throughout this movie was my first exposure to the coen brothers and it hooked me set in 1990s los angeles the film follows the dude an unemployed stoner with a passion for bowling as a case of mistaken identity and a soiled rug lead to his involvement in recovering a kidnapped woman honestly that little synopsis doesnt do the film justice and itd really be best to just watch itthe characters are what make this film so memorable jeff bridges as the dude what can i say since seeing him in this movie i havent been able to picture him as anyone else made it interesting seeing him as the villain in jon favreaus iron man heh he totally embodies this character with his chilled demeanor and stoned investigating stealing the scene almost as often as the lead is john goodman as the dudes buddy walter a vietnam veteran who cant help but regress to nam rants every time something grates on his nerves walters attempts to help dude in his predicament only make matters worse these two characters alone with of course credit to the fantastic writing of the coens fill the movie with infinitely quotable dialoguesupporting bridges and goodman are a myriad of great talent steve buscemi julianne moore peter stormare sam elliott and philip seymour hoffman contribute to film though the one of the best supporting characters has to be john turturros jesus quintana despite only being in two scenes his role as the pedophile bowler made for one of the best moments my absolute favorite sequences in the movie have to be the dudes hallucinationsdream sequences particularly the gutterballs number a great soundtrack wicked casting sharp writing and constant laughs give this movie infinite replay value and itll never get old,black_comedy
theres not much that can be said about that hasnt already been said not only is it a hilarious tale of mistaken identity and personal greed but it is a landmark film in terms of style character and philosophy it is on a very short list of truly essential films from the 1990s and stands up to as many viewings as you choose to throw at itone particular shining star is the main character jeffery the dude lebowski played by jeff bridges a perfect embodiment of the slacker lifestyle combined with the zen mentality the dude carries the picture as the unfortunate victim of external events all the dude ever wanted was his rug back full of hilarious lines and deadpan reactions bridges ensures that no scene is without insight and comedy even donnys funeraljohn goodman is also a high point turning in what is probably the best performance of his career as walter sobchak a vietnam vet holding a grudge against the rest of the world walter lends his unique form of support to the dude the scene with walter substituting a ringer for the ransom money is one of the greatest few minutes of film i have ever seen goodman really dives into the character delivering the little idiosyncrasies that lend unquestioned authenticity to the characterthere are plenty of other notable performances including steve buschemi as the slowwitted donny and philip seymour hoffman as the tightassed brandt the cohen brothers spun a true masterpiece with this movie one that seems only to become better as the years pass a mustwatch for any film fan,black_comedy
yet another masterpiece from the coen brothers which i possibly their best the film is about a case of mistaken identity for the dude jeff bridges perhaps the best character ever created lebowski which results in someone peeing on his rug and such a trivial spiralling off into a whirlwind of wacky adventures which is expected from the coens the dude and vietnam vet walter john goodman who thinks he is jewish are the main characters and are great fun in the movie and of course the mostly ignored donny steve buscemi the acting writing directing and somewhat bizarre cinematography are amazing if you like creative drama comedies watch this film if you dont watch it anyway,black_comedy
two things shock me about reaction to the first being the iffy critical reaction to it when it was released following fargo the second being that there are still people who dont love this movie its unquestionably a brilliant film on any technical level there are no wasted shots the dream sequences are unbelievably gorgeous the coens direction is confident and assured every step of the way and their economy in telling the story is commendable and the cinematography by roger deakins is superbgoing beyond the visuals to the film i find myself even more bewildered by how anyone could not at least give credit to the coens for this script at least for its immaculate structure and remarkably efficient characterization humor is subjective sure but this movie employs so many different types of humor that i should think it would appeal to just about everyone at one point or the other i consider it a blessing that theres not a single joke in the film which i didnt find funny you cant explain such things further every line here is just pure gold and the best thing about it is that the film demands multiple viewings for one to properly appreciate how rich the humor here isim struck by the similarity of this film to a later coen brothers film burn after reading not only did both follow nearunanimously praised oscarvalidated dramas with memorable characters and a dark sense of humor but both were also met with positivebutnotecstatic reviews from critics the biggest similarity however is the genre burn after reading is a spy thriller with no stakes and is a filmnoir with no real stakes and a bunch of pointless crime and destruction there are differences which lie mostly in the execution of the concept most notably in that features far betterdeveloped and more sympathetic characters as well as a stronger script in general moreover while burn after reading is a spoof of the spy thriller is more like a loving tribute to noir most specifically raymond chandlerthe dialogue is pristine and probably never matched in film at least not in a comedy the acting is consistently superb with only julianne moore not being absolutely excellent though shes fine really and jeff bridges and john goodman giving the best performances of their respective careers and the film is a technical marvel whats not to love like with many of my favorite films ive put off writing a comment for a long time and now that ive gotten it out of the way i dont feel ive said all i wanted to say oh well this is an absolute classic and i have no issues with calling it the coens finest film to date and one of cinemas great masterpieces,black_comedy
if fargo is the highest point in the coen brothers filmography comes in a close second its a perfect hybrid of fun mystery irony and pure insanity joel and ethans most explicitly entertaining movie since raising arizona and by far more accomplishedthe plot loosely based on raymond chandlers works the title itself is an obvious pastiche of the big sleep revolves around a former hippie jeffrey lebowski jeff bridges who insists everyone refer to him as the dude or in extreme cases something like his dudeness or el duderino to call the dude an underachiever is a euphemism hes never achieved anything in fact he spends his days doing nothing besides smoking marijuana drinking white russians or bowling with his friends walter john goodman a vietnam veteran with a life philosophy like no one else and donnie steve buscemi who isnt actually allowed to do much since everyone constantly asks him to shut the fck up whereas in fargo it was impossible to prevent him from talkingthe dudes quiet existence is radically shaken up when he is assaulted for no reason by two men who even take the liberty of peeing on his rug as it turns out they mistook him for another jeffrey lebowski the one mentioned in the title a wheelchairbound millionaire whose young wife tara reid appears to have been kidnapped by a band of nihilists led by peter stormare add a sleazy pornographer ben gazzara the other lebowskis artist daughter maude julianne moore the mysterious stranger sam elliott whose voice occasionally comments on the story a childmolesting bowling champion john turturro named jesus thats right nobody fcks with the jesus some freaky dream sequences and several mixups and its no longer very surprising that the dude needs absurd quantities of booze and pot to accept whats happening to himas a matter of fact what happens is actually the least interesting aspect of the film the noirish premise is nothing but a macguffin a cheap yet brilliant excuse to make all those wonderful characters interact with the coens trademark exquisite dialogue the best lines coming out of goodmans mouth this is what happens when you fck a stranger in the ass the fine ensemble cast gives life to a singular group of pederasts pimps private investigators and slackers above whom bridges towers with a humanity that makes you want to hug him on the spot the dude a revolutionary at heart even when there seems to be nothing left to fight for is the brothers most relatable and endearing creation next to fargos marge gunderson and its no surprise in the twisted coeniverse theyre as normal as they comeoverall pretty much a modern classic like most of the coens films and despite its dark streak a bit of a feelgood movie thanks to its oddly sweet and charming protagonist as the stranger points out its good knowing hes out there the dude,black_comedy
some scenes are a bit too absurd preposterous but abides that being so the coen brothers simply say to their critics such is lifetheir film is about exactly that  the absurdity of life in that no matter how much we try and take things into our own hands do justice or make people claim responsibility for their actions that life will often suckerpunch us out of left fieldlebowski is about a man of that name that goes by the dude hes a completely miserable lowlife character played by jeff bridges that for some reason you care about as the coen brothers are notorious for the dude gets caught up with some bad people for no reason other than he shares the same exact name as someone who happens to have money when two guys break into his home thinking he is the other lebowski and one pees on his rug it all goes down hill from there for the dudewith a stellar supporting cast led by john goodman who is incredible in this film as the dudes best bowling buddy and insane convertedjewish vietnam vet lebowski is original and deepbelly laughing funny but not only that the events of the film all say something important about when we choose to take action and when it might be best to let things be the films scenes are either funny and quotable creepy and eerie or both usually both all the gags however seem to have a point if not in what their message ishow it contributes to the film than at least in the way they grab your attention every scene in the film is effective in this waylebowski is undeniable proof that comedy can have a purpose other than mere entertainment it is a film with purpose beyond humor it is both strange funny and meaningful while not nearly as recognized or critically acclaimed as fargo per say the effective combination that is so rare in film definitely warrants coen brothers fans the rationale to say lebowski is their best project,black_comedy
this movie is simply amazing ive watched it for the first time in 1998 or 1999 and to be honest i wasnt very pleased i thoughtits okquite nice but nothing special three years ago i watched it again and i found it much better but that wasnt still itfinally i watched for the third time last year and i was really amazedmaybe i could say third times a charm i dont know maybe i was to young in 1998 to understand and enjoy the brilliance of or maybe its that kind of movie which keeps getting better and better each time you watch it it is one of my favorite movies theres something magical about ityou can watch each single scene over and over again and not get bored the dialogues are hilariousbut i am aware of the fact that not everybody would like that kind of humor but i just love it magnifficent performance from all actors especially bridges goodman and buscemibut supporting seymour hoffman stormare or moore are outstanding too i ve read that when cohens wrote the script they had all these actors in their mind and you can see it on the screen simple a must seebut of course you know thats just like my opinion mananyway the dude abides,black_comedy
overtly based on raymond chandlers classic novel the big sleep is my favourite work from the coen brothers along with millers crossing when released in 1998 cinemagoers were baffled by the film with most viewers not being able to even gather an opinion however once the film was available for purchase a cult following began to emerge which has given birth to the annual lebowski fest and a socalled religion named dudeism the world of lebowski has become an element of modern popculture while jeff bridges character the dude has developed into an icon of apathy his days are spent bowling drinking experiencing occasional acid flashbacks and delving in pacifismconducting an exhaustingly and intentionally complex tale of a trophy wifes kidnapping puts fourth a crime story as a means of making everything about the picture even more ludicrous than its characters you see the coen brothers routinely craft films concerning characters that have become swathed in absurdist situations this is an ulterior motive a means of clashing wacky diversities with an impelling sense of convolution is about characters that are blissfully unaware of the complications which arouse due to their erratic behaviour jeff bridges protagonist the dude aka jeffrey lebowski becomes apart of a kidnapping plot by accident he unwittingly stumbles across the scheme after a contextual naming error in which two housebreaking thugs urinate on his rug in response the dude seeks compensation from the intended victim who happens to carry the same name hence the confusion as you can see i am rambling and could do with a caucasian cocktailhas been apart of my life for many years now i recall lapping up the dialogue to such an extent that i would unintentionally quote the film during everyday conversations and i still do this boils down to a screenplay which will retain its status as one of the finest ever written by no means is the script artificial or plagiarised instead the breathtaking originality of it came as a breath of fresh air to the qtladen dialogue which circulated throughout the independent cinema of the 90s exemplifying imagination and entertainment is the aim of dumb halfwitted nonsense is not what the film illustrates as some people have wrongly accused it of being oh and i must not disregard a clear and present fact jeff bridges offers one of the greatest performances of alltimedo not dismiss this masterpiece as a senseless twaddle as that would be an unfair accusation for such a multilayered outing in confrontational elaborate humour this is comedy as an art form and so is conducted on an ambitious scale of subtly intelligent foulmouthed wit except this is a farce crafted on a mesmerising scale of ingenuity and radiating charm characters like walter sobchak donny kerabatsos jesus quintana and of course the german nihilists are irrefutable creations of hypocritical hilarity throughout the picture the dude encounters a vast array of sarcastically written characters which are effectively caricatures of combined personalities stylistically the film is crammed to the brim with stunning filmmaking procedures eg the jackie treehorn section which accentuate the confrontational wackiness of what could be hailed as a warped homage to filmnoir for a film of the 90s the soundtrack is punctuated with retro rock  roll from forgotten eras and in essence identifies a hippy stanceit might be worth noting that this review is just my opinion man even so that should not stop you from viewing a film which is destined to be regarded as something not just of the 90s but of todays culture too remember abide by the dudes rational whether you like it or not philosophies simply take each day as it comes and try not to live in the past stranger,black_comedy
the opening scene of follows the journey of a tumbleweed blowing in the wind it makes its way from the desert into the city of los angeles it keeps on going until its final resting place at a beach all accompanied to the sound of tumbling tumbleweeds on the soundtrack the point the film is trying to make is that in every city in the world there is one person who is like a tumbleweed someone subject to the whims of fate and in this film that person is jeff lebowskifirst off dont call him jeff or lebowski hes the dude a throwback to the stoned 60s that found his way into the stone cold 90s he doesnt really do anything except for observing the world through a drug addled haze and on the side he goes bowling with two very odd teammates walter and donny john goodman  steve buscemithe dudes unfulfilled yet untroubled life as a slacker takes a detour one night when two heavies break into his house and want money it turns out these two have mistaken the dude for a multimillionaire they inflict some further harm on the dude by peeing on his beloved rug it really tied the room togetherthe dude goes to see to get compensation to no luck but on his way out he helps himself to a rug and meets bunny lebowski tara reid the big fellas wife it isnt long before the dude is up to his goatee in trouble when he gets dragged into a kidnapping plot involving bunny that sets off a chain reaction of buggered up dropoffs walters unhelpful help stolen cars ransom money and erotic wet dreamsthe coen brothers followed up their superb kidnapping caper fargo with this equally superb slice of coen kookiness and again theyve crafted a tale around a kidnapping but that doesnt seem quite as important this time around its just a convenient hook to hang a lot of wackiness onnoone could ever accuse the coens of being normal theres always something a little off the beaten track about their films but thats the reason why i love them so much at least the coens are consistent and theyre always trying out new layers of bizarreness that are frequently dazzlinghas the coens at their most sadistic they do seem to enjoy putting the thumbscrews on their characters and every different plot point is an opportunity to tighten them even further and jeff bridges is the unfortunate soul at the centre of it he is the man at the mercy of their masterful direction as he goes through one tough and tortuous situation after anotheris a wonderful cascade of dire events much like fargo the scenes interlock with each other so tiny details can come back and bite you in the arse the plot is quite sleek and even multidimensional but the coens are far more interested in dreaming up new and wackier ways to torment the poor dude as well as the sublimely inspired gallery of freaks misfits and wackos theyve surrounded him withcoen regulars john goodman and steve buscemi are back on hand as the dudes bowling buddies goodmans walter is one of his most eccentric personas a shellshocked vietnam vet the man walks a fine line between passive restraint and fiery insanity its a role that suits john goodman down to a tee and the best part is its not a caricature hes playing there is a real man behind the nuttiness hes a man whos seen more pain in life than anyone should have to its that key that makes walter the most complete of any character goodman has played in a coen filmas for steve buscemis donny hes a man of few words but thats because hes never allowed to complete a sentence since walter is always telling him to shut the fk up we never learn much about donny just that he always bowls a perfect strike in fargo he died and does so again here as much a mystery in death as he was in life something morbidly amusing is that lately whenever buscemi is cast in a coen film he always winds up in little bits by the endjeff bridges is perfectly suited to the dude a stoned strung out loser who glibly coasts by on the chaotic shifts in his life and his drug induced dream sequences are so far out theyre from another galaxy wait until you see the one about the busby berkeley viking bowling dance number entitled gutterball its a hoot out of hellwhen i first saw i was surprised that the ending seems to lose the plot 20 minutes before the credits roll but then i started thinking about something the narrator of the film played by sam elliott said at the start how he lost his train of thought while telling the story and thats exactly what happens in the film itself its a bold move but its something only the coen brothers could get away with and they dois definitely the coens in trippy mode but its a work of inspired genius and again affirms why the coen brothers are so superb at everything they put their minds to,black_comedy
like many im sure ive watched this movie so many times i can quote nearly every line needless to say it is one of the most entertaining and laughoutloud stories ever told but watching it again recently i was struck by a subtle theme that i hadnt caught on to before this movie is very seriously advocating peace in our lives in our relationships and on the world scene its a little bit discomforting how this comedy unintentionally reminds us that we are still fighting in iraq after over a decade not to espouse my political views or suggest that this is a political film but this film does focus our attention via the walter character on our collective obsession with violence and encourages us to reevaluate our situation from the dudes perspective our communication lines are breaking down new information has come to light and like many of the characters in the film we should be asking wtf are we talking about when this aggression will not stand the dude doesnt raise a fist the dude abides and takes it easy the dude is a bigger man he is,black_comedy
unbelievablei have seen this movie at least 100 times pretty sure anyway and im not kidding if your having a bad day week year or say you just feel plain angry one day just simply pop this film in and all your problems are gone for at least 2 hours if not more in the same sense where you feel good post sex or post working out this is also an enjoyable ride thst surely could give you an afterglow so to speakyou notice something new with each viewing you learn to love the characters and everything their about and you are amazed at how one movie can have so many elements to it and a comedy at that some people dont understand this movie or they might think its slow if their new to itbut if you have an open mind and you watch this a couple of times it will quickly become a favorite its pretty impossible for it not to becheck it outyou will not regret itman,black_comedy
every time i watch this movie i get a big smile on my face it is always entertaining it is such a zany story the characters are so memorable and of course it makes you want to have white russians which are delicious it also makes me want to go bowling something i havent done in so long i think the acting is great the guy who played dude was perfect for the role john goodman was amazing he was so funny and i alway enjoy steve bushemi or however you spell his name this tale of wash up middled age misfits is great film making it tickled the funny bone and it just fun to watch good acting and a twist on a simple concept really worked in this film i have never met a person who doesnt like it the dude abides will live on,black_comedy
this was the movie that brought me round to jeff bridges the actor he always annoyed me before with his pompous type characters but in this he is superb he made me laugh constantly throughout the movie i always loved the coens work as it is just beautifully shot and conceived  always interesting without moving too far from the joy of the story is my favourite coen movie because it deals with a more common theme and is easy to relate to jeff bridges character i could watch all day and sometimes i wish there could be a follow up movie the story is full of superb characters and settings whilst the soundtrack is excellent do yourself a favour and see this film,black_comedy
yesterday i decided to watch this famous movie from the coens which they made after their brilliant fargo i had not much expectations because i thought its impossible that they made another movie as good as fargo indeed its impossible and it will always be impossible but when one movie from the coens is nearly as excellent as fargo was its definitely this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen pretty sure the great actors make the movie as good as it is im speaking of course about the best jeff bridges weve ever seen and the most brilliant john goodman weve ever seen steve buscemi has not such a big part as he had in fargo but thanks to him there is a wonderful runninggag which is getting funnier and funnier the more the we hear it to have actors like john goodman jeff bridges steve buscemi and julianne moore in the same movie is a great luck and a triumph,black_comedy
i saw this movie in the late 90ties my bigger brother tommy had bought itat first i did not think the movie was funny at all i thought it was just a very weird film about guys bowling there was not any of the usual comedy with people getting hurt and sobut at that time being the only dvd in the house i saw it again second time around it is a little funnier but not much then i saw it a third time then it got to meit is the funniest movie over made period the characters are so funny the dude walther the nihilist all are so funnyand it gets funnier every time you watch itthe dude lines are golden year well that is like just you opinion man and jackie treehorn treats objects like women man and all of walthers jewish and vietnamthine is so funny every timeis doctor strangelove of the 90ties,black_comedy
this is my  favourite movie of all time its about a guy named jeffrey lebowskibut almost everyone calls him the dude who has been mixed up whit another guy that is also named jeff lebowski he iss wife owns money to a porno producer and thens wife is kidnapped the dude is being the currier to the money that they are giving to the kidnappers that is 1 million dollars but the dudes best friend walter sobchak gets the brilliant idea that they can keep all the money for themselves the coen brothers has made a movie that is impossible not to love the characters like the dudejeff bridges walter sobchakjohn goodman donnysteve buscemi and so on is so original that you laugh at them just by looking at them and that i tell ya aint bad that this didnot won any oscar is a big mystery i now many people doesnot think this and i now that many people do think this that this movie is better then fargoalso made by coen brothers i mean fargo was brilliant and its also one of my favorites but i think this is a little better as i said its my  favourite,black_comedy
i finally broke down and bought this movie because of all the glowing reviews id read here about it surely a movie so many people liked and waxed lyrical about would be worth owning the first time i watched it i got to the dudes second encounter with maude and turned it off just annoyed by the film i watched it again and made it through to the end a few days laterive only seen three coen brother films raising arizona mostly hated it fargo mostly loved it and this one still trying to decide one thing you can say about the coen brothers films is that they are complex this one is somewhat of an homage to raymond chandlers la based philip marlowe mysteries i happen to love raymand chandlers works and consider him one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century so am somewhat disappointed by the coen brothers thievery their characterization not mine of his stylethe dude like chandlers marlowe gets caught up in a web of intrigue and runs around la meeting mostly unsavory characters that you cant begin to like marlowe himself is somewhat unlikeable but not as unlikeable as the dude at least marlowe is working while the dude is motivated by primarily his own greed first in wanting to obtain a new carpet for free and secondly by increasing offers of money from the other lebowski and the other lebowskis daughter maudebut if the dude is unlikeable most of the other characters are even less likable john goodman as walter is especially annoying and most of his scenes are played out so over the top to be totally unbelievable most of the other reviewers talk about how realistic the conversations between walter and the dude are yet gullibly laugh at walter throwing himself out of a moving car with an uzi wrapped in bubble wrap to go try to catch a kidnapper to beat the truth out ofdonnie is probably the most likable of the three friends or at least maybe you feel most sorry for as he is continually told to shut up by walter at least donnie gets one of the most memorable lines of the movie when the dude and walter are talking about something that lenin said and donnie interjects i am the walrus of course the coen brothers for no discernible reason kill donnie off at the end of the moviei dont know why the coen brothers felt they needed sam elliot in this movie but i liked it as a nice touch of surrealism i didnt like the dream sequences very much especially the second one i also found the german nihilists very insultingly portrayed kind of along the same lines as how the germans in hogans heroes were portrayed id expect better from the coens they are smarter than thatthe film wasnt totally worthless i did laugh out loud at points the in and out burger fixation was hilarious as was the 2x4 nailed to the floor as a doorstop that the dude later trips over for a couple of examples but there were as many things that i found just downright annoying about the film as wellfar from a masterpiece its a badly flawed albeit amusing film,black_comedy
the coen brothers have brought me a great deal of joy especially when i saw raising arizona alone and far away from home in southern california many years ago they do have the ability to bring me to fullbore gagging on my own spit laughter this is what happened one night eight years ago when i sawtbl is quite simply one of the funniest films ive ever seen it is also a very strange movie with a story line that indicates sustained drug use and an arrested level of maturity it is not for everyonebut for me this movie caught me in the right mood and at the right time i needed excellent performances sharp loony writing and a soundtrack so eclectic it defies descriptionthere are throwaway lines in that come close toand sometimes matchthe signature gags from raising arizona my favorite there was trey wilsons exasperated description of his missing sons clothing to an fbi agent i dont know what he had onhe had yodas and s on him here when jeff bridges is offered oral sex by tara reid for 1000 and he starts to move away from the camera someone asks him where hes going his response im going to look for a cash machine im dumb enough that lines like that and movies like catch me by surpriseand cause me to start hacking spit from laughing,black_comedy
this is one i pull out every year or so and watch and ask why did i wait so long to watch this one again there are many scenes and lines that i find run through my head for awhile after i watch this a number of great performances and its interesting that over time this cast looks stronger and stronger as i watch this movie it really appears that the cast is having a lot of fun making this film  relationships appear easy and no one seems to have phoned their lines in i do find that i have to be in the right mood to watch it  its great release when its been a particularly stressful week because in a way theres a lot about the dude jeff bridges that appeals  a lot of people would like to be that free but theres a lot of pent up stress in most peoples worlds like walters john goodman give it a try,black_comedy
isawesome here we have a movie that combines a brilliant and hilarious script with a clever and twistful plotits like clerks and the usual suspects put togetherand the best part is it works very wellis hilarious not funny or very funnyhilarious you will laugh the entire timei will say it is probably the funniest movie in the modern erathe movie is clever solid complicated plot it just makes it funnieri do not want to give anything away because that would destroy the fun is a cool complicated and hilarious movie1010,black_comedy
this has to be one of the only movies that truly made me laugh out loud all the way through but unlike all the other comedies ive seen this one is just plain funnier the plot revolves around a modern hippieavid bowler called jeffrey the dude lebowski the dude though has the same name as a multimillionaire called jeffrey hence the title and when the multimillionaire owes money to a group of nihlists they dont believe in anything they mix up the two peoples identities and the dudes carpet gets ruined because of it the dude then seeks restitution for his carpet but soon becomes involved in a kidnapping involving the big jeffrey lebowskis wife and throughout the whole movie he is helped by his two bowlingbuddy friends walter and donny what ensues is complete mayhemthere were parts in this movie that i found to be so funny that i had to pause the movie while i laughed for minutes at a time i also missed some parts because i was laughing so hard and had to rewind the script is brilliant everything in this movie is absolutely hilarious and the pace is fast all of the characters are unique and have their own voice like the burnedout dude the shorttempered walter and the extremefeminist maude and there is not one scene without its fair share of guffaws all of the acting is superb as well and the soundtrack is amazing this is the funniest movie i have ever seen it is extremely creative always interesting and just plain insane this is the coen brotherss best movie by far yup even better than fargo and is also one of my alltime favorites i give this one an easy 10 out of 10,black_comedy
i can say without a doubt that this is the coen brothers best film though they have made many other great movies and are two of my most favorite directorswriters in hollywood now they absolutely shine with the funniest thing about this movie is how all of the peculiar and hilarious characters and situations come together so gracefully where raising arizona and barton fink tried fairly successfully at accomplishing this feat does this flawlessly the dudes crazy dream sequences walters paranoid infuriated ramblings about history and american policy the ridiculous dialogue between the dude walter and donnie maudes elitist la interactions with the dude the aggressive german kidnappers and the narration of the strange cowboy played masterfully by sam elliot all merge seamlessly to form a comedic masterpiece that gets better on repeated viewings like the hugely successful show seinfeld the main characters walter and the dude never seem to accomplish anything of any value but the combination of walters incompetent aggression and the dudes incredible misfortune produces a story as complex as it is funny at the end of this movie you may be asking yourself what you just saw and what good came from all the foul language and unusual dialogue between walter the dude and the other characters in the movie the best thing is to just sit back and laugh uncontrollably at the strange situations the characters find themselves in along with the accompanying dialgue every time i watch this movie and it has been quite a lot i pick up new quotes and find new things to laugh at as mentioned in the summary the fact that out of all the coen brothers films the only two to win academy awards was fargo and o brother where art thou is a travesty and does a disservice to the inherent comedic genius that this movie displays although i hate saying never i dont think a movie of this comedic magnitude will come out again,black_comedy
is probably one of the best films in the category of dark comedy the coen brothers did a really magnificent job in all respects practically every aspect of the movie is flawless the characters the dialogues the casting the storyline the settings and the plot itself where the main roles are concerned jeff bridges and john goodman gave their best performance ever the roles suite them so well i doubt they will ever do better than they did here steve buscemi is the only exception he already gave his best in fargounfortunately the coen brothers never really recovered after the shock of making such an exquisite film and their later works are nowhere near as good in fact id go as far as to say their film intolerable cruelty 2003 was a complete waste of effort for maker and viewer alikethere is however one emphatic point about it is not universal humour to really appreciate it one has to be familiar with the american way of life or at least have a basic understanding of us history contemporary culture slang and so on for example the ambiance of the bowling culture words like undude bummer jay ringer his dudeness walters goodman constant struggle for people to respect his constitutional rights and the rules etc overall i still have to say it is an evergreen classic and a must see for everyone who believes they have a decent sense of humour and are not put off by a little cursing from time to time and lets face it all the time,black_comedy
this movie may be called the wisdom of the dude it reminds me the book of the tao of poohthe dude is a guy that floats with the streamhe is not trying to be the most smart guy on earththe bravest and so onhe is just the dudeand for once with the help of his vietnam veteranwalterhe is trying to be smart and things start mess up for himbut even then he is still the dudethe good thing about watching the movie is a chance to take a rest from the rat race of lifelean backeat popcorn with a beverage and have a good timejust like the dudeand if you learn something from that movie then it would be something that with no wordsit is something that you will grasp with your feelings and gut no brain and mind is needed hereand no unnecessary wordshave a good time,black_comedy
this is one of the very few comedies that is still funny every single time you watch it for what some might dub as a stoner comedy theres quite a lot going on this movie and its damn near impossible to catch everything on the first viewing i wont get into the plot details since i think its best to watch it for the first time without knowing anything about it then watch it again a couple weeks later ill bet you laugh more the second time you see it office space was the only other comedy that had this affect on me oh and one other thing do not watch the edited version on tv this movie is rated r for a reason and if you watch the edited version you are missing half the moviemy highest recommendation,black_comedy
the dude abides see it more than once it grows on you it is mythical first time i saw it i was not so impressed others say this also happens to them but try it again and something unusual will take shape in you it is like the proverbial good wine kind of thing with age it gets better and better and you gotta check out the lebowski fest web site  a whole community of little urban achievers with tshirts bumper stickers lebowski fests this is a classic movie that can gently like water cracking stone change the consciousness of the world i knowthat seems pretty far out so sue me  yo abusive world leaders and you know who you are be warned  this is a subversive film  you better ban it or classify it and lock it away before your populations learn to relax and enjoy life you might think it is only about a stoner antihero hero and it is to some extend but it is also about ordinary people dealing with stuff they aint prepared for  being a bigger person than you think you are  handling the messy stuff life throws at you without shutting down and becoming rigid it is about finding your innerdude and maybe just maybe this particular movie is growing in popularity at this particular time because of the way things are  the pathetic and clueless leaders we have  the direction they are taking us yuk  our seeming inability to do anything about it  the endless frustrations of our menu driven impersonal telephone world  and maybe there is also some nostalgia for the 60s and 70s when for a brief shining moment there was a sense of real life happening and a sense of optimism blooming  that is missing today  well uh thats just your opinion man,black_comedy
my video bible is the best movie ever made the dialog is unrivaled by any other movieor book for that matter one can spend hours watching the movie a thousand times and remembering every quote but the 1001st time you watch it you will find something new and funny that you never knew could be left in the film the casting is perfect and spoton for all portrayals of script characters john goodman performs in as close to a leading performance a supporting role can be jeff bridges steals the show as he was intended to do and portrays possibly the best character ever filmedthe dude he integrates the intended simplicity of the dudes lifestyle with the chaotic complexity of his philosophies and personality absolutely a mustsee for anyone who gives a damn about breathing,black_comedy
this in my opinion is quite possibly one of the best films of all time with an all star cast including steve buscemi jeff bridges and jon goodman these men were born to play these roles they go on and on about almost anything very strong and well thought out characters turturro is another favorite of mine portraying the character jesus in this story the movie flows well and in the end it concludes that even the biggest losers in the world can make a difference having watched this movie over 500 times now i could go on about it for days but this is a must see for anyone it is my life dream to meet the dude in person he is an actual person according to the coens only the coen brothers could make a two hour work of art on such a random series of events amazing 10,black_comedy
this movie is hilariousthe dude aka el duderino aka the dudeness is extraordinary jeff bridges is absolutely perfect as the lazy stoned and funny talking dude and john goodman uh if only i had a dollar for every memorable line he said hes incredibly funny steve buscemi is as always excellent i have so much respect for this man in every movie hes been in hes always been able to raise it to an extra level hes brilliant philip seymour hoffmann is just outstanding one of the best actors out there the roles he has chosen says it allnot to forget john turturro as jesus now thats magic his moments in the movie are really his he is so funny in in contrast to the dude it is hilarious and the germans i love the germans and i love that flea from red hot chili peppers is one of themi could go on and on but these and the rest of the cast are all part of an absolutely unique movie its timeless comedy,black_comedy
this movie has certainly gained cult status and nothing i could say would persuade any reader to watch it because if you are reading this review you are one of the 99 of the people who absolutely love this flickgrowing up in the chicago area my dad was the manager of a bowling alley for 30 years and i was a bowling alley rat as a kid this film is especially funny to me because i remember characters like the dude and walter sobczak drinking and bowling all the time a lot of wing nuts hang at the lanes which to me made the story even more plausible lol i remember the late 80s  early 90s and they captured the ambiance of the bowling alley crowd perfectly i adore this moviethe movie is hilarious but this is something you already know i have a soft spot in my heart for the scene after donnie has the heart attack and the next scene is a really cool pan of the lanes and the bowlers as townes van zandt pines the rolling stones dead flowers live as a backdrop a really great combination of great coen brothers and great music sadly townes van zandt died a year before this came out which makes me wonder if they put that song in there as a tribute to him and also fitting with donnies death both are sad momentsand remember thats right nobody fcks with the jesus,black_comedy
i only recently found this treasure by watching previews from another rental wow watched it 3 or 4 times already cant get enough casting is perfect writing is awesome direction superb production excelling big fan of the coen bros since fargo and then bro where art thou this tops them bothhysterical prologue on dvd about the film restoration bit with forever young lol hope they make a sequel perhaps name it the dude or dude lebowski with the original cast even bring back steve buscemi to play his twin plot could entail dude being visited by maude to assist in something to do with the child they conceived hey even though they didnt marry the child still has parents with both the same last name  may not be as good as the original but it would be a pleasure to see them all together again with a continuing storyline,black_comedy
this movie is very personal to me the coen brothers have always been a favorite of my family and the dude looks acts and talks exactly like my dead fatherthat said my high score for this film is not just because i like it but because its excellent im going to save the usual great directing acting cinematography editing and humor all of which it has and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times i watch itfirst of all the dialog specifically move over tarantino and kevin smith you have been owned this dialog is faster wittier more real and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible was the dialog even written down most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each others direction and they are talking about whatever they want to and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep reemerging later characters go off on regular tangents and im not just talking about the vietnam war either and the actors never ever fall out of character its amazing to beholdsecondly the storylines general arch many conversations ive had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back in fact the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way the dude ends up worse off than he was before but then again hes happier and the status quo has returned so its still contained brilliantly the thing is that the coen brothers tend to write very characterdriven plots where the characters personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations furthermore its not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless like a lot of lesser characterdriven plots it all ties together and is contained beautifully this movie could not have ended any other wayfinally i wont bore you with the regular talk about how great a character the dude is even though he is i want to talk about walter sobchack honestly this the role john goodman was born to do and of course he did it brilliantly not only can i not imagine anyone else doing it i cant imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting dude together with donnie the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screenpolarisdib,black_comedy
there is not much i can add to the vast array of comments and praise out there for the dude however i would like to note a bit of surreal trivia from the moviein the opening scene we see the dude buying milk at the grocery store nothing special you might be thinking but when he goes to pay a the register note the date of the check he is writing and the newsclip on tv immediately afterwordsit is chilling to say the least ill not say more simply watch the movie once more to witness one of the more bizarre cases of premonition by chance 10 years to the date by the way the box set for this movie is fantasticlots of goodies ps how i love the coen bros and all the fine talent they cast in their movies three cheers,black_comedy
jeff lebowski or the dude as he prefers to be called is an aging hippy who loses his favorite rug when he is mistaken for a millionaire with the same name the dude and his loudmouthed friend walter find themselves in a sometimes surreal always hilarious series of adventures they encounter eccentric characters and sometimesbizarre situations in their attempts to stop a kidnapping that may or may not have happened evade germans who may be nazis or nihilists but who are probably just a former technopop band and maybe even get the dudes rug back the dialogue is hilarious and the cast is fantastic is one of those movies that gets better with repeat viewings it was written and directed by the coen brothers and stars jeff bridges john goodman julianne moore steve buscemi john turturro philip seymour hoffman many others and flea highly recommended,black_comedy
hey kidstheres this song im trying to find but i dont think its in the soundtrack does anyone know what song is playing in the scene with the dude and the limo driver the cool one the driver is talking about a big rash on his ass and some annoying stuff but life goes on and the dude is saying how he lost money today and how he was in a bad mood earlier its still in the beginning of the movie i think its right after he was with maude lebowski and after getting out of this limo he gets forced into another limo finding the old lebowski and brent if anyone knows what song is playing that would be cool because its been bugging the blazes out of me,black_comedy
this movie is pure gold i love this movie first off it takes place in the early nineties anytime a movie takes place in between the years of 19701994 its got my attention its also a comedy i am a comedy freak i love comedy comedy is my life this is real comedy the funny stuff one thing i love about this movie that i havent heard anybody else say is that the movie had thee perfect music to it fantastic music throughout the whole film my favorite characters were the dude of course walter and donny i am a fan of all three of the actors who played those parts jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi poor donny was always being told to shut up by walter the dude was mixed up in the other jeffery lebowskis problems and walter threw his undies out the car window and wants them back from those nazis those three pals sport was bowling ive actually enjoy it as well some other people i had noticed in the movie were tara reid as bunny dom irrera as the driver and jack kehler as marty im also fans of them to wrap this whole thing up i want to say if you havent seen this movie and you want to see a great comedy about a guy whos just trying to get by in life watch starring jeff bridges,black_comedy
the big lewboski is among the best comedy films of all time kind of it has a very disjointed storyline and is at times hard to follow or comprehend however the writer allows enough latitude for the actors to make it work the casting of jeff bridges as dude is central to the movie i cant think of another actor that could have pulled this off as well as he did it really tied the movie togetherthe dude seems not to want anything but to be left alone the uncertainty presented to him as the result of a case of mistaken identity maybe shatters the warm comfort that dude has spent his life creating and maintaining it makes him very uncomfortable and causes him to react accordingly walter is the dudes salvation he forces the dude to pursue the source of his discomfort the more that walter exerts himself the better it gets john goodmans heroic manic performance gave the movie the only sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic circumstance presented to the dude both walter and dude are pretty intelligent introspective and spiritual beings in their own rights they just dont know iti have no idea what donny was doing in the movie other than to have steve buschemi die in yet another cohen brothers film the dialog is wild the big lewboski yelling the plane has crashed into the mountain maudes discussion of the effect of vaginae on men and all of the jesus scenes down to his purple jump suit the purple jesus are bizarre everything coming out of the dudes mouth is very funny like a night at the opera and the producers good comic actors presented with the right opportunity can take it over the falls the more you watch this movie the better it gets,black_comedy
i rarely give a film the maximum 10 points but after seeing probably close to ten times im sure it deserves the 10 you might wander what is really going on in that film and why do so many people praise it when to you it seemed boring didnt it the film didnt really seem interesting after the first viewing but when i saw it the second third time repeats on cable tv i realized i was expecting some kind of a plot but theres hardly any in the film instead the film is full of brilliant dialogs comic situations the female form and sree lingonberri pancakes actually if i was to quote my favorite lines from the film it would probably take half a page and the film doesnt fail to entertain after the first viewing because there are so many hidden comic situations that one must really see the film a few times to notice if you this is not the usual type of comedy though cant tell more or i might spoil your funbrilliant really brilliant and in my opinion very unusual as for an american film pay attention to the dialogs and small details,black_comedy
i love most to all coen movies but anyone who believes this is not their best work is just wrong i realize that is just like my opinion man but i defy you to find a more quotable movie with more entertaining characters anywhere mark it an 8 or better or you are just over the line i am down with fargo which seems to be the other popular fan favorite for the coens but it is still 4th best at best big lebowski is clear cut 1 hudsucker proxy is arguable 2 3rd could be raising arizona blood simple or millers crossing 4th fargo comes in ahead of o brother and intolerbale crueltybarely grab some caucasians sit back and reevaluate the dude for your own good,black_comedy
is an epic film that has strikes and gutterballsups and downs the cast is spectacular there are many stars that appear in this film jeff bridges does a great job playing the wonderfully lazy the dude john goodman is very funny as high tempered vietnam vet and steve buscemis character donny is very funny as the innocent victim of goodmans temper i can not picture any other actors playing these characters or the other characters for that matter has an excellent plot something that most comedies seem to lack this is a must see movie that will have you repeating some quotes from the film to your friends on a regular basis this is one of the funniest films of all time the dude abides,black_comedy
this film is most definitely one of the best by the coen brothers granted fargo and oh brother are amazing along with the rest of theirs but considering that the age group right now for 1528 year old males are right at home with this film so quotable from anything waltergoodman says to the liberal tomfoolery of the dudebridges and they bowl all the time this film is more than amazingthe dude as he likes to call himself is misconstrued as a rich lebowski in town under the same name of jeff lebowski and his rug is adulterated by the chinaman seeking recompense for his rug for which he claims ties the room together he approaches the lebowski the henchmen were actually looking for after meeting the real lebowki who is an old rich conservative with a young attractive wifetara reid he hires the dude to help pay the ransom on his young wife bunnythe plot turns into a twister of events leading the dude on an adventure aided by his partner in crime walter he meets many odd quirky characters such as muade lebowski played by julianne moore who delves in an idiosyncratic sexual docket i suggest everyone see this film not only the frat guy generation will love it but anyone who can laugh at a joke and understand making fun of both liberals and conservatives will love this film through and through 9 outta 10,black_comedy
for so many reasons this is one of the best comedies you will ever see if you enjoy quirky movies and a movie that will take your mind for a wild ride this is it the cast is amazing john goodman steals the show as walter between the dude the stranger and jesus there are plenty of strange and hilarious characters the story takes one turn after another and is in true cohen brothers form i have seen this movie many times and still laugh out loud walter and the dude go on a quest to replace his rug it really tied the room together in the process the dude finds himself confused with who sends the dude on a wild task in this movie each new character seems to top the one you just meet watch this movie,black_comedy
in my short 25 years of life i have seen a decent amount of movies missing out on some of the classics from before my time however i would still say that for the right sense of humor this movie is nearly perfectthis movie is very dialog oriented which to some extent necessitates that you get to know the characters to really understand why some things are funny i personally loved this movie when i first saw it but probably would have only a given it an 8 the more you watch it however the more your knowledge of the characters from the fist viewing build very quirky and nuanced personalities that make the characters very real and yet surreal this makes it that much better when you hear some of the comments because you know where they came from just as if you heard of something that a friend did and depending on who that friend was it makes their actions that much funnierthere are flaws in every movie but what matters is do they bother you or not and i dont remember any that do and i have seen the film at least ten times each time just as good as the last and this is what makes this movie so special is repeatability you can watch it and start it over right afterwords and laugh just as hardjohn goodman should have at least been nominated for a best supporting actor as he is excellent in this movie as walter also john turturro is excellent as the jesus in a limited role other actors turn in very good performances as well i think you need the right sense of humor for this movie to work for you but everyone that i do know that likes it loves it and that makes it worth viewing because if it does work for you you will understand where the genius is located in this film and you will love it as welli wont mention any details about the film because thats what the film is for and frankly if i tried to summarize it it just wouldnt do the movie justicesee it sometime when youre bored and hopefully you will see what i see in what i still say is the best comedy of the 90s,black_comedy
this is my favorite movie of all time i keep running into big lebowski fans here on the east coast so there must be a lot of us this is the only movie i watch over and over again the dialog is a bit heavy on the cuse words but critical to the story of the dude and his rug the cast and plot make this one of the most stupefying stories i have ever heard this is the cohen brothers crowning achievement many films are predictable and formula driven this movie is unpredictable each time i see it i see something new there is no other film like it and when i am a bit blue i can put this film in and it will always crack a smile on my face,black_comedy
like i said in the summary simply put this is the movie that defines life in the 90s the dude as the narrator so eloquently puts it is the man for his place and time although he defines laziness and the dude is lazy he is a hero but what is a hero ill stop stealing lines from the movie and just say that this is one of the best put together movies of all time it is a cult classic and i cant imagine why its not more mainstream but it is clever original and i must say that john goodman as walter sobchak is one of the best characters to ever grace the big screen if youve seen this movie im confident youll agree this is one of the few films that can be silly and real at the same time to put it bluntly this is a must see if you havent seen it and if you have watch it again it only gets better,black_comedy
a victim of mistaken identity geoffrey the dude lebowski in advisably pursues recompense for the spoiling of his beloved rug after it is ruined by two braindead thugs who think he is the pasadena millionaire of the same namehow on earth anyone could possibly have imagined that the dude was a millionaire in the first place is a little beyond comprehension but reason is not important when a movie is as profoundly funny and satisfying as this wee gem from the coen brothersnever before has geoff bridges fitted into a role so snugly and it would perhaps be churlish to suggest that the character made it an easy role to play as this would take something away from an outstanding performance from bridges as the ageing pacifist hippieperhaps he may have had better pure acting performances than this but surely this was a role bridges was born to playthe dudes daily chores include trips to the supermarket to ensure he has fresh milk which he opens and smells before buying for his staple diet of white russiansfor dude lebowski is perhaps someone many of us aspire to be likean exstudent activist turned tenpin bowling pacifist the dude endeavours to take it easy for as much as possible and one fells if it wasnt for the destabilising influence of his best friend  vietnam veteran and vietnam  obsessed walter  he sure wouldon walters john goodman suggestion the dude decides to visit his namesake millionaire of the film title and ask for compensation for his ruined piece of carpet after all it really tied the room togetherit soon becomes clear that the dude should have settled for a smelly rug and gone bowlingafter initially rudely rejecting his request for the compensation the wheelchairbound big lebowskithrough the good offices of his attendant  the snivelling and cowering brandt  forgives the dude for stealing a rug from the mansion and offers to pay him 20000 dollars to act as courier when his wife is kidnapped by a gang of motley german nihilists really clever plotwhat follows is predictable enough in that the dude and walter become embroiled in a sequence of events which become increasingly bizarre as they fail to deliver the one million dollar ransomwhat is not predictable is the bizarre characters that the dude encounters along the way that make this comedy so much more endearing than mostanother character that deserves a mention is donny the hapless member of the trio who passes almost unnoticed but this is nevertheless another good piece of work from this really good actor steve buscemiso overall this is a fine piece of work by the two coen brothers and is one of my favourite movies i saw it when i was 13 years old and was blown away with laugher from watching this great comedyi would suggest to all fans of coen brothers or good comedy to see itso deserves a full 910 stars watch it now,black_comedy
a really good picture the plot is as easy to follow as it is entertaining the characters as well as the director are more than good at showing us what they want us to see amusing and entertaining characters and a story thatll go to the history books the music is fantastic and really thoughtthrough you get introduced to the dude and his world and soon you realize that you never want to leave the movie shows us the brighter as well as the darker and more lonely sides of life but most important of all also that we must be able to laugh at them sometimes in order to get bythe only thing i didnt totally like was the photo but you cant have it all,black_comedy
terrific terrific terrific dont ya just love the coen brothers story built with the unique and overthetop characters these guys are famous for from the dude  jeffery liebowski to walter to donny even jesus thats right nobody fks with the jesus a mistaken identity becomes one of the most unique and hilarious comedies in years it doesnt matter what you believe in  even if its nothing we believe in nothing liebowskianyway this movie is fun fun fun its one of those where youll be dropping quotes with your friends and annoying everyone elsebut isnt that what a fun movie is all about1010,black_comedy
yes i gave it a 10 but only because i gave fargo a 9 and i liked this one even better what i should have given it was a 95 because of two fundamental mistakes in the moviefirstly its title is a poor choice for the dude wouldnt have liked it  he only wanted to be known as the dudesecondly though i love the shawn colvin adaptation of the viva las vegas tune played during the second half of the credits the movie had absolutely nothing to do with las vegas it was all about la manbut dont you just love the music selections for this movie though i doubt ive ever heard a better movie soundtrackand dont you just love sam elliot as the stranger  who blows mysteriously into la like the tumbleweed in the opening sceneas for philip seymour hoffmans roletoo muchand lastly the busby berkely dance sequencepure psychedelia,black_comedy
even with raising arizona on their cinematic belts the coen brothers made their comedic masterpiece in this triumph of a comedic movie is it the highest rated comedy on the top 250 this movie defined my college years as people had lebowski parties with white russians etc and the movie going the whole time people just could not stop watching and rewatching this movie instead of the typical slapstick gross out or physical comedy that has so dominated movies since the 1990s bl uses slick writing creative characters and a convoluted but fun plot to make the audience laugh no lame sex jokes or tense moments between a female and male nothing forced or built up to force us into laughing just good old fashioned hilarity the entire movie has become quotable with john goodman providing most of the lines with his over the top character it is such a classic that i know many a person who knows the entire script almost line for line like its star wars or some other cult movie it even makes jeff bridges always seem to be the dude to me now even when i see him in movies he performed in well before this movie all the actors put in fine performances with steve buscemi and john turturro making their regular coen brothers appearances some people may take this movie too seriously and i am sure if one does one would scoff at its high ranking but dont let yourself become a cinematic elitist just relax and realize that this is one of the reasons why people make such a big deal about the coen brothers a unique film that deserves credit for taking chances but for also being intelligently written incredible laughs and relevant caring characters force me to give this a 9 or a,black_comedy
thats right is the best film ever and by reading many of the other imdb comments i can see i am certainly not alone in that opinion there are a few reasons why i happen to believe this to be numero uno the dialogue in this film surpasses even that of pulp fiction almost every line of the script is pure gold and if it does not bring the merest chuckle out of you then you are rolling around on the floor in fits of laughterobviously the dude is a legendary creation played to perfection by bridges but just outshining him is goodman as walter he is quite possibly the funniest character to be portrayed on screen you only have to go to the memorable quotes tab on the column to the left to experience just how funny this guy is his constant bringing up of the vietnam war into literally any topic of conversation never ceases to be funny and the scene he smashes up that blokes car shouting you see what happens when you f a stranger in the ass is the best of all the classic scenes that make up this masterpiecethis is the one film i dont think i will ever get tired of watching and if for some bizarre reason you dont like it check your pulse you may very well not be alive,black_comedy
if the movie ended about 10 minutes early it would have been excellent im sure some people would disagree with me but i felt that the last 10 minutes were a waste and brought the movie down other than that its a great movie the coen brothers always end on a bittersweet note that i feel is unnecessary and manipulative its like they are compelled to constantly pull the rug out from underneath youin spite of this this movie is extremely well made the dialogue is hysterical is this your homework larry the dream sequences are clever and the dude character is inspired if you like this film you might like jackie brown like lebowski there is a profusion of profanity shut the f up donnie,black_comedy
im going to start off by mentioning this movies falls at 2 on my list of best movies of all time ill also mention that i live by dry sarcasm and underlying suggestioninterestingly enough i hated this movie the first time i saw it missing the first 10 minutes certainly didnt help as i had a hard time following however nothing really stood out that i enjoyedas i watched the movie 25 more times over the next 10 years i saw everything that i had missed in that first viewing and it became entirely clear to me the pure genius and wit that goes into every scene and every line of dialogthis movie has the best character definition ive ever seen even though you cant necessarily identify with the characters you feel as if youve known them for years within the first couple minutes of meeting them sure they are stereotypical but they are also brilliantly acted and portrayed making them so believablegoodman gives the performance of a lifetime walter is so overthetop ridiculous and yet so surprisingly content as such one cant help but to laugh at how seriously he takes himselfand then theres jesus everyone else does a topnotch job but he steals the show two scenes both equally outrageous costumed acted and written to perfectionif you find yourself disliking this movie watch it again unless youre easily offended by the f word let every line of dialog sink in along with the way its delivered when you find yourself laughing hard at your favorite parts rewind them and listen to the reactions of characters that you may have missed because you were laughing so hard they are equally as rewardingthere is so much to digest in it deserves to be viewed a couple times a year you will undoubtedly seehear something you probably missed the previous time,black_comedy
is my favorite movieit may not be the best according to some but its a very clever and original movie some of the humor doesnt jump outat you like in other comedy movies instead you more or less have to think about what is going on in the film to see the humor in it is a classic one of the coen bros best but only recently have i noticed more people watching the movie and enjoying it i think as more people see the movie that they may have missed will gain more respect for those of you that saw it on comedy central your missing out on a lot of r rated comedy rent the dvd sometime and youll know what im talking about here,black_comedy
just because noone else has mentioned this i suppose ill have toyou basically match the characters in the movie  shot for shot  with white russians kaluha vokda milkyoull get through about 11 in total i think  memory is a little hazy which doesnt sound too much but they do come in sudden batches for this reason large amounts of premixed white ruskies will lesson the panic drinking and mixing my exgirlfriend moaned for weeks about the effects of dried kaluha on our coffee table whats a coffefs table for anyway if its not for coffee liqueor drank by the pintive done it at least three times and it is such a local favourite im been thinking of doing something similar with millers crossing shot of irish whisky every time you see a hat fallgreat great movie has anyone here mentioned julianne moorefinal note intolerable cruelty is hugely underrated,black_comedy
the big lewbowski is an absolute riot  it is filled with slapstick comedy with bawdy overtones  there is no need to think  the film is easily digested and it is a belly buster  jeff bridges plays the dude a lebowski with charm who is a los angeles hobo  he is assaulted by thugs at the beginning of the film  his bowling buddy john goodman walter is hysterically funny  they have adventures that test the limits of humor one should sit back and relax and really enjoy the casual presentation  the drama is charming  the characters are lovable  the cinematography is excellent  even though it is a comedy it has the feel of a fantasy with episodes of cartoon like floating through the sky by our protagonist  this is a classic and should be in the dvd file of true film buffs,black_comedy

john goodman should have been nominated for his work as walter sobchak every time he delivers a line in this movie i crack upthis is the funniest movie i have ever seen ive never been more entertained by a movie in my lifejeff bridges continue to take roles that are offbeat and out of the mainstream making him one of the more appealing actors of the past 25 years his interaction with walter is perfectit never rings false or misses a beatthe movie moves under the perfect control of the coen bros i am amazed by the dialogue in this movie how it recalls earlier phrases spoken by different characters in the story amazing simply a work of comedic art from beginning to endthis movie should have been subtitled how to make a comedy by joel and ethan coen brilliant 1010,black_comedy
if you dont like bowling then you are entering a world of pain this has got to be one of the greatest comedies ever written if you watch this the first time and dont get it you probably never will this movie is like an old friend written with the assumption that you already know whats going on if you get it you really will feel like you already know whats going on john goodman gives a stellar performance as the dudes best friend they also couldnt have picked a better man than jeff bridges to portray this lazy yet likable dude the story in itself makes it an instant classic,black_comedy
never has a coen brothers film been so good and so cool all at the same time   jeff bridges is the most underrated actor of his generation and the rest is history  the coen brothers have never found it hard to create a bizarre story that doesnt seem so weird when you watch it and turn it into something promising and promising is way off when talking about   john goodman is fantastic as walter  the retired vietnam veteran that has never got over the war and is angry at every possible thing and person apart from the dude bridges and donnie played by steve buscemi they are three friends who are no hopers but live for bowling   nothing comes better not even women into their life than the bowling championship coming up but in between the times they bowl they have to go through the problems of peeing on the dudes rug a bag full of walters uncleaned undies a mistaken identity and just being the wrong place at the wrong timethe dude one day goes home to fine two men waiting for him and to put his head down the toilet  they tenement of the dude pay them money without realising that the man they actually want is another man who shares the same last name as the dude lebowski   as punishment they pee on his rug and he is most disliked to that so visits the lebowski that they were meant to find to demand another rug and ends up getting involved in more trouble than he bargained for  the real lebowski comes into trouble after the visit by the dude when he young beautiful wife bunny is kidnapped and enlists the help of the dude to be the drop off man with the money   before you know it walter gets in on the action and everything goes wrong to make this the most comical black comedy since the last one   great performances from bridges goodman buscemi and a nice and perverted cameo by john tuturoro makes this the best of all the coen brothers films,black_comedy
features one of the most convoluted plots in film history if only it mattered the greatest thing about this film is the characters that are created  the dude jeff bridges is one of the alltime great film creations walter john goodman standing in stark contrast to the dudes pacifism is similarly brilliant steve buscemi is funny in a minimalistic role as donny who is always one sentence behind everyone else the stranger sam elliott is a classic narrator completely unrelated to the plot other unnecessary characters include the unnervingly funny jesus john turturro and the painfully awkward landlord marty one of the underappreciated moments in the film is his dance routine honestly would the plot really be affected if the stranger donny jesus marty brandt or knox harrington werent in the film what about the private detective at the end or the fascist policeman the plot need not be understood to enjoy the comedy gold of this film i gave it the a ten on this websites ratings and it is my personal favorite coen brothers movie right ahead of o brother where art thou and millers crossing,black_comedy
this is an arizona update and unlike its predecessor i love itthis is your only spoiler warningunlike fight club where the narrator imagines his alter ego the narrator is in the imagination of the hero  how clever is thatwe get the prerequisite dream sequence mixed with reality  surreal fantasy is bliss in their book and mine but scott still oneups themagain the rich are the targets for our protagonists  here we have more fun than simple babysnatchingthe levels of detail this is a pardoy after all are richer this time no im not talking about writing a 69 cent check for milk  compare the concepts behind the gulf war to the objective of bowling walter was rightthe acting as usual in a coen film is a mix of stereotype and reality goodman and stormare are stereotypes  moore bridges and buscemi act  this was when the coens were reaching their creative and artistic climax  watch this with o brother to see them at their max before the intellectual collapse  how else do you explain ladykillers and intolerable  oh well it happened to coppolafinal analysis   learn from this,black_comedy
this movie made me review my opinion on comedies ive always been a fan of horror and scifi and not really been in to comedy until i met the dude walter and theodore donald karabotsos that isthe dialogue is hilarious the characters are genuine the plot is surprisingto say the least the casting superb the story is genious the soundtrack wow and bunny lebowski is pretty hotmy favourite scene is the dude and walter paying their last respects to donnie spraying his ashes in to the ocean the look on jeff bridges face when he is covered in ashes is pricelessso to sum it upto those of you lesser fortunate who hasnt seen this movie yet see itits great,black_comedy
after watching numerous times i really have had nochange of opinion between each viewing i loved it to me the biglebowski is a classic movie and one that i find myself watching overand over and never getting sick of with the coen brothers you eitherlike it or hate it theres no middle ground after asking people aboutfargo and o brother where art thou i found severalpeople who hated them all and many that loved them all as for me ilove them all and i cant wait till there next film although i realizeive given no description whatesoever of the actual movie i can say itsan epic bizarre comedy and well just a good movie like really goodone of my favorites ,black_comedy
i understand that this movie is not for everybody i had to also watch it two times before i started to like it but when you are hooked you really are hooked i cant think of a funnier movie than this the dialogues are simple but great only wish they would make a special edition dvd from this one joel and ethan coen really made their best film with this one all the characters are unique the dude is awesome played by jeff bridges simply my all time favorite movie out of ,black_comedy
is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen yet at the same time i love the movie because of its intelligent use of comedy in a situation that deserves alot the film has liberal use of the fbomb and other vulgar words and at points become over the top the film has some of the best oneliners i have ever heard that are only funny outside the movie i watched the film in complete silence only to laugh my ass off 2 hours later when thinking of the fix their cable line in the end the movie has no point and ends with nothing happening it is a series of events that accumulate into zero in the end i was dumbfounded that i had wasted 2 hours of my life on this movie only to reflect back on the time as well wasted i know that this review completely contradicts its self but so does the movie described in to i would reccomend watching this movie with others to laugh about the jokes in the near future in the end no one fcks with the jesus,black_comedy
 the 560th commentwhat else can be said ill try to dig my way out of this selfimposed predicamentfirst thing this movie is definitely multiple viewing material it grows on you and attains everincreasing heights of entertainmentrow by row it weaves a disordered tapestry upwards reaching a new incremental level with each viewingpremise a semicoherent riff on bogies the big sleep as seen through the chaotic lens of a leaf in the windthe dudepros1 casting jeff bridges steve buscemi julianne moore and john turturro are perfectly castkudos to john s lyons2 editing basic narrative sequences are beautifully intertwined with the dudes foray into his surreal inner dream world3 casting ben gazzara as jackie treehorn genius ncons1 casting john goodmanover the top2 too many fusoverkillsynopsis have a glass or two of vino rojo and watchmy misguided value is 384 stars but then again yeah well thats just like your opinion man,black_comedy
jeffery lebowski is the name his parents gave him the dude is what he calls himself  in california there are two jeffery lebowskis they arent friends they dont even know the other exists until some debt collectors mistake the dude for his name twin  that guy is rich married and the complete opposite from dude here so he has no clue whats going on  one of the collectors pees on the dudes rug that makes him mad so he and his friend walter decide that they are going to make the other jeff lebowski pay for the damages  doesnt want to but he decides he wants the dude to rescue his wife  if he does so then the dude will get his money and a new rug  i wont spoil the ending for you but it is hilarious and thought provoking,black_comedy
ive never had a roommate who didnt like  it is quite simply a perfect film to watch with friends  its funny fluffy and it goes down really well with the mindaltering substance of your choicebizarrely this nowclassic film hit the theaters like a beached whale it barely recouped its costs and was generally regarded as a lightweight followup to the coen brothers acclaimed fargo  i can see why people were disappointed actually  fargo is a tightly plotted thriller and lebowski is shamelessly meandering lunacy  but both films are masterpieces in their own wayswhats so great about this movie then  without sounding too pretentious id like to submit the theory that it captures the rhythms of modern everyday life  think about it  we all have stupid hobbies and annoying friends wed all rather get trashed than work and wed all be pretty hopeless morons if we were suddenly plunked into the middle of a tortuously complex film noir plot  thats the genius of it puts the average schmuck into a chandleresque world of intrigue and the results are hilarious in a rather strange wayi know lots of people who think this is the best comedy ever made and im almost on board with that  walter alone propels the film to greatness  but in the end is just slightly too strange for me to wholly embrace  oh its great four stars all the way kind of stuff but after i watch a deeper comedy like the odd couple i feel more fulfilled more enlightened about the human condition  after i watch i feelsillybut silly is good when youre in the mood,black_comedy
youve got to hand it to the coen brothers they certainly know how to push the right buttons at the right times when it comes to off color comedy following on the heals of the acclaimed hit fargo is cut from the same irreverent mold as its predecessor it concerns the adventures of the dude an incredibly lazy hippie bowler with no aspirations who just cant stay out of trouble as with all coen films the performances and writing are first rate especially jeff bridges as the dude and john goodman as his violently unstable bowling partner the humor is definitely not for everybody but the people who dont like it will probably steer clear anyway ill just say youll probably find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons i think we could all learn something from the dude  i learned that i really dig this movie and now i want to check out the other works in the coen brothers impressive catalog 910,black_comedy
while fargo millers crossing obrother where art thou and raising arizona not to mention all there other films are fantastic peices of work stands far higher than any other in my opinion i cant think of how many times ive watched this film but it keeps getting funnier perfect dialogue perfect casting totally coen brothers utterly amazing jeff bridges has never been better along with john goodman and steve buscemi delivering top notch perfomances any one who says is not a comedy doesnt know humer anybody can crack a fart joke but to be able to write witty clever and just down right histerical dialogue are true gods all hail the coens,black_comedy
well the film is simply quite brilliant a very clever story with some very clever twistssome of the most quotable lines to exist in a filmsome of the greatest actorssteve buscemi for example creates an astonishingly likeable and believable character with so very few lines in comparison to either goodman as walter or bridges as the dude the dialogue is quick and witty as one might expect from any coen brothers movie and arguably every line in the film is immensely funny due to the excellent writing and the excellent delivery by each of the actors if you havent see this film youre in for a treat and if you have seen this film i expect youve seen it more than once i really cant see any reason to dislike this film and would deem it one of the greatest filming achievements of our age so do see it its bloody good,black_comedy
i just bought on dvd and boy had i forgotten how hilarious it was i hadnt seen it since it was in the theatres 5 12 years ago and i had forgotten how great some of those lines were so many little details like the 69 cent check for the half and half to commiting ones ashes to the bosom of the pacific every coen brothers movie before and after this one has rocked but this one still remains the best and easily the funniest i know that the coens are fond of george clooney right now but it would great to bring back jeff bridges for another role as well as john goodman they made a great team everytime i watch this movie henceforth i will be adhering to a strict drug regimen to keep my mind limber,black_comedy
if only i could count how many times this film has been able to cheer me up i could probably only then begin to thank the coen brothers for this gem of a film  jeff bridges john goodman and john turturro fit perfectly into their characters while a stellar cast of supporting actors steve buscemi julianne moore sam elliot give quirky and hilarious performances  the script is possibly the best coen script to date  i know there was a backlash when this was first released with people looking for fargo 2 but in my opinion this is the better film ten out of ten in my opinion but for those who are offended by a few hundred curse words i suggest you steer clear of this one and renti dont knowgoldmember or something anyway see it or dont see it either way the dude will continue to abide,black_comedy
for those of us 50 year olds who were smart but had little ambition and less drive this film is about one of our own who set his goals low and achieved every one yep hes a slacker and darned good at itthis is one of my favorite movies and im not going to add to the good stuff others have said about it this is really a plea to someone in tv land to turn this movie into an episodic television series the dude as a slacker version of colombo or rockford  walter a perfect sidekick and with maude feeding them cases to solve i know someone who could help for la la lands quirky side done properly this could be a cult tv series to complement an outstanding movie,black_comedy
funniest movie everan instant classic  a clever film noir comedy best character in the movie is jesus played by john tuturo you said it man no one fs with the jesusincredibly well acted and well done  my favorite coen brothers filmdefinitely in my top 10  this movie is very funny however may not be for everyone  to those who dont like this movie i say this your not wrong walter your just an ahole,black_comedy
any film thatss chain of events are started by hired goons breaking into a tenpin bowlinwhite russian drinkin stoners house and piing on his rug well its got to be goodehthis is one of those films the more u watch it  the more u notice the little subtle humour the more u love itthis film ruined my grandmothers funeral because during the scattering of the ashes i got a flashback of a scene from this film and burst into a fit of laughter true,black_comedy
the wacky and indeed zany riposte the coens chuffed out to fargos breakthrough hit status this ended up rivalling it in critics affections giving jeff bridges his signature role this mixes bowling kidnapping of course german porn nihilism modern art and julianne moores vagina of course to make a surreal pot pourri of complete incomprehension  the film starts with a tumblin tumbleweedwell why not  a stranger turns up to dispense advice from under a stetsonokay  one character has a completely unexpected fatal heart attackfine  the dude goes into a dream sequence that makes you feel youve dropped acidwhatever  you cant argue with because its coming from a place you cant even imagine sheer class in an utterly odd way,black_comedy
jeffrey lebowski aka the dude has been confused by kidnappers as the husband of their victim who happens to have the same name and as a result hes pulled into the mess against his will to clear his name and to get to the bottom of things with the help of his slightly psychotic friend walter goodman they do their best to solve the mysterious event and it all started with a rug that tied the room togetherjeff bridges as the dude here was simply an astonishing surprise to say the least never would i have pictured him or even felt he was capable enough to pull off this quirky character hats off dude and sorry for underestimating you john goodmans performance as walter was another pleasant surprise as the hardcore vietnam vet who cannot forget his buddies that died face down in the muck theres a certain chemistry between the two that would have been all but impossible to foresee before getting started the casting crew mustve known something i didnt because it really makes the filmwhat more can be said of the coen brothers they simply know how to keep it simple yet extremely entertaining and wholly original it is a rather short film but never lets up when it comes to the laughs and the characters definitely one of my favorite comedies of all time and i know im not alone the dream sequences alone are worth the rentalif white trash vietnam vets nihilists bowling and smoking jays sounds appealing to youthen this would be a wonderful addition to your film collection no room for improvement 1010you mind if i do a jay,black_comedy
im not sure if i can add to whats already written this is just a great comedy the interactions between goodman and buscemi make it worth the price of the rental fantastic characters as usual if john turturros jesus doesnt make you laugh youre probably clinically dead,black_comedy
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen although i didnt have that opinion until after i had seen it about 4 times it took my a few viewings to really catch everything the key is that you have to watch this movie without really worrying about the plot you just have to enjoy the characters and the dialogue which in every scene without fail is as witty as any ive ever seenits the kind of movie youll memorize repeat parts of over and over and watch over and over enjoying it more each time every character in it has a unique charm and despite the fact that they are all pretty much cartoonish caricatures they all somehow have depth and the interplay among them is just priceless this is funny stuff one of the most underrated movies ever,black_comedy
as a big fan of the brothers this ranks as my second favourite coen brothers movie it is absolutely superb when i first saw it i was laughing so much that i found myself wondering just what the hell it was all about then i watched it a few more times and wondered just what the hell it was all about actually it is a very finely crafted movie even if it looks as if they were running out of film and just tied everything up in the last reel i am so glad it came out on dvd as it gives you the opportunity to pick up other bits and pieces that seem almost secondary well actually they are but who cares like in the opening scene where the dudes head is shoved down the toilet after he bashed his bowling ball against the door jam if you notice the dent left is still there all through the film its a small thing but one that make the whole movie a gem jeff bridges is the dude and a biliiant piece of acting to explain to the big labowski that she bunny kidnaped herself both goodman and stevie are perfectly cast and johnny t is just perfect as the jesus like stones any given sunday this movie bases itself in a sport for which i have no interest but boy what a movie i have to give this 9 out of 10 as it is only the coens second best movie the first is of course millers crossing,black_comedy
this is one of the funniest comedies of all time really  jeff bridges is astounding as the dude and john goodman even better as his best pal waltergreat soundtrack too just go out now and see the coen bros masterpiece that is far more entertaining than their other movies95 out of 10,black_comedy
jeff bridges is a likable actor here he gets a tailormade role the dude this film never misses a beat or sounds a wrong note from start to finish it is a hilarious journey with wonderful characters the german nihilists the eaglesloving cabbie the hispanic pedophile bowler the crippled namesake of the dude the cripples lackey and walter the cast is uniformly superb the coens know exactly what they are doing and the result is a film to savor,black_comedy
criminally underutilized and overlooked actor jeff bridges shines here as the dude in this magnificent shaggy dog tale by the talented coen brothers that improves in hilarity with every viewing  the dude is a truly inspired creation  as far from your standardissue hero as youll ever find  in fact to be blunt hes a lazy drugaddled feeble slob  but his heart is good his instincts true and his shuffling persistence in the pursuit of justice is a wonder to beholdas usual the coens regular supporting cast of loonies is perfection with costar john goodman a standout as the john miliusinspired vietnam vet with a chip on his shoulder the size of gibraltarthe plot doesnt make a heck of a lot of sense with many bizarre stops along the way weird bits of business oddball musical fantasy interludes and bursts of manic action that will most assuredly test the attention spans of the straightlaced and unimaginative  but if you loosen up and go with the flow in the laidback manner of the dude himself you could find yourself having a lot of fun,black_comedy
there are very few comedies made after 1960 that can make me chuckle much less laugh out loud but is one of them  while ive owned the dvd and have seen this film many times i was able to catch a midnight showing last week at a local art house theater and it was a hilarious experience  the high hilarity was enhanced by the crowd literally chanting the lines or that could have been the white russians we all drank were flowing as freely as water and the audiences obvious appreciation for this clever filmwhile the coen brothers deserve a lot of the credit for the direction and the brilliant script a special mention should be made regarding the performances  i would say that jeff bridges completely breaks from his regular guy type roles but lebowski is a regular guy if you are a pot smoking unambitious shlub  both bridges and john goodman turn out performances that are so colorful and hilarious that their mere presence on the screen sparks laughter  the always fantastic steve buscemi also joins goodman as a coen brothers repeat performer and carries on the typical buscemi coen brother character fate  this is a hilarious surreal and brilliant film that should not be missed especially if you are a fan of the coen brothers work  it has been criticized by die hard fans and others for not falling into their typical genre but all of the elements are the same and while for me choosing a favorite coen brothers film is like choosing which child is ones favorite it cant be done this is definitely one that i can watch repeatedly and not have it lose any of its charmshelly,black_comedy
one of the coens most inspired films this one draws on at least 3 different genres as it weaves its amusing tale of a confused attempt at blackmail that gets mucked up by the unintentional involvement of loser exactivist jeffrey lebowski bridges at his best bridges goodman and buscemi make a congenial trio seeming at home in the bowling league they seem to live for and turturro makes a surprising and memorable appearance as the jesus  the dream sequences a coen staple were never more fitting or more funny particularly when lebowski goes from his flight over la to a busby berkeleyesque production line full of viking women led by moores dominating heiress  even to its last bittersweet moments this is a memorable dark comedy that brings all the coens best elements to the fore,black_comedy
i have long been a fan of the coen brothers films and i admit i was hugely disappointed with when i first saw it in the theaters especially since it was the coens first film release since  the incredible fargo and many viewers like myself had high expectationsso i avoided viewing it again for a few years until i got the urge to complete my coen bros video collection and i hoped that with the passing of some time my opinion would change it did for the bettergranted is still no fargo and i still think granting this film a higher rating than far better coen films is awfully gratuitous but at least it can be viewed and appreciated on its own terms now instead of having the critical and commercial triumph of fargo looming overhead unlike films such as fargo barton fink or oh brother lebowski plays as a loose far less structured and meticulous affair the coen bros quirkness abounds but seems to be devised more for pure pleasure than imagery of any deeper metaphorical meaning this actually makes it unique among coen bros films because one gets the sense that they just wanted to make a straight forward for them at least comedy about a character thrusted in a weird predicament thats incongruous to his persona it does seem to play a bit forced however as if the coens felt that they needed to uphold their trademark stylizations and the dialogue does get a bit wordy and tiresome after a while it entertains on a fairly basic surface level whereas other films in the coen catalog such as barton fink have an incredible amount of depth and are far more thought provoking theres nothing cryptic or profound here the depth of the film lies in the filmmakers vision and the character development but not so in a storyline with any underlying hidden meanings or moral lessonsoverall an entertaining and engaging film but definitely not the best coen bros film nor the funniest film ever made,black_comedy
if you like quirky and john goodman then rent raising arizona insteadthe plot begins with jeff bridges character being mistaken for another man with the same name  the other mans wife apparently has a lot of outstanding debts and the ruffians who pay jeff a visit urinate on his rug before he finally convinces them hes not the rich husband theyre looking for  hes simply a bum known by everyone as the dude  the dude decides that if he simply visits the rich guy with the same name he can probably talk him into replacing his rug since technically they were supposed to have urinated on the rich guys rug instead  the rich fellow however tells the dude that his wifes been kidnapped and asks the dude to carry the ransom money to themwhy  good question and from there the story gets even more confusing and pointless  which the filmmakers freely admit  on the dvd version the filmmakers frankly state that the confusing plot takes a back seat to the quirky characters we get to meet  oh joythey even admit that when one of the actors asked what his characters motivation was or why he was even in the story  they didnt have an answer for him  they say this laughing at the viewersanyways the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that the visuals and transitions are unique and creative and that jeff bridges proves again that hes such a good actor he can even come out shining when buried under a pile of feces  his portrayal of the dude is priceless  and he doesnt dance halfbad either,black_comedy
a very very funny film  if you want some laughs i highly recommend it  please take this bit of advice dont expect everything to get tied up neatly  just enjoy the time you spend watching the film  i was very upset at the films close because of lack of closure  there is so much buildup that i expected something really grand as a climax  there isnt really a climaxunless you count the dude knocking maude up things do get basically tied up but not everything and not very satisfactorilydid i spell that right  no matter  i gave the film a 9until it ended and dropped that to a 7 due to my dissatisfaction,black_comedy
the movie is awesome  great laughs great characters all that let me also sayjohn goodman is my herobut beware  people always try to imitate lines from this film and itcan become extremely annoying  i mean you really can get sick ofit,black_comedy
possibly my favourite coen brothers film its the one where they let it all hang loose and just go for the laugh and they get it great stuff youll be quoting lines at people for months after you wont be able to help yourself,black_comedy
oh life is a blast  i really love this movie and it is just so much fun the characters are just great  a big hearty laugh and yet the movie has intelligence  and i truly think the movie is a play on detective movies jeff bridges is perfect for this role as the dude  like all coen movies this movie is just plain different  you end up spending time thinking about it latera big smile to the coen brothers  thanks guys,black_comedy
what probably happened was the coen brothers had a bunch of cool visual and story ideas they didnt know what to do with and they decided to make a movie out of these disparate elements the result is a bit of a mess you can just hear the coens saying hey what if there was this guy whos the ultimate slacker and what if there were these guys who thought they were nihilists but were just a bunch of pathetic poseurs with exaggerated german accents who played geeky german electronic music on a puny ghetto blaster what if  by this point theyre already laughing themselves silly and theyre right this stuff is very funny but it doesnt add up to anythingthis is easily their most disjointed film their only disjointed film actually and their least involving but its worth seeing once if only for the wonderfully conceived central character jeff bridges in a pitchperfect performance for steve buscemis skillful subtly hilarious puppydog performance and for moments such as the narrator saying near films end that its good to know the dudes out there a statement made humorous by the fact that the main character couldnt be less of a hero,black_comedy
i asked myself recently out of all the four hundred or so films that i own which one couldnt i live with out was the answer the coen brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to quality control everything about this film oozes class and style from the opening title sequences surreal dreamsflashbacks and some imaginitive camera work good use of colour as well check out  the bowling balls and the jesuss suit its also very very funny and the whole of the cast are at their bestyour revolution is over sirthe bums lostthe bums will always lose,black_comedy
oh so many great lines the beauty of this is in the subtleties  the dude hears something somewhere doesnt really understand what it means but uses it in conversation this aggression will not stand he gets from george bush and uses it on the parlance of our times he steals from maude and uses it on brandt and on and onfck you man you dont like my music get your own fckin cabi was in the music business brieflywas a roadie for metallicaleads sure ill just check down with the boys at the crime lab theyve got four more detectives on this case theyve got us workin in shiftswhere you goin dude home donnie phones ringin dude thank you donniewouldnt out hold much hope for the tape deck though or the creedenceits a league game smokeyi told that clown a thousand times that i dont roll on shabbas but they already posted it well they can fckin unpost itim just gonna go find a cash machinemind if i do a jaythat some kind of eastern thingze pigs en blanketsay what you will about the tenets of national socialism dude at least its an ethoshis girlfriend gave up her toe she thought we would get ze million dollars its not fair,black_comedy
this movie is the reason why movies are made  it is fun funny and yet carries a message with it of dire consequences for ones actions  though set in the time of operation desert storm the jokes punchlines anecdotes and characters are not dated one bit and neither are the reacurring references of politics lingo and expresssions like chinaman nialist johnson or dude  i never thought the word dude could be personified into so many different verbs adjectives or nouns that a simple story involving a kidnapping mixed with bowling could be so complex with so many different characters yet be so intricately structured that it is still simple to comprehend with every character uniquely created while still commanding multiple viewings  the character of the dude based on a friend of the cohen brothers is expertly played by jeff bridges as a simple stoner who loves white russians bowling and is overwhelmed by all the attention suddenly paid to his quiet existence by a chance of mistaken identity his friends are the hilarious john goodman playing a divorced converted jew who frequently references nam in inappropriate instances repeatedly asks am i wrong in an attempt to justify his actions and still acts like a soldier past him prime pulling guns and uzis out to keep the world sane  steve buschemi john tutturo and philip seymour hoffman both offer hilarious quips questions quotations and funny accents to add to the insanity add in julian moore and tara reid in early yet believable performances and a masterpiece is formed  every piece of dialogue is a quotable quote every scene is expertly woven every character is well structured and every joke is fully explored  theres no dumb pot humour here only intelligent jokes with some of the best physical abuse comedy ever set to the music of creedence clearwater bob dylans the man in me kenny rogers what condition my condition was in and the eagles hotel california in spanish this is not only the best bowling movie ever made the best cohen brother movie ever made and the best comedy ever made it is also one of the best if not the best movie ever made and it only gets better every time you watch it  the phrase may be cliched but this movie is the one that made it so and if you see one movie for the rest of your life make it this one 1110,black_comedy
i have honestly never seen a film like before  just like i have never seen a film like fargo before  both were done by the coen brothers and both were funny and strange at the same time  and both had roles in them for steve buscemi who can make a good film great a bad film good and a weird film watchablei cant say i loved this film even though im giving it an 8 out of 10 but what i can say is that i really liked it  john goodman and jeff bridges are so funny in this film  goodman has issues  thats for sure  he has many issues that he is dealing with  but instead of dealing with them like a scarred vet usually does he deals with them in anger but a funny anger if that is possible  he lashes out at his friends especially donny who just doesnt seem to say any of the right things when goodman is aroundbridges is excellent as well  his character really just wants to get through the day and bowl and not have anyone pee on his carpet  but of course none of that is going to happen in the strange world that the coens have createdwhat is not so great about this film is all the dream sequences  they are confusing and they dont hit the right note  they feel more like a nuisancebut this is a film that should be experienced  it is at least original and it is worth a few laughs,black_comedy
this movie is hilarious but its difficult to put into words there is no summary that can be made that would be less than a page the plot twists all over with subplots ranging from a soiled rug to a porn tycoon to a kidnapping case and on and on one reviewer put it the best when he called it a two hour seinfeld episode a movie about nothingaside from the ridiculously confusing plot i had to watch it 3 times before i understood it all the characters are what hold this movie together hilarious performances by john goodman john turturro and others make this well worth the headaches 910,black_comedy
some critics thought this film was for diehard coen brothers fans only fortunately im one of them so i found this hysterical  sure it meandered but that was the point  when hollywood comedies are at an alltime nadir we should be grateful for movies like this which made me laugh consistently throughout  jeff bridges was perfect and the rest of the cast was equally wonderful  one long trip but highly enjoyable,black_comedy
the coen bros have moved to the top of my list of inventive movie geniuses the characters and their dialogue makes this a classic that can be seen again and again,black_comedy
this film will always be remembered as one of the best comedies ever its so over the top one has to wonder how the coen brothers were able to fit in all of the various storylines and plot elements into a neat 98minute package this film completely changed my opinion of john goodman who i always thought would be some goofball hack for run of the mill comedies kudos to the coens this ranks as my favorite coen brothers movie until they find another way to reinvent themselves,black_comedy
theres really only one good part of but its a really good part its one of those scenes that you see in a movie and you tell your friends about it for years you constantly spout off hilarious quotes from that scene that you remember laughing so hard about you develop inside jokes about the scene with the friends who were lucky enough to be there to watch it with you and you may even begin to regularly consume certain types of alcoholic beverages that you saw enjoyed by the main characters in that scene the earthquakingly memorable scene indeed as i said before the only good scene in the entire film is the one that begins immediately after the opening credits and ends approximately 117 minute later just before the screen fades and the end credits rollnot laughing to hell with you thats funny and the movies even funnier every character in is developed perfectly to serve the purpose of the story these characters truly have personality especially the dude who the fk is this guy walter donny youre out of your league and even mr lebowskis geeky assistant brandt they may occasionally be stereotypical characters but they fit perfectly with the story augmenting it even though its already complex and interesting this movie has an excellent plot line that is punctuated with endlessly hilarious dialogue donny youre outta your element and peppered with welldeveloped and interesting characters jeff bridges delivers a spectacular performance as the dude flawlessly capturing the slacker attitude and lazy lifestyle that that character lives his love for white russians has made that drink a staple at my house and is now among my favorite alcoholic drinksyeah big accomplishment but thats the kind of thing that makes a movie like this even better as a college student i can see the difference between the slacker life that i lived in high school and the extremely busy one that i live now the dude has chosen to perpetuate that lifestyle living his life on the couch and at the bowling alley constantly dirtpoor but obviously perfectly content with himself the only time he is even the slightest bit upset is when something disrupts that lifestyle and his rug gets ruined clearly a nice rug is not something that a person in the dudes line of work ie unemployment can easily replace he is even almost completely calm when the guys break into his apartment at the beginning of the movie and doesnt really seem to be too upset until one of them ps on his rugthe interactions between the dude walter john goodman donny steve buscemi and eventually the jesus combine to make some of the most amusing moments of the film but it is enormously entertaining from beginning to end there cannot possibly be enough praise given to this movie to do it justice watch this movie you are sure to love it and if you dont watch it again because you must have missed something a true contemporary classic of modern comedy,black_comedy
after the darkly surreal snowswept landscapes of the minnesota depicted in fargo 1996 the coen brothers have wisely opted for a different locale with set in los angeles circa 1991 at the height of the persian gulf war this effort from the inventive duo is a whimsical tale about a man known as the dudejeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is a laidback kinda guy an aging hippie who spends his days drinking white russians smoking pot and bowling with his buddies one day this all changes when two thugs invade his home rough him up and urinate on his rug it seems that they have the dude confused with another lebowski a rich millionaire whose young wife owes money all over townbummed at having his prized rug ruined the dude decides to contact the other lebowski and in doing so becomes immersed in a very strange convoluted plot that involves nihilists a kidnapping busby berkley dream sequences british performance artists and bowlingsound a little strange its all par for the course with the coen brothers a clever filmmaking duo that loves tweaking existing genres to the point that they become something very different and distinctly coenesquethis includes fullyrealized characters both major and minor that have their own unique habits and mannerisms most films do not take the time to flesh out their respective worlds or the characters that live in them but this is not the case with the coenspresents a world rich in detail and atmosphere and is subsequently populated by often a humourous and sometimes bizarre collection of characters that range from an obnoxiously narcissistic bowler named jesus john turturro to walter sobchak john goodman the dudes loyal bowling buddy who just happens to be a vietnam vet with a short fusethe cast do a great job in supporting the main character played wonderfully by jeff bridges he creates mannerisms and habits that flesh out his character perfectly from the first time we see him bridges is the dude and even though he is a downandout loser there is something undeniably likable about him and this is due in large part to bridges performance from start to finish is an engaging comedy that is very entertaining and a lot of fun to watch it is a visual feast for the eyes  in particular the dudes dream sequences which are simultaneously hilarious and breathtaking this is the coens in top formmay not have the dramatic weight or substance of fargo but it has a distinctive charm uniquely its own the joy of this film is in watching all the entertaining diversions subplots and minor characters and how the dude interacts with them all you are not supposed to really care about what happens to the convoluted storyline or how it is resolved that is merely windowdressing for the coens to showcase this highly engaging world theyve created is definitely worth the trip,black_comedy
the story is hard to follow and some characters just appear for no reason but is still my favorite movie  the story makes more sense if you watch the movie ten times or so  the characters in the movie are the most entertaining i have ever seen and make the movie worth watching as much as possible  john goodmans performance alone is worth seeing the movie ten times to understand the story,black_comedy
this is probably my favorite movie for a few simple reasons  this movie is the absolute king of subtle comedy youd have to watch it a few times to understand what i am talking about  nevertheless this movie also presents an interesting story that evolves itself around some of the funniest and most interesting characters that i have seen on the big screen  thats what it should all be about,black_comedy
while some criticize the coen brothers for making lebowski i praise for they have given to me a film i can watch endlessly  i have seen the film upwards of 15 times and every single time it is hilarious  the writing is ingenious as is the twisted plot  john goodman will never have a role like this again and i feel that it is his if not also jeff bridges finest work phillip seymore hoffman never ceases to amaze me  if you havent seen this movesee it  if you dont like it than i am sorry because i will always have this movie on my shelf just waiting for a lazy day so that i can once again laugh,black_comedy
most movies have no originality  was original right down to he title  rarely have i seen movies that impact me the way this movie did  i was really impressed with every aspect of the movie  some have enjoyed fargo better then the big l but i dont think so  i know that the coen brothers set out to make a movie like no other and i feel like they have  the movie didnt make me fall off my seat with laughter until i really thought about it for several days  it took several viewings of the movie to catch everything that was going on  i had to purchase a video so i could save money at the video store  each viewing revealed yet another detail that was missed previously  its not everyday that you find a comedy that really makes you think as well as laugh  congrats to the coen brothers for making a masterpiece like my new favorite movie old being goodfellas,black_comedy
greetings again from the darkness  i have fought this for quite some time but must now give it up for the greatness that is  the coen brothers bad pub made me stay away from lebowski on its theatrical release and am just now getting around to it  what a gem truly brilliant casting and the coens now customary bizarre dialog make this one something special  who but the coens would cast steve buscemi as a former surfer or flea red hot chili peppers as a nihilist  yes we expect perfection from jeff bridges every time  here he delivers  is he a slacker or just a decent guy who doesnt wish his rug soiled  bridges perfectly captures the spirit of the dude  goodman is his usual overthetop self only moreso  his dialog seems at time pulled straight from casino if you f know what i f mean  the beautiful julianne moore seems a bit disinterested in her role until her wonderful scene for improving conception  philip seymour hoffman again shows why he is absolutely the best young character actor working today  tara reid cruel intentions and american pie has a brief yet effective role as teh trophy wife with confusing intentions  david huddleston steals his scenes for the first time since blazing saddles and coen regular john turturro is terrifically offbeat as jesus the wonder bowler  sam elliot lends a touch of class as the stranger and dont miss aimee mann til tuesday and ben gazarra  another aspect that we have come to expect in coen movies is a wonderful soundtrack  lebowski provides us with dylan and costello along with the wonderful work of carter burwell this movie begs for repeat viewings but do brace yourself for the boundary pushing,black_comedy
first time i saw it i dont think i laughed a single time  then i caught it on tv a few times bits and pieces  then i bought it   now ive seen it at the minimum 100 times and find something new every time and my gut hurts after its over  this is the funniest movie of all time  period  a scene doesnt go by where it doesnt have at least 2 levels to a joke if not 3 or 4  caddy shack fast times etc doesnt touch it  ive seen o brother several times and its great and i own it but its not the masterpiece that lebowski is  fargo  pleasewalter the dude donnie deine kabe guy brandt all of them played perfectly  its the subtle things  things like do you see a wedding ring on my finger while showing his right hand   the cop at his house casually looking at his pot in his ash tray   the dudes check for 69   on and onhey theres even a special appearance by asia carrera hehwhat you have over there is a bunch of fig eaters trying to find reverse on a soviet tank  this is not a worthy adversary  the man in the black pajamas now that was a worthy adversary whos wearing pajamas walter shut the f up donnie,black_comedy
ill try not to repeat what has been said in other reviews but this is a special movie for me  i had gone through a very painful breakup and i was utterly miserable for two months  one night i rented this movie seeing it for the second time i laughed my fool head off and things got better again  perhaps the dudes final line in the movie which i wont give away provided me with hope and perspective this is one of those rare comedies that just keeps getting funnier every time you see it  jeff bridges who is so good at intense brooding roles has unbelievable comic timing here some criticize the plot as overly meandering and it is  but the films aura is compelling and you just want to go along for the ridelike some other coen brothers films takes the archetypes of a particular genre and spins them in an utterly unique way  all of the staples of the film noir detective story are here  the la setting the kidnapping the aristocratic client the easily enraged sidekick the femme fatale the miscreants and lowlifes who impede the progress of the case etc  however the lead is not someone with  an unwavering sense of purpose as is usual but the role is instead filled by the dude quite possibly the laziest person in the world  as the expression goes hilarity ensues since this is the coen bros the humor is obviously not like most modern comedies in which vapid characters say and do stupid things in predictable ways  keeps you off balance with loads of witty dialogue plot twists and gags that absolutely blindside you  seeing will make your life better  unless of course you end up not liking the movie,black_comedy
once again the coen brothers have proven what masterful movie makers they really are  this movie is one of the funniest and most entertaining i have seen in a long time  bridges and goodman both deliver fantastic performance as a pair of whacked out losers who must try to unravel a kidnapping plot this movie had me laughing so hard i felt like my sides would split a must see for anyone who loves true comedy at its finest,black_comedy
you have to be on weed to understand this movie  seriously  and that walter character reminds me of homer simpson you just want to wring his neck  i usually dont have anything bad to say about movies but what the hell  this must be a guy thing  i am completely lost  i could think of much better ways to spend an evening  sorry,black_comedy
somehow i rest easier knowing the dude is out there takin er easy for our sins so states the mysterious cowboy narrator of thereby elevating jeff bridges character the dude into the archetypical christlike antihero of our timeschristlike but the dudes every other locution is the eff wordyes but in chaotic times like the american 1990s the forces of decency and love inevitably must be found in some pretty strange places podneris a romp whose chief goal is to make audiences laugh until they cry however along the way the great themes all are broached love death greed perfidy betrayal forgiveness courage honesty ambitioni have watched lebowski merely four times but i look forward to owning my own copy soon and watching it once a month ive already memorized sections of dialogue flaubert said madame bovarycest moi i am inclined to say the dudecest moifor those whose minds and hearts align with those of the coen brothers surely this is their crowning achievement to date no scene rings false and the parts all cohere even though one must watch the film several times before every detail falls into place this is a consummate work of picaresque art which becomes a kind of don quixote before its over utter compassion and realism underlie the delicious absurditiesye who have ears to hear listen and laugh this is as good as film gets at the turn of the millennium,black_comedy
this is a great film lots of laughs strange and interesting ideas jeff bridges has done a turn around from previous roles he is brilliant as the dude john goodman is great as the vietnam veteran even if its unreal as people say wake up people the whole film is unreal steve buscemi is his usual self great characters great funi really recommend this to anyone with a sense of humourthe soundtrack is brilliant as well go and see it,black_comedy
how could anybody compare this movie to fargo  they are completely different movies each amazing in diffrent ways  ive seen fargo over 20 times and lebowski 6 times and i still couldnt tell you which one is better but i can tell you they dont lose anything after multiple viewings  they both prove that the coen brothers may be the best moviemakers in hollywood today  lebowski is one of the few movies ive ever walked out of and wanted to walk right back in and watch it again  i recomend this movie for anyone and everyone,black_comedy
dont try to figure it out simply enjoy the ride the plot to this movie isnt even that important the way the characters react and the tone of the thing thats what draws you into this piece it is blissfully bizarre and probably belongs up there with altmans the long goodbye and polanskis chinatown as a wonderful snapshot of los angeles wrapped in a privateeye story again it isnt a riddle to be solved just movie entertainment at its best the initial mystery of this story is about as important to the final film as the initial who stole the truck business in the beginning of the usual suspects forget about it and listen to the dude spongingup vocabulary walter chastizing pascifism and poor donny always six steps behind out of his element like all the coen brothers films this one gets better with repeat viewings to catch every nuance in performance dialogue cinematography etc  jeff bridges gives his best performance since fearless  find out who has walters undies youll laugh to meet the manparts anyways,black_comedy
this movie is like a hot air balloon caught in a cyclone  it is great to watch at first  every twist and turn is a delight and offers all sorts of unsuspected surprises  you will gasp and laugh out loudand then during the last quarter of the movie it blows itself inside out and the laughs surprises and the plot just vanish into thin air  a real let down  poor and struggling beyond beliefa fantastic movie to watch with your loved one if you have no intention of watching it to the end  great for the laugh and feel good factor that leads you to the remote so you can abandon hollywood and find your own moment of truth before the movie goes pear shapedfollow my advice with this movie movie especially your timing  and you will get it all just right,black_comedy
im one of those sick people who actually didnt like fargo all that much the characters were boring the plot was uninspired and the sense of humor was irritating and pretentious i guess im the only one that doesnt think boring dialogue about ice and snow between cops at a murder scene is laughoutloud hilarious  however is ten times the movie fargo isthe characters are just great  even minor characters get special quirks that make them far more interesting than the major characters in most recent movies  and the protagonist jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges is the kind of guy who wanders down to the supermarket in his bathrobe at night to write a 69 cent check for a carton of milk  im tired of boring ridiculously onedimensional main characters who get closeups every other second while using lines like im not going back without my men  the dude is an unlikely hero if there ever was one and that is why he is a most refreshing and memorable one  theres the dudes best friend walter john goodman a wellread and impulsive vietnam vet jesus the purple clad sex offenderbowler maude lebowskijuliane moore the feminist artist who speaks of coitus and a crazed group of ideologicallyconfused nihilists among so many other great characters  the dialogue is pricelessthe plot is very unique and ridiculous but it fits the movie absolutely perfectly  the dude and walter get involved in a shady world of kidnapping  embezzlement porn reactionary cops and just about everything else when all the dude ever wanted was compensation for a rug of his that had been urinated on by confused debt collectors who were looking for a different man also named jeff lebowski there are so many great little touches in this movie  the dudes dream blackout sequences are hilarious complete with saddam hussein handing out bowling shoes and bowling combined with porn imagery  the script is very clever  and the movie as a whole is an incredible experience  the best part of is how strangely wonderful the whole thing is don t expect most moronic movie critics to understand it  in a perfect world would be in the afis top 100 instead of fargo  its the type of movie you never want to end,black_comedy
well i just saw it on cband satellitei read a lot of these reviews including ones with lots of exclamation points ones insisting its their favorite film and that if youre smart a film lover or a coen lover then you must absolutely love thisconsequently i feel compelled to say that i believe all those things to be correct in my case ive been a devotee since blood simple and i adored fargo so ive got to say that this movie absolutely sucked its wit was with an anvil so clumsy repetitive and sophomoric a few sight gags merited a slight smile but it was so bad i stopped it after one hour i was in a good mood wanting to be entertained but i felt insulted by what i perceived as a sellout to hollywood crotchexcrement humor and the humor of familiarity if you hadnt recognized turturro would that bowling bit have been funny even clever micturition indeed even the the vet and the businessman were broad 2 dimensional caricatures cartoons just so the 12 year old kids would get it with an anvil shame i respect the coens enough to believe that they know what they did here and i bet their respect for their viewing public has not benefited from the undeserved praise ive read here gene siskel saw right through this tripe,black_comedy
how could the word genius come to mind when watching this film  all you have to do is take a stupid plot and mix it with some dead beat characters that yell a whole lot  this movie should not be on the top 250 list nor anywhere close  you have to think when you finish watching this movie why is this a great film  what did i learn from this then you will understand  i laughed maybe twice during the whole movie  john goodmans characters lack of not being able to see the scale of problems is not funny at all more irritating than anything else  its hard to sit through 2 hours of listening to him spit out the genius comedy lines that people on here keep raving about  these lines are not more that phrases that literally dont make any sense and the only reason people will think they are funny or repeat them because they have no place in any movie  for instance what is the bar eats you line  now some of you can overanalyze this into making some sense but i am sure that it was written to be just another stupid line that was said with hopes of being overanalyzed into something that made sense  dont believe the reviews on this page you really shouldnt waste your time with this one  thats about all i have to say i feel i have wasted enough time on this movie already by watching it,black_comedy
heard so much about how great this movie is i kept waiting for the movie to get great kept waitingand waitingthen the movie ended im into all kinds of cult movies but not this one its not good enuf to be great not weird enough to be great not lousy enough to be great what is so outstanding a guy named the dude wow brilliant a guy drinking wowee i simply failed to see the value of this film cult or otherwise it just bored me,black_comedy
to make long story short i dont understand what really matters in this filmthe plot is rather simple a lazy jobless middleaged man living in los angels gets in trouble only because his name is identical to the another man who looks a millionaire but in fact lives by the money of the foundation that he representsthe plot may become interesting if the main characters have more concrete biography and have a will to live their life in such so that it would become better than the total wasting of timebut what the authors made of the plot is the contrary no one of the characters has a will to live otherwise that is they want to live only as lazy dogs with no positive or creative purpose their sense of justice and sense of duty is lower than average  their desire to have a lot of money without working is not motivated by any thoughtout view of the world and as a result they look very flat and boring people here the simple plot is played by very boring people and authors effort to make simple boring story look interesting resulted in an empty demonstration of cheep and disconnected images visions of daydreams of the main charactersorry but i feel no sympathy for dose lazy and healthy guys only playing but not living,black_comedy
fortunately i recorded this film off channel 4 uk so i could fast forward through all the dialogue  dont get me wrong  i like films with lots of dialogue  but in this case they were just shouting at each other ranting on about nothing much at all  lots of angst wasted over trivialitiesi was willing to be won over by a coen brothers movie  i really enjoyed fargo  but this just seems such a waste of celluloid or whatever they use for film stock these days  great performances but if i never knew it was there i wouldnt miss it  and i donti hope that makes sense  certainly doesnt,black_comedy
i had high hopes for this film however they were quickly dashed when i sat through this american drivel the humour of the film consists of stilted acting monotonous deliveries all of these are probably deliberate and presented in a blatant sarcastic way that just passes as dull its way apparently really funny to focus your main character who is a card board cut out dullard to say mind numbingly unfunny things and all the banal phrases that are considered universal language to the club of a young generation at the time the film was released the film is a testament to the recurring claim that americans dont get irony and when they try to apply it they desperately grapple at it clumsily like in this film its probably the worst attempt at a comedy ive ever had the misfortune to witness,black_comedy
45 mins into the movie  and havent even cracked a smile what a stale movie its as though they are trying so desperately to be funny and its falling flat real flat expected much more from the cast too disappointed,black_comedy
im not sure why but lately i have just been hearing reference after reference of lately not to mention my sister telling me how funny this movie is and that i should definitely watch it well my sister just handed me the movie and said she would not speak to me until i watched it some ultimatum huh well i did watch it immediatelyover all was a funny film i had more than a few good laughs i think my favorite running gag was between john goodman and steve buchemi and how john just keeps telling him to shut the f up donnie and finally his last line to him is these are bad men donnie im not sure why i found it so funny maybe it was the way it was said it just played off so well also the jesus gag the spanish bowlers were hilarious not to mention a few other scenes of the dude getting knocked outbut still im not too sure if i found this movie to be funnier than other comedies i prefer i think everyone has their different taste but my sister did say to watch it one more time so hopefully maybe ill get why this is such a great movie to others710,black_comedy
dont get why this is such a good movie just some guys bowling and one dies missing wife missing rug the end,black_comedy
a series of mundane events in the lives of some consistently lame guys extremely overratedmove on you wont miss anything,black_comedy
its a really good tricky to understand filled with hidden meaning slightly funny kinda sad psychological coen brothers piece of artthe only reason i give it an 8 is that at the end of the day its too simple when you boil all the complex stuff and once you do you will realize that you could have watched far better movesshows if you wanted to think about all the themes in the movie hell id rather watch 23 episodes of supernatural episodes rather than this and get the same thoughts and feelings but thats why i am giving it a 8 rating out of respect for the coen brothers and the people who will enjoy this stuff more than me i can easily get bored with moviesshows that have normal life representations of more complex meanings,black_comedy
it was such a funny and cringe factor film with some strong performances the dialogue for a bit indulgent in coarse language which my ears could have done without but otherwise great film,black_comedy
the big lebowskiit is odd to encounter a sketchy comic feautre by coen brothers and the exciting part is that they do pull it off not like the other genre that they are familiar with but the writing is quite powerful and funny at the same time and on terms of execution there is no doubt on that part as they score majestically on projecting the anticipated vision on screen on performance level jeff bridges is hilarious along with a great supporting cast like john goodman and julianne moore she is surprisingly funnier than any other cast member had a great potential concept that is piled upon setting the plot and characters way too much that the joke grows shallow and numb when it hits on screen no matter how much they have worked on building it up,black_comedy
for a misunderstanding a man loses his rug makes a deal to help a wealthy man in order to have it back ended up getting in more trouble that is need itthis is one of those movies that i had an enormous curiosity to see since everyone was telling me that it was good movie and a few minority telling me that is a stupid overrated one so i finally watch it and its fun thats about it i havent had this much fun watching a movie in recent yearsthe performances are all great jeff bridges sells it as the dude ii get why people like the character i love john goodman i kind of like the use of steve buscemi and the sam elliotts cameo the characters are all very likeable very distinct with their own ideals which most of them contradict themselves oddly enoughsure the plot again is very simple but not entirely predictable i was always wondering where the story was going to go we go around from one weird character to another and of course those dream sequences i had the wtf look on themi also love the scenery as someone who has lived in la this quite how it is with some fantasy touch it reminded me of other movies with more realistic approach to la like drive and nightcrawler against your la la land for exampleif its a real masterpiece or not is still something i need to analyze it for a few more time but i can finally see what drives people nuts for this movie,black_comedy
im going to say that this is the best movie ive reviewed for channel awesome month its constantly referenced by the nostalgia critic obviously and a ton of other people what makes this movie so great is that theres so much going on and yet in the end its mostly pointless actually its worse than that things are probably worse off now that donnie is dead and he even dies from something that isnt even related to the main conflict of the story but you know what we had a great time while it was going on movies like monty python and the holy grail are ultimately pointless but that doesnt mean were not entertained like mad while the movie was going this movie tells the story of a guy named lebowski or the dude who meets a rich guy also called lebowski hes and he wants the dude to rescue his wife i didnt even realize philip seymour hoffman was in this movie we have such a fantastic cast with jeff bridges john goodman steve buscemi and julianne moore this is one of the most profane movies ever made with 260 fwords although i only counted 258 i knew i lost my count a few times they even manage to play with that there are many four minute segments that feature no swearing at all to emphasis the more dramatic tone here i guess its ironic that the most beloved sports movie of all time happens to be one about bowling not much of a competitive sport its truly heartwarming when the stranger talks to us at the very end he says that even though things were mostly bad for the dude at least he can keep a positive attitude and if nothing else live the life he wants to yeah this is steve buscemis best movie i recently saw reservoir dogs and john goodmans best too ,black_comedy
watching this film i got a very strong sense that the coen brothers created a character and then everyone involved in the film found themselves falling in love with him theres so much absurdity in this film but at its heart is a character whose realness in the sense of keeping it real grounds it all so many things test the dudes commitment to his own personal ethic and in what is essentially a romp the challenge to his moral compass creates layers one cant imagine from a synopsis of the filmand its all perfectly executed jeff bridges is fantastic john goodman simultaneously aggravating and charming the dialogue so snappy and the one liners so quotable then theres the sort of soundtrack that filmmakers can assemble when theyre at the top of their game and direction that doesnt intrude except when it wants toi hadnt seen this film for years but theres so much going on im sure i could watch it again in a week and not be bored,black_comedy
intruders break into the modest los angeles apartment of jeff the dude lebowski he is roughed up money is demanded of him that he does not have his head is unceremoniously swirled in the toilet and the toughs threaten to return but they have the wrong lebowski this simple case of mistaken identity leads to a comedy of errors involving a kidnapping a milliondollar ransom jesus in a purple bowling suit a duffel bag full of dirty undies an attack ferret and even a spicy bowling themed dream sequence the dude is inept lazy and hopeless but there is a time and place for everyone he is in way over his head yet so is everyone else 20 years after its release and the film still one of my alltime favorites it was my first coen brothers film their brilliance and originality is instantly recognizable the story and characters are full of delightful depth and details the writing is witty and consistently dazzling there is never a dull moment and on top of everything it is really really funny at times i could hardly breath i was laughing so hard among such moments is the confrontation with the ferret the parking lot skirmish heart attack and the bowling rants and taunts of jesus finding balance is one thing the coen brothers excel at each character has offsetting strengths and weaknesses every setting is shown in wondrous light as well as the shadows and nothing is beyond reproach no one and nothing is put on a pedestal or trashed without a fair fight the casting of jeff bridges john goodman julianne moore steve buscemi philip seymour hoffman and john turturro is brilliant the coens have such amazing insight into the american character rich and poor country and city women and men and cultured or not they cut across boundaries religions philosophies regions and political persuasions and they do it seamlessly and randomly as a tumbling tumbleweed and as unlikely as a bowling alley prophet,black_comedy
there are films and then there is the yardstick by which all other films can be measured against the only movie i would rate 10 out of 10enough said,black_comedy
probably is the most funny movie of all time you can argue that the plot is weak that there is not much of a story going into it and there is no real ending but there is no need in thatthe complete asymmetrical built is the movies styleat the end of the day it is jeff bridges performance as the dude that makes this movie that great every scene he is in is directly becoming funny john goodmans walter is the perfect opposite as a character but also outrageously funny the story is built with delightful irregular and unanticipated scenes that cause the effect of a rare novel where you check out how many pages are left and hope they are more not less with all this bullshit happening in the life of the dude the movie describes his task to remain the coolest dude on the planet regardless of what will happenin some ways heartwarming is truly a masterpiece and one of the most underrated movies of all time,black_comedy
its hard for me to see a movie and say that its an 1010 movie i dont to me when a movie is 1010 youre saying that this movie is one of your favorites of all time and ok even though ive only seen it once is one of the best movies that i ever sawso lets talk the acting here is fantastic everyone is great the characters have this weird charisma its hard to explain but you simply care about all of them the script is super well done really for me the cohen brothers and tarantino are the best ordinarydialogueswriters out there is just fantastic how cool every single one of those lines are funny or meaningful somehowand i think that my favorite thing about the movie is this its super funny i laugh my ass of through the entire movie but is also one of those films that you can watch again and every single time it is going to have a different meaning its like a thing of the cohen brothers i guess this is the same with hail caesar and of course no country for old men is just fantastic those types of film because isnt a movie that you need to see and pay attention to the details an ordinary guy that just one to see one funny movie can watch this and just have fun but some crazy cinema fan like us can rewatch and catch all the hidden thingsthe soundtrack is terrific too in short is a classic one of the funniest movies i ever see definitely worth your time,black_comedy
if someone would ever pitch this film to me in a universe where i had not seen this film i wouldve probably thought of it like a small peculiar little film that probably wouldve had my interest but with not much more going for it never would i have conscidered a film like that be that kind of a film i would conscider one of my personal top ten favorite films of all time so what is it that makes it so lovable to be honest i didnt truly get it the first time i saw it that can be because how young i was the first time i saw it i have though grown very fond of it later on for now to be conscidered one of my all time favorites and i think it has all to do with the deliverance the acting is great the scenario is ridiculous and the plot is overly complicated yet thats the reason the film works that well i am the type of person who loves roundedness in storytelling where conflicts are resolved in a peculiar manner this film offers this in a sense yet also not at all i was very confused about the ending the first time i saw the film because there are several story lines that are never further explored as the credits roll i didnt really like this way to end the film the first time i saw it but i have realized over the time how brilliant it really is first of all because of our main character jeffrey the dude lebowski we are following his story yet as all of our stories it will include the story of others throughout the film we meet sorts of different people whom the dude has something to do with we get a glimpse of their stories but not the resolution of them this may be because its not something the dude actually cares about because the rest of those stories are not something that involves him to quote the dude quoting lenin you look for the person who will benefit and uh you know what im trying to say,black_comedy
the characters alone make this film one of the greatest ive ever seen jeff bridges and john goodman are amazing the story is timeless well told yet unimportant at the same time you can watch the whole film or pick up watching it at any point its that enjoyable please add to your list of films to watch,black_comedy
this movie was good but by no means a master piece the plot tried a bit to hard to be cleaver and the humor wasnt the best the acting was good by all involved with the exception of julian moore whos acting was sub par worth a watch but dont go in expecting too much i saw this in 2017 so maybe at the time the movie was better and doesnt hold up to more modern takes on similar story,black_comedy
john goodman and jeff bridges are an absolutely fantastic duo in however i want to talk about the direction of the coens for this film the writing also reminded me of thomas pynchons inherent vice a decent amount and i definitely mean that as a positivehowever the coen brothers direction is for me what brings the other components of the film together the films weird psychedelic scenes the slow motion bowling with john turturro and the wonderful use of space particularly with the houses of the two lebowskis all add comedic eccentric depth to an otherwise still funny movie the trip the dude takes when he lays down on his floor on his rug and starts flying is one of the psychedelic scenes that comes to mind it feels so odd but in another way entirely right john turturros jesus quintana character does not have much to him other than the beautiful slow motion bowling scene but man is that enough finally i got to thinking about the disparity of space between the two lebowski places the dudes place is relatively small but its there that we go on a trip and treehorns place but thats for another time that opens up to the whole city whereas when we are ats place the dude brandt bunny and almost anyone who enters looks small in comparison to the space of the house its an interesting dichotomy that truthfully may not mean much but its something small i guess pun intended that makes the direction of the movie more special its also just a legitimately very funny movie that really does thrive off the duo of goodman and bridges its weird and its frequently nonsensical but its still worth a watch,black_comedy
as guys weve all been through this bohemian times where we could keep the same underwear for the week and bed sheets for the month when the toilet seat could be left open and we could do whatever we wanted in the bathtub without a nagging female voice interrupting our meditation but now that we settled down its with nostalgic eyes that we remember the time we could be guys in the lousiest and laziest meaning of the world and venerate the one who made this attitude a lifestyle a state of mind a philosophy his name is jeff lebowksy aka the dude a name fittingly rhyming with attitude and hes played by the namesake bridges in the signature role his career much neededindeed who needs motives personal backgrounds goals and all that screen writing hogwash when you have an attitude the attitude makes the characters who make the film and thats the way the coen brothers have it with bizarrely overlooked at the time of its release but whose brilliance blossomed in our minds after we got rid of all our preconceived cinematic notions and started to appreciate the laziest character of la but while the californian urban landscape is integral to the films narrative i think every man in a way or another can relate to the dude starting with his appearance basically he looks like a bum with his long leonine hair his shaggy goatee his bermudas shorts flipflops and bathrobes but heres a guy who obviously is the antithesis of the metrosexual figure and thats enough a reason to love himwhat matters for the dude is to go bowling with his team walter sobchak john goodman and donnie steve buscemi and enjoying a white russian cocktail walter is a nam vet and the kind of friends that make you wish for enemies and donnie is the space filler who cant align three sentences before being told to shut the  up you think its crazy to hang out with such guys i have a friend like walter and no matter how much of a bastard he could be we forgot about it while playing pool bowling pool or poker the point is that if guys were given the opportunity they would pick fun and idleness as ways of life and if it was up to the dude there would be no plot two guys could beat and waterboard him hed let them go the minute they knew it was the wrong lebowski but one committed a mistake he peed on the rug the one that tied the room togetherthe film is set during the gulf war so when he shares his misadventure walter paraphrases bush sr and tells the dude that they crossed the line and hes entitled to demand reparation if the dude is the extreme of mens capability to live without rules walter is the total opposite and cant envision life without a sense of ethos he cant play on the shabbat day even though hes not jewish but like he says just because he divorced from his jewish wife doesnt mean he should give back the library card walter is so wrapped up in his selfrighteousness he point a gun on a player who cant admit he crossed the line that hes the one who makes the plot move forward much to the dudes annoyance goodman is the laurel to bridges hardy and you cant count how many times the dude realizes the nice mess hes been gotten into and the mess all starts with the rug situationso the dude complains to the late david huddleston a tycoon who incarnates the american capitalist dream and except for his legs lost in korea he has everything money power influence a philanthropic foundation and bunny a trophy wife played by tara reid throws the little one out of his office but the dude tells his spineless assistant played by the late philip seymour hoffman that his boss agreed to leave him a rug as compensation and as far as he was concerned all was well that ended well for the dude and he could focus on the next game with jesus quintana a hispanic bowling champ played by the coen regular tarantino quintana makes quite an impression when hes introduced but the feeling is immediately and hilariously contradicted by the little backstory detail walter providesbut we wont have much of quintana because theres more going plotwise bunny is kidnapped his worried husband hires the dude as a negotiator and maude lebowski his daughter julianne moore takes the rug back and many other things i wouldnt spoil  many critics point out the fact that theres not a real plot and it doesnt matter even the narrator mustached legend sam elliott reckoned hes lost his train of thoughts but i think theres one identifiable pattern in the characters have an attitude which means they believe in something tangible the dude believed in bowling walter in bowling and ethos donnie in his friends in principles his assistant in so its all natural that the closest to villains in the film would be nihilists its one thing to do nothing but being driven by nothing is beyond reasonand for all the mess the dude and walter go through they remains true to their nature and this contrast makes their interaction and situations so damn hilarious i understand the film needed some musical interludes to let us catch our breath one of them providing an unforgettable pov shot from within a rolling bowling ball when knocked up the dude only cares for bowling more than a game a defining metaphor for the man who slowly rolls over the lane of life the film also ends on a pure metaphor because in bowling terms is a strike,black_comedy
the main story of this film opens up with jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges having his rug urinated on the cause of this unfortunate event was a mixup by the thugs as the dude jeff lebowski shares a name with a millionaire jeff lebowski david huddleston this prompts the dude to go over to and demand compensation for the rug this leads to having the dude be his courier to deliver ransom money when his wife gets kidnapped the ransom drop goes awry when walter john goodman gets involved which lead to the whole somewhat convoluted chain of events in the rest of the filmone of the major themes of the film is the dude pacifism what makes the film interesting is that while he is a pacifist he spends the majority of the film being angry however you can always see his laidback peaceful personality underneath everything when the thugs broke into his apartment in the beginning of the movie one of them water boarded him in his own toilet however when he talks about it with walter the next day he does not even mention being water boarded hes just upset about the loss of his rug we also see this later in the film when his second rug is stolen when he meets maude julianne moore who was the person who stole the rug they have a long conversation with the rug being mentioned several times at the end of the conversation maude apologizes for having him punched in the jaw he replies oh thats fine that doesnt even when she insists he see the doctor he says thats thoughtful but he doesnt care about being beaten he just wants a rugthe editing and camera angles in the film are simple and direct with few exceptions there are no real fancy editing effects or transitions the only time there are any fancy effects in the film are in dream sequences additionally the colors of the film especially the dudes clothes are simple and muted this represents the dudes simple laidback attitude on lifeoverall is a great film the characters in the movie all have their own personality and backstory and that makes the whole film feel alive the dialog is engaging especially with everyones personality being in contrast with the dudes after seeing it for the first time this is already one of my favorite films,black_comedy
i had a professor in college that used to always tell us the world needs more bowling leagues it was a strange thing to say i thought in an intro to american politics class this professor gave us the example of when he was in graduate school he and his wife joined a bowling league in their town he said that it was a great way to meet new people whom you may have never otherwise thought of spending time with he said that our society needed to relearn those social skills after every viewing of i think back to this professors recommendation to join a bowling leaguewas always one of those films that was recommended to me to be included on my list of movies that i should see before i die while i had already seen a fair number of coen brothers films i was still a little hesitant to watch this one i finally gave it a chance one rainy afternoon i have to admit the first time i watched it i thought to myself what did i just watch i laughed a lot yes but i couldnt wrap my head around it as with many films i watch i let it simmer in my brain for a while a few months later i gave the movie a second chance this time at the end of the movie i realized that i had just seen a piece of art every subsequent viewing i find that i like it more and more in my opinion it is the best performance by jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi of their entire careers while i dont usually describe it as my alltime favorite movie i have recently been coming back to this movie when in conversations with friends about truly great movies i tell people to have patience with it dont expect to be satisfied with the endingright away at least has aged extremely well too i feel it is even better now than when it was first released in our era of instant gratification and social media we need a movie like this we need to join more bowling leagues,black_comedy
this movie is a beautiful mess first and foremost its a laugh out loud hilarious farcical comedy with an pleasantly odd sense of humor and a penchant for satire its also a crime drama with some mystery and mind bending elements the acting is great and the directing has a level of meticulousness and polish to be admiredit has a way of making a simple story needlessly complex and adds unresolved plot threads on top of unresolved plot threads with a badge of honor it even piled up so many meandering elements that its confused in itself is what america is at least if youre looking at it from the view of a coen brother,black_comedy
when this film first came out it didnt do that well at the box office and it received mixed reviews however over the years it has not only acquired a huge cult following but it has also had many books written about it analyzing the philosophy in the movie this seems a bit confusing at first sight because seems like a mediocre comedy film at first sight however is it possible that it has a deeper meaningthe movie centers around a man who calls himself the dude who is an unemployed loser who aims very low in life and doesnt do much all he wants to do in life is to continue living the way he does and to go bowling however one day when he is mistaken for a millionaire by 2 thugs he gets involved with multiple characters as it becomes possible that the quiet lifestyle he enjoys living may be overwhy does this film work so well in the first place it has a ton of scenes which could be cut from the movie that wouldnt effect its plot whatsoever examples of these scenes include the dream sequences the talk with the cop donnys death and maudes attempt to become pregnant with the dude also half of the conversations seemed to drag on very long and some of the ones which last a few minutes could be summarized in a few lines finally most of its subplots have no conclusion to them examples include the kid who stole the dudes car the dudes rug being stolen and the outcome of maudes attempt to become pregnant however the biggest unconcluded subplot in the film is the bowling tournament that was hyped up for such a long time throughout the whole movie only for the film to drop the ball and go nowhere near it while probably all other films which do this would be dismissed as pure garbage this one somehow gets away with it the question remains why is that so in burn after reading another coens brothers film its plot was sort of similar as all the buildup in the movie led to nothing however what makes this film more unique than that movie is that it didnt even have much of a buildup for its scenes in the first place most of the situations and subplots in this film stop before they even get going with them or have a chance for the film to explore those subplots most other films would get despised if they did this in fact some people do despise this as it sets them up for disappointment if they became interested in a particular subplothowever what i find so interesting about these subplots is how they tie in together with the character of the dude the dude is sort of a loser who doesnt do much with his life he has no job he always wears shabby clothing and it appears that all that matters to him in life is remaining the way he is and going bowling with his 2 bowling buddies the reason why it doesnt matter to us what happens in these situations is because it doesnt matter that much to him thats not to say that he doesnt care at all when these situations happen as he does show that he has a moral center he tries to defend himself so he doesnt get injured or killed by other people and he also shows concern when bunny lebowski gets kidnapped and is in danger of getting killed however it also seems that he just wants to live comfortably even as a lazy jobless loser and only worry about himself instead of others or what others want to do to him the film shows that he only has a moral center when something bad might happen to him or other people around him obviously he doesnt offer the world much but he also doesnt harm other people he keeps his goals and standards pretty low and he is a loser but he doesnt mind being a loser this is the thing which holds the movie togethernow that ive talked about its plot for a bit i want to briefly talk about other aspects to the story that i liked firstly the acting is pretty great jeff bridges as the dude does a great job as the leading role the dull attitude of the dude in the film is greatly represented by the dull but lovable tone of voice that jeff bridges shows also john goodman gives a great performance as walter his performance also has some of the charm that jeff bridges brought to the screen both of them carry the movie excellently as their performances help carry home what the deeper meaning of the movie is also the 2 dream sequences are highly imaginative as much as they are visually intriguing theyre my favorite part of the movie as they are creative and some of the bizarre imagery in them is actually kind of funny due to the creativity that they havein conclusion id say that this film is a masterpiece just because it has accomplished something that no other movie i can think of has accomplished in the same way as this one it tells an original story that has never been done before and its plot is filled with creativity obviously some people wont like how it doesnt conclude most of its subplots so its not for everyone but i can appreciate it for its uniqueness and creativity on top of the unique plot the acting and dream sequences are also pretty good i recommend this film to all fans of cinema if you are able to look over the fact that most of the subplots have no conclusion you are in for a fantastic experience that has never been done before also it will probably remain unique for dozens of years,black_comedy
from those that ive seen every one of the coen brothers movies has that peculiar charm offbeat characters an odd sense of humor whathaveyou and then theres a different beast entirely get a load of this thing its a mystery yarn set against the backdrop of a bowling tournament with more fwords than a whorehouse a host of whackedout characters and the protagonists are a stoner and his crazy vietnam veteran buddy its also one of the most quotable movies ever produced the magic is in the dialoguebut its one of my alltime favorite movies because of the two leads john goodman seems to exist solely to keep jeff bridges in a state of perpetual exasperation and their bickering never fails to send me into a fit of gigglesalso if i can get sam elliott to narrate my life story id call that a big bucket of win1010,black_comedy
this is a plot and dialogue that perhaps only the coen brothers could have devised im thinking less of their clarity in fargo and no country for old men than of the almost hallucinatory logic of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy only a steady hand in the midst of madness allows them to hold it all togetherthat and the delirious richness of their visual approachanyone who cares about movies must surely have heard something about the plot this is a movie that has inspired an annual convention and the church of the latterday dude its star jeff bridges has become so identified with the starring role that when he won the 2010 oscar for best actor twitterland mourned that his acceptance speech didnt begin with the dude abides these words are so emblematic that they inspired a book title the dude abides the gospel according to the coen brothers by cathleen falsani this is a serious book though far from a dreary theological work,black_comedy
starts and ends with narrative voiceover which seems to be out of place a wellmoustached stranger with a cowboy hat chronicles mysteriously and tenderly a tale for the times and tumbleweed blows through not great lonely western plains but down town los angeles yes the city of angels itself but the glitter is often substituted for the gritty in those noir detective works the texan acts as a filter he doesnt approve of the dudes profanity or laziness but then again isnt the hero of these stories supposed to be a morally ambiguous figure this is not the golden age of detective novels the coens throw bridges knee deep into this love letter of sorts to the great noirs it is set in urban california much like the big sleep but the dude is not the hardboiled detective harbouring darks thoughts and living endlessly on a cigarette he is unemployed dressed in a bathrobe instead of a trenchcoat and lives on white russians and pot there is a clever shot where he contemplates himself in the mirror of a time cover the whole narrative is set into motion not by his own motivations but by the bickering of his best friend walter john goodman plays the impulsive livewire veteran who has the ability to spin any conversation into one concerning war patriotism and freedom donnys eulogy is sorely lacking the trio lovingly frequent a bowling alley which houses an assortment of plucky figures instead of a seedy and neondefaced bar which spits out slow jazz when a gun gets pulled out or any sort of violence whatsoever the dude protests when he is confronted by the bizarre bowling rivalsex offender in jesus he has no witty comeback but manages to mumble out one of his classic lines we delve into deeper mysteries a rogue phonecall leads lebowski to the films femme fatale as he meanders up a dark alleyway she is given an apt introduction swinging wildly as she dabbles in abstract erotic art and speaks pointedly about gender truths in a british accent as tradition states they sleep together but it isnt the desperate romantic affair we expect later lebowski follows up on another lead on a welldressed and spoken millionaire that is to say he is hauled there against his will and the architecture is sleek modern intimidating the dude lounges with his white russian the coens question the genre with every turn we have strange characters like maudes sophisticated bald friend who laughs with high pitched derision but does not harbour evil plans a covert car follows him around the film and ends up being a rather nervous private investigator who is thrilled to meet another pi of such great talent and ability which speaks about his own competence the dude is bamboozled with overelaborate demands in a increasingly complex and twisted kidnapping plot and fails to complete any of them in a rare instance where he takes action the camera eagerly zooms upon a hastily written and cryptic message the coens parody a similar scene in hitchcocks north by northwest here but the dude finds not a vital clue but a crude drawing of an erection the opening credits lovingly detail the bowling alley and all its regulars to the tune of bob dylan there are other dreamlike sequences which increasingly up the chaos and in another film they might lead to some sort of bigger picture or unearth some grand conspiracy but here it just leads to more profanityladen demands for explanation they are stylised with great care and hint at the noir influence but perhaps through the lens of the dudes stoner lifestyle being crushed by a giant bowling ball which spins in a dizzying pov running raggedly in the night while being backlit by police cars and an elaborate interpretive dance number set to the counterculture tune just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in elsewhere maude romantically confronts the hero of the story by looking down at him and upside down in a moment of incompetence friends encounter a piece of culture at the dance recital but how loyal is the dude and in a scarce moment of clarity and realisation the holmes figure reveals all via a dramatic flashback which visualises the murky millionaire figure in ominous shadows and a lightning storm of course the essence of film noir is that our characters are trapped within a world of chaos and moral greys and indifference only here our hero is beyond ordinary and somehow stumbles upon the right answer despite his incompetence and laidback approach it is here that coens extract much of the humour bridges stutters his way through an explanation of why he has neither ransom nor kidnappee he crudely constructs a device to stop the frequent intrusions only to have the door open the other way and then later trips on the plank himself philip seymour hoffman is wonderful as a spineless and obedient servant who lavishes praise upon his master and echoes his sentiments in a very moderate manner a little boy is remarkably stone faced and walter who takes every transgression as an affront on himself and america overreacts in the most hilarious way and is shocked to find he has targeted the wrong car later he attempts to unveil a conspiracy but ends up dumping a disabled man onto the floor and in that climatic fight a bowling ball is substitute for a mace and donny dies of a heart attack his ashes blowing in the wind and the dudes face next week he goes bowling and forgets about the whole affair you know strikes and gutters,black_comedy
this is a movie that for me can be watched over and over and over again and still find tiny details that you never noticed before this and fargo are my favorite coen brother movies because of the environment around them affects the story now i know you can say the same thing about other coen brother film or any film for that matter but for me the snowy wasteland of fargo north dakota and the suburban by day neon by night oasis of los angeles really make the films what they are and in my perspective masterpieces jeff bridges famously plays his role to near perfection and in my opinion makes all of his other roles obsolete this means whenever i see him in another movie as a different character i only see him as the iconic role that he nailed in 1988 is my favorite movie and i recommend to anyone and everyone,black_comedy
there are many things to love about movies the smell of popcorn the taste of butter the john goodman moments and of course if you like to laugh at one deadbeat stoner who has a passion for oriental rugs and forgets to comb his hair you will love this movie it is written by the coen brothers who have wrote about a thousand great movies unfortunately they are dead now but this movie is still alive my favorite thing about this movie the reason why it gets 9 stars every single line is mildly funny of course you cannot laugh out loud at every single line but you will find yourself giggling inside every time john goodman opens his mouth god so funny watch this movie sober or notyour choice either way funny as hell at one point the dude is tripping on a illicit substanceoh my god the cinematography is amazing the viewer is experiencing a trip in someone elses perspective very novel and unique i watch this movie whenever i can with friends you should do the same ,black_comedy

it is easy to forget that is a mystery like the coen brothers previous hit fargo where fargo is dark is a parody hidden in the jokes satire idiosyncratic characters and musical numbers the story is about a hippie bum geniusly portrayed by jeff bridges who is unwittingly sucked into becoming a pawn in kidnapping and embezzling scams as the narrator the stranger sam eliot roundaboutly puts it sometimes theres a mani wont say a heero cause whats a heerobut sometimes theres a man and im talking about the dude heresometimes theres a man who wal hes the man for his timen place he fits right in thereand thats the dude in some ways a monomyth the dude takes us on an antiheros journey the dudes legal name happens to be the same as a bigwig whose trophy bride and former porn star bunny tara reed owes money to a porn producer jackie treehorn the producers goons confuse the two jeffrey lebowskis and micturate on the dudes roomtyingtogether rug this sets off a chain of events that begins with the dude seeking reparations from david huddleston on the advice of his bowling buddies walter sobchak john goodman and donny kerabatsos steve buscemi this leads into him becoming the wealthier lebowskis patsy in his plot to embezzle funds from his wifes foundation because replaces his wifes ransom money with a ringer intending to frame the dude for its loss the dude ultimately and unwittingly undermines the scheme by solving the mystery after determining that they had replaced the ringer with a ringer he further subverts by knocking up his only daughter maude julianne moore a major theme of is masculinity its stereotypes and their deconstruction analyzes his masculinity asking the dude what makes a man is it   is it being prepared to do the right thing whatever the price isnt that what makes a man to which the dude quips sure that and a pair of testicles the motif of masculine stereotypes is repeated throughout the film and each character the dude encounters on his journey is a different stereotype even caricature of manliness most of which are expertly subverted jeffrey appears wealthy and powerful but is physically confined to a wheelchair and we learn that the money belonged to his wife and is wrapped up in a charitable foundation so he actually has relatively little control his bark is significantly worse than his bite brant phillip seymour hoffman is educated with what is potentially a highpowered position yet is a sycophantic flunky you can almost see his tail tucked between his legs walter is a triggerhappy ultramilitaristic war hero stuck in the vietnam era he destroys a shiny new corvette with a baseball bat while shouting this is what you get when you f a stranger in the ass the jesus is a hypersexualized pederast who literally licks a ball during his introduction the stranger is a cowboy jackie treehorn is a wealthy pornographer surrounded by scantilyclad women karl hungusdieterlead nihilist is bunnys porn costar and his fellow nihilistspretendnappers are overthetop aggressive and obsessively attempting to castrate the dude the only two female characters are also a mishmash of stereotypes bunny is a porn star trophy wife farm girl and runaway maude is a privileged educated feminist and creator of strongly vaginal artwork she tests the dudes masculinity by saying vagina and several synonyms in an attempt to unnerve him,black_comedy
bowling mistaken identity white russians and kidnapping these are the words that describe the events in the plot of this movie its story is an unemployed bowler named jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges is one day mistaken for a billionaire also named jeffrey lebowski david huddleston his rug is ruined so he gets the help of his bowling buddies an insane vietnam veteran named walter sobchak john goodman and the dudes other friend donny kerabotsos steve buscemi to get his ruined rug back an innumerable number of subplots a boatload of swearing and some great lines are what make this film more then worthwhile this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen and everything revolves around the dude the dude is a character who has accomplished very little and does very little but he seems to have managed himself a very happy life and thats what really holds together everything as funny as it may be could have been left out but what you cant take out is the dude himself his reactions and way of doing things is what makes this worthwhile if you havent seen it then go find it somewhere and watch it,black_comedy
the story is very original and clever for this comedy and that is only a part of the good stuff that is coming from this film and on top of that the film is absolutely hilarious throughout the whole film i consider this film one of the greatest comedies of all timejeff bridges is great in this film as the dude a stoner mistaken for a rich big wig from there through the rest of the film it is hilarious throughplot development twists and ideas and if there are any refreshed and unoriginal jokes than it was used well enough to where it didnt matter and all the other jokes are original and pricelessfans of coen brothers need to see this film you cant call yourself a critic without checking out this great cult classic however this is a different film due to its originality and some people may not like it due to how different it is other wise enjoy,black_comedy
the coen brothers movies never cease to amazed me from blood simple to raising arizona these two cinematic geniuses always made me laugh and also enlightened me in any situation they put on the big screen yet even in the slightest sense sometimes their stories can be twisted but hilarious and after seeing twice on dvd i can finally sit down and write a critical review of the moviethe story takes place in los angeles in the year 1991 jeffery the dude lebowski jeff bridges is not your average movie hero in fact the narrator sam elliot tells us in the beginning of the movie that the dude is considered the laziest man in los angeles hes a loner a loser and a fan of drinking white russians the dude also has friends like his bowling buddies walter sobchak john goodman an angry vietnam veteran and donny steve bucemi an simpleton who doesnt seem to pay attention to somebodys conversations when the dude is ambushed at his home he realizes that the guys who assaulted him got the wrong man he soon finds out that theres a another man who has the same name jeffery lebowski david huddleston huddleston wants the dude to find his kidnapped wife after receiving a ransom note from the kidnappers so the dude and walter decides to bring the ransom money to the kidnappers since they were given instructions from them unfortunately this doesnt go as planned the dude and walter failed to bring the money and as a result the dude receives news that the culprits cut off her toe with evidence pending the dude decides to investigate the mystery along with walter as the story deepens into bizarre twists and turns involving a porno king ben gazzara who uses the dude to star in one of his filmsafter seeing this movie twice i started to figure out why this movie became a cult movie of its own and i think i know why most movies consists on telling stories that have a meaning to it the plot can be either straight forwarded or filled with many twists and turns there isnt really any meaning to maybe audiences are tired of seeing movies that are predictable or recycled in fact i am also one of those people who cant stand watching films that are recycled from the screenplay factory the coen brothers dont fall into that specific category these two men can write sharp and witty dialogue some might even compare this movie to quentin tarantinos pulp fiction what these two movies have in common is yes they are set in the city of angels but also to make a point the way the characters in both movies talk in such a way that its sounds screwy and also funny at the same time its rare today to see films that are dialoguedriven i know for a fact that some audience members dont like too much dialogue i can understand that statement but dialogue doesnt hurt it certainly doesntout of all of the characters that the coen brothers has written in their films i have to say that the dude is perhaps the best wellwritten character that they could come up with in many ways the dude lives by his own rules and doesnt seem to pay attention to the world around him when he has to investigates the kidnapping he does his way rather than stopping and looking over the specific details that are involved in the crime its almost as if he consumes most of the evidence through his brain and finally after so many complications he finally understands what is going on on the other hand walter is also like the dude walter is unlike the dude a vietnam veteran who doesnt like to be wrong on the things that he does yet he thinks hes being blame for the wrongdoings that he did while serving in vietnam hence his repeated line am i wrong another similarity is that he and the dude are somehow stuck in the early 90s they think they are still living in the 60s jeff bridges is wonderful as the dude he brings a lot of heart into his character he makes the dude likable because of his onscreen presence john goodman is very funny as walter the angry vietnam veteran who reluctantly agrees to help the dude with his investigation among the supporting performers are julianne moore as lebowskis daughter who specializes in pornography john turturro is also well casted as jesus the gay latino bowler who is always eyeing the dude walter and donny since they are competing him in a bowling tournament and i wouldnt want to leave out phillip seymour hoffmans and julianne moores performances those two performers did a very good job portraying their own characters with sharp writingwhat i also like about the movie is the bowling aspect this is a very good movie about bowling even though it is a not sports movie but furthermore is also an ambitious movie that tries to crammed as much as it could because they are so many things going throughout the entire movie you have a mystery a kidnapping a bowling tournament an investigation pornography a rug that the dude owns that had been peed on and german nihilists how could one movie fit all of this in well ambition is the key and so is the writing that drives this movie altogether  12 3 12 stars,black_comedy

i have to get honest with you dear reader this movie is my favorite movie of all time which has a huge influence on this reviewevery time i watch this movie by the coenbrothers i get something new out of it it is just filled with symbols hilarious thoughtful and cleverly written dialogue yeah i know there is a few swearwords now and theni love the attitude of every single character and their interaction is just wonderful also the humor in this wow i laughed by behind off more times than i can count on two hands combined with 2 feet with 1 missing toe thoughwatch this movie if you havent already it is cinematic gold though you have to be in the right mindset but once it grows on you it festers and may even turn you into a real dudeist,black_comedy
the story line is greatthis comic update of the world crystallised by raymond chandler charts the disastrous involvement of laidback dopehead jeff the dude lebowski bridges in a kidnapping case involving the wife of his millionaire namesake huddleston the dude is hired as bagman and of course finds himself increasingly at risk as he makes his way about an la populated by the rich strange and dangerous nor do his bowling buddies help donny buscemi is frankly several pins short of a strike while walter goodman a crazed irascible viet vet is so determined to stand his and the dudes ground that he causes more trouble than he solves immensely inventive and entertaining the film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of barton fink or fargo but its still a prime example of the coens effortless brand of stylistic and storytelling brilliance thanks to roger deakins gleaming camerawork tbone burnetts eclectic soundtrack selection and the coens typically pithy dialogue it looks and sounds wonderful moreover far from being shallow pastiche its actually about something what it means to be a man to be a friend and to be a hero for a particular time and place,black_comedy
what makes this an outstanding comedy the fact that you laugh louder the 4th time the 5th time you watch it its not only a comedy of punch lines when you enjoy it the 1st time then the 2nd time its not that funny cause you already know the catch its the classical style of the movies atmosphere that sets the adorable moodwhat makes it a classic the 11th time the 12th time you watch it you dont get bored perhaps you wont laugh out loud like you previously did but it still gets you in that moodin addition this comedy is sprinkled with some serious social matters read between the lines watch between the scenes,black_comedy
john goodmans character impressed me more than the dude did because he is funnier  deepfollowing the story of how a slacker and his bowling club friends fall into a parade of crime is written with humor in mind the characters are very different  genuine from each other the boldness is another thing to consider great music playing as the background score there are few moments when it comes to total laugh out the thought of these sequences will make you laugh improbable situations deliberately brought out by the characters will feed you with story narration  food for thoughtlengthening the plot a bit and shutup ending makes me feel not totally satisfied by the dude  his chums ill rate a humble 6510 for the gang and the eclectic characters music  setups very impressed as this is my first film by coen brothers steve buscemi is good while jeff bridges is cool as hellbottom line extremely funny for people who can relate moderately funny for people who enjoy logical scriptscan be watched with a typical indian family noprofanity strong  sexvulgarity mild  nudityporn critical  violence strong  gore mild  smoking strong  alcohol very critical  drugs no,black_comedy
what i think makes so great is its attitude and outlook on life and how it can easily resonate with people especially with a nonconfrontational attitude like the dude in a world where we try to overrationalize everything until we dont realize were creating an altogether new problem which is a byproduct of an already existing issue the dude makes everyone else look like a cartoon character or a caricature to quote what the cowboy said which is basically we all need a hero for its time and place or i dont know i kinda forgot what he said umm something to that effectwhat makes the movie great is you see this guy who gets placed in this sticky situation and how he gets tangled up with all these characters being the opposite with the obvious walter who happens to be his buddy to see these characters tick is just plain hilarious and what is also great is watching the dude just floating through every conversation and every conflict inadvertently making almost everyone else out to be taking themselves too seriously i did not see the point about the film the first time due to being delirious from working but upon my second viewing of the film i found it funny in a way that resonated with my outlook on lifei think we all yearn to be stoic in the same manner as the dude especially in a world in which a lot of people have their head stuck up their asses to take no bullshit without feeling the need to protect a huge ego is an attribute that everyone should try to aspire to to me is not only a great comedy but a great film that feels so human and i cannot help but smile with laughter and feel a sense of warmth from watching it when there are so many characters in movies that feel like they are from an unattainable fantasy dream we cannot help but alienated from them and to have a film like to bring these characters back down to a human level makes a movie that feels like real life and at its core is what makes this film a classic and a film that has a home in my heart forever,black_comedy
this was just unexpected such an amazing movie now why you should watch with your friendsif you expect a comedy just to laugh then you shouldnt watch this is more than that this movie talks about life about irony and simplicity through simple scenes thoughts camera takes and great act you will travel from well developed light comedy to some deep thinking about the way you face stuffthe movie is about who is the dude way of life and nothing more so lets get to itthe dude is a simple guy and was interpreted perfectly flawlessly everything he does you do with him you feel with him you think with him you can see that he is not a simple character yet you can grasp him entirely and the most important about his character is that he is believable real this put together make you feel you can be him can feel light as he does that is what this movie is about is about you going inside it and taste the ideas is about you freeing your mind and absorbing the entire set and this is also why you shouldnt watch if you just want to laughi really dont have much else to tell you i would easily spoil it all this is about the experience not about the opinions and i write reviews for you to decide if you would watch not to talk about it after the movie so buckle your belt and ride this train,black_comedy
i usually dont watch the same movie several times however is a big exception to that rule very loosely based on real people and stories this movie is full of details subtle references and jokes in fact its impossible to catch them all in just one viewing every time i watch this masterpiece i always find something new thus has the biggest rewatch value ive ever seen in a movie another astonishing thing is that almost all of the dialogue in the movie besides one sentence that was adlibbed was written in the script which is fascinating since the fword or a variation of the fword is used 292 times the word dude is used around 161 times and the dude says the word man 147 times through the movie with these two elements in mind there is no doubt that the coen brothers are absolutely marvelous screenwriters and is their best movie to dateis a movie about an everyday lazy hippielike guy named jeffrey lebowski aka the dude his misfortune starts when two thugs mistaking him for another man also named jeffrey lebowski and who is a millionaire enter his house and try to extort money from him they also pee on his rug when they eventually realise they entered the wrong house they just pick up and leave the dude furious about his rug being destroyed decides to take the whole situation to the millionaire lebowski from this moment on one complication after another erupts and the dude gets involved in all kind of activities the movies narration is very film noiresque the movie follows the dude in every scene and he serves as the audiences guide through the story as a matter of fact the movies plot and characters somewhat follow the classic novelmovie the big sleepsince the movies plot just like the one from the big sleep can get complicated from time to time one may find oneself during the first viewing in a position where trying to follow every subplot means missing the small details that make this movie so perfect not that it is wrong but in order to fully appreciate the appeal of repeated viewings are an absolute necessary especially since is ultimately a comedy and much of the humour is in the details the characters also a very strong aspect of the movie there is plenty of them and each and everyone is memorable and great like i said before the characters and some of the situations they get into are based on real life people and their stories the coen brothers met in their lifetime this unusual combination of real life absurd situations and film noir structure is what makes so unique and enjoyablereally has a cult status it is generally adored by both critics and the audience it even has its own multycity festival lebowski fest it can easily be found on most of the best comedies of all time lists it also spawned one of my favourite soundtrack albums featuring names like bob dylan kenny rogers captain beefheart and elvis costello among others speaking of music the bassist of the red hot chili peppers flea also has a role in the movie and features a fictional german electro band named autobahn which is clearly a homage to kraftwerk  i found that to be a really nice touch the only problem i have with the movie is the opening narration by sam elliott which seems too pointless and long and it never suited me besides that everything is top notch its a definite recommendation now if you would excuse me i have to go make myself a white russianrating 910 read more at httppasspopcornwordpresscom,black_comedy
joel and ethan coens is an absolute cult classic this film created the dude as one of the most iconic characters in film the slow witted carefree stoner played by jeff bridges makes for a hilarious character with biting satire and tongue and cheek humor he is also complimented with john goodmans character walter as a vietnam veteran who cant seem to not relate things to the vietnam war his cool and calm personality overshot with an immediate burst of rage conveys a contrast which is both hilarious and extremely entertaining his character is also famous for the quote shut the f up donny and am i the only one here who gives a f about the rules which resonates in pop culture references today the great soundtrack featuring famous artists such as creedence and johnny cash really emulate the context of the film and attribute to the overall mood of the oxymoron phrase chilledout mayhem however this satirical humor is not for everyone which can really take away from the film for some people overall the story is quite good and the characters are excellent the amazing surrealist dream sequences also create an atmosphere of 1970s woodstock and the generation of freelove and habitual marijuana smoking all in all this is a masterpiece and the coen brothers best film ever,black_comedy
is a laughoutloud comedy one of the alltime greats while it may not be so uproarious as other comedy classics like caddyshack or dumb  dumber one thing distinguishes it from the lot making it special its actually good its a good movie it is good in the dramatic sense that puts it in rare company with flicks such as raising arizona if there were only some link tying those twooh the coen brothers what a coincidence these fellows are unbelievable someone might consider giving these two an award or some sort of a commemorative plaque ethan and joel know their stuff watching and expecting a workable storyline or plausible happenings would be missing the point entirely the true splendor of this film lies in the viewing ebbs and flows the sweet spiritual journey endured dipping into a tranquil pool of camaraderie and tolerance while emerging a cooler wiser person is fully enriched with lifelearning moments take it from the stranger if not from me sam elliots narration is great the pacing of the film is precise the writing of dialogue and the characters themselves are stupendous the acting is first rate jeff bridges gets the role of a lifetime playing the dude john goodman is unforgettable as walter john turturro as jesus is so funny the enjoyable experience of is simply lovelytake er easy dude i know that you will,black_comedy
this is one of my favorite coen brothers film and thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish its a black comedy with humor that is clever and really works and will grab your amusement till its over and even when its over i couldnt help but think about certain scenes in this movie because of the memorable characters its a brash comedy but all the elements work well together in this because of this film jeff bridges will forever be known as the dude the dude is this really mellow and laid back guy who isnt that bright or ambitious of a person in fact he is unemployed and lazy while drinking white russian but i couldnt help but like the guy also how he deals with his surrounding and his what the heck expressions is just priceless he sort of reminded me of homer simpson from the simpsons and adds a lot of humor to this film the story is basically about a dude that gets tangled up in a situation because of a certain coincidence and becomes sort of a kidnapping investigation and the people around him constantly makes the situation worse for the guy this is a very humorous comedy with quite a bit of satire that works and has bunch of scenarios that interconnect very well near the end john goodman is also in this film and the dudes best friendwell only friend and he plays this obnoxious loosecannon type of character and he will probably forever be known for his role in this as well overall if you like coen brothers film or even a great humorous film make sure to check this one out i wanted to get myself a white russian drink after this film9510,black_comedy
directed by joel coenstarring jeff bridges john goodman and julian moorewritten by ethan and joel coendude lebowski mistaken for a millionaire lebowski seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get itbefore watching this film i knew it had somewhat of a cult following but i never really heard any real noise about it as the movie ended i knew i didnt waste my timejoel and ethan coen are great creators in the world of filmmaking ive watched no country for old men and what i took away from that film was silence is golden but this film is an entirely different animal reminds me of dazed and confused and reservoir dogs in the way that its so easy to relate to the characters that the coen brothers superbly created the writing is the strongest aspect of this picture they speak in such a down to earth tone that it seems like youre listening to one of your best friends speaking to you and it really helps the flow of the story its easy to read the characters and the atmosphere is shoved in your face but not necessarily forced its brilliant i salute the writersthe acting in this picture can be summarized with one certain namejohn goodman he stole the show period end of story whenever his character was on screen my eyes and ears were glued to him and when his character wasnt on screen i was passionately awaiting an entrance john goodmans character has patience when everybody elses blood is rushing and he believes he knows the whole story without even knowing a shred of truth he never looks back and never thinks twice he was a joy to watch and i would watch the film again just because of him moving on i had my doubts about jeff bridges at the beginning of the film i didnt think he could pull off the character i was brought in front of in the beginning but as the film went on he grew on me i was buying everything he was saying great words with such a modern tone made his character just as enjoyable as goodmansthe music in this picture met with the story at such a point i was hypnotized it had a farelly brothers edge to it at times i thought i was watching one of their films the music had such a good mood atmosphere and it leaves you so relaxed its the kind of music you would have playing if you were going on a long road trip with a few buddiesthe great lebowski was fun i cant say that about a lot of films ive seen in my life its a film thats worth a second viewing and if you havent seen this film i strongly recommend you give it a look,black_comedy

is a comedy written and directed by joel and ethan coen jeff bridges stars as jeff lebowski an unemployed los angeles slacker and avid bowler who is referred to as the dude after a case of mistaken identity the dude is introduced to a millionaire also named jeffrey lebowski when the millionaire lebowskis trophy wife is later kidnapped he commissions the dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release the plan goes awry when the dudes friend walter sobchak schemes to keep the full ransomjohn goodmansteve buscemi philip seymour hoffman david huddleston julianne moore tara reid and john turturro costar to play key supporting rolesit is loosely based on raymond chandlers novel the big sleeptypically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the coen brothers brought to life with strong performances from goodman and bridges after the tight plotting and quirky intensity of fargo this casually amusing followup from the prolifically inventive coen brothers seems like a bit of a lark the plotwhich finds lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after hes mistaken for a rich guy with the same name is almost beside the point what counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue great work from coen regulars john goodman and steve buscemi and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the coens in a class all their own the result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involvedit was enormously entertaining,black_comedy
nah seriously its a masterpiece of its won but its a cohen brothers movie so you know what to expect you know its not at the level of the godfather but it has this special something that i cant describeahhh these cohen brothers you gotta love their style is the perfect 90s film that capitalizes all the distinctive elements of the aforementioned decade cultural change not conventional characters and the strangest situations that could happen to any average joethe dude is a character fell from heaven we all have a little of him inside his random way of living and dialogs make him a very interesting character that defines that in the 90s many persons were peculiarjames woods delivers a hilarious performance the man is out of his mind the antisemite oriented dialogs were very very funnyi cant praise this movie enough because it never gets old i can watch it any time of the year and it feels fresh its not a comedy but its not a drama it surely isnt pretentious just take the movie for what it is a movie made for persons who dont give a damn but at the same time take life for what it is,black_comedy
is a unique comedy from the coen brothers it is about a man called dude or the dude whose life is a complete train wreck his actual name is jeff lebowski and the narrator calls him the laziest man in los angeles county consequences ensue when dude is mistaken for a very rich man with the same name written and directed by ethan and joel cohen jeff bridges leads the cast which also includes john goodman as walter julianne moore as maude and steve buscemi as donny the dudes favorite pastimes are bowling with walter and donny and smoking pot the two main themes in this movie are mans existential struggle and abuse and mistreatment of one generation to the next especially the 50s to the 80s take the bowling for instance bowling is respected in this movie and several of the dream sequences involve the characters at the bowling alley anyone can go play bowling pretty cheaply but its a professional sport it is also an older expression of fun all generations enjoy bowling its unifying the dude is symbolic of the 60s hippie happy peaceful pacifist stereotype in the end he didnt accomplish much walter finds offense in almost everything but claims not to worry about anything and takes every opportunity to remind anyone listening that he is a vet walter and the dude are polar opposites yet turn out to be best friends they must not have known each other in the 60s the duo sets out on many a missions throughout the film but never end up with any results walters constant interruptions and donny never getting to speak and the dudes struggle to explain most of his situations when only a few words would do become a running gag throughout the film some see it as a indictment of 60s counterculture if instead of screaming about what they didnt want they had articulated what they did want perhaps they would have achieved more for some the 60s revolutionaries are looked upon as the centurys losers donnys name is reminiscent of the 70s due to a famous brother and sister duo he is constantly being interrupted yelled at and ignored by walter and the dude he is shy bland a tagalong and just a step behind he admires walter and the dude but doesnt have the same moxy this contributes to his fearinduced death donny is the only one of the three that actually bowls the dude never touches a ball and walter picks one up for another scene but does not bowl with it a generation lost and ignored jesus john turturro represents the flipside of the 70s a possible pedophile clad in a purple jumpsuit he is sexually aggressive colorful loud but ultimately all posturing and no actionsimilar movies would include raising arizona the big sleep blood simple barton fink fargo the long goodbye millers crossing punchdrunk love trees lounge and rob roy many techniques were used in this film especially in the dream scenes the lighting the angles were perfect it was so original and fun these scenes were vital to the themes message and they way they shot them was perfect this is one of those movies you love or hate you either get it or you dont the first viewing is so unique and for me it took multiple viewings and a deep love for the film to really fully understand and appreciate it the themes are relevant and the coens are geniuses,black_comedy
once again the coens go and make an original picture that is hard to match anywhere else in entertainment speaking honestly as far the story goes is to movies the way alice in wonderland is to books it is really like no other movie that i have seen before true it does seem to go all over the place but in the end there are no loose ends that are left untied an achievement that you dont see much in the mainstream due to the fact that they hope to make a sequelafter watching and laughing within the first five minutes of the film i had to pause it every now and then to control myself before continuing theres so much in this film to love that it is no surprise that film has gained a cult following what i personally love about this film is how the coens picked actors that actually looked like someone that you would find walking down the street or inhabiting the suburbs of america jeff bridges just nails his famous role as the dude and is part of the reason i think people like this film the entire film is pretty much about an average guy thrust into this random stream of events and hes still trying to figure out what the hell is going onif you havent seen it watch it now,black_comedy
this movie is a cinematic masterpiece it is excellent in all facets of the production jeff bridge and john goodman are absolutely wonderful in this offbeat yet engaging story about a man who is caught up in a case of mistaken identity however the actor who deserves special praise is david huddleston who gives one of the more memorable performances as the guy who causes all the problems in addition to the excellent cinematography this movie is a tribute to the bowling alley and perhaps to all the humdrum places that we often take for granted after all how often has a bowling alley been used as a setting for comedy or drama yet in this movie that concept works after all where else would you expect to find a dude who likes creedence clearwater revival and drives a beat up car julianne moore is great too in this movie as is the rest of the cast this movie is a definite must watch for everyone who likes high quality entertainment,black_comedy
there have been a few movies over time which have portrayed private eye characters that are quirky or losers or both  but this one takes that concept out into left field and then keeps going into some completely unexplored area way beyond left fieldjeff bridges the dude and john goodman are particularly brilliant in their roles of bowling buddies setting out to unsnarl a kidnapping fiasco goodman is well known for his comic talents but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest i laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in than i have in a long time during a moviethere are bizarre circumstances absurd conversations acid flashbacks and entire characters that you may decide arent really there i anticipated the punch line in the strange little funeral that jeff and john held for their friend and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived i had somehow missed this movie for quite some time so i am certainly glad i finally watched it if you are a fan of offbeat irreverent comedies and havent caught this yet this time is nigh warning after this movie you may experience strange subconscious desires to drink white russians and go bowling,black_comedy
beautifulmy favorite moviethis film is an ode to a dudist way of lifea story about deception and con seen through eyes of an pacifist one of the funniest and coolest movie everincredible dialogeven better charactersevery line in a movie is an instant everyday quote career high performances for jeff bridges and john goodman bridges will never be able to shake of this powerful performance or kick of the nickname the dude in my opinion this is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you cant see thatgo bowling grab a white russian or what ever your drink isand search for your innerdudeto take it easy for all us sinners,black_comedy
ill admit i am a big fan of this film ive loved it since i first saw it on a grainy rental video back in 2000 to me the coen brothers have made two outstanding films this one and fargo 1996 and yes i know there will be some disagreement out there about that but its only my opinion now before i tell you why i think this is such a great film heres a little bit about the plotjeffrey lebowski aka the dude is disturbed one evening when two heavies break into his house and demand money that his wife owes their boss one of them urinates on his rug before they realise they have the wrong lebowski this one isnt even married the next day the dude complains about this to his bowling buddies walter sobchak and donny kerabatsos they figure out its a case of mistaken identity and the dude goes to see the man they really wanted another jeffrey lebowski  who happens to be a millionaire leaving with a replacement rug the dude meets the young trophy wife bunny lebowski a few days later he is contacted by mr lebowskis assistant brandt because bunny has been kidnapped and they want the dude to act as the bag man i wont say any more but thats basically the setup throw ins artist daughter maude from a previous marriage and some crazy german nihilists and you can see theres plenty to keep the audience amused and entertainedthis is an exceptionally well made film with a great cast a great score and some really different and enthralling dream sequences thrown in to me its almost the perfect movie i say almost because i like to leave a little margin for improvement great performances all round from jeff bridges as jeffrey lebowski  the dude john goodman as walter sobchak julianne moore as maude lebowski steve buscemi as donny kerabatsos david huddleston as jeffrey lebowski  philip seymour hoffman as brandt and tara reid as bunny lebowski oh and i almost forgot a stellar performance by john turturro as jesus quintanaas ive already said this is to me almost the perfect movie i say that because i can only find one scene that doesnt add anything substantial to the story its the one where the dude confronts the guy in the vw beetle for those that have seen it apart from that an almost perfect movie very highly recommendedmy score 9310,black_comedy
im not sure what to think about this movie the movie is at times funny very funny intelligent artistic but at other times it is simply flawed annoying silly  stupid the main character is an interesting character i liked the dude his friend walter must be the most annoying film character ive ever seen but he serves his purpose but then again you got buchemis role he just pops up now and then never really contributes the story was good the dudes struggle was funny but it just kinda ends up with nothing i dont know some call it the 2001 of bowling and weed smokers fair enough it has a few clever trippy moments but i dont know it lacks structure i give it a 710,black_comedy
now it was sometime in the year 1997 after the powers that be at the academy of motion pictures and science had decided to give a whole lot of recognition and awards to a film called fargo that a couple of boys named joel and ethan though the most common nomenclature simply called them the coen brothers were thinking of making their next film now joel and ethan knew they had done well with their last film that aforementioned fargo and they thought that their next film should be big a big film a film so big that it might as well have the word big in the title and they  and were talking about the coen brothers here  well they just so happened to come up with such a motion picture a picture which managed to be big as well as managing to be well outside of any range of conventional expectations and that very motion picture happened to be one now known asor something like that in fact the coens have true to form resisted discussing the inspiration for or meaning of what can still be considered one of their wildest strangest and most inspired works of cinematic genius in as adamant and heated terms as the debates speculating on the films true meaning or purpose but part of the genius of the film is that whether regarded as a caustic political allegory it is worth paying attention to the brief snippets of early 1990s american political news shown and referred to regardless a loving and witty send up of all the conventions of a pulp raymond chandler style film noir detective story with a knowingly incomprehensible convoluted plot or simply a remarkably strange comedy the film works for whatever reason the precise cocktail a cinematic white russian perchance of absurdly quotable dialogue inspired and memorable character bits bizarre dream sequences slow motion musical interludes and occasional dashes of selfreflexive profundity all fused together by the impeccable technical double act of roger deakins sumptuous cinematography and carter burwells obtrusively resonant music makes for a work of strange clunky madness and perfection which never quite manages to do what is expected of it or hit a wrong note no matter what inferences or expectations the viewer brings to the tablebut the films true genius lies in the fact that despite its guided bizarreness baiting analysis the most gleefully likely point is that the film like the ongoing injoke of its nihilist antagonists is ultimately not about anything the entire enterprise can be seen as an extensive exercise in talking a lot but ultimately saying nothing much like sam elliotts mysterious strangers priceless rambling of a narration one almost dares to believe that the coens true joke is all of the speculation controversy debates over the film and religions derived from it being ultimately unwarranted as the film was crafted with no such motivations or ultimately any motivations at all and ultimately perhaps the most poignant point that can be extracted from the film is that it doesnt need a point as entertaining as it can be to try to impose meaning on the strange and hilarious string of events passed off as a narrative the film functions beautifully simply as a chance to hang out with some lovable hilarious and very memorable characters to experience the thrill of a mystery haphazardly investigated with the viewer continually left as befuddled as the characters to listen to some great music and to ultimately learn much like the dude to simply accept the absurdity of it all and simply exist and try to get through and again whether such an absence of point is truly the most satisfying explanation of the film remains a moot point  no matter what lens the film is examined through it has never been so enjoyable to enter the gleefully odd remarkably stylized world of the coen brothers and simply existbut the films true joy lies in its collection of eccentric characters and equally offthewall performances jeff bridges has never been better inhabiting the laid back drugged up and haphazardly heroic role of the dude with an uncanny ease and magnificent comedic timing  a perpetually watchable triumph of characterization consistent scenestealer john goodman is equally priceless as fauxjewish ragefilled vietnam veteran walter sobchak a bellowing stubbornly illogical yet strangely lovable satire of the crass yet well intentioned western stereotype julianne moore similarly generates a performance which is outlandish flat out hilarious and hits perhaps a little too close to home as an absurdist feminist visual artist david huddleston rants raves screeches and bellows to sublime comedic effect as the titular industrialist and steve buscemi transforms clueless yet lovable into a work of art as the continually out of his element donny but sheer magic can be found just as much in the supporting cast with philip seymour hoffman as obsessively prissy personal assistant brandt john turturro as grotesque purple spandexclad gyrating former pedophile bowler jesus quintana peter stormare as a deadpan nihilist porn star and tara reid as the compulsively greedy and promiscuous bunny lebowski along with the innumerable supporting bit parts each demonstrating exquisitely inventive and staggeringly funny characterizations all excelling during their respective moments to shinewithout question the film will not prove fitting for all tastes and complaints have been raised of its being selfindulgently alienating and strange overlong and aimlessly rambling yet for those generally attuned to the coens incomparably oddball frequency proves about as inventive fresh compelling and insanely comical as well as potentially thematically provocative as a film can get and even the articulated complaints against it somehow manage to work more in its favour than detrimentally one of the few films which visibly improves from an already high standard upon each viewing remains a cinematic comedy masterpiece and yes the dude

have you ever been told a story before that was so out there and funny that you couldnt help but laugh however when it was all over you stopped to reflect on the movie that you just saw and realized you had no idea what you just saw this movie is the story of jeffrey lebowski and his run in with jeffrey lebowski in a variety of plot twists and turns with fake kidnappings and a pornographic producer looking for his payday somehow unfolded in it all is a movie mostly considered to have darker films the cohen brothers take a swing at humor even though they very much succeed it all goes back to how much this movie makes no sense and goes nowhere with their more serious movies they have first and second acts with conclusions and all with things just sort of happen and then nothing at all by watching the movie you get embraced into their world as if going on a vacation you go there and then you leave  you might have some fun and some laughs and you might not whether your experience is good or bad however the discussions to follow the film will be anything but boring even if you didnt like the movie at all the quotes you will be saying in the months to come will be ever lasting and unforgettable and just like the film what really happened in this review,black_comedy

that game in which you throw a huge ball at an arrangement of wooden pins trying to pull them all down and stay suffering the suspense of watching the ball trajectory along the alley till the end in slow motion camera is much more thrilling where it can pull them all down or fail some or most of them showing that at bowling like in life you are a loser this movie strikes a certain parallel between bowling and real life being the story of the misadventures of jeffrey lebowski and jeff bridges performs a good role at it caused by the fact that he has got the same name as a famous wealthy man which gets him into a lot of trouble narrated in a series of tragicomic episodes along with his two bowling pals one of them pretending to be a very smart guy but who only brings more trouble to our lebowski man some of these episodes are funny indeed and are the best part of the movie since the story itself isnt worth much some others are not so funny including the one of an unnecessary death because death is rarely funny the dialogues could be funnier if they didnt abuse of a wellknown obscene four letter word which is repeated about three times in every five word sentence i am no moralist at all but never could find any humour or aesthetic value in four letter words i neither condemn nor approve of them they just dont make me vibrate at all leaving me totally indifferent they are only necessary in a work of art when they serve the purpose of defining someones character is that the case here in conclusion we can say that its a lukewarm comedy lacking vibration,black_comedy
just might be the funniest movie i have ever seen i think i have seen it at least ten times and it never gets old to me i also love all of the characters in this movie you have the veitnam vet the suirely annoying guy and the dude jeff bridges is the perfect actor for this role this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh every single time you watch it the coen brothers did a fine job on making the characters in this movie really come to life the story is good and crazy the dialogue is hilarious the soundtrack awesome all the characters are amazing the coen brothers truly executed another masterpiece i recommend renting this movie buying this movie or getting your hands on it because you will not stop laughing and you will love it i hope that my comment on this movie will convince you to go and watch this hilarious movie,black_comedy
the coen bros are great filmmakersafter fargois the best movie made by themthe best thing about this movieis that its unpredictableyou dont know whats gonna happen in the next scenejeff bridges and john goodman bring excellent performancesthe film is very well written and it has excellent dialogsis a very funny comedyis a fun and great movie made by two brilliant filmmakersi recommend it with a lot of enthusiasma real mustseei write this last sentence since imdb does not allow me to write 9 lines but 10rating9,black_comedy
the coen brothers indulge us into the lives of the seemingly humdrum yet intricately fascinating lives of 70s enthusiast jeff the dude lebowski and his vietnamscarred sociopathic friend walter sobchak there is no point there is a very complicated and in the end quite anticlimactic story what there is however is more inventive charm than a circus show put on by david lynch not to mention loads and loads and loads of laughs i loved it and so will youjeff bridges plays the dude or his dudeness or el duderino if youre not into the whole brevity thing we are treated at first to the site of our protagonist being given a rather unpleasant gift by two goons sent to recover some sort of payment as it turns out they have the wrong man soon the dude finds himself entangled in a web of lies as he attempts to find out who the money came from and why they owe it there are many plot twists along the way which i wont ruin although its futile to think this film is about plotthis is perhaps the coen brothers most creative work to date even their wildly abnormal works like raising arizona have been matched for delightful weirdness in the form of the dudes various tripout dream sequences this being a coens film there is no such thing as a small part check out john turturros wild cameo as malodorous paedophilecum bowling deity jesus quintana or sam elliot as the films bookending cowboy narrator he sums the film up brilliantly two minutes in when as our narrator he says maybe i just lost my trail of thought maybeafter viewing i was convinced that jeff bridges sole existence on earth was to play the dude he is just perfect as the man who seems to get through all the destruction in his life with an apathetic retort of dowdyhippydom in a demented way its what makes him so tranquilly admirable john goodman matches the dudes bathos with psychotic blunder and steve buscemis donnie is a rare buscemi treat of cluelessnessdespite its convolutions never feels unrewarding in its rubikscube plotting whereas earlier works like the ambitious millers crossing 1992 were flawed on basic storytelling levels here we are treated to the demented worlds first and story second the denouement is somewhat of an anticlimax but by that point you are so far into the world of deadbeat optimism that you wont be disappointed in fact the indifference to its own crescendo makes for a very fitting finale in the end its not the destination the counts its the ride and what a ride i dont think joel and ethan have written a script with better lines nor do i think theyve ever had a better cast this is a film without meaning but loads of heart and white russians too,black_comedy
hey i just rented this movie as it was a coens movie but i must say i never felt attracted to the story the looks or the first impression the movie made on me i had to start it 4 times and by the 4th time i got over the first 5 minutes  and boy was i hooked  this is definitely one of the best of the coen bros with a magnificent performance of jeff bridges i think his best  but also turturro goodman and moore are a delight to see the story unfolds in several layers and gets more interesting as the movie progresses but its mostly the types that are put down which are hilarious but still recognizable i recommend this for any night for a movielover ,black_comedy
didnt get it the first time i saw it on christmas evebummed out by myselfthen i watched it again right afterincredible this is the best cohen bros film yetand gets better each timeeven bought the book about the making of it which shows storyboards etc this movie is not to be missedone of my all time favoritesand ive seen a lot of moviescheck it outyoull thank meit rox enjoy if you like itcheck out the making of book this film has all of the regular cohen actorsjeff bridges is amazing and the xtras on the dvd are well worth itesp the part about sam elliott having no idea why he was even hired to show up for his partanywaygreat soundtrackand great actorsthe shooting is so amazingsets the scenes perfectlyawesome,black_comedy
joel and ethan coen can be proud of their big lebowski be ready to laugh your butt off jeff lebowskijeff bridgesis a pot bellied potsmoking laid back slacker that insists on being called the dude his two best friends are walterjohn goodman who sees the world against him for surviving the viet nam war and donnysteve buscemi who manages to buttin on conversations only to be ignored dudes world consists of bowling and getting stoned somehow dude is mistaken for a wheelchaired millionaire david huddlestonand is caught up in a kidnapping scam for the ransom dude seems more upset with getting restitution for his urine ruined rug dude of course needs the aid of his two foulmouthed bowling friends also fitting into this amusing plot are julianne moore as maude the erotic artist john turturro as a hairnetted latino bowler named jesus and tara reid as sexpot bunny lebowski rounding out this diverse cast of characters are philip seymour huffman ben gazzara flea and sam elliott who also narrates the dialog seems glued together with the f wordwhich of course is a noun verb and adjective it seems one toke over the line is not enough cheers for the coen brothers,black_comedy
this is one of the best coen brothers movies and my favorite from them what is so great about this is how the dude jeff bridges gets involved in a series of events that he never really asked to be a part of bridges is excellent as the dude this is one of his best performances i have ever seen the supporting cast is great with john goodman no oscar nod steve buscemi john turturro always great sam elliot pete stromare julianne moore philip seymour hoffman and david huddleston the movie features the usual coen brothers soundtrack great hilarious dialog and great camera shots especially the open sequences up through the opening credits the funniest part for me was the funeral at the end not to spoil anything this movie is highly recommended for coen brothers fans and fans of great comedy,black_comedy
another coen classic i dare say certainly one of the weirdest coen films in my book jeff bridges delivers a brilliant performance as the dude but not only he also john goodman as walter is unbelievably good theres not one character that feels miscast or out of place not even the german nihilists and then there is jesus when you think it cant get any weirder unless you go see fear and loathing in las vegas wait until jesus starts to bowl now you may not like bowling but thats of no consequence because new things will come to light when you keep watching things like beverages of a certain kind rugs toes scribbled notes car stolen car found a baseball bat money lost the eagles thorough doctors sex not necessarily in that orderthe dream sequences are yet another part of this movie which in itself would be totally cheesy and boring for anyone to watch but this time around its the dude and you fly along with him no questions askedone cannot help but wonder though how the dude makes a living besides playing courier for ransom money maybe he acts as a jury for his landlords dancing performances who knows its beside the point the dude does what the dude does nothing but that he does exceedingly well810,black_comedy
this movie seems to be a raymond chandler type gumshoe film noir story except the philip marlow protagonist is substituted for the dude while philip marlow is a suave yet tough private dick who wears a suit the dude is 40 year old stoner who likes to bowl and wears mostly boxer shorts and a robe also pays for items costing less than 1 dollar with a check the story starts out with two henchmen breaking into the dudes house mistaking him for a man with a similar name to collect a debt figuring out they had sought the wrong lebowski they leave a little reminder of the break in namely they piss on his carpet which held the room together from here the movie takes some unexpectedly wild yet quite comical turns the dude is usually surrounded by his buddies walter and donny walter is a slightly unstable jewish converted exvietnam veteran while donny is the proverbial 3rd wheel this movie is just pure fun i could not stop laughing the whole movie the situations are just wild and the dudes dealing with them is even better i recommend watching this movie with friends and with lots of kahlua vodka and milk on hand ahhhhh those white russians,black_comedy
little needs to be said about the film  it has one of the greatest cult followings ive ever seen and the movie is chock full of oneliners  the cohen brothers are able to deliver yet again with a great piece of americana twisted around a wonderful comedy  the dude jeff lebowski played by jeff bridges is your average unemployed stoner whose number one hobby is bowling  his friends and teammates are walter sobchak john goodman a vietnam veteran and donny steve buscemi who is never allowed to get more than a few words inthe dude becomes involved first with a vandalism at his apartment then later tangled in a web of robbery extortion kidnapping and pornography the film provides good mystery and thriller vibes along with the mounds and mounds of comedic momentsthis is a movie i recommend everyone see as long as they can handle the f bomb being dropped a momentous 281 times8 out of 10,black_comedy
this film is one of those little gems that on the very odd occasion will come along to remind us that film can be quirky intelligent and off the wall without turning into pretentious art house rubbishtop quality writing and direction really gets the best out of an already great cast brilliant sub plots all interweave to create a wonderfully oddball world which is close enough to ours that we can still relate to the characters thus drawing us into the film and entertaining us at the same time the dude iswell a dude white russians are officially the coolest drink 810,black_comedy
ive read the reviews and am convinced many of these people havent actually seen this movie  finally we get the answers to all the really important questions in a package that is just outrageous enough to be proof of the coen genius the truly devoted have come to love spoilers coming minor compared to above what happened to hippie activists from the 60s  why they end up burned out over weight unemployed and spend their time bowling  when they cant bowl they listen to bowling on tape  wow the rewards of fighting the good fight are rich indeed what happened to viet nam vets who didnt have ptsd and werent consumed by the system when they came home  they convert to judaism level the world and all its rationality with their overblown opinions and reactionary jargon and go bowling what happened to surfers from the 60s  they become meek voiceless irrelevant punching bags for the oafish viet nam vets and go bowling ah life is good i can rest at night this movie is so genius to call it genius might be an insult to the movie i think john goodmans character should have said that in the movie  the coen brothers show their mastery of dialog once again  also they have gifted us with a movie that opens up the lives of the truly average and makes them interesting enough that we cant look away just see blood simple raising arizona fargo and the man who wasnt there if you want proof they can do this over and over  the coen touches that make this movie genius include the pointless sam elliot narration donnie the doormat the nihlists the total inability of the characters to correctly identify a four legged animal the omnipresent white russian smoking a j in a strangers house without permission as though it were considered good etiquette dream sequences that rival madonna videos a naked lady suspended from the ceiling painting her masterpiece the car that wouldnt die until it did a photo of the dust bowl that is supposed to make a porno star homesick and the winner of the genius touches in a coen brothers film a famous television writer in his own livingroom in an iron lung in the 90s  wow you couldnt find all these amazing things in 1000 movies combined and joel and ethan give them to us in one rousingly laid back adventure  thank you and hats off to the brothers ill keep on watching and keep on enjoying this one for years,black_comedy
spoiler maybedudeattention all realists  ok if i dont have your attention whatever but those reading let me tell youthis movie is more like a journey  it is a journey of a man practicing simplicity  jeff bridges as the dude portrays a lifestyle completely opposite of the rich and famous  his manners are laid back and life is cruisin by like the bowling balls down the lane  the dude is an avid bowler who likes to burn and drink  his best friend john goodman walter is another storywalter is the dudes bowling buddy and is also vietnam veteran he contsantly links everything to the war  he has zero impulse control and can only be finessed by the dude  basically if there is a situation that can go bad walter is diggin the hole quickwatch the movie if you have not already done so you will not be let down unless you have a sense of humor that is narrow and warpedhave a great daythese two men have collaberatively created a brilliant film,black_comedy
i loved this moviethe offbeat humor the oddball characters the dream sequences and the intermittent philosophical musings of the mysterious stranger sam elliot all worked together to make a thoroughly enjoyable moviewhile i didnt get fargo the coen brothers crafted a movie here that i wish id made myself its really a gem,black_comedy
this movie is funny sober and hysterical otherwise  john goodman is fabulous as well as the rest of the cast  there are a couple of scenes that youll even find yourself repeating similar to officespace  this flick is a definite must see with your buddies on a wasted evening,black_comedy
my rating 14 out of  i consider myself a fan of the coen brothers i loved both fargo and raising arizona i found to be entertaining but it had a convoluted storyline does this make it a bad movie absolutely not and this is because of the wonderful dialogue the coen brothers have provided for usthe acting is one of the strengths jeff bridges is absolutely perfect as the dude john goodman is hilarious as walter steve buscemi really doesnt do much except get insulted by john goodman julianne moore takes a different kind of role and does well to enjoy you must do one thing forget the plot you will hate the movie if you try to figure out the plot it is a mess of a plot at one point it gets incoherent but that scene is one of the best in the filmis not a masterpiece in fact its even really far from a nearmasterpiece stature but it is highly entertraining and it will calm your nerves after seeing a movie called requiem for a dream,black_comedy
i just recently saw this movie for the first time and it is now one of my favorite films  this movie is one of the funniest films i have ever seen everything is just so on in this picture  jeff bridges is gold as the dude but its john goodman in my mind that steals the show walter is one of the funniest characters i have ever seen  i cant remember laughing as hard as i did when he pulled the piece in the bowling alley or when they go to the kids house about the stolen money  plus every time he tells steve buscemi to shut upit just gets funnieralso john tuturro as jesus was great  i just wish he would have had more screen time  goodmans deadpan delivery about his sexcrimes was just too damn funnyall hail  i now suggest you all go out and drink a white russian,black_comedy
one of those rare films that gets better with repeat viewingsaside from the hilarious writing and acting we have a homage to every marlowearchersam spade film every made the young out of control wife the rich old disabled husband the eccentric strong minded daughter the sinister pornographer the beach town sheriffthe premise of the film was what would happen if you threw a man like the dude into a typical la film noir mystery how would he cope what would he do not much to base a film on but it worksthroughout the film bridges in the character of the dude drifts like a beach ball in a swimming pool bouncing off the sides going in different directions listen to what he says recycling everyone elses thoughts and words he is a mirror reflecting everything back in many ways he is infantile his beverage of choice is a sweet milky white russian he listens to a recordiing of a bowling game while immersed in his tub a womb like scene the dude avoids pain and suffering which means he avoids growing upah the writing in the beginning of the film there is a scene in the bowling alley with goodman bridges and buscemi discussing bridges problem those few minutes of dialogue are some of the funniest ever written but the scene wouldnt work without the subtle acting and sharp timing john goodman owns the film he takes his gift for comic acting to a new level his character is full of rage and love  hes a typical man also rare in the film every camera shot adds to the drama and meaning its a visual feast the coen brothers scatter references and clues and jokes throughout the film  only repeat viewings will show you the detail like the rug and the room the coens have really tied this movie together,black_comedy
when the world ends and the world council are deciding which films are to be taken into space for preservation this will surely be one of them the coen brothers truly are blessed with a talent so rare the ability to make film after film and have everyone be differenttry watching blood simple raising arizona and millers crossing in a row and try to find any clues that they are made by the same peoplethis though is while probably not the best film they have ever made that accolade falling on either millers crossing or fargo it is surely the  funniest and most entertainingthe great characters that the coens seem to be able to pluck out of thin air are here in abundance and even characters who have less than ten minutes screen time seem to be wonderfully fleshed out most notably john turturros hilarious jesusjeff bridges is the dude a man who has never achieved anything apart from a brief stint as road manager for the grateful deadwho are apparently a bunch of assholes because hes never tried happy to drift through life as a nobody with only two friends in the whole world and a predilection for smoking grasshe is completely harmless and so when he is suddenly thrown into a chandleresque tale of kidnapping carpet ping nihilism pornography and bowling it is a mark of the coens genius that they can stop it from being completely ludicrous and make this the first ever farce where the audience cares deeply about the man the dudejeff bridges proves that he is either one of the greatest actors of his time or a great raving potheadthe sense of confusion that comes from him is so real he appears to be so helpless that it is heartbreaking and sidesplitting at the same timehe obviously needs help needs to be guided through this by a friend who comes in the shape of walter sobchek john goodman the most inept bumbling war veteran everbest summed up by the dude himself one of these days youre going to have to accept that youre a goddamn moronwalter despite his best intentions ends up hurting the dude more than he ever helps him inadvertently dragging his friend deeper into the hole i could have just been sitting here with p stains on my rugwith a plethora of other great oddball characters donnie maude the titular big lebowskithe wonderful jesus quintanathe film merely reinforces the coen brothers as truly great american film makers who have made nine films and never a bad one long may they rule,black_comedy
i was told on good faith that this film is best viewed in an alternate state of mind  given them instructions and armed with the appropriate material i got on with the jobquite the film classic c brothers stuff  what i enjoyed most i think about the film was its unpredictability in subtle ways  i really had no clue from scene to scene what would happen  a wicked sound track totally fitting for the theme and pace of the film no matter youre state of mind youll be well pleased with its levity and gravity  without delving into each character it developed each and gave you a feeling you knew each much deeper   i dont think youll see these actors in roles unlike this in any other film you see with them that fact alone was really something wild  as other reviewers no doubt tell its well worth the rental or tv slot if you get a chance to see  arm your self with munchies,black_comedy
this is really a strange movie but strange in a good way it was so funny and entertaining and the characters were just outrageous being swedish i of course enjoyed seeing peter stormare in a small role as a german nihilist fond of lingonberry pancakes i also thought julianne mores feministic character was very funny john goodman jeff bridges and steve buscemi were all great in the leading roles is without a doubt a really really strange and a really really funny movie it must be seen to be believed,black_comedy
has become one of my favorite films its a weird combination of a cheech and chong movie and a philip marlowe adventure it s also the funniest movie since clerks i highly recommend it,black_comedy
when i saw the trailer for this i thought it would be like fargo actually it was so funny i couldnt stop laughing steve buscemi and john goodman are really funny if you havent seen this and are in the mood for a comedy or action film you should rent it,black_comedy
a lot of critics seemed disappointed with this followup to fargo but i dont see any justification  lebowski is easily the funniest movie ive seen in a long time  i saw it 3 times in the theaters  john goodman should receive a nomination for best supporting actor for his portrayal of a bowlingcrazed vietnam vet  jeff bridges is also great as the dude  the only problem with the script is that it must be too intellectual for popular culture  i assume thats where the movie flew over the heads of many viewers,black_comedy
 is a wonderful friday or saturday night at home with  nothing else to do but see a funny movie that will have you laughing so hard  youll fall out of the chair  it is a great movie and i recommend it to  all ,black_comedy
i really really liked this film surprisingly more than other cohen brothers masterpieces  the eccentric dude and his bowling buddies and their antics are so hilarious i laughed for days after seeing this  i had to replay several scenes over and  over in disbelief of how creative and funny they were  the acid flashbacks were particularly great  john goodman steve buscemi john turturro are in perfect form,black_comedy
is yet another great film by the coen brothers  its not quite as entertaining as fargo or barton fink but it will not disappoint  in my opinion the worst of their films towers above all the mediocre crud thats out there  the dreamy bowling sequences were hilariously brilliant and most of the actors involved were excellent  john goodman however  was slightly annoying and not nearly as effective as he was in barton fink  john turturo was also great in a small role as jesus the bowler  see this film,black_comedy
i thought is was great as wellnot even close to raising arizonabut still good  john goodman outdid himself in this one  he was in his element for sure  and its always good to see julianne moore oh yes,black_comedy
i just watched this movie last night and i cant believe that someone could make a movie out of this kind of person ive seen the work of the cohen brothers and didnt understand most of their movies but for this movie i can say that its hilarious john goodman plays a great role in this movie this is a great movie to watchmichal,black_comedy
i know a lot of people who hate this movie  i dont understand those people but what can i say  i find to be not simply a very funny movie one of the funniest ive seen but also a damn good movie in terms of character story plot and themes  so few people are interested in making good comedies anymore  is like a gift from heaven this movie is the rare combination of a film which i can rewatch endlessly i always find something to make me laugh out loud its never the same thing twice and actually holds up rather well to close scrutiny  its a wonderful goofball version of a standard 1950s film noir updated of course and never taken seriously  but all the elements are there  its a terrific spoof of detective movie but it actually functions successfully as a detective movie  compare to airplane which is a riotously funny spoof of airplane disaster movies but only works as a spoof not as an airplane disaster movie  is making fun of detective movies but it also has a real mystery involved and a real detective albeit an unusual one who actually solves the mystery    great performances make this film and the cast is to die for  see it  if its not your cup of tea well it isnt for everyone  but for my money this is definitely not only one of the funniest comedies out there but also one of the best,black_comedy
jeff the dude lebowski is a bowler mistaken by a duo of mobsters for jeff lebowski the millionaire they demand repayment of a loan the dude knows nothing about while he tries to explain their mistake the millionaires daughter is kidnapped and the kidnappers send her a severed toe in the mail with a ransom notefrom there the dudes problems just grow bigger and biggerit has been a long time since i have seen an actor completely envelop a role such as jeff bridges does for the dude steve buscemione of the best actors in the world is his perfect self in the role of donny a nice polaropposite to his role in fargo and john goodman is great and one of the best character you just cant stop laughing this is a very good movie,black_comedy
the coen bros big lebowski is probably my favorite movie of 1998 thus far austin powers was the funniest movie in recent history until came along i think this will movie become a classic it has so many memorable scenes i was literally aching from laughter after seeing this movie i just got my copy on dvd and im prepared to watch it very regularly great screenwriting great acting excellent cinematography a great soundtrack and a bizarre sense of humor fargo was a tough act to follow but the coens has succeeded wonderfully will probably become my favorite coen brothers film i give it a 10 out of 10,black_comedy
isnt the greatest movie of all time its not even the greatest movie by the coen brothers that would be fargo it is the funniest movie i have seen in a long time though the characters in this movie are so screwed up in the head and everyone has to love the bowler jesus and all of the nihilists the movie is hilarious from the start when dudes rug is soiled to finish with the scattering of donnys ashes this movie has it all bowling millionaires trophy wives worthless bums kidnapping nihilists action kidnapping vietnam vets botched ransom car theft heart attacks missing toes jesus pornographers corrupt cops acid flashbacks dream sequences sex solely for the purpose of reproduction and on and on and on if you dont laugh until you cant see straight you dont deserve this movie movie makers should think up things like this instead of supposedly funny films like mafia,black_comedy
there are so many movies that lack in originality and there are so many comedies that fall flat  is like an answer to my prayers  this is a comedy that works in all aspects  sometimes you have a comedy thats funny but the writings terrible and the talented cast is pretty much the only asset that keeps it moving  this movie not only has a great cast but its wonderfully written by those genius coen brothers lavishly directed and contains a remarkable soundtrack  each and every character has a quirky notable personality  my favorite though he only appeared on screen for about 5 minutes was jesus quintana played masterfully by john turturro  he cracked me up so hard  and i love that scene where jesus goes up to bowl licks the ball for good luck and we watch in slowmotion as he hits a strike  he dances in the lane and rejoices while we hear a mariachi version of the famous hotel california in the background  only the coen brothers can make a scene work that smoothly there are other memorable sequences like the musical number called gutterballs with jeff bridges being handed a pair of bowling shoes by sadam hussein and flying under the skirts of beautiful women  you watch a scene like that and you wonder why this movie didnt nab an oscar for best art direction      ethan and joel coen have a great sense of originality and that also showed in their other hilarious comedy raising arizona  i loved that movie too  but i loved this movie twice as much  some wont approve of its maximum dosage of f words but i was laughing so hard that didnt bother me one bit  is one of those flicks that shows you what comedy is all about and how to really form a good punchline with perfect timing and delivery  as a bonus the film is packed with stunning visuals its such a great movie to look at  there are no cheap shots in this one the dialogue is imaginative yet realistic  its not the least bit pretentious  you know as you watch this that this is the way people talk and that was also shown in fargo  and i liked that even though the central character was a simpleminded individual they didnt construct him like someone out of a bill and ted movie  jeff bridges who is perfectly cast was extremely entertaining and i can say the same about john goodman as his easilyangered friend who follows all the jewish holidays even though hes not jewish  i find it a tad appalling that critics have panned this movie and called it slight and forgettable  this is more intelligent than most comedies in recent yearsor any year  this is a very very entertaining movie and if you really want to laughthis is definitely the movie to see,black_comedy
the first time i saw this i didnt like it  when i saw it on video i havent laughed so hard since theres something about mary  this film is almost as funny as theres something about mary but one of my alltime favorite comedies  jeff bridges john goodman and julianne moore gave great hilarious performances and the coen brothers wrote some of the funniest dialogue ever much better than the overhyped fargo,black_comedy
very entertaining  i was laughing from the first minute to the end  lots of surprises too reminiscent of pulp fiction but not quite as dramatic or shocking,black_comedy
im not sure is for everyone but for my money its one of the funniest comedies ever a very impressive production from the coen brothersover the years the coens have knocked my socks off they have their heavyduty films like no country for old men barton fink and their satires like the hudsucker proxy  it seems as if they can do anythingthis is a very very funny and offbeat film with crazy characters acid flashbacks and bizarre situations  a true baby boomer movie about the dude jeff bridges whose name is jeff lebowski who is mistaken for another lebowski whose wife owes money all over town goons try to get the money from him he winds up working for the other lebowski when his porn star wife is kidnapped along for the ride are two of his bowling buddies walter a vietnam vet who though not jewish observes the shabbat and steve steve buscemi julianne moore plays maude the daughter of my favorite part of the movie  i have many but my favorite part is one of the last scenes which i wont give away the acting is fantastic with jeff bridges totally inhabiting the dude and john goodman in one of his best performancesa flop when it opened over the years has deservedly become a classic as it found its audience its now rated in the top 250 on imdb which is only right,black_comedy
from the very first frame this film just screams coolness john goodmans vietnam vet is the best thing ive seen in a cinema since leo dicaprio drowned he should get an oscar for this but will proberly lose out to the fifth solider on the left in saving private ryan i wholeheartedly recomened this film to any one with a brain,black_comedy
ill just say this ironically steve buscemi plays the only somewhat normal person in the cast  everyone else is a weirdo the movie is strange and at times gets boring but it is definitely worth seeing because some of the scenes are so incredibly funny  john goodman as walter and steve buscemi as donny steal the show and they are involved in almost all of the movies best scenes  if youre offended by cussing though do not see this  it rivals reservoir dogs and clerks for the movie with the most swearing ive ever seen  if you dont mind profanity and want some real laughs though you must see this,black_comedy
i thought the movie was just plain great  i admit i thought the fword was used a bit much but hell in some areas of the country that is the way people speak and is natural  i thought that the coen brothers did a wonderful job of writing and directing  what i liked most about it was the fact that unlike other movies it didnt stick with the one plot cause life is not like that  the movie was about the dudes life after his rug was soiled and all the st that happened after it  the film had great character development and great wit and humour  as i said the film was all around great,black_comedy
i think i could see lebowski every day so far ive seen it five times which just makes me want to see it more my favorite coen brothers movie i think theyve improved with every movie except the hudsucker proxy in fact i think this is the movie they had in mind when they worked up the hudsucker proxy with all of the imagery symbolism and themes all over the script i think this movie is in some ways a tribute to complexity and coincidenceonly complaint i want more of john turturro as jesus this movie is electric watching it reminded me of getting an hourlong massage  i loved every minute of it and was fearing the inevitable end of the movie karl hungus walter donnie jesus  liam maude lebowski everybody was sensational  but the dude is the focal point he should be an inspiration to us allthe more i think about this film the more i believe its my favorite movie of alltime,black_comedy
i have no idea why this is so hyped i just want my money back this is some strange con,black_comedy
 1998  out of fourby blake frenchthe coen brothers are an artistic breed of their own they add a twisted touch of humor to every project they create imaginative characters memorable stories and ingenious dialogue they have explored the lives of poets hillbillies cops mobsters adulterers killers and now a loserthats right explores the life of a bigtime loser a lazy uninspiring unemployed loser his name is jeff lebowski jeff bridges who lives in the moment and wears a goatee a beer belly a ponytail and a pair of oversized bermuda shorts he lives to bowl drink white russians and to do drugs character what do you do for recreation the dude oh the usual bowl drive around the occasional acid flashbackthe dudes best bowling pals donny steve buscemi who is never allowed to finish a sentence and walter john goodman who is stuck in the past diddle with the dude as he goes with the flow inhibiting not a care in the world until a porn king confuses the dude for another person with the same name of lebowski thugs invade the dudes house plunge his head into the toilet and pee on his rug they leave after they realize they have mistaken his identity however the dude wants a new rug walter and the dude take a trip to the rich lebowskis they get more than a rug it appears that someone has kidnapped lebowskis daughter and the wealthy bigwig wants the dude to deliver the ransom money the dude agrees and of course chaos ensuessome of the material falls flat a subplot about a bowling maniac named jesus john turrturo goes absolutely nowhere fortunately many scenes work wonderfully featuring original ideas thoughtprovoking metaphors experimental camera techniques and eyepopping cinematography i especially enjoyed how the film explores the dudes dreams with sequences bursting with color imagination and peculiar images audiences will remember as one of the most imaginative films of the decade the coen brothers create an odd assortment of unique circumstances and characters the quirky characters have lots of fun with the unbelievably profane screenitcom informs us that the movie uses the f word 250 times but strangely amusing dialoguewhat does it all add up to well there is plenty to think about and plenty to laugh at but we do not leave with a powerful feeling of satisfaction may resemble the spirit of raising arizona another wildly funny comedy by the coens but this movies does not quite work as well both contain the same zany style but that film felt inspired by plot lacks plot a string of amusing predicaments does not necessarily account for the absence of story  if the film would have followed a clear comprehensible story it may have been more involving but thats clearly not what the coen brothers wanted even before the opening credits begin the films narrator sam elliot explains that this film is about the dudes adventures its not really a narrative of the dude but an examination of his reaction to life changing events by the end of the movie we sense the dude has learned from his experiences and because of them he is a better personwell kind of,black_comedy
movie is very slow and boring except some few nude scene which couldnt hold the movie not recommended at all to any age group i can bet you will say same if you watch the moviesave your time people,black_comedy
a carefree broke and calm lebowski the dude get tangled with the big wealthy lebowski this is the story but then many sides used or took advantage of the poor carefree lebowski who have friends that less to be said they raise the flames of the already lighted fire  it is funny and at some points hilarious i didnt get the purpose of the few characters in the movie but in overall the few main characters dude and his friends were funny in their way of looking at things i cant say that i enjoyed the whole movie but i can say that there are very few scenes that worth saving for repeat watch,black_comedy
this is the best movie of all time and i knew this right after i watched it its just perfect everything in this movie is perfect the characters are outright interesting from the dude who manages to keep his head cool by adhering to a strict drug regimen his buddies the hotheaded but hilarious walter and clueless donny the other characters maude bunny jackie treehorn jesus quintana are also very interesting and add their own flavor to the movie the whole story is a sort of whodunit mystery which turns out to be a much ado about nothing much like life itself  and it was this hard hitting conclusion which made me realize that this is perhaps the best movie ever made,black_comedy
i had the luck of seeing during a sneak preview in late march of 1998 here in belgium the room was packed and afterwards applause erupted the entire audience stayed seated and clapped until the final credits rolled since then ive seen it numerous times i introduced my little brother to it when he was 14 only for it to become one of his favourite movies too quotable quirky quintessentially coen 10 stars,black_comedy
i believe every people who is between 2045 age must watch this movie,black_comedy
theres a religion for its time and place it fits right in there helps us abide through all the strikes and gutters the ups and downs of the whole darned human comedy it really ties your life together and the religion for our time and place is dudeism having an official religion movement based on a movie is in itself an achievement worthy of recognition the so called laid back attitude has turned into a goal for many in the stressed everyday life of the urbanized society of today perhaps this is why some might consider the movie a religion you can find out if this is so or not for yourself personally i highly recommend seeing this,black_comedy
i had heard about this movie all the time from friends saying it was good but i never actually saw the movie until recently its a fantastic ride along with an unemployed but peaceful dude who suddenly gets mixed up in something he cannot always comprehend but just goes along with it anyways i really liked john goodman in this movie a lot of his scenes were hilarious because he gets so angry i will say if you dont like cursing in movies then this movie might not be for you i think one of the reasons this is such a classic movie is because all the characters are very relatable and very funny 910 one of the few comedy movies that can be watched over and over,black_comedy
bridges plays jeff the dude lebowski an unemployed slacker with very simple taste bowling marijuana white russians and a rug that ties the room together when thugs mistake him for jeff huddleston and vandalize the dudes rug he seeks compensation from but by the time an agreement is reached the dude finds himself in the crossfire of a conflict involving kidnappers ands much younger wife reid above par upon first viewing but the replay value is unmatchable and will eventually wind up at the top of your favorite comedies along the lines of other coen brothers comedies but this one is easily the best layered with terrific minor characters played by an exceptional supporting cast lets not forget the incredible soundtrack which consists of many of the dudes favorite tunes and some eagles too out of four,black_comedy
in spite of how brilliant this movie is so few of my friends have ever seen it i have never been in so many situations where my movie quotes have had to been explained clearly this movie deserves far more recognition its the story of how a dudes rug gets peed upon and the cascade of events that ensue because of itone of the great things about the movie is that when you are watching it you know that there is something more than simply the story of a dude and his rug speaking of the dude jeff bridges provides an iconic and by far the best performance i have ever seen from him he is such a laid back character who garners respect from all his comrades you really cant help but sympathise with him he spews some of the best lines heard ever john goodman also plays one of the most memorable characters in existence i feel that that is the thing that makes this movie so incredible its characters are immeasurably memorable even donnie who does almost nothing i am going to need surgery to remove the memories of the movie but i wont because its excellenthmm lets see negatives what did this movie do wrong perhaps you could argue that some of the characters come to nothing but you would be foolish because it all culminates with the brilliant line the dude abides it shows that so much has happened that at this point jesus the bowler doesnt to him the investigator guy doesnt matter to him and most certainly the teenage car thief doesnt matter to him i am really struggling here to find things wrong with this movie the biggest criticism i have is on a purely mood scale this movie is only watchable if youre in the mood for really thinking about a movie if youre not just watch anchormanclearly i struggled finding anything wrong with this movie there is so much to enjoy with the film and i am amazed that i had never watched it prior to a few weeks ago even saying its great to think about deeply can be debunked there is enough humour and captivating story for you to passively watch it just stop reading this review and go to amazon buy the movie watch it as soon as possible your life will improve,black_comedy
for fun i wondered who would give this film a no star i find it fascinating that when i see a great film and others see a terrible one a battlefield earth what causes the discrepancy is it perhaps theyre humorless or lack the capacity to get it the investigation was interesting the reviewers seemed articulate much of the time and not mere trolls yet they hated the dude the whole thing every character they were bored they felt it was stupidso perhaps heres why a few people cant get the dude they just dont like him they didnt like the characters the nihilists ordering piggie in the blankets or a vietnam vet whose converted to judaism and watches his exwifes dog the film has a wonderful backstory that invites you to fill in the gaps with similar characters in your own life and fiction its full of rich details but if you dont like one or more of the characters then its like listening to colleagues you dislike at work prattle on about their facebook posts they dont get it and dont care and just want to leavethe genius of the film is that many people who dont see the humor on the first viewing a few years later see it again perhaps on tv as their spouse or friend is watching it and realize i missed that the first time around thats pretty funny and insightful then they watch some more then more then theyre hookedthe dude is not for the faint of heart you would not want the dude to move in with you hed burn down the house because he forgot to turn off the oven but hey stop being so fascist about it will ya but even if you want some distance between you and him you come to love him and his troupe of characters that are simultaneously stereotypes both in fiction and real life and at the same time unique characters in their own right the dude says you need to stop being so uptight relax and get it or not and when someone gets uptight and doesnt get it they dont get it and they are the ones who write 0 star reviews of this film on imdba few years down the road theyll have a few drinks in them and relax and watch it and then theyll change maybe theyll fix their 0 star imdb review maybe theyll apologize to the dude but the dude is ok with that he has far more important things to do,black_comedy
the dude has influenced my wardrobe my way of life and my haircut ive bought the sweater have the glasses found a bowling ball at a second hand shop clear jelly sandals deep cut white v neck tshirt shorts its now part of my wardrobe too searching for identity look no further than mr lebowski or the dude to his friendsthe calm approach the dude has taken to life is the narrative of an overpriced self help book how to beat the stress of modern livingbrilliant acting amazing music great script two of the most talented people in hollywood at the helm the cohen brothers have created some amazing thoughtful funny pieces this sits atop that pilegreat cult movie deserving of its reputation to be a part of the movie to see it arrive at cult status in the early 2000s and to attend a lebowski fest last year in melbourne was a highlight of this century,black_comedy
this is my first review because this is my favorite movie of all time and every single person on the planet earth needs to see it not a lot of people see this movie which is sad because has everything it has crime comedy drama and bowling and boy does it have some quotes has so many quotes that the script is basically just one long quote it starts off with a stoner the dude coming home to his crappy apartment from the groceries store and he finds two thugs who promptly shove his head in the toilet and demand money stating that the dude is a millionaire when the dude says that its pretty obvious that he isnt a millionaire they pee on his rug which really tied the room togetheri know its not on netflix yet but it is totally worth the price to buy it ive seen it over 15 times and it still hasnt gotten the least bit old in fact it had only gotten better the first time i saw it i hated it but when i saw a second time i thought it was awesome that may or may not be the same case with youthe dude abides,black_comedy
from the getgo the dude comes off as a nonchalant guy looking to take in the most of life without extravagance his pacific nature along with his friends who can be polar opposites at times are lovable characters who all love to bowl but in all seriousness this movie revolves around the misfortunes of lebowski a lovable passive man who just wants to enjoy life but is put in a whirlwind instead from the bowling alleys to the bridges going on this adventure is constant excitement and joy you cant help but smile to see the dude take what life has to throw at him in the best way he can lebowski is quite the man and this movies highs literally and lows certainly prove it is more than just another dull comedy watching this movie even after hearing about all its reviews i was still quite impressed in every aspect of the film whether it just be scenes of playing at the lanes or taking a relaxing drive outside i cant overemphasize how much i enjoyed this film i highly recommend since im sure it will put a smile on your faceand even give you a little something to think about,black_comedy

a legend crazy script remarkable performance chaotic adventures salad of a lot of ingredients strange dialogs ironic image of existence thriller in skin of comedy few drops of kafka and dada movement and an unique character and more important jeff bridges as central pillar of a masterpiece about joy of life in a special manner a film about nothing but not version of seinfeld only image of a world as fruit of its rules and result of directors genius special character  a carpet spice  dialogs in a bowling scenes heart  lebowski himself as image from mirror for a time of waste a real good comedy with value of manifesto and special demonstration of wonderful performance,black_comedy
this masterpiece comedy from the coen brothers with an unforgettable performance by jeff bridges as the dude had an abysmal theatrical run but it has generated a cult around it since it hit video the dude is the ultimate stoner a slacker role model for the offbeat whose claim to fame is his superior skills as a bowler and the authorship of the port huron statement whether bridges likes it or not he will always be a symbol of the rebellious counterculture as his close friend walter sobchak john goodman is obnoxiously hilarious whether he is whining about the buddies that he lost in vietnam or his pseudo jewish heritage and john turturro is just as outrageous as a weaselly sexual predator the characters that make up qualify as a diverse group the coen brothers deal with the theme of mistaken identities and a supposed kidnapping two of jackie treehorns moronic thugs attack the dude jeff bridges at his modest venice beach bungalow and plunge his head repeatedly into a toilet in an effort to wring information out of him at one point one of the two urinates on the dudes thrown rug eventually one thug figures out that the dude is poor rather than wealthy as it turns out they targeted the wrong lebowski but meant to confront pasadena philanthropist jeffrey lebowski david huddleston of mcq whose young wife bunny tara reid owes treehorn a bundle of dough the dude is so upset by the act of aggression by treehorns thugs that he visits lebowski and demands compensation for his rug although lebowski refuses to compensate the dude the dude steals a rug and falls under the scrutiny of maude lebowski julianne moore of the forgottenwho was sentimentally attached to the rug she explains that she controls all of the money and doles out amounts to jeffrey anyway jeffrey hires the dude to serve as a gobetween the kidnappers and lebowski walter tries to tell the dude how to handle this sticky situation but everything that walter does leads to something infinitely worse at midpoint walter is seen running around his exwifes pomeranian some of the funniest scenes involve idiotic walter taking a tireiron to a sports car that he thinks a little boy owns and another has a trio of german nihilists visiting the dudes apartment and dumping a marmot in his bathtub while he is bathingwinds up being an oddball raymond chandleresque mystery with the dude acting as a gumshoe as usual the coens present a gallery of weirdo characters maude ranks as a really warped character who describes her experimental art as vaginalsam elliott is very good as the narrator known only as the stranger who introduces us to the dude during an evocative opening title sequence with the sons of the pioneers crooning in the background,black_comedy
let me say first off that i hated this movie the first time i walked out of it i did however watch it again over the years and i have to think it was just my age at the time i was 19 and now being the ripe old age of 32 i have to say i might enjoy this for repeat viewings more than anything elseso what makes this movie great first off it has one of the single best scripts i have ever seen it is funny weird and incredibly quotable the characters are well drawn and so odd that you cant help but love them the coen brothers have made some very good movies but nothing compares to the utter genius displayed hereexists on the plain of earth that we just dont inhabit in this film la is a magical place that walks the along edge of lunacy a bit mythological and just subversive to keep us coming back again and again for a great movie that never loses its sparklethe dude abides,black_comedy
when i was young i never really got into bowling i always wanted to and when i did i enjoyed myself the more that i think about the character jeff lebowski the more i envy him hes so cool what a role model he goes to stores in his robe everyone refers to him as the dude he bowls hes funny hes awesomehes the coolest role model alive and what makes the cohen brothers film so enjoyable is the way jeff bridges portrays jeff lebowski to be honest i think bridges deserved the oscar not only for crazy heart but forjeff lebowski and his friendssteve buschemi and john goodman are frequent bowlers lebowskis life is turned upside down after his mistaken for another lebowski who is the opposite a millionaire two guys break into the dudes house and pee on his rugthe dude goes to the other lebowski and forces him to pay for his rug eventually the other lebowski asks jeff to get involved in his life after his younger wife is kidnapped and from then on bunches of weird things happen jeff meets the other leboskis daughterjulianne moore who is involved in porn and he gets into mishaps with some germansis hilariouswell actedand engrossing the dude is such a likable character the film is made in a style that i cant even describe i laughed so many times from jeff bridges screams to the rest of the movie overall the movie is a masterpieceand it deserves to be called a classic44,black_comedy
this is one of those movies i never got around to seeing it is one of the most delightful black comedies of all time watching the byplay between the frenetic john goodman and jeff bridges is priceless the plot is all over the place and we are played once in a while but the excitement is in the journey not the end bridges character is the laid back sixties protest type who is accosted one day a case of mistaken identity as a couple of thugs beat him and one pees on his rug this sets in motion and effort to find the man who shares his name and get his rug replaced he ultimately steals one of the mans rugs this sets off john goodman a poster child for anger management they become involved in a kidnapping drop and i cant begin to explain the rest suffice it to say these guys have a great chemistry and all bridges can do is watch the dominoes fall goodman has made a career of playing lovable psychos for the coen brothers this may be his masterpiece,black_comedy
is one of my favourite films and it is the sort of film you can watch over and over again and each time it gets better and even funnier nearly every element of this film is made for a joke in some way and it is these deeprooted jokes that make the film it is so well written that a majority of the jokes arent even noticed first time you watch but then watching again you pick up on them and next time theres moreive seen the film about six times and i have to say i have laughed more each time i have watched it as i discover more and more jokesit is honestly hard to think of a bad thing about this film jeff bridges heads a fantastic cast with some simply brilliant acting and all potential narrative loopholes are cleared up by the endthe coen brothers are fantastic filmmakers and i am shocked that this film did not win more awards or get more acclaim at the time910,black_comedy
this has been my candidate for the funniest film i have ever seen ever since i caught it at a last chance theater late in its initial runit was a small theater in a multiplex total attendance was myself solo a thirty or forty something married couple two young guys a dating couple and another group of two or three college studentsa group dynamic soon established itself we all became so sore from laughing that no one wanted to be the initial victim of the next gag but each time someone would start laughing and we all helplessly joined in every timewe really did think we could hold out once but the next thing the dude dropped the joint in his pants and his torino ended up sideways in the alley after that we gave up on even trying it was the most powerful bonding experience i ever had with strangers in a theateri have always been completely high on jeff bridges talent wondering why he was not appreciated like deniro duvall hackman pacino etc it seemed odd to me that he will probably be remembered for playing this part but now i think that might not be a bad fate after all i think he is like robert mitchum  the best hollywood actor alive under appreciated because he makes it look so easy lebowski is the perfect example of that it looks like a simple acting job but no one could have done it better or even as wellto give the coen brothers their due the onetwothree roll of fargothe big lebowskioh brother where art thou may be unmatched in cinema history and they keep getting better,black_comedy
with the recent win at the oscars for writingdirecting brothers joel and ethan coen for no country for old men it was appropriate that some of their films be on tv and this one was pretty good basically jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges is an ageing hippie and mistaken for another jeffrey lebowski aka david huddlestone who is a millionaire by two thugs who pee on his carpet the dude is then drawn into a kidnap possibly because of the mistaken identity ofs wife bunny american pies tara reid it seems that many other people not just the kidnappers want something from the dude and all probably because they think hes the millionaire for me what kept me watching was the great performance by john goodman as the dudes aggressive bowling buddy walter sobchak a bearlike vietnamveteran with a serious temper and a bit of a potty mouth also starring julianne moore as maude lebowski steve buscemi as theodore donald donny kerabatsos philip seymour hoffman as brandt john turturro as jesus quintana harry potters david thewlis as knox harrington and sam elliott as the stranger the one narrating there were some funny moments and the surreal dream sequences were interesting and the performances especially goodman were all great so i dont see any reason not to see it very good,black_comedy
about thirty years ago i read the word micturate in a story and it was so intriguingly curious i began using it in conversation with a couple friends of mine for its intended appropriate reason of course like pull over the car i have to micturate i never came across it in high school college or anywhere else it never came up in a tv show stage play or a film its like the word was invented for the sole purpose of never using it never once did i ever hear anyone except the members of my trio use the term until today the real lebowski david huddleston uses the word upon introduction to the jeff bridges lebowski actually the past tense micturated but close enough pretty nuts to get excited about rightwell if the movie didnt have me right there i was bound to coen brothers fandom with the on screen arrival of jesus quintana john turturro its been a while since ive seen anything as flamboyantly over the top as his introductory first strike capability if that small bit of inspired genius doesnt grab you you probably wont go for the rest of the flick either is a raucous seinfeld episode on speed or at least the equivalent of a buzz on too many white russiansquite honestly i was all prepared for the big l to be john goodman but it didnt take long for that slight hint of disappointment to evaporate jeff bridges is a worthy lebowski in all of his underachieving glory perfectly complemented by the boisterous brains of the outfit walter sobchak goodman its too bad donny steve buscemi didnt make it to the finale but hey not everyone gets to go out in a can of folgers something subliminal there  why not maxwell house good to the last drop in a tribute to one of filmdoms masters of malapropisms walters speech honors donnys memory from la joya to leo carillo  i had to play that one three timesthe big l simply demands viewing more than once im sure i missed a bunch the first time around its the story of the dude a man uniquely qualified to claim his time and place in los angeles of the early nineties im not quite sure but i think theres an unspoken message here,black_comedy
peter stormare is not a nihlist how come nobody has seen this the entire listing am i the only true big lebowski fan what other inaccuracies are lurking in this site please how many of us are lovers of this movie and quote it line for line to our friends and family and enemies and anyone who will listen to it but we fail to scan the credits and find that peter stormare is listed as a nihlist even peter stormare must have looked at every site that has his name listed hes not that famous for gods sake peter stormare was jesus quintanas bowling mate remember jesus the pederast that walter sobcheck identifies to the dude nobody fucks with the jesus youre out of your element donnie,black_comedy
well what can i say its one of my favourite movies when i feel distressed in the daily s this movie makes me feel whole again in one way like i dont have to do something that i just have to live my life without any bosses or other people who wants to say what i have to doi gave this movie an 8 it could also be a 9 or 10 because its just a number numbers dont say everything well now i regret that i havent give it a 9i recommend this movie for people who come home from a hell of a daily workday and want to commit suicide this movie will hold you from doing thatthe dudeyesssits just the dude,black_comedy
probably the most boring comedy ive ever seen no random stuff patched together doesnt make for funny gags sorryits probably hilarious and quotable to those who live their lives smoking pot and being useless all the time but for the rest its just a crappy story about a parasite of society for whom youll feel no simpathy the plot is meaningless the jokes are just random talking that makes no sense most of the scenes are extremely predictable and the characters are all disgracefulyou could probably have more fun watching shitizen kane avoid it like the plague,black_comedy

big lebowski the 1998  out of 4 the dude lebowski jeff bridges gets mistaken for a millionaire lebowski and soon hes pulled into a big mystery when that rich guys skank girlfriend is kidnapped by some unknown men soon the dude must try and figure out whos pulling all the strings but of course in between his bowling league and dope the plot of is probably the least important thing because as a mystery it really doesnt work for a couple reasons one is that its too easy to figure out what really happened and the second is that you really dont care too much the movie works because of the terrific characters and i dont think its an overstatement to say that theyre some of the most memorable of any film of the decade the screenplay by the coen brothers works so well because the characters are so well developed and theyve gotten some incredibly talented actors to bring them to life even the smallest parts in the film feature a fair number of known actors including a few who would go onto win oscars the entire film goes around bridges who is pitchperfect as the dude this laid back type of character is one bridges had been playing for decades by this point but add in the dope the strange dialogue and the supporting characters and you can say youve never seen a lazy bum like this one bridges is just so believable in the part that you not once feel as if youre seeing a performance but instead youre seeing a real loser caught up in the situation john goodman plays his vietnam buddy and its a real shame that he gets so overlooked because he delivers perhaps the funniest performance in the film countless movies have done the crazed vietnam bit to death but goodman comes across so original that you cant help but feel that hes one of the best who has ever done it i just love the way hes able to go from calm to psycho and back to calm in the matter of seconds the supporting cast is just as impressive with julianne moore steve buscemi david huddleston tara reid philip seymour hoffman and john turturro are all terrific in their bit parts as well the chemistry that the supporting players have with bridges is another strong selling point another major plus is the soundtrack which features the likes of bob dylan creedence clearwater revival elvis costello santana the eagles and many more i think the one downside to the film is that since the mystery doesnt work the extended 117minute running time feels a bit too long and you cant help but feel that the story could have been wrapped up in less time with that said there are countless big laughs to be had here and its certainly true that you never know where the comedy is going to come from and that helps keep the thing moving the performances especially bridges and goodman makes this film a true cult classic,black_comedy
a film buff friend of mine recommended this film to me some years ago and his opinion is generally quite sound this is the sort of film that i could watch every week and still find it superb entertainment the film is an absolute barrel of fun throughout and the cast and crew together with the coen brothers have produced a masterpiece when the monty python experience came along in the late 1960s my dad and i used to watch it together i was almost always helpless with laughter whereas my dad had various expressions on his face from bewilderment to boredom and suffice to say he never did not see the funny side of python this is another instance where he would probably be watching this film with a stony face unable or unwilling to grasp what would be so funny to me yes there is violence and sexual content but in my opinion it is all in context and not gratuitous but thats just my two cents like in a lot of other comedy films you either like them or not and i suspect that there are quite a number of people out there who just cant tune into the humour i am fortunate in that i can tune in and apart from anything else this film stands on its own and not just a comedic exercise but as a fun story with a reasonable plot told in an unique way i would highly recommend anyone watch this film because in my opinion there is so much to like and hopefully if you tune in you will not be disappointed,black_comedy
directors joel and ethan coen have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre jeff bridges stars as jeffrey lebowski an unemployed los angeles slacker and avid bowler who refers to himself as the dudeis a wideeyed oneofakind comedy of genius with the structure of a shaggydog raymond chandler pastiche no surprise that it has ripened over the years and became a beloved cult favourite the first cult film of the internet era it is the coen brothers most exuberantly wacky and inventive film but also their most affectionate and the performances are a joy the films devoted fans have spawned lebowski fest an annual festival that started in louisville kentucky in 2002 and has since expanded to several other cities,black_comedy
i found that while i liked certain parts of the film and found the acting excellent it just seemed uneven in pace and plothoweverfive days later i found himself quoting lines from the movie and laughing to myself about many of the scenes call it the slowburn effect it just gets better with age it was a much better film than i though it was when i first saw it however it is a 89 star movie but since i didnt realize it in the beginning while i viewed it i had to dock it a couple of stars definitely part of the cohen canon this is a good thing i dont roll on shabbos,black_comedy
after seeing this movie i sat and think abit if i saw a movie or i starred at a garbage can which was stinking the more you stayed near it the movie seems like one in whcih important roles are held by no name actors and the insignificant by the best one bridges moore buscemi goodman what do you get  three losers one more loser than the next one are playing big boys except the part where they were supposed to look like big boye they look like embarrasment walkers and nothing more i wondered how the hell bridges could accept such an idiot script its a lost of time man i saw bad movies but this one takes the cake,black_comedy
the coen brothers already made a name for themselves after the release of their films like raising arizona barton fink and most recently fargo in 1996 at the time so when came out im sure they were all over this film the film is in no way bad but its definitely a movie that isnt for everyone besides the strange characters the plot is equally as weird and is a little hard to elaborate but really the film is one to laugh out loud too both leads in this film are portrayed fantastically and are very funny when on screen alone and simultaneously bridges character the dude is one of the best characters in any coen brothers filmwhen it comes to jeff bridges i dont know a lot i do like him for his underrated role he played in kpax but this is only i believe the second film ive seen with him hes great at doing a comedy film when he gets into character with the la slacker accent he can be a thrill to watch he drops some funny one liners in this picture and is also accompanied greatly by john goodman who plays walter when the duo appear on screen the laughs keep coming and coming and the humor rarely lets upthe plot involves an unmotivated slacker nicknamed the dude bridges demands jeffrey lebowski to give him a new rug after his was urinated on by two robbers who were looking for a person by the same name as the dudes jeffrey lebowski his request is declined but he is contacted again when lebowskis trophy wife is kidnapped and after a series of events the dude and walter must return the ransom in order to get the wife backisnt really my type of film the coen brothers never were my type either i was never really into their films and am into a much more different tone of comedy this comedy while being well done and funny is also a little bit of annoying too because of how long it is the movie could be trimmed around maybe twenty minutes in my opinion it doesnt need to span close to two hours sort of reminds me of dinner for schmucks how it almost runs two hours to say that since its long its better not true for any movieone of tbls high points are the character performances by john goodman and jeff bridges both characters are insanely funny and very amusing to watch on screen as well i am really fond of the dude character and he throws in very amusing and clicking lines in the films as well i enjoyed the end scene and the way the movie ended too i guess what im trying to say is that has ups and downs but really its a movie you need to try out it may not be for everyone but it does have its share of humorthe last thing i need to say is this is a film i dont think id watch again various films ive reviewed recently ive went back to and rewatched again for the hell of it and some movies i even watch for an occasional third time naked fear ive watched once more since i reviewed it and i gave eves beach fantasy another try and couldnt make it through the first ten minutes i dont know if i can watch this film again just for the hell of it because i believe i got the full entertainment value the first time around while its well made im sure ill come back to it in later years but not anytime soon but clips i can assure you will be revisited is a highly enjoyable film while not being what i expected it still had a great cast and various scenes with lots of humor i think i can say it certainly does abidestarring jeff bridges john goodman steve buscemi and julianne moore directed by joel and ethan coen,black_comedy
what a waist of my time how on earth a succesfull man turn an big looser to save its problem i stoped watching after am hour,black_comedy
i missed when it was at theaters and after reading all the hoopla and praise foisted in its direction had to rent it and finally see itbig mistakeas with pulp fiction i just dont see what the hype is about the humor is sparse as far as im concerned with john goodmans character being the only redeeming part of the entire movieyeah i paid attention and i watched it twice it didnt helpsome people have raved over the joke that the main characters rug really tied the room together if that is what passes for great humor well count me out,black_comedy
i dont understand why this is loved by so many rating 81 i can t believe,black_comedy
what a tripnot sure where to start the fantastic strong original characters the acting the dialogue the life messagedisruptive surreal and fun beyond wordsthe absolute anti hero movie thats now a cult phenomenon and i am proudly part of it,black_comedy
wellthats justmy opinionone of the greatest characters ive ever seen in a movie and ive watched over 300 filmsman those coen brothers are one hell of a filmmakers,black_comedy
perfect in every way acting script direction cinematography soundtrackan absolute joy,black_comedy
this movie is hilarious and it is a rare comedy that gets even funnier on subsequent viewings,black_comedy
its extraordinarily rare for a movie to forever change the landscape of pop culture with a single blow but did just that i cant speak to the nature of how this was received when it came out i was only eight when it hit theaters but i can speak to the nature of how myself and many of those close to me feel about it and i can speak to its increasing relevance of it today this movie is a masterpiece that has no equal simply because there is absolutely nothing else like it under the sun the dude jeff bridges the fisher king abides he has since 1998 and he will until movies no longer are relevant,black_comedy
this is the greatest fun ever made or depending on who you are the worst as other reviews have noted you will either get this film and love it or you will probably hate it either way is fine because thats just like your opinion man in my opinion this movie stands up to repeated viewings with ease it seems like there is always a new nugget with each view the layers in this film are staggering and i dont think its hyperbole to say this is the greatest film ever made if you have seen this film once and you hated it i encourage you to watch it two more times i was hooked from the opening credits but my wife did not like it but she likes me so she did not balk when i wanted to continue my habit of repeated viewings after about the third time she was quoting lines and pointing out some of the motifs now she hardly ever refuses me when i want to put it on even though she does usually tell me that im not wrong im just an hole,black_comedy
this will be a quick take on this flick it is the best comedy ive ever seen and one the best movies ive ever seen hard to believe when this movie came out in 98 it was a flop now its one of the biggest cult followed movies ever i have been a fan since i first saw it ondvd when it first hit stores one of the most quotable movies ever this role of the dude was made for jeff bridges and he is perfect john goodman is bridges equal the ying to the yang goodman is perfect also there is so much to take in so much comedy so many great lines great colorful characters my favorite scene is where donny passes and the get his remains ashes in a coffee can they go to scatter his ashes and they literally get them in their faces donny has the last laugh omg that is some funny stuff the thing with this movie is youll either love it or youll hate it there is no in between great actors great dialogue so much going on i guarantee if you watch it and give it a chance by the end youll say damn what great movie it is one of the most original and truly great movies you will ever see,black_comedy
great movie ive seen it many times and every time im bouncing congratulations to all involved in the production of this movie,black_comedy
this movie has a big personality and i could have given it a 10 but i felt that a 9 was more appropriate this is basically a postmodern tale that anyone growing up in the 90s will understand everyone should find this entertaining especially on reruns on all the networks it requires attention span as the story is rather complicated it also has a great number of characters to introduce but the filmmakers do it so well that it doesnt lose any points i didnt give it a 10 because it is so outlandish and overthetop that even the most gullible will want to walk away from it at times there is a character played by john turturro who is a registered sex offender who plays bowling alongside the three main characters in league bowling and they felt the need to do a cutscene to tell his story even though he is only in one scene also there is the guy who is a stage actor who wants the dude to go to his performance and the dude nearly forgets  this character has nothing at all to do with this movie so the scenes changed about every 2 minutes also john goodmans character getting away with threatening to shoot someone in public and the cops show up and somehow miss him way too overthetop it felt at times like a pornographic display of garishness,black_comedy
this movie really ties the room togetherthe most classic neo noir comedy caper of all time blending old school hollywood schlock with hippie revivalism and art house pretension funk this is really the coolest film ever made in the modern ages has there ever been a more chilled out protagonistantihero than the dude sam elliot narrating donnie you are certainly out of your element in trying to understand how perfect this film is,black_comedy
in a film that combines so many plot elements including a ransom nihilism a stolen car  and of course bowling  its quite amazing that it works as well as it does the script by the coen brothers is rather complex but its really satisfying to see how the dude becomes further and further embroiled in the affairs of different groups and higher powers in los angeles jeff bridges encapsulates the character of the dude i struggle to picture anyone else who could portray him so well john goodmans performance as walter sobchak is also very strong and the dynamic between him and the dude is very engaging this is complimented by an unorthodox script which creates some very entertaining dialogue as well as some finelyinterwoven humourthe direction is also solid with the cinematography of roger deakins being beautifully smooth particularly in the shots at the bowling complex it is immensely satisfying to take it all in the one issue i have with the film is the dream sequences that occur as i dont really feel like they add anything meaningful to the film aside from this is a film i would highly recommend,black_comedy
this is one of the best movies on so many levels i didnt pick up on how mean this movie is the first few times i watched it jeff bridges as the dude is kind of infinitely charismatic so its hard to see through to all the really fucked up stuff he constantly repeats things that other people have said to him he has a pretty aggressive sense of entitlement he is a dick to women and he only seems vaguely sane in contrast to walter his solution to all problems is bowling he doesnt seem to do much of anything besides be a real chill ass dude which is hilarious and fun to watch it is a great movie i just love the fact that i can find a new layer three viewings in and then that makes me want to watch it again to see if its right fuckin good movie,black_comedy
this is a cult classic and deservedly so the dude had officially taken his place in american culture this movie is a good example of how good writing acting and character study can really carry a movie in the movie the dude as jeffrey lebowski refers to himself is targeted by mobsters because he has the same name as a wealthy businessman whom they are really trying to get violent and hilarious situation ensues as the dude who is a carefree beach bum who also spends a great deal of time at the bowling alley enlists his guntoting pal walter and friend donnie to defend himthis film is filled with terrific situations quirky characters and unforgettable moments you will never forget it or the dude or john goodmans character of walter out of ,black_comedy
this movie is excellentperiod now dont get me wrong there is some nudity that could have been left out and it wouldnt have hurt the movie at all but that being said it is still a great movie the fantastic actors take you for a ride in this film and when it ends you cant believe that two hours went by only a strong film writing combined with fine acting can accomplish this there are times that we were laughing so hard that we missed a bunch of the following dialog there is a lot of what some call bad language but it seemed extremely real the entire time and not out of place like the brief nudity weve read some bad reviews here but i have to say we thoroughly enjoyed it even to the point of wishing it was longer,black_comedy
have you been looking for a movie that really ties the room together if so is just that movie warning spoiler alert this movie starts out when jeff lebowskis aka the dude jeff bridges house gets broken into by two assailants demanding money the assailants soon learn they have the wrong lebowski and one of them angrily urinates on the dudes rug the dude angry that his favorite rug that really tied the room together was urinated on consults his bowling partner walter sobchok john goodman walter instructs the dude that he needs to find the correct jeff lebowski and have him compensate him for the fouled rug the dude heeding walters instructions does just that upon meeting the real jeff lebowski the dude gets inadvertently involved in the kidnapping plot of mr lebowskis wife bunny tara reid mr lebowski offers the dude 25k to be the bag man and drop the ransom off to the kidnappers the dude then tells his bowling partner walter who invites himself along to perform the drop walter switches the ransom money with his dirty undies the whites and they perform the drop the ransom money is then stolen out of the dudes trunk and he finds himself between a rock and a hard place the kidnappers report that they did not receive the ransom so now the dude is assailed upon by not only mr lebowski but the kidnappers as well the dude and walter ultimately find out that that bunny ran away and wasnt kidnapped they also discover that mr lebowski stuffed the ransom bag with telephone books in hopes that the kidnappers would kill bunny who was a gold digger that cheated on him the theme of this film is you guessed it the dude the dude is an unemployed burned out bum he gets assaulted hes tortured his rug gets soiled on and his car is systematically destroyed throughout this film he is seduced by a rich woman who uses him for her pregnancy needs he has the chance to earn a fortune only to have it slip away despite all this the dude remains very dude like he takes on all this adversity and challenge with his calm easy going demeanor in the end the dude is essentially where he began before all this strife and drama entered his life none of this seems to bother the dude and this is why i love this film so much the coen brothers are amazing writers and i believe this to be their best work to date another film they wrote called inside llewn davis had a very similar theme to inside llewn davis was about a struggling folk musician whose music partner kills himself llewn davis oscar issac record doesnt sell he survives by sleeping on various friends couches one of whom he ends up impregnating his girlfriend he takes a recording gig to be able to earn enough money to pay for his friends girlfriends abortion throughout all this adversity llewn davis like the dude has a calm and easygoing demeanor and basically ends up where he began minus his record starting to take off the use of voiceover narration and the thematic element of focusing on the character lend a lot to why this movie has taken on the cult following that it has the voice over narration helps to introduce us to the dude from the beginning of this film the stranger that narrates also points out the struggles that the dude suffers throughout this film as well as highlight that the dude keeps his calm the narrator ends the movie by comforting us and letting us know that everything works out for the dude the thematic element of focusing on the dude is what drives this movie the plot is important to this film but without the dude there would be no plot that being said this movies plot is driven by the lead characters actions the qualities that set the dude apart from ordinary people is his ability to remain calm despite all the chaos that surrounds him the theme of this film can be absolutely expressed in the description of the dude if youve been looking for a good movie that really ties the room together then this is a must see shows us that an easygoing demeanor and calmer than you are approach is the way to approach life this movie is ensured to bring you a great film viewing experience,black_comedy
i was going to give this a 9 out of 9 but then i told myself negative this movie is a timeless classic that deserves and has earned a 10 out of 10 it is funny but not too funny the storyline is amazingly done with a group of amazing casting choices and the dude jeff bridges does an amazing job playing a dude who is the dude no but seriously it is one of the greatest movies that i have seen and i cant be bored of it no matter how many times i have rewatched it the movie and cast is fantastic,black_comedy
to anyone that did not like this movie or gave it a bad review please do yourself a favor and watch it again i thought it was pretty good the first time i saw it but i would say it is great after the third and fourth times probably the most rewatchable movie ever made clever writing and great acting  one of the best coen bros movies ever1fargo 23no country for old men jackie treehorn treats objects like women man,black_comedy
it is difficult to define one genre for this masterpiececoen brothers combine comedy with various elements of the noir movies such as the abundance of characters linked to each other through secret ties that reveal the rottenness behind everyoneour protagonist is not the usual policeman or private investigator damned and alcoholic but a complete idlerjeffrey lebowskiinterpreted by jeff bridges who will be meddled in a case of alleged kidnapping the film is set in los angeles in the early 1990s with characters welloutlined and marked by a story behind many of which are just victims of events that live or are forced to livethe jeffrey lebowski characterization is gorgeous a middleaged lover of bowling and white russian this movie will make you want to drink one immediatelyin which there is a great influence of taoist philosophyjeffrey abides all the events that come to him staying calm and never getting angryjust like a taoist sage he does practically nothing to change his situation he never takes position in doing something he always finds himself victim of the eventsthe protagonist is joined by walter played by john goodman representing jeffreys complete opposite this character is in fact presumptuous and violent he is angry at all the scene where he threatens to shoot an acquaintance only because he broke a rule of bowling is awesome and takes the situation in hand turning it completelythe contrast between the two is functional like the yin and the yang the two friends complement each other creating a balance between disorder and order activity and passivityphotography and direction are sublime the only opening scene is worth more than whole films the coen brothers manage to focus the attention of the spectator on objects and minutia even with mute shots and without giving much explanation salient points are then highlighted by the scenes in which the protagonist is out of his own as when it is hit in the head in which his subconscious frees up and transforms jeffreys desires and thoughts into true images in the visions are actually present the bowling carpet and daughter of the homonym mr lebowski dressed as a valkyrie surely to mark the nationality of the nihilists with whom she had to dothe soundtrack is very good for the film so it is connected to lebowski as much as his dressing gown and cocktailsend up finally recommending this movie to anyone that you love the investigative films or the comedies you can not do without this movie you can see it with your family in cheerfulness and tranquility or have a thorough insight into the freudian nature of visions and the welldelineated philosophy of the characters and still enjoy this masterpiece which would definitely be seen at least once in life,black_comedy
i have seen 1000s of movies in my day and i must say is an unquestionable masterpiece of comedy jeff bridges the dude john goodman walter sobchak and steve buscemi donny could not have fit any better as far a cast goes not to mention some of the other names in this film including sam elliot the stranger and philip seymour hoffman brandt john s lyons hit a grand slam on the casting i dont want to get in to the entire story line and ruin it for those that have yet to see it but if you havent you must non stop laughs throughout the 2 hours in this diamond all i can say is the rug brings the room together the dude rules,black_comedy
i think it might be against the law to make a list of cult movies and not include this it wasnt too warmly received when initially released it has since spawned numerous books annual conventions and a notoriously hilarious edited for television version lots has been said and written about it its one of the ultimate cult films,black_comedy
to me this movies is about a man who is complete he is happy has a hobby that is a love of his life has friends that love his hobby as well and has enough money for gas and oh did i mention a rug that really ties the room together but to me this movie is about all of that and yet none of that its a movie about being happy with who you are and not letting others tell you how to be happy during the first run of this film i say it 50 times in the the theater during lunch i would go see 1530 minutes of it after work i would see it twice and this was the time period in cinema movies would stay in the theater for months sometimes almost a year so i have plenty of chances to see it it was an escape for me wanting stuff a reminder that poverty as well as wealth is only as good as how you choose to feel about it,black_comedy
was directed by joel and ethan coen and stars jeff bridges john goodman and julian moore when the dudejeff bridges is mistaken for jeffrey lebowskidavid huddleston his life becomes a lot more complicated than before word of advice watch this movie while intoxicated i watched it while sober and still enjoyed it immensely but i guarantee that watching this movie while off your head will improve it that said this is a very enjoyable comedy jeff bridges shines bright as the dude with an excellent cast including john goodman and phillip seymour hoffman also providing great performances and being the potatoes to this meat and potato pie the comedy is pretty good and ill definitely say that more jokes hit than they do fail that said i wont say that many jokes in this movie are hysterically funny i chuckled a lot but i only full on laughed out loud maybe 2 or 3 times that isnt a massive gripe but its something i though i should mentionmy main gripe with this movie is that being intoxicated is probably the best way to see it and that is not a major gripe at all the story is pretty basic but works well for what it is attempting to do despite this they set up a lot of character and story arcs that go nowhere which was really annoying that is my second major flaw with this movie it sets up interesting characters like jesus and even donnie but then ignores them or even completely forgets them for the majority of the plot i would rather the characters not be in the movie than have them in it for only a minuscule amount of time the endingwhich i love by the way is very open and allows a lot more possibilities for sequels where they could have explored these characters more and gave them more depth instead of cramming them all into this one movieeven with these flaws the movie is very damn enjoyable its incredible colourful imaginative characters really drive the movie and they are what makes this movie shine that is why i wanted more time going to some of the supporting roles a lot of effort was clearly put into these characters and i wish they got more screen time to bloomits a very technically proficient movie the cinematography is pretty good the set and costume design is great i have no real flaws with this movie as far as sets and camerawork goes maybe a few changes to character and set design but i cant say it was anything that really hindered my enjoymentall in all this movie is very enjoyable soberand i imagine even more so while on something therefor i do recommend this movie to anyone so long as youre prepared to possibly have a breakdown during a few sequences of this movie its a very enjoyable movie and ill rate it 8 rugs out of 10,black_comedy
is really its own kind of film its characters are all strange but yet seem to fit in perfectly there seems to be no line drawn in the sand to limits creativity and bizarreness its main character alone has been such a draw that he has been the source of a new religion dudeism the directors of the coen brothers are known for their unique filmography and outsidethebox thinking but is certainly one of the movies that granted them that titlewe begin our journey from the outside starting with the stranger an old cowboy who already knows the dude himself jeff bridges the stranger acts as a character narrator and audience member all at the same time he talks tall tales about the dude and we are promptly dropped into his world the dude roams around la and bowls in his free time always scavenging for his next white russian and couch to kick back on the dude walks back home one day only to find two henchmen waiting for him one throws the dudes head in his own gross toilet and the other unzips his pants and pees on his rug it really tied the room together one henchmen goes on to explain that the two are there to extort money from the dude calling him mr lebowski only theyve got the wrong lebowski the two leave in an aggressive embarrassment and the dude is left on his bathroom floor with a toiletwatersoaked head and sunglasses onthe dude does some digging and eventually finds the real mr lebowski in an attempt to get some money to replace his rug the two meet in mr lebowskis illustrious house and the dude leaves without any money but having tricked mr lebowskis personal assistant brandt into stealing a rug for him as the dude leaves he winds up chatting up mr lebowskis trophy wife bunnie as wellthe dude is a toker for sure always kicking back and lighting some js he proves himself to be the dude time and time again the dudes casual mindset pairs well with his habit of smoking weed and in a good amount of scenes he is however its almost like he goes unchanged there isnt a sober dude and there isnt a high dude he just is the dude its the appearance of what the dude is that makes him what he is and weed is a strong component of that without the j the dude wouldnt be the same dudethe dude goes back off into his exceedingly casual life and bowls with his teammates walter sobchak john goodman and donny kerabatsos steve buscemi however not too long afterwards the dude receives an urgent voicemail left by brandt requesting that the dude come and visit and its not about the rug mr lebowskis wife bonnie has been kidnapped for ransom mr lebowski and brandt see the dude as being in a unique position because they believe the men who captured bunnie may also be the same culprits who soiled the dudes rug the dude abides and the rest is a crazy hilarious journey its like the usual suspects meets the naked gun jeff bridges performance as the dude is one of the most recognizable in hollywood him and a litany of other cast members won awards for their unique and charismatic performances the acting is from another world the characters are the strangest in the world but all need each other to exist its almost a hallucinatory movie is a must see for any movie fan and is sure to crack a few laughs and spark lots of curiosity theres no better time to enjoy the turbulent journey of the dude than now is best served with a white russian,black_comedy
review by the coen brothers is a great film because of its great characters the cast includes jeff bridges john goodman julianne moore john turturro and many more released in 1998 is a quirky crime comedy about an unemployed slacker from la who is drawn into a world of kidnapping after being mistaken for a washed up millionaire of the same name to summarize it is about the dude a slacker and a keen bowler when two enforcers show up at his house demanding money having mistook him for a millionaire with the same name and urinating on his carpet he is plunged into a world of deceit kidnapping and much more in the pursuit to be compensated for his ruined carpet a summary of the plot does not do this film justice the character of the dude is brought to life by the outstanding performance of jeff bridges the dude has so many hilarious quotes and back and forths with his counterpart walter played by john goodman jeff bridges seamlessly plays the dude with laid back perfection i was disappointed though with steve buscemis character donny having very few lines in the film although whenever he does talk he is usually told to shut up which can be quite funny another film by the coen brothers called fargo has steve buscemi in a much bigger role than in this one and he is excellent in fargo i would have preferred if he was given a bigger role like in fargo john turturro has a hilarious performance as jesus but little screen time during the films spectacular dream sequences are used with great effect the soundtrack for the film is very good too in conclusion is more about the characters than the plot i would recommend this film too everyone and i would give it a 910 it is my favourite coen brothers film and my favourite film with jeff bridges in it that i have seen,black_comedy
one of the most underrated comedies of all time this movie is as funny as any other comedy and maybe even funnier jeff bridges is great as well as john goodman the story line is hysterical this is one of those movies you need to see twice to really appreciate it if you need a good laugh is the remedy to cure your woes a must seetwice,black_comedy
great movie coen brothers and roger deakins how bad can it be take look at this  this movie has its own religion called dudeismit derives from the dude  the main character of the moviethe thing that made this movie irreplaceable is his responses to the incidents that happen to rather than the movies plotdoubtlessly the most beloved character in this movie is the dude but we shouldnt forger walter toohe is the guy that makes you laugh every single second as you watch this movie also includes criticism about vietnam war and other political cases that makes this masterpiece even betterif you really understand the characters and watch this movie with analyzing them without looking other components i have no doubt that you are gonna really enjoy this movieand surely youre gonna envy the lifestyle of the dude moreover jeff bridges is definitely the best actor for playing the dude if you watched it and didnt like it  yeah well thats just like your opinion man,black_comedy
the first time you watch you tend to find it messy and not very coherent but thats exactly what the movie needs isnt about the dude or his rug its not about bunny and her problems with known pornographers its not about jeff lebowski giving the dude a ringer and its definitely not about donny shut the f up donny no the movie is really about the characters its about watching these very imaginative characters and their mannerisms its about watching how they act and react with one another and seeing how their personalities get them in and out of tough situations ultimately the plot is so messy because the coen brothers dont want you to focus on the details on why what is happening or what motivation brought these characters here there is but one motivation in the movie that matters the dude wants his rug back and he just wants to get it back without having to bother anyone the situation these characters are put in is what makes the movie funny and the way that they react is how we learn from these characters plot is important in some movies but when the characters are the ones who have the story to tell why not stop worrying and just listen to them the next time you watch this movie forget about whats happening and just enjoy these hilariously inapt characters navigate their way through the mess that is,black_comedy
the dude yup you just call him the dude he abides man he abides that right there would be a pretty decent review of this film because most of it is a bunch of losers making oneline quips whilst stoned in a profound manner and you know what its brilliant and it worksa man has his carpet sabotaged the one that really tied the room together he sets out to find out why and gets caught up in an adventure he is mistaken for a much wealthier lebowski whos wife owes money and thus gets everyone in trouble the resulting hijinks involve ransom german nihilists and bowlingthis film more than any other by the coens seems to have generated more cult followers quotes party themes and halloween costumes its unique funny as hell and has a strange plot the characters are like your college dormmates  memorable and goofythere is a sober philosophical side to too it makes you think about life and our purpose in itall in all the film is pretty great and will probably rope you in for many viewings,black_comedy
as a college student with a very busy schedule life can be very stressful at times for me when i get stressed i watch films this has been my favorite pastimes for many years and in those years i have seen many movies some of the movies have been entertaining and well made while others have been complete failures one film that is among the more memorable is the coen brothers film this 1998 comedy is certainly one of the best and most hilarious films i have ever watched the hilarious dialogue enthralling story and great acting are what make one of the most influential films in recent yearsthe dialogue is one of the most effective pieces in this film it is certainly a film that i and many people around me quote frequently one of the most memorable lines in the movie is the classic the rug really tied the room together which is repeated numerous times throughout the film this is funny because the rug that is so frequently mentioned was urinated on at the very beginning of the movie and it is the only reason why the dude pushes on through the madness during the film another and equally memorable quote in the film is at the very end of the film when the dude utters yeah well the dude abides this laid back comment is so comical because the dude has gone through so much at this point in the film yet he is still content with the way things ended up the memorable dialogue in is credited to the movies brilliant writers joel and ethan coen who also directed the filmanother great component of the coen brothers writing can be seen in the films outrageous story there are so many twists and turns in this movie which just adds to the hilarity of it all the film starts with a bang when the dude returns to his home after grocery shopping and is attacked by two men asking wheres the money lebowski the comedy in this scene comes from the dude getting mistaken for another jeffrey lebowski and being the inciting incident that throws the dude immediately into his absurd quest for a new rug another hilarious part of the film is when john goodmans character walter sobchak the vietnam war vet destroys a corvette he mistakenly thought was a young boys with a crowbar which resulted in the cars true owner smashing the dudes car in any movie no matter how good the writing is the actors must be able to deliver it in a way that is believable in the case of it must also be funny and that is exactly what the actors were able to accomplishthe acting is by far the most important aspect of the entire movie everyone who was cast in was able to deliver every joke with great timing yet make their character believable even though the story is so off the wall jeff bridges portrayal of the dude could not have been better because he was able to make the absurdity going on around him completely believable a great example of bridges ability to do this is in the scene where the dude gets one of his friends ashes thrown in his face while spreading them in the ocean what makes jeff bridges acting so funny in this scene is his stoic face and almost nonexistent reaction john goodman also did a fantastic job as walter in this film as his character goodman had to go from being completely calm to being furious back to acting completely calm in an instant and thats exactly what he did the scene that goodman demonstrates this best is when he pulls a gun on one of his friends for not marking their foul while bowling to this day whenever i see bridges in a film i immediately think of the dudewhile there are many fans of the film it is of course not for everyone the biggest complaint i have heard from the people that i have recommended the movie to has been that while there are many surprises in it the film doesnt really go anywhere which is exactly what i thought the first time i watched the film although i do see their point i think the reason why somebody would say something like this is because what the dude is trying to do is get a new rug since the two men from the beginning of the film peed on his first one this to most people is not a story worth telling or watching but the movie is more about the dudes journey than what he is seeking i would recommend to anybody looking for a good laugh the one piece of advice i would give though is that if you dont like it the first time give it at least one more chance if not two chances all the way through because of the films memorable dialogue ridiculous story and great acting i would give a whole hearted a,black_comedy

best comedy ever made period the characters the setting the overall feeling the cohen brothers knows their craft i mean walter sobchak you cant go wrong with a character like that especially when you cast john goodman for the role and jesus dont forget about jesus never have a character with so little screen time made such an impression this may sound weird but john turturro plays the best alleged rapistself proclaimed bowling king there ever was and he does it wearing a god damned hair neti fall back on this movie when im sad when im happy when im alone or when im with friends i always fall back on this movie if i were to choose one movie to see for the rest of my life this would be the oneplus it always makes me wanna go bowling and get drunk on milk based drinks,black_comedy
when was released in 1998 it wasnt a big hit i was born in 98 since then the movie has generated itself to a cult classic and for some good reasons the story is a typical coen brother story but still stays original the cast did tremendous job representing the characters written for the screen jeff bridges rubbing his eyes before the dude was high in some scenes or john goodmans nailing performance as a sort of john milius lookalike the iconic outfits that you can buy on amazon for halloweenand since i saw the movie for the first time i always after watching it get the need to mix myself a white russian and listen to kenny rogers just dropped in and you know why because its a cult classic,black_comedy
this is its basic virtue  it is a memorable movie for the anthology scenes for humor and more important for its magical art to remind what represents freedom a film about a guy his friends a confusion and a lot of adventures all so simple for become a kind of masterpiece because it is a game with ours dreams frustrations revolts and fears like a christmas tree with so many and differences ornaments than it becomes the only reasonable version of a decent christmas tree sure the performances are great but no surprise because  after its end the only axis for memories is the air of the universe of big lebowsky his carpet and his desire of justice story of a dude and seductive eulogy of total freedom ,black_comedy
without doubt one of the most influential movies of 90s some of the created scenes are so remarkable and memorable you will remember them for its profoundness comedy and repeating dialogue coen brothers created one of the most interesting comedymystery movie that literally is for anyone who appreciate creation of unpleasant and tense but in the same time funny scenes its fantastic how coen brothers managed to create such a powerful movie from simple fact that somebody peed on dudes rug and how all development started at getting some compensation for rug jeff was a perfect cast for dude as he show us skills of great acting walter sobchak played by goodman is one of the funniest characters every created as he brilliantly portraits his and does probably best role of his life in comedy intelligently written and created dialogues that radiate with comedy and seriousness capability of creating interesting scenes that coen brothers are able to do is not easy but they are doing it perfectly 44,black_comedy
is very good at what it sets out to be a funny funny movie with great balconies and even as a genre had minor it still has great balconies the plot is great looks like a movie mobster scorsese very well built and great solutions but in the end reminds us that it is a comedy film and may not be as serious the script makes us fully understand all the characters even some with little screen time photography is great the soundtrack very well embedded with the scenes the performances in this film are expendidas especially john goodman is magnifico as walter sobchak and completely steals every scene in which it appears the setting of the movie is also great and all the great games scenes that the guy is drunk or drugged and shows their trips are sensational although they realize the fragility of special effects some characters also appear in the plot without much reason and others also arise are spectacular and are not used but overall is a comedy film the coen brothers there that is great,black_comedy
joel and ethan coen have stood high in the ranking of some of the best directors in hollywood for the last two decades and still to this today continue to make some of the biggest masterpieces this black comedy starring jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi is a movie that did not perform well with critics nor saw much sunshine at the box office but eventually went on to becoming a cult classic and one of the my favorite comedies to date this film follows jeff lebowski played by jeff bridges a drifter who lives under the name the dude as his name happens to be the same name as a billionaire to matters worse this billionaire is married to a woman who is in serious debt and owes money to some of the most dangerous individuals in los angeles with the dude mistaken as the billionaire played by david huddleston the lebowksis wife bunny lebowski played by tara reid is kidnapped by the dangerous men and orders the dude to get their money with the help of his bowling buddies walter sobchak played by john goodman and donny kerabatsos played by steve buscemi his plan makes a turn for the worst when he gets involved a series of dangerous schemes including corrupt police officers and lebowkskis erotic daughter maude played by julianne moorethe coen brothers are often known for mixing genres in their films this film pervades with a straight balance of comedy with a serious undertone an achievement many black comedies do not do too well nowadays what we get from this picture is a hilarious movie with an entertaining plot though complex solid performances and some of the most memorable characters jeff bridges nails it as the titular character giving sharp dialogue and a clever sense of humor none one could have played jeff lebowski aka the dude better than he jeff bridges fits the bill then john goodman who plays walter sobchak is quite hilarious and delivers some of the most clever lines in the film though his character may have quite a crude personality that is what makes him the funny man he is the rest of the cast hits a home as well the chemistry between jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi works astonishingly well whenever these three hit the screen that is when viewers should be ready for a hilarious good time especially when john turturro comes on screen the humor though not inspiring is nicely written by joel and ethan coen in ways to make it work rather than beat down on clichd gags the only major flaw viewers may encounter is the difficulty connecting with the plot as it does tend to veer some odd directions at various points nonetheless there are plenty of surprises and twists and turns to keep the plot captivatingtakes position as one of the coen brothers best works and one of the comedies of the 1990s thanks to the strong performances by an talented cast clever dialogue surprising humor and solid characters this film is one worth checking out for everyone,black_comedy
centers around the dude wonderfully played by jeff bridges who finds himself and his rug on the wrong end of a mistaken identity caper he is offered a job from another lebowski a millionaire played by david huddlestone to be a courier for the millionaire lebowski and enlists his two friends donny steve buscemi and walter john goodman a former viet nam veteran for help after a series of unfortunate events the dude and his friends find themselves in over their heads and the dude may be on the line for much more than he ever asked for the themes of this film seems to center around misinformation being in the wrong place at the wrong time and manipulation everything about the film seems like it was devised by or is the result of misinformation and being at the wrong place at the wrong time the plan by seems to have already at least have been thought of if not already in motion by the time the dude shows up at his mansion demanding compensation for the rug that was urinated on by the thugs trying to collect a debt from the dude is then coerced into a plan that has him running dangerous errands and meeting all kinds of sketchy characters that he probably would never have run into if it werent for the unfortunate timing and bad luck of this mistaken identify casethe coen brothers do a masterful job of mixed witty and hilarious dialogue with suspense and action all of their films this one included feel like a work of art as opposed to a big budget comedy romp the editing lighting and soundtrack really enhance and contribute on their own right to making this film as great as it is the soundtrack perfectly balances between the dudes hazy lifestyle to opera like signing while a partygoer at jacky treehorns home is thrown into the air in slowmotion on a trampoline the theme of this film has parallels to other films by the coen brothers for example in the film no country for old men the lead character llewelyn moss josh brolin stumbles upon a crime scene one night while out hunting being at the wrong place at the wrong time leads llewelyn down a dark path and finds himself running for his life throughout the film deserves to be talked about as one of the best coen brothers films to date it has a complex and twisting plot that allows for multiple viewings without boredom an all star cast who each masterful carve out their characters in a humorous yet compelling style and the direction and writing from the coens is top notch and will have audiences quoting the dude for many years ahead,black_comedy
the coen brothers created cult followings worldwide when they released this 1998 film noir comedic classic this movie features stellar performances from both jeff bridges and john goodman as the laid back the dude lebowski and the angry vietnam veteran walter who go on a quest to seek compensation for the dudes urinated stained rug and get caught up in a unusual mystery in addition to a hilarious script it features a eclectic soundtrack of the likes of bob dylan captain beefheart and creedence clearwater revival which fits the mood of the movie after seeing this movie i would now put this film amongst my favorites and recommended that everybody see it the dude abides,black_comedy
to me the three funniest american movies ever made are a night at the opera young frankenstein andits really interesting to notice the similarities between the three movies young frankenstein is a spoof of classic horror movies from the thirties is a spoof of classic detective movies from the thirties and forties both movies totally capture the feel of the original genre and feel authentic even when being deliberately funny the dude is a lot like the monster a slow and clumsy but basically goodhearted character who spends most of the movie stumbling around not quite knowing what is going on while the hysterical characters all around him create bizarre complications also notice that both young frankenstein and feature showstopping musical numbers each of which come out of nowhere and feature the rumpled clumsy main character suddenly recast as a dapper song and dance man puttin on the ritz and just stopped in to see what condition my condition is in are both numbers that take an already successful comedy and push it into the realm of a total classic a lot of the humor in parallels the humor of a night at the opera in both movies wealthy society people attempt to boss around deadbeats and eccentrics who soon turn the tables and create all kinds of mischief maude lebowski with her artistic tastes cheerful snobbery and fundamentally gullible nature is a perfect update of the welltodo women margaret dumont always played in the marx brothers classic comedies the difference is that maude is never ever reduced to the role of a simple straight man or woman indeed her wit is often a lot sharper than the dudes the dialog is inane and the plot ludicrous    of course you can imagine where it goes from here he fixes the cable dont be fatuous jeffreythis brings up the final point i want to make about there are no straight men there are no small parts every single character is funny and the effect is dazzling whereas groucho has to be the funniest character in every scene the dude himself is often allowed to step back and allow the weirdness of others to shine this is what makes a unique comedy masterpiece so what keeps this movie from being a perfect ten the ending is a little anticlimactic and the death of a major character dampens the impact also the use of the cowboy character in the bowling alley and as a narrator struck me as being an annoying distraction,black_comedy
was a wonderful film about lifes struggles through the eyes of a cool slacker the plot steers us through a network of rich people problems to the harsh reality of life and death jeff bridges plays the role of the dude absolutely perfectly the dude gets entangled in a twisted kidnapransom plot that introduces a wide variety of personalities walter sobchak john goodman adds energy to the conflict with his crazy rash behavior walters nutty actions help to reinforce the dude as the position of reason hiss antics drive the ransom scenes and help insert excitement into a meaningless sequence walter and the dude escalate the situation by not completely following the kidnappers directions the situation snowballs as the truth is slowly revealed donny steve buscemi does little to influence the plot and is included mainly as comic relief for the first part of the movie his conversations seem distance and irrelevant but in the end his character helps to ground the story and remind of us what really matters in this world maude lebowski julianne moore introduces herself to the situation and gives us some insight about the kidnapping maude is used in this film to convey information about her father played by david huddleston although her role is very helpful her demeanor and snooty personality distracts and pulls attention from the flow of the theme as i watched this great film i felt this sequence could have been routed a bit differently to help the plot instead of hinder it the germans added a good amount of comic relief as their characters helped to tie the whole kidnapping ploy together the nihilists added another dimension to this theme that was meant to make light of the whole abduction this film has a lot in common with the movie raising arizona both films revolve around attempts to extort the rich for money while outlasting crazy and funny events both films become grounded in the end by life and death the lighting in the ransom delivery sequence was extremely appropriate and seemed to mimic the typical suspenseful car ride the music and even the color of walters glasses help to add to the adventurous feeling we were intended to experience in this scene the shot angles during the bowling scenes definitely helped the music to calm our emotions from the conflicts of the kidnapping and peacefully install us back into the mind of the dude i absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone with an open mind this crazy adventure has a little bit of everything exciting sex drugs and rock and roll but also remains grounded expressing the trials of life and death,black_comedy

the coens best film but thats like my opinion man jeff bridges with a careerbest performance he is the dude one of cinemas most charismatic and lovable characters talking about memorable characters john goodmans walter sobchak has some of the best lines of dialogue that the coens have written with perfect timing easily one of the funniest films of the 20th century infinitely rewatchable and quotable sam elliot plays the best depiction of godthatisntgod on screen the coens reinvent the filmnoir genre with their masterpiece the coens are true auteurs and is their finest work to date,black_comedy
follows a peaceful stoner slacker type called the dude jeff bridges as he is pulled into various adventures through a case of mistaken identity the dude is mistaken for a rich man with the same formal name of jeffrey lebowski david huddleston this mans wife bunny tara reid owes money to a pornographer named jackie treehorn and his two thugs rough up the dude looking for repayment while abusing the dude the two thugs pee on his rug and then realize he is the wrong jeffrey lebowski and leave the movie then cuts to the bowling alley and introduces the dudes two bowling team members and good friends walter sobchak john goodman and donny steve buscemi walter observes that the thugs are not the issue but instead the real lebowski is the one who should compensate him for the rug that so nicely tied the room together after confronting the real lebowski and getting nowhere the dude helps himself to a rug that actually belonged to the daughter of the real lebowski maude lebowski julianne moore after leaving the home with the rug the real lebowski calls the dude back the next day and confides in him that his wife bunny was kidnapped the dude agrees to help get the wife back and hilarity ensues through various high jinx created by and around the dude for the remainder of the movie the theme of the movie is a satirical look at many aspects of the american society especially materialism and what our society portrays as the stereotypical man the dude is a peaceful man that endures countless assaults on his personal life and is generally taken advantage of throughout the movie but somehow he comes through the entire process with a positive outlook and seems to be more comfortable in his own skin than almost anyone else in this movie world in the opening he is characterized as an incredible lazy representative of the society and possibly the world but you come to have a great deal of respect for the character and his approach to life by the end of the movie the soundtrack was very effective in setting the tone of various scenes the opening scene features tranquil western tune that seems to fit perfectly with the dudes peaceful outlook on life you could argue that that this tumbleweed in that scene is the dude himself roaming quietly through la the opening credits drew a direct line to the theme through the song the man in me this song helps to highlight that the man in the dude in relation to the world around him the dream sequence featuring the mini movie gutterballs uses the song just dropped in to perfectly frame the dudes drugged mindset quintana is introduced with a spanish version of the hotel california playing in the background which highlights the wonderful eccentric personalities that inhabit la these examples show how the soundtrack helped to highlight the differences between the dude and other men in this microcosm of the world the dialog in the movie was the star of the film to me the movie is a cult classic because of the many humorous exchanges between the characters walter yelling at donnie youre out of your element and the dudes constant humor he fixes the cable really are the backbone of the movie throughout the movie the dude is placed in these very tense situations but he constantly finds humor in the situations dont get me wrong the dude also gets very angry throughout the movie but typically he can move on and dismiss the situation with a simple fu it after some time has passed this shows how this man wont let much get him down even after donnie dies and the bartender mentions donnies death dude has moved on and wont let himself stay down there is something inherently manly in the ideal sense about fighting to never let the world keep you down in the end this movie really pokes fun at the many different version of a man that the director provides and shows the dude in a positive contrast to them nihilists pornographers a millionaire that lies about his success and marries a trophy wife a man stuck in vietnam and a sex offender combined cant hold a candle to the dudes outlook on life they have all chased material possessions and that pursuit has done nothing but hurt them while the dude has floated wonderfully through the movie with this unbreakable positive outlook,black_comedy
this film is quite good every character is freaking awesome and the dialogue is simply golden the one character everyone knows the dude is easily the highlight of this movie hes a lazy easygoing guy who just likes to sit back and let life happen when he gets mixed up into a crazy complex plot the results are quite amusing the second best character is walter a foul mouthed angry vietnam veteran he makes for some hilarious and memorable scenes the plot to this movie is kind of all over the place its never hard to follow or anything but it is everywhere i can see people making the argument that is was a really lazy to put such little effort into the plot if thats your opinion i wont argue with you however i will disagree with you id say lots of effort was put into this plot it seems that a lot of time was put into making it so it could be complex if it wanted to but simple if looked at from a certain point of view that lines up perfectly with the character of the dude he makes the plot seem that way he only focuses on what he cares about and ignores everything else that is actually quite brilliant and i give major points to the coen brothers on that one in the end is a hilarious film and should be seen by everyone,black_comedy
frankly this is the best film the cohen brothers ever made it shows their strength at doing comedy which frankly is what they do bestits not a comedy of gags nor one in which every line is tailored to achieve an effect its an intelligent script fine tuned to make you laugh while you try to catch the underlying messageevery character fills the movie with flavor while jeff bridges as the dude and john goodman as walter sobchak lead the cast some lesser characters such as philip seymour hoffmans brandt and john turturros jesus quintana help to change the pace in the moviethis is one of this movies you watch and like and after some time you see again and find a lot of small little details you missed the first timeits definitely on my top 10 movies of all time a must see,black_comedy
really isnt like most other comedy films but that doesnt mean that it isnt a good comedy it is in fact an excellent comedy filmthe writing in this film is simply outstanding the dialogue and conversations are quirky funny and very creative and smart the coen brothers really are masters when it comes to making this movie there is also a very wide variety of quirky strange and funny characters each with their own personality and most of them give great performancesspeaking of performances there is some excellent acting in this film in particular jeff bridges performance as jeffrey the dude lebowski a lazy casual laid back unemployed bowler john goodman julianne moore sam elliot david huddleston and john turturro also all give great performancesoverall outstanding writing quirky characters and excellent acting make this a fantastic comedy and a fantastic film,black_comedy
official communique from the international order of the brothers shamus in the 16th year of our donald theodore kerabatsos has finally been cracked this ahere story im bout to unfold is a story bout the story itself and i reckon its bout them tellers too the coen brothers what i find so durned interestin is how these fellas spun a golden yarn into them threads that make up that thar rug same said rug that in the parlance of our times tied the room togetherand heres the story once upon a time there were as story it werent no ordinary story now it were a story bout a story  come to think of it a story bout a whole pickle barrel full of stories now this ahere story caused such a warmin inside of me i did hear it agin and agin and then  and then  well i begun to see perplexin things deep in the pile of that thar rug hidden as it were in the warp and the weft why theres a story deeperin i ever figured a story within a story and that thar story within yet another story,black_comedy
this film was absolutely hilarious it had witty remarks and i can say with confidence that i love this movie to start this movie takes a simple complication and just keeps on piling on complication after complication that eventually we would suspect the story would become very complicated and hard to follow but in the main characters dont seem to be affected by all these situations and complications some would say this is bad storytelling but the fact that the main characters acknowledge the difficulties and try to solve them as best they can and being people who are just going where the wind takes them in life you would think that the whole story would end up the same way even if they werent there but no it is the exact opposite anyway onto my verdict of the story coming from the minds of the coen brothers they managed to create a dark witty and hilarious story with twists and bumps causing the story to become so detailed yet with a real tone not a filmreal tone a real down to earth tone i still cant comprehend how they managed to do it this story will keep you entertained and thinking for weeks therefore the story gets a pass from me onto direction i thoroughly enjoy the coen brothers style and in it really worked giving us the exact angle we needed and entertaining us with beautiful shots with dialogue that will not soon be forgotten there isnt much else to say other than i am really looking forward to the next coen brothers film and you should too so as my final rating i am giving a 910,black_comedy
the coen brothers at their hilarious trippy irreverent best not a slackerstoner movie its way better written directed and acted than that dialoguewise its a comedy plotwise its a raymond chandlerlike mysteryits the comedy that makes it though incredibly funny in an offbeat sort of way dialogue is insanely original fresh and simply wonderfulthe performances are spoton i cant imagine anyone other than jeff bridges playing the dude john goodman and steve buscemi are perfect as his sidekicks even the minor parts are played brilliantly john turturro as jesus deserved way more screen time however he may then have stolen the showa brilliant modernday classic,black_comedy
never heard of this movie before this year and i was hesitant about even watching it at all some farcical obscure title with some people apparently calling it a cult classic was i wrong this movie was funny as hell and the lead character the dude played by jeff bridges is a rally likable person you want him to succeed in getting restitution for his soiled carpet even his crew walter sobchak the unstable veteran and donny his other bowling buddy are straight forward rad characters their escapades in the movie are hilariouswe see nihilist thugs loan sharks and a con artist billionaire lebowski with his name confused with that of the dudes this movie is well worth the watch goodman drove the movie and probably played one of his best roles,black_comedy
a way out west there was a fella fella i want to tell you about fella by the name of jeff lebowski at least that was the handle his loving parents gave him but he never had much use for it himself this lebowski he called himself the dude now dude thats a name no one would selfapply where i come from but then there was a lot about the dude that didnt make a whole lot of sense to me and a lot about where he lived like wise but then again maybe thats why i found the place sdurned interesting they call los angeles the city of angels i didnt find it to be that exactly but ill allow as there are some nice folks there course i cant say i seen london and i never been to france and i aint never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says but ill tell you what after seeing los angeles and this a here story im about to unfoldwall i guess i seen something ever bit as stupefying as yad see in any a those other places and in english too so i can die with a smile on my face without feeling like the good lord gypped me,black_comedy
smartly written  strongly performed is a ribtickling ride of mistaken identity brought to screen in a mesmerising manner by the coen brothers deftly directed but faring even better when it comes to screenplay and filled with lots of idiosyncratic characters superbly rendered onscreen by jeff bridges john goodman  others is a hilarious ride through blackmail fraud robbery sex beer  bowling with every event in the film revolving around one mistaken identity and is made all the more gripping through the twists n turns it offers without for once losing its humour bone multiple viewings advised,black_comedy
film plot is centered on a los angeles dude who is a real slacker pot smoking white russian drinker soon to be hero solving a crime mystery he happens to have the same name as a millionaire jeffrey lebowski played by david huddleston whose wife bunny lebowski tara reid was kidnapped and owes money to a known pornographer we are introduced to the dude as he is shopping for milk and he opened the carton and sniffed it the dude wrote a check for 69 cents and returns home it appears that he is unaware that someone is waiting on him and they attack him in the apartment one of the hit men urinates on his rug his prized possession that ties the apartment together says the dude the dude enlists his bowling buddies whom we meet in regular league play his main antagonist and best friend played by john goodman as walter sobchak we soon learn that walter is a practicing jew who observes the shabbos day of rest walter refuses to lift a finger on the day of rest but manages to convince the dude that he needs to find the millionaire jeffrey lebowski and get his rug replaced walter drives the car on the shabbos and says he is just doing it to help out but turns out he is creating more trouble for the dude the millionaire jeffrey lebowski is in a wheelchair but convinces the dude he needs to deliver the ransom money alone so his kidnapped wife will return the dude becomes a crime fighting urban cowboy they go through the motions of delivering the money and in the meantime they say f it lets go bowling park the car in a handicapped zone with the ransom money in it when they walk outside the car is gone panic ensues and walter always says shut the f up donny played by steve buscemi donny never really gets to say much in the film but walter always tells him the same thing we get introduced to the millionaires sister maude lebowski portrayed by julianne moore maude was a nude artist who created her works of art while riding in ceiling harness she believed the ransom money was kept by the dude but he proves to her that there was no money and he was used by her brother as a scapegoat the millionaire still has the money the pornographer hires hit men thugs to find the money once they determine there is no money they punch the dude in the face so hard we see  hear fireworks and then he is flying through the sky like superman then he lands in the bowling alley the dude tackles all his problems inside the walls of the bowling alley the punch perpetuates him therewalters character gets so out of hand he pulls a gun on another bowler because he wants to bowl on shabbos this is not going to happen the police are called but they run right by the pair in the parking lot they are not even the least bit frazzled about the police being there we see them running into the alley with guns pulledthe music ties the scenes together in the movie when the action elevates to a point where they cant handle it anymore the say lets go bowling magically through sound they end up there bowling always confronted by larger than life egos and it becomes quite funny how much animosity and hate both lash at each other one of the teams they are to play against become real aggressive and say no one messes with jesus john turturro that is the bowlers name we get a flashback which is so comical showing jesus as a pedophile going door to door announcing to the neighborhood that he lives there music takes us from the bowling alley through that flashback it is a funny movie showing that even slackers can be heroes maude found a purpose for the dude as she wanted him to be a sperm donor only she wanted a child she was beyond weird but the dude liked her style at the conclusion of the film donnie dies from shock of seeing the dudes car on fire he was not up for all the problems and confrontations that walter and dude went through he was much more fragile than they imagined best part is he didnt die alone his best friends were there till the end many times over this movie had music transition the picture forward the voices were covered by different rock songs and special effects transferred everyone to the next scene just by mere suggestion we were walking in the bowling alley at every problem i loved how they glorified some of the bowling scenes especially with the dude going underneath about 50 women down the approach looking up at their crotches sometimes even the dude was embarrassed by what he wished would happen he couldnt look up at the women he floated upside down the approach of the bowling alley ashamed of his own thoughts or more like daydreams the dude became a crusader of crime not youre likely candidate to solve a mystery he did it with the help of donnie and walter despite the constant arguing and bickering between the three the arguing was the craziest thing that kept them going for most it would drive them apart i never imagined this would be a crime mystery movie that was so cleverly written that the dude seems like someone from real life and not a character at all he feels so real thats what makes this movie so special anyone can be a hero you just gotta believe in yourself even if youre a slacker,black_comedy
outrageously zany offbeat comedy the likes only the coen brothers can provide life is tough for the pot smoking allround slacker jeffrey lebowski more commonly referred to as the dude jeff bridges in one of the most defining roles of his career sharing his last name with a millionaire hes victimized by thugs who mistake him for that rich man who owes them a debt a situation which finds his beloved rug in ruin after having been urinated upon by the perpetrators when he visits his namesake to try and get him to pay for its cleaning he soon gets more than he bargained for as he finds himself caught up in what appears to be a kidnap of the wealthy mans trophy wife but swiftly explodes into a bizarre inexplicable potpourri of events beyond anybodys control or understanding thanks to the involvement of a host of wacky maniacal and thoroughly enjoyable characters ranging from feministnihilist artists and pornographers to white russians and generally random folk annex narrators yet all the dude asked for was a clean rug and an opportunity to win the local bowling alleys competition he trained so hard for with his two best buddies john goodman with severe anger management problems and steve buscemi who cant take a hint when hes asked to shut up the coens dont ask you to make sense of it all they just want you to roll with it pun intended as the dude does himself nevertheless despite this absence of a clearly defined plot or more likely because of it proves all kinds of fun the pair of directors used the same tactic a decade later with burn after reading to similar results proving them the masters of this subgenre of nonsensicomedy for the record i just made that term up and i hope it catches on in both cases they were aided by an impressive cast of character actors andor movie stars who felt like doing something different for a change ins case including philip seymour hoffman john turturro julianne moore and sam elliott though the film was met with moderately tempered critical reviews and disappointing box office results back in 1998 time has proved the coens right as it has since become a widely accepted cult classic with serious tendencies towards an eventual seemingly unavoidable shedding of the moniker cult when burn after reading came along in 2008 the majority of both audience and critics finally understood this type of film and that movie did much much better business accordingly,black_comedy
come on this is the best film ever i even raising this above lotr since this is contemporary i grew up living like the dude the dude reminds me of my unclenot in a bad way but with deep respect to living ones own lifethe coen brothers have created a film to be topped if it was possible barton fink was greatfargo yeah it was exceptional storytelling but the dude  that was wellcrafted cinemathe only other film that i have seen of theirs that captured me as much was no country for old mencant wait for the next surprise,black_comedy
funniest movie ive ever seenvery good performances strong script very well directed deserved an oscar for me jeff bridges and john goodman should have deserved an oscar or at least a nomination its not that kind of comedy which is funny and at the half of the movie the jokes start to get annoying the whole movie keeps you entertained at least i didnt want the movie to end the only thing that bothered me is that they havent done a part 2 i want to know what is going to happen to the dude and walter i dont really care about other characters really that doesnt mean that the other actors werent good i really would love if it lasted more1010,black_comedy
in this eccentric comedycrime film by the coen brothers they created an outstanding movie the actorsactress in the film was perfectly unified in a great way that audience could build a vision of the plot if you can handle the graphic dialogue used and suggestive behavior this is the right movie for you the theme of the film is jeff dudelebowski jeff bridges discovers he is a victim of mistaken identity thugs were sent to his home by jackie treehorn ben gazzara to recover a debit big lebowskis the millionaire wife owes him before the thugs realize they have the wrong lebowski and that hes the dude they urinate of his rug leaving dude in disgust dude pays biglebowski david huddleston a visit to be compensated for his rug being destroyed big lebowski filled with arrogance felt he was there looking for a hand out dude felt the conversation wasnt getting anywhere and decided he would take a rug from lebowski home to be evenwhen bunny tara reid disappears lebowskis wife big lebowski contacts dude making him an offer to be the bagman the only thing dude has to do is deliver the ransom money for bunny dude brings walter john goodman along to make the drop when the drop goes to pieces it creates a ricochet of others trying to reclaim the ransom money while home listening to the soothing sounds of the bowling pins being knocked down he discovers 3 people standing over him they knocked him out and he begins to hallucinate the lighting becomes dark with bright lights in the sky as he floats in sky during the hallucination dude see the rug he confiscated from big lebowskis he is woken once his bowling ball drops him back to the surface after coming back to reality dude is greeted by a women flying through the air on a stripe line in the nude maude lebowski julianne moore dude and maude forms a relationship dude without realizing has been sized up to be a sperm donor of her child dude experienced many encounters because he was trying to clear his identity after having sex with maude and enjoy a marijuana joint at that moment dude realized the reasoning behind the mistaken identity fiasco in conclusion as a motif in the film dude was the main characters name however it was used as a common word of expression during dialogue dude was able to regain his identity and continued being the old lazy laid back unemployed and bowler from southern california,black_comedy
like most of the coen brothers movie this movie deserves to be seen again and again i watched it with my family with my girlfriend and with my friends i probably have seen it 20 times so far i watched lots of movies in my life movies that made me cry made me laugh made me think however ive never seen a movie like this movie has everything in it and every time you watch it you realize something new thats the beauty of itall the actors in the movie did their jobs perfectly especially jeff bridges john goodman and john turturro by the way if you get yourself a white russian cocktail when you watch the movie it doubles the pleasure that you will get from the movie ,black_comedy
is an brillianthilariousfunny comedy and a true cult classic filled with great directiona wonderful castfantastic scriptmemorable characters and a fantastic soundtrackis one of the funniest films of all time and the coen brothers at their bestset in los angelescalifornia in the early 1990stells the story of jeff the dude lebowskijeff bridgesa stoner from the 1960s who loves getting stonedbowlingwhite russianshis carpet rug and creedance clearwater revival and lives a pretty normal life then one night the dude is attacked by two thugs who mistake the dude for millionaire jeff lebowskidavid huddlesonand urinate on the dudes rug this case of mistaken identity puts the dude in a tale of intrigue and mystery where he meets various characters and laughs and chaos ensueis one of the best comedies of all time and is a hilarious film from beginning to end that didnt get much attention at the time came out two years after the coen brothers masterpiece fargo which was critically acclaimed and won many movie awards and then after the coen brothers did fargo they releasedwhich did modest business at the box office and received mixed reviews from criticsmost critics seeing as a failure compared to fargo but since its release in 1998has become a one of the all time great cult filmsone of the funniest movies of all time and is now seen as a classic from critics and audiences and one of the coen brothers best films one of the reasons is such great movie is that the coen brothers have taken the taken the filmnoir style and influence of raymond chandlers the big sleepfilm and noveland set in los angeles in the early 1990s where instead of long coats and a tough detective its long hair and a stoner the comedy and humor in this film is hilarious and it mostly based on the situations and dialog and the various characters that the dude meets or comes in contact with and each character the dude meets gets weirder and stranger and each character that comes in contact with the dude is unpredictable and surprising tbl has a filmnoir influence because the film has intrigue and mystery but in tbl the intrigue and mystery is slightly off kilter and it seems like every character in the film including the dude is messed up in the head and you never know whats going to happen next its filmnoir told from a stoners point of view and its ingenious and original tbl also has episodic feel to it where the film and its characters go from one thing to the next and the plot is complex but not hard to understand and it adds to the great outlandish and hilarious tone of the film the photography by roger deakins is beautiful and surreal and colorful making the los angeles city and landscape look amazing and bright and adds to the films comic tone and greatness jeff the dude lebowski is one of the most iconic characters in the history of film because as soon as comes on the screen the dude has this great presence and style and you just never forget him whats also great about the dude is that he is a slacker and stoner and doesnt care who knows about it and the dude has a down to earth style all of his own and he doesnt try to be cool he just is although not a private detective in the traditional sense like phillip marrlow or sam spadethe dude evokes the same style as those two great characters as investigates and tries to solve a mystery and the way the dude deals with characters whether its his friends or other characters is funny and classic the dude is a character that will be remembered forever the screenplay joel and ethan coen is amazing and wellwritten with every main character saying hilarious lines and dialog that very quotable and memorable the ending of the film is funnytragic and ironic and is a truly classic coen brothers ending that adds to the greatness ofthe whole cast does great jobs in their roles jeff bridges is excellent and hilarious in his most iconic role as jeff the dude lebowskiwith bridges bringing laughs and coolness to the role john goodman is brilliant and hilarious as waltera vietnam veteranwhos the dudes best friend and bowling teammate and goodman has great scenes and chemistry with bridges julianne

read it here httpsqueerelistblogspotcom201306thebiglebowski 1998htmljeff the dude lebowski is a professional slacker and amateur bowler who spends his days drinking white russians dressed in a robe and plastic sandals two thugs break into his apartment and beat him up to get his money they soon realize they got the wrong jeffrey lebowski his dudeness then decides to meet this millionaire lebowski to get compensation for his damaged rug that was peed on during the incident afters trophy wife is kidnapped the dude is in charge of delivering the ransom to get her back marks a high point in the coen brothers career they created an icon of the 90s with the dude he became a godlike figure for many a guy adored by a generation thanks to his unique philosophy and style i dont think the dude could have been interpreted by a better actor than jeff bridges he rocks the laidback attitude with a disconcerting comfort not to mention that his hair is so sleek im hypnotized by it the bridgesgoodmanbuscemi trio is hilarious and the additional characters portrayed by talented actors like julianne moore or philip seymour hoffman are the cherries on top of this psychedelic cake is one quotable masterpiece punctuated with bizarre dreamy scenes specific to the coen bros i dont know what they are on when they write their screenplays but i sure want some i really like the soundtrack that features bob dylan among others the plot suddenly becomes secondary and my main pleasure is to watch jeff bridges evolve in the dudes colorful pants side by side with the wrathful veteran mastered by john goodman the characters and situations crack me up because theyre all so incredible the story is narrated by a cowboy the villains are german nihilists and john turturro who appears only for a few seconds on screen is a bowlersexoffender named jesus if that isnt random brilliance i dont know what is1 reason to watch indulge in enjoying tbl dudestyle with a guiltfree white russian or 9,black_comedy
in every great directors career there is a film where all the stars align the script is perfect the acting is impeccable and the movie seems to just magically fall into place the coen brothers could have not put together a more well balanced and enjoyable film this is there defining moment this will be there masterpieceyears later audiences still enjoy the story of the dude jeff bridges and his laid back approach to life not to mention his love of bowling with his eclectic mix of friends  walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi this is a tale of intrigue and layered complexity that is only reserved for the finest of films with stellar performances by the whole cast including a legendary performance by john turturro as the jesusas we wait for the next generation to discover this cinematic gem this film will abide as will the dude,black_comedy
yet another absolutely perfect masterpiece of a film from the coen brothers these brothers seem to be masters at the medium of film every single line of dialogue in this movie has a way of being seen as funny even if you can find a line in the film that isnt very obviously comedic the film is genius in the way that through all its seeming simplicity through all that it seems to focus on the ridiculous plight of a stoner attempting to solve a mystery it harbors a deep philosophy a sort of live and let live philosophy in other words the dude abides the three main performances those of john goodman jeff bridges and steve buscemi are expertly played as are the majority of the roles including philip seymour hoffman julianne moore and john turturro also the music in the film as some people have pointed out is much like a character in the film and it just fits right in there to quote the stranger the movie is fantastically rewatchable one could probably watch it once a day and not grow weary of it because its incredibly funny quotable and genius,black_comedy
when the coens want to be funny and smart and put violence and stupidity every passing minute all in that in a movie the answer is not only can be one of the best films of the coen brothers but also as one of the funniest movies ever made the coens once again manage to put all his humor and intellect in a comedy written and directed as well everything in the movie sound coen material the story itself is when the unforgettable the dude lebowski jeff bridges is mistaken for a millionaire with the same surname lebowski two thugs urinate on his rug to force him to pay a debt he did not even know dude seeks and finds the other lebowski david huddleston not only earned a reward for the ruined rug and also accepts a job at one time as payoff dude then asks the help of his bowling buddy walter john goodman a guntoting converted to judaism with serious anger issues the little work leads to a huge mess which leads to more trouble and soon seems that everyone from the porn empire tycoons and improvised criminals want something from the dude the whole movie is full of coen elements black humor moments of absurd violence but it is never a negative point in the coen films but a great talent especially in its bigblack comedy and as always a fantastic direction from joel coen director with amazing shots of scenes one example is a scene where we see the bowling ball inside of it running and the writing as always very strong in delivering extremely funny and smart dialogs leaving the movie extremely entertaining to watch when the coen duo want to make a very funny and intelligent movie with a fantastic direction and writing and just with a formidable cast with phenomenal performances especially bridges and goodman with very entertaining and superb performances i must say they are the best on delivery,black_comedy
ill be honest  i adore this movie  however i find that it is not for everyone  if you are looking for a traditional comedy this is not it  the thing that this comedy has are colorful and creative flairs unlike any another  first off  the story is about a midaged hippie the dude who is mistaken to be a millionaire by two goons  they claim the dude owes them money and subsequently urinate on his rug  later on the dude goes to the millionaire and complains about the urinated rug  this is where the story unfolds to be a fusion of hippie culture  odd personalities and funny twists  resulting to be a creative perfection  i give the coen brothers props for creating such well thought characters and having them creatively adjust to the entourage  as for the acting  i would say that bridges and goodman were perfect  this movie is a must for all you folks who love nontraditional comedies ,black_comedy
i rented this movie and watched it immediately as soon as it was over i watched it again and again and again this may not be as funny as other comedies like the hangover but it has clever characters and clever dialogue that keep the movie movingthe film focuses on the events in the life of jeffery the dude lebowski and how through a case of mistaken identity he is forced to save a millionaires kidnapped wife unfortunately for the dude and his slightly psychotic friend walter that means facing nihilists pornographers and 15yearold thievesi especially recommend this movie for fans of the coen brothers if youve seen at least one of their movies and enjoyed it then you will love,black_comedy
its two separate subplots biggest mistake people make is trying to tie it all together with one single ruglike themeplot 1 as the coens have often admitted they were using chandlers big sleep as their first model a meaningless complex twisty noir mystery as the main plot while adding other subtle little messages here its like a copy of lynchs blue velvet which shows that the simplicity and innocence of small towns like fargo or 50s america ie the bowling alley are long gone and if you poke your innocent nose into the mystery of the hidden underbelly of society organized greed deception violence etc you are going to get hurt by it which the dude was lessons just let it go curiosity killed the cat revenge isnt worth it stay above all the dirty behaviors that run modern society the age of innocence is overplot 2 lbjs famous 1965 quote to the canadian prime minister who criticized american policy in vietnam you came into my living room and pssed on my rug is the starting point here like walter john goodman a group of vietnamera grudgeholders cheney rumsfeld perle others waited 30 years to find some clueless stoned knuckleheaded dude bush jr they could manipulate into redeeming the honor of the us by not allowing our nation to be pushed around on the world stage this aggression will not stand bush jr working on a whole other agenda was seeking more personal ruglike revenge for his dad who was supposedly humiliated by not destroying saddam and iraq in gulf war i walter and dude also had totally different agendas here but toward the same outcome lessons pride will get you in trouble the past is the past revenge isnt worth it vietnam is overlet it go or risk crippling the us economy by focusing so much on global pssing contests while everyone else is making stuff blissful postwar 50s america is all gone now but maybe some of us can just go back to bowling and live a simple lifelots of other little interesting comments in here about nixons love of bowling religion nihilism etc are just that symbolic commentary about the world there is no bigger meaning thereyoung people ask how did this all happen president dwight eisenhower warned us if we dont pay attention the militaryindustrialcongress complex what we now call global corporations would get too much power and wreck the country with their greed and arrogance we didnt listen next time around abide the warning,black_comedy
jeffrey lebowski the other lebowski may be sidetracked by caucasions doobies and a league bowling schedule but the dude jeff bridges our hero without a cause is left to fend for himself with nothing but an overbearing bowling buddy the brilliantly annoying john goodman the dude is a pacifist among nihilists neoartisans philanthropists and of course bowlers lest we not forget the tremendous julianne moore as pretentiously liberated maude lebowski who utters the best lines of the movie the soundtrack unfolds as sam elliott narrates and the dude abides from the dream movie gutterballs to bridges who carries the hippie torch for the deadbeat unemployed yet amply selfnumbed generation comedy cameos and coen brothers chaos rule this classic cult piece,black_comedy
this is a welldeserved cult classic i wont call it chandleresque even if it is based loosely really loosely dood on the long goodbye its a standalone comedy in its own right and the characters are totally off the wall and completely credible its filled with laughoutloud funny scenes the spreading of the ashes on the ocean is a stand out john goodman is huge and john turturro is totally over the topthe movie bears repeated watching over the years and youll appreciate the small things more as you stop following the plot and start following the bits that are going on during the scenes,black_comedy
excuse me all of you who loved this moviei really dont understand what the hype is all about im sorry butallow me pinpoint some aspectsis the movie funny yeah a little it shows a lot of acid humor and sarcasm  which by the way i loveotherwise the movie lacks of consistency or let me say a spinal cordit has great specific moments of excellencealthough is not enough for pasting all of them into a unique brightness piece the storyline in general is poorin my opinionsometimes i felt as if the movie has just stopped look burn after reading for instanceits the most great movie of coen brothersi loved it the main characters are great in despite of their just passable interaction highlighting jesus who was by far my favorite characterappealing flashy arrogant and clueless at the same time on the background ive enjoyed the subject specially the greed which is continuously at our side all the time live and see how petty and greedy people are bottom line if you are looking for a deep and dense experience under coens label this is not the right movie try no place for old country fargo or mainly burn after reading,black_comedy
ive been hearing about this flick since it was released people quote it people use images as avatars there is definitely a cult following to itlast evening i could not sleep i finally dialed this up on netflixi liked it i really liked it it is very much in the offbeat camp of things jeff bridges sometimes rubs me the wrong way for some reason not in this movie he nailed the dude nice jobthe caper was interesting too zany but compellingmay not hit me quite the same way as others but it is worth watching and having a few chuckles,black_comedy
high on my list of desert island movies lebowski is an endlessly rewarding modern classic that seems to yield something fresh with every screening jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi may have been able to carry this thing by themselves staggered around a rickety old bowling lane with just a wardrobe and a copy of the coen brothers script but when their performances are matched by a blindingly colorful supporting cast a plot that swerves around like a drunken driver and the brothers unmistakable eye for subtlety the end result is pure magic i could watch this three times a year and never get tired of it,black_comedy
revolves around a case of mistaken identity complicated by extortion doublecrosses deception embezzlement sex marijuana and gallons of white russians jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges one of the laziest men in la county which would put him high in the running for laziest worldwide enjoys hanging with his bowling buddies guntoting exvietnam vet walter sobchak john goodman and mildmannered exsurfer donny steve buscemi when the dude lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire lebowski david huddleson two thugs urinate on his rug that really tied the room together 1998 to coerce him into paying a debt he knows nothing about while attempting to gain compensation for the ruined rug from his wealthy counterpart he accepts a onetime job with a high payoff and enlists the help of walter deception leads to more trouble and it soon seems that everyone from porn empire tycoons to nihilists want something from the dude the main theme of is disunity all of the relationships among the elements in the film may seem to be enigmatic with each other but this style of film creates an integrated system of disunity the coen brothers like guy ritchie and his movies snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels constantly use in their films divergence to leave the viewer and the characters in disarray with the plot in the film the main character jeffery lebowski refers to himself as the dude this element of the story becomes a motif the dude is referred to and refers to himself as the dude because it represents his personality which is an easygoing cool character the common western society slang which is associated with the word dude is male prostitute as the stranger says in his opening monologue theres a name no man would selfapply where i come from 1998 the dude is continuously used by his friends and business associates through out the whole film although presented as a laidback cool character the dudes title is representative of how he is seen by everyone around himbowling is a major part of the film the art of bowling is played as a highly stylized ritual and several dreamacid flashback sequences center around the game many different camera angles are used in bowling sequences from the up close shots of bowling balls on the lanes to the almost cartoony dream sequences of the dude one camera angle in particular that best represents the film is when the dude is dreaming and he is miniaturized and ends up inside a ball rolling down the lane the camera rolling around and around ceiling to floor with occasional glimpses of the pins and the bowler represents the jumbled topsyturvy world of the dude in the film he never knows which way is up and what to believe the entire film the dude is left confused by the situation in which he has found himself in and every time he thinks he has it figured out he is tossed in another direction that only leads to more confusion and befuddlementthe theme of is eclectic with its different motifs and divergent storyline and the best way to summarize it comes from the opening monologue and the strangers introduction of the dude way out west there was this fella i wanna tell ya about goes by the name of jeff lebowski at least that was the handle his loving parents gave him but he never had much use for it himself see this lebowski he called himself the dude now dude  theres a name no man would selfapply where i come from but then there was a lot about the dude that didnt make a whole lot of sense and a lot about where he lived likewise but then again maybe thats why i found the place so darned interestin see they call los angeles the city of angels but i didnt find it to be that exactly but ill allow it as there are some nice folks there course i aint never been to london and i aint never seen france and i aint never seen no queen in her damned undies so the feller says but ill tell you what  after seeing los angeles and this here story im about to unfold well i guess i seen somethin every bit as stupefyin as youd seen in any of them other places and in english too so i can die with a smile on my face without feelin like the good lord gypped me now this here story im about to unfold took place in the early 90s  just about the time of our conflict with sadm and the iraqis i only mention it because sometimes theres a man i wont say a hero cause whats a hero sometimes theres a man and im talking about the dude here  the dude from los angeles sometimes theres a man well hes the man for his time and place he fits right in there and thats the dude the dude from los angeles and even if hes a lazy man  and the dude was most certainly that quite possibly the laziest in all of los angeles county which would place him high in the runnin for laziest worldwide sometimes theres a man sometimes theres a man well i lost my train of thought here but aw hell ive done introduced it enough,black_comedy
on watchability i have a tendency aided and abetted by netflix to find a really great movie and then watch it over and over before the big labowski it was mr hulots holiday and before that the seven samurai in this regard tbl holds a special place since it seems to be made especially for this kind of movie watching it has a consistent a texture that feels soothing the comfortable chair and tbl have a way of mergingon walt all of the dudes problems are caused by his buddy walt walt was the one who put the burr under his saddle about the rug without walt the rug incident would have been quickly lost in the haze that is the dudes life at every turn it is walt who drags the reluctant dude further into the mess my son summed up the dude perfectly when he said that all he wanted throughout the film was to be left alone but walt is motivated and he wont leave the dude alone walts constant prodding is the mcguffin of tblyes walt is a jinx but a lovable jinx in fact i would argue that john goodman comes close to stealing the movie from jeff bridges someone has remarked that goodmans genius comes from the fact that his personality is so much smaller than his enormous body  he dominates the screen with his body but comes across as a cute puppy dogon style like other coen brothers movies and like so many british comedies from the golden era of the 50s and 60s tbl cleverly hides many of its funny parts for us to discover for example why does the dude run instead of walk back to his home after buying the halfandhalf answer to connect with the white russian as soon as possibleon society now a challenging question before a certain point in time somewhere in the 60s or 70s tbl would never have seen the light of day because of its use of bad language it repeats the anglo saxon word 281 times and without the bad language tbl would not be tbl the question is this were we better off in the days of movie censorship and humphrey bogart or is the degradation of our language and everyday life adequately compensated by movie gems like this one to put it another way has being entertained become our reason for being,black_comedy

man do i love this movie ive seen it a few times and it gets better with each viewing jeff bridges character is one that could not have been played better by anyone  this is one of those roles that seems so perfect so real that it will forever define the actor who played it jeff bridges will always be the dudei also loved the roles that john goodman and steve buscemi played goodmans manic vietnam vet is hilariously earnest and buscemi has an uncharacteristically quiet role which is put to great comedic effect in relation to goodman one of the little things i like so much about this movie is the portrayal of the friendship between the three characters it feels completely natural which may say a lot about me and my friends i love this aspect of the moviethe dialog is superb and there are many throw away lines that you may miss if youve only seen it once a wonderful film that just gets better with age,black_comedy
could be considered one of the greatest films of all time in the film jeffery lebowski or the dude as he is more commonly known jeff bridges is a lazy man who enjoys bowling smoking weed drinking white russians and listening to classic rock especially creedence clearwater revival his life does not seem to extend beyond these simple pleasures nor does the dude seem interested in branching out the dude abides as he says in self reference this all changes when a couple of thugs try to shake him down for money owed by another man named jeffery lebowski and one of them urinates on the dudes rug the dude is convinced by his friend walter played by john goodman to go to the rich jeffery lebowski and ask him to replace the rug thus begins the dudes story which involves a ransom kidnapping mystery doublecrosses sex and severed digitsthe theme of is difficult to define at first but perhaps it is best summed up by the stranger played by quintessential cowboy sam elliot who says sometimes theres a man who well hes the man for his time and place thats the dude in los angeles that being said the entire film seems to be an elaboration on this statement although the dude is a painfully ordinary man he finds himself in an extraordinary situation and the audience is given the opportunity to see how he handles himself every character in the film is ordinary however as the story progresses the power players the criminal masterminds and the femme fatal are all exposed to be just ordinary people lashing out in various ways as they do what they think they have to in order to survive through their collective actions however and extraordinary situation is created this statement on human nature and especially the social implications of los angeles culture during the early 90s is both fascinating and hilarious this integration of normal people and strange circumstances are characteristic of coen brother screenplays and although not as dry as fargo there are definite similarities in theme the main difference in is that each of the characters seem to see themselves as some romanticized hollywood character each is the hero in their story the one exception to this being the dude who is just happy to be himself but gets caught in everyone elses storiesthe theme is enhanced by the natural lighting techniques employed throughout the film the bowling alley scenes are all awash in harsh fluorescent lighting every detail and flaw of the middleaged and mostly out of shape characters is bared for the cameras in fact most of the locations in the film appear to use the natural lighting with only minor enhancements if necessary these are all ordinary places full of ordinary people along these same lines the music for the film is wonderful tbone burnett the musical archivist for the film chose an eclectic mix of music from bob dillon to captain beefheart nina simone to piero piccioni with surprises such as the gypsy kings covering hotel california and even some breathy erotic chanting the soundtrack is where the egos of these ordinary people can flourish and the song for every scene is perfect considering the character of the chief protagonistantagonist the music allows the audience to see what each character hopes that they are projecting despite their extremely human behavior if this point was not obvious enough the nihilists including red hot chili peppers bassist flea actually carry a boombox blasting german techno when they attack the dude and his friends the are just ordinary people in an extraordinary situation acting in very human ways while projecting hollywood egoskudos goes to the coen brothers and a fantastic cast for this incredible film,black_comedy
although it is not the most high brow entertainment out there and its host of amazingly idiosyncratic characters is mentally stimulating and for the most part laugh out loud funnywe follow the dude who happens to fall into a host of unsettling and hilarious events all due to the name jeffry lebowski of which he shares with a multi millionaire whose young wife is kidnappedone of the best movies of all time for seriously good one liners many of which i find myself repeating on a day to day basis i am what you would call a little obsessed with this movie but i still think that for anyone looking for a beautifully shot well written pitch black comedy with a kick ass soundtrack this movie is a must see,black_comedy
i firmly believe that if you do not find to be an extraordinarily funny film then there is something fundamentally wrong with you jeff bridges is absolutely fantastic as the dude a total burnout that is simply drifting through life and is caught up in an unlikely series of absolutely hysterical events john goodman and steve bushemi are outstanding as the dudes close friends and the exchanges between them are pure comedy gold this is a brilliant nonformula movie that is everything i wish hollywood would be all the timevery funnyuniquely creative and well acted and directed take the time to see if you have not already and if you have see it again,black_comedy
what a strange film but heck it is funny and grabs your attention from the opening scene only the coen brothers can get away with a movie like this thanks to a very smart script and great performances from the entire cast i think that the coen brothers are the best at casting the right actors for the right parts because every actor seems to make their best film in a movie directed by the coens jeff bridges gives one of his best performances as the dude a very complex character who seems to live his life playing bowling smoking weed and drinking white vodka all the time then there is john goodman who gives his best performance to date as well with his character who has some anger management issues and always lives in the past reminding everyone when he gets the chance that he is a vietnam war veteran steve buscemi plays a completely different role from the ones he is used to playing he does not even talk that much this time around and finally john turturro who had a very small part playing a hispanic pedophile named jesus but who was just hilarious in every scene this is not your typical buddy comedy this is much more than that it takes things from different genres and makes this a completely original comedy even the strange dream sequences serve as a sort of lowering and rising the curtains for the next act you cannot have a successful comedy without a good script and has an excellent and funny script this is my favorite coen comedy and will always be the standard for their future comedies who else could make a movie about a man trying to get his rug back and making it so complex with other movies such as fargo and no country for old men the brothers prove they can direct any film genre,black_comedy
crisp elegant and tightlyplotted with no loose ends the titular protagonist of this thriller is a heavyweight business tycoon a korean veteran warhero disabled but not crippled with a charming daughter and a devoted second wife famous for his charitable enterprises he has an alias who might be known as the sherlock holmes of los angeles an amateur gentleman sleuth with the professional wellhoned acumen of someone with a naturally keen intellect this is no dud but a man of intrepid action ably supported by the alley irregulars a couple of greathearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists there are many twists and turns and surprises along the way what was the significance of the phantom kidnapping how did the hollywood bigshot producer get involved why did the police chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished stateoftheart apartment micturated upon at the end you know there was something down there the acting throughout this gripping tale is stellar the dialogue is courteous and refined but unfailingly witty there are a number of dream sequences reminiscent of salvador dali possibly owing something to alfred hitchcock in one of his more surreal moods two animals a marmot and a pomeranian play significant roles as the enigma unravels several forensic crime investigators are called in there is also a sagacious narrator acting as a sort of greek chorus lucidly explaining the intricacies of the background to the interplay of the charactersmake sure you see this masterpiece before you die its right up there with chainsawagogo and bimbo cheerleaders from outer spacenought out of four found this review useful i love this movie and have watched it countless times get a life,black_comedy
when i saw this movie the next day my brother asked me if i liked it and i said him yeah okey why asked again him and i said i cant tell you you have to see it only if you see it youll understand am i excessive no im not this is not only a fantastic film very well made is much more than this the dude is a life style another way of live is like paul lafargues book the right to be lazy and its magic like never before i felt completely trapped by the characters the dude and also walter possibly one of the greatest characters ever man i love him hes a hero i dont know my next dog will be called walter and if my dog respected his name he would be a crazy sick mental dog but also charmingoh man or i should say dude please see it you wont sorry,black_comedy
every now and then in a lifetime something called comes rolling into my sick world the film follows the story of a disillusioned eagles obsessive by the name of jeff bridges whos tubwaggled into a world of stolen cars blown toenails and marmots once satisfied to idolize richard nixon to the tune of an all eagles soundtrack the dude finds himself tugged crotch first into a world of international intrigue supporting roles includes a militant rosie odonnel as the dudes brother in law and shooting partner walter and steve buscemi as creedence fan john turturro in short this film is perfect for anyone who harbors a love for the eagles bowling and white russians take er easy dude,black_comedy
this movies just great jeff bridges was brilliant and he definitely deserved an oscar for the dude im usually a fan of coen brothers ever since they made their first movie blood simple and they havent disappointed since sure theyve made a couple of average movies but never a bad movie not so far at least john goodman was also great if not the funniest character in this movie his character is just brilliant a guy that turned jewish since hes married his wife who left him always talking about vietnam and about how he saw his friends with their faces in the mud even when theyre talking about potatoes for instance and so on and so on i cant find any mistakes in this film except that i would have really loved to see a bit more of steve buscemi the script and the directing are also great as expected from coen brothers violence is just in line not overdone and not underdone and the music is just brilliant this is a well packed very well written mix of black comedy and a thriller thats way too intelligent to be dumb and way too dumb to be intelligent a masterpiece,black_comedy
its a really funny solid movie i totally think you should watch it if you havent seen it and if you have then ill see you at lebowskifest in seattle 2010goodmans crowning achievement in acting bridges delivering lines with the white russian in his mouth poor donnie everything about this one screams new classic which can be said of many of the brothers other filmsbut this has all been repeated adnauseum i am simply trying to stretch this to 10 lines so i can submit itso stop reading this go watch it if you havent seen it you wont be sorry,black_comedy
back in 1998 i rented based on the reputation of the coen brotherss previous film fargo without any real expectations my brother and i proceeded to watch it and by the end we were in agreement we had just seen the funniest movie of all time more than ten years later the film has aged gracefully and if its not necessarily the funniest movie of all time then its surely one of the top contendersthe film centres on jeff bridges playing a slacker who likes to go by the name of the dude has the same name as bridgess character but thats where the similarities end after a case of mistaken identity the dude ends up acting as a courier for the other lebowski delivering ransom money to kidnappers naturally things go about as wrong as they possibly could and hilarity ensuesthe cast is topnotch jeff bridges excels as the dude and he has great chemistry with both john goodman  julianne moore throw in some coen brothers vets like steve buscemi  john turturro and add to that philip seymour hoffman sam elliott  others and youve got a cast thats to die forthe coens deliver the goods with both the screenplay and the direction there are a ton of hilarious memorable quotes and the films look is always interesting and attractive they also make some fine use of music including bob dylans the man in me the first editions just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in and a spanish version of hotel california by the gypsy kings overall the film sports a much higher level of craftsmanship than were used to seeing in modern comediesin the end though the films cult status must be mentioned the film has attracted a loyal following but there are bound to be those that just dont get the film since i am firmly in the followers camp i strongly urge you to give the film a chance,black_comedy
after all these years i finally watched this acclaimed classic from the coen brothers and i must say is a very unique film that holds interest and stands on its own the plot is interesting that takes twist and turns making you as the viewer think and thats really what a movie should do as you know that method is a staple of the coen brothers yet this film is blended with laughs to make it more enjoyable set in la it focuses on the life of a laid back and down to earth common slacker jeff lebowskijeff bridgeswhos only enjoyment is smoking pot drinking beer and hanging out with his friends and bowling the two friends are a crazed vietnam war veteranjohn goodman and a lonely losersteve buscemi all of sudden this trio of bowling buddies will find themselves on an unexpected journey of facing crazy characters and being involved in an apparent kidnapping case thats tied to mistaken identityso clearly this is a wild goose chase type of film thats unique as some of the scenes are strikingly visual and its plot keeps you thinking also look for good supporting turns from juilanne moore and phillp seymour hoffman this is a film that will appeal mostly to the hippie culture and older people still it has plenty of laughs and its creative enough to last in memory as a unique cult art cinema classic so remember dude is an offbeat film that strikes a unique score any film watcher will find its plot very creative thats blended well with laughs and the acting was in fine form as the chemistry of the characters made the film work so clearly this is an underrated classic to remember,black_comedy
even if youve never been into this genre or movies directed by the coen brothers theres no denying that this movie is a mustsee for everybodynow some would argue that in order to fully understand and enjoy this film youd have to be stoned but even if youre completely sober youre still going to find this funny in some aspect i should know i watched this at least 10 times and it is hilarious not only is this movie funny but its also very quotable i challenge anyone to find a person that cant quote one portion of the movie and have someone else know what theyre talking about its that quotablenow for the verdict gets a 10 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie is superb easily one of the best its big funny sprawling it never gets old the comedy is superb the characters are awesome and its a really good entertaining take on los angeles superbits the coens at their best you could argue they make two types of movies  the dark thriller and the absurd comedy this with a close second being raising arizona is by far their most interesting worki could spend the rest of this just quoting lines but im not going to if for some reason you havent seen this movie stop whatever you are doing and go rent it,black_comedy
ive seen this movie about 15 times to say that it is hilarious is pushing it a bit i think it has its moments funny it is but groundhog day it aintto say that it is the greatest movie ever made now that is hilariousis the potheadcollege clever guyfilm student anthem that always seems to find its way on dvd into every one of the aforementioneds film collectionsthe amazingly talented jeff bridges portrays a dude named well the dude who shares the same last name as a crippled millionaire who is involved with some shady characters the dude suffers for this but he and his sidekick nam vet walter manage to come out looking like two diamonds in the rough amongst a host of wealthier shallower individualsnot without some awesome lines and scenes stumbles through a few weeks in the life of the dude in his adventure by the end we are satisfied and we basically learn that people who bowl in bowling alleys sleep in lowrent apartments and drink white russians all day are people too and sometimes they are better than the wealthy and the eliteonly problem is if you didnt already know that what you need to do is drop out of college stop having mommy and daddy pay your bills and join the real world this movie alone wont save youas a cowboy shooting down home wisdom from the hip sam elliotts character is by far my favorite part of the film 7 out of 10 kids,black_comedy
films by the coen brothers i often find a little intimidating everyone agrees that theyre not for a mainstream audience but you certainly need your wits about you  basically they are films for connoisseurs and as much as i enjoy my movies ive always considered myself to be a casual moviegoer it has taken me a long time to get around to watch this movie  as it did with fargo  but as with their other movies i enjoyed this immensely it is genuinely as interesting as it is amusing littered with faultless performances and a classic filmnoir style plot that twists and turns around the quotehappy dialoguejeff bridges plays jeff lebowski a potsmoking slacker living in la and preferring to go by the name of the dude spending his time bowling with his buddies walter john goodman and donnie steve buscemi the dude is the victim of a vicious beating by two clueless goons who mistake him for jeffrey lebowski the millionaire seeking compensation for his ruined rug the dude quickly finds himself drawn into a complex kidnapping case and begins to find himself out of his depth with an evergrowing list of people seemingly intent of manipulating him to their will the dude finds his laidback attitude sorely tested as well as his friendship with the quicktoanger walterwhile my suspicions that this films plot would be complicated were right at no point did i find my attention wandering or my understanding of the story diminished this is storytelling on an epic scale reminiscent of classic noir movies like the big sleep and double indemnity but there is a blackasnight streak of humour running throughout the film mainly from goodman as the borderline psychotic vietnam veteran thats brilliantly pitched with dynamite performances throughout the cast its difficult to pick out any one actor but bridges rightly deserves the plaudits as he is utterly convincing and oddly lovable as the bearded waster bumbling his way through the film with a childlike naivety the only possible downside that i can think of is that it does need multiple viewings to get the most out of it and as ive already said you definitely need to give the plot your full attentioncould arguably by described as the ultimate stoner movie but seeing as that brings to mind stuff like dude wheres my car and harold  kumar get the munchies that is doing this movie a grave injustice this is a movie with real depth and charm  a classic detective story with the most unlikely sleuth imaginable it may be complex and highbrow but dont let that put you off as this is one of the most enjoyable movies ive seen for a long time  its much lighter than their other efforts ive seen like fargo which was quite dark it actually reminded me of kiss kiss bang bang but this is much funnier and more entertaining than that  bridges and goodman are a much better pairing than robert downey jr and val kilmer forget any trepidation you may have  this is the coens at their absolute best and even if youre a casual movie goer you owe it to yourself to watch man,black_comedy
you either get it or you dont with this movieyou wont get it if youre fussy about movies fitting into specific genres it touches on film noir  comedy  buddy movie but is actually none of these you wont get it if you focus on the plot too much its not about the plot its about the characters  the plot exists mainly to set up all kinds of different situations for them to handle or mishandle most of the time you wont get it if swearing annoys you i hardly noticed the amount of bad language but it seems to annoy some people a lot most of all if you dont empathise with the dude you wont get itthis is a very subtle movie that features many unsubtle characters who border on caricature much of the time i think a lot of people expect an outright comedy  are disappointed by the lack of obvious jokes its a movie best approached with no expectation  it gets better every time i see it im not going to rave on about it even though its one of my all time favourite films its best to just watch it for yourself,black_comedy
was one of the funniest movies i had ever seen the coen brothers had did it again they understood and knew how to make an audience laugh i could not stop laughing from beginning to end jeff bridges played the perfect lowlife bum unemployed laidback surfertype longhaired dude i think one of the funniest parts of the movie was when the cop from malibu was talking to the dude in his office and then jeff bridges had to be reminded about authority with a coffee mug i was on the ground laughing because i could see that happening to someone you had to learn to respect authority or suffer the consequences i learned that most of the things that we encountered in life just had to be laughed at or ignored like the dude did in everything would turn out fine in the end a great film and very very funny a must see,black_comedy
words cannot describe the magnificent wonderful and strange beauty that is take your typical noir tale of kidnapping doublecrossing and sleazy pornographers and throw in the dude a pot smoking pacifist with a penchant for creedance and white russianswithout going into the plot its an amazing achievement that the coen brothers have weaved an incredibly intricate film noir story into a bright and colorful comedy with each character funnier and more outlandish than the nextwith a fantastic soundtrack beautiful visual style a firstrate cast and a tonne of laughs is not only a great film it happens to be this reviewers favorite coen brothers outing to dateits more than noir its more than comedy its ah you know man,black_comedy
its easily better than fargo imho and its right up there with barton fink or millers crossing a true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters but its the movies atmosphere which is so truly joyous a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing achieving ones goals is important yes but its okay to set them low is what i perceived this movie to be saying as long as one is basically a good guy then thats enough well thats what it seemed like to me and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques lovely music  although more burwell would have been nice  and the trippiest funniest most absurd dream sequences youve ever seen if youre a type a personality you might not like this movie much but for the type bs and further on down the alphabet the further the better great movie,black_comedy
jeff bridges at his best ever i think it is so funny this man the dude should be everyones hero the movie is also about peace in his own intrinsically and curiously unusual way looking at it after now 10 years after it was made is not only still a great laugh but also inspiring its good now and then to get back in to rock and roll i think the movie tackles important questions about life in an intensely comical and intelligent way i live in europe and it might just be that people who are not so familiar with the american culture would not be able to catch the great humor but i feel blessed to be able to understand the hero that the dude is playing i truly wish i was like him detailed in every scene rich characterization diverse soundtrack witty real life dialogue this movie is god i feel that it takes a lot from a movie to make me leave with a sense of satiation but this movie does it for me wonderfully written and directed by the coen brothers it is yet another masterpiece from them another thing is that this movie never tries to be funny it doesnt have random quirky characters or punch lines it all comes from the scenes very naturally and how cool is the scene when the sheriff throws and hits the dude in the forehead with the mug and the mug doesnt turn while its in the air so many great scenes,black_comedy
jeff bridges the fabulous baker boys stars as the dude lebowski who is mistaken for another lebowski which ultimately leaves his rug ruined taking this up with the dude is sent on a mission to recover his kidnapped wifeis one of the coen brothers finest creations by being different funny and entertaining all the way through with smart direction and actingyou will have never seen anything like this before as jeff bridges gives an unbelievable performance as the dude an unemployed bum who likes white russians and bowling who seeks a very bizarre retribution in his ruined rugthe ideology of the rug and the whole obsessive nature behind it is very funny as is bridges in a very weird character which is lovable for being so hip and relaxedthough his character can be extremely rude and annoying john goodman roseanne plays walter extremely well and makes an interesting paring alongside the dudethe plot is excellent and very consistent very character driven packs in plenty of laughs along the way with some breathtaking twists and turns and strong ideologies to keep it entertainingone particular factor which helped the film along was the beautifully directed bowling scene fantasies so bizarre and unique that the film is a must watch just for these couple of moments of pure genius they are so out of place in the film so wacky that it is pure amazementforget jds fantasies in scrubs we have the funniest and wackiest fantasies right here in a completely twisting and turning storylinecome the end of the film you may have lost your way a bit as to what happens with all the money dealings and who all the characters were and so forth but you will definitely not mind watching again as you will have seen the most coolest dude in the history of cinema in a very finely directed comedy drama,black_comedy
is a superb film mixing comedy and at times surrealism focusing on the dude jeff bridges the ultimate slacker we follow the escalation of oddities in his life after thieves mistake him for somebody else and pee on his rug he then tries to get compensation from his namesake mr lebowski the man the thieves intended to nobble but afterwards gets dragged into increasingly crazy intrigues revolving around a missing lady the supporting cast was brilliant with john goodman absolutely hilarious as a guntoting nam veteran with an obsession with bowling he helps push the dude into bigger and bigger mishaps with his flawed logic and unhelpful interferences there are twists and turns as the film winds its way to the finish with plenty of laughs i would rate this above fargo another excellent coen film big lebowski is that good,black_comedy
love this movie seriously one of the best of all times if you havent seen this movie and have been debating it you must i mean must watch the cohen brothers are not only genius comedic writers but the way this movie is shot is brilliant as well point of view shots colors and slow mos of yeah this is one of jeff daniels and john goodman best rolls of all time watch this movie several times too because you end up catching a lot the second time around the comedic timing from steve buschmi of my gard and john tortoro as jesus well need i mention that this is one of his best rolls as well everyone in the family except for the under 14 age group because there is nudity will enjoy this movie it really did take me a couple times of watching it though to really get how brilliant it is,black_comedy
ive watched my share of comedies and in all this time ive only been able to single out four as definitive and making a mark on the movie industry and establishing themselves as classics ghostbusters the first one mind you caddyshack also only the first national lampoons animal house and drum roll please lets discuss that last one further shall we follows the story of jeffry the dude lebowski an la bum who gets sucked into the underground crime scene drugs sex rock and all i cant really give away more info than that without spoiling something so thats all i will say in regards to the plot on the character side of the movie the whole film is comprised of bums thugs and wackjobs all who are lovably bizarre while the characters all seem to have onetrack minds you never seem to tire of them and are all amusing in their own way for example walter constantly tells donny to shut the fk up donny is always almost completely unaware of whats going on throughout the movie the dude always says some witty oneliner that lightens the mood the way any stoner could etc the script is absolutely hysterical and topnotch as can be expected of the coen brothers and the acting is completely believable despite how far out the dialogue and events are how could anybody forget the dudes reaction when they drag him out of the limo while hes drinking a white russian well here it is whoa whoa hhey dude careful ive got a beverage here overall i loved everything about the movie its an incredibly fresh original movie that cant possibly be put in any specific genre its so unique heres a warning though the first time you watch it you might not enjoy it as much as the next time as its one of those movies that gets better with age this can perhaps attribute to the commercial and critical failure it exhibited upon release but since has grown so huge that they have made a convention for it named lebowskifest once you get sucked into the wild world of the dude you will never want to leave,black_comedy

it is a directors movie and again the coen brothers manage to leave their idiosyncratic stamp on this movie mostly intriguing but sometimes weird the coens allow another story to unravel in a psuedorealistic world that they create in so many of their movies looking back at this movies as a whole it seems like a rather mediocre product with crumbling storyline however if you have watched the coens enough you would know that they are more likely to deliver instantaneous gratification while watching a movie than give memorable product to be remembered later so while some subplots in stick out like a sore thumb the movie succeeds in entertaining with some genuinely hilarious scenes there are moments where sheer brilliance radiates from the scene construction and it is for these moments the movie has to be watched in my early days as a coens fan i have made the mistake of trying to overthink their movies it is mistake because retrospectively their movies may appear ordinary but at the time of viewing the coens amazing audaciousness holds together it may be viewed as a victory of style over substance but it really is an effort to choose entertainment over reality i did not take much home from lebowski neither did i think it was a perfect storyline but it was thoroughly entertaining and sometimes that is all you need,black_comedy
the tale begins well not so directly here when two idiot goons mistake jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges to another man with the same name sans the dude and take a leak on his carpet while trying to get him to cough up some dough the other lebowskis wife is due from here the dude finds the other lebowski whos a millionaire with a young wife and demands reconciliation for his rug now one thing leads to another and one person stranger than other waltzes into the screen while the dude tries to figure out what is going on and whos fooling whothe coen brothers have gathered together a great cast ranging from bucemi to goodman the script is tight and flows well the direction is solid and the actors do their damned best as they should this ends up with one of the funniest comedies ive seen in ages witty surprising odd and all around plain awesome there isnt a single actor in the film that would do a sub par delivery in the story and all the pieces clash nicely together while the bizarre tale of bowling and betrayal unfolds before the viewers eyesi cant do nothing else but to recommend this as this is one of those films that will last time more than a week or two this is one for the ages,black_comedy
its hard to exaggerate just how great this movie really is funnily enough when i first watched it i didnt rate it as highly as the other coen titles id seen on the second or third viewing it suddenly gelled the beer probably helped and now it is totally in my alltime top three greatest ever its all in the script of course and the performances and the art direction and the surreal sequences and the music well you get the idea every aspect of this movie is just perfect it cannot be improved on in any way and therein lies its genius central to its immortality are the two leads  goodman and bridges  who are note perfect in every single scene speaking of scenes there are too many great ones to count but the last time i watched the funeral parlor became my newest favorite it is our most modestly priced receptaclethe greatest thing about this movie is that you just have to think of a line of dialog and it just cracks you up immediately more than once i have laughed out loud in public like a complete zany when some random line from the film drifted through my subconsciousyou see what happens larry you want a toe i can get you a toe nobody fcks with the jesus its a natural zesty enterprise theyre gonna kill that poor woman careful man theres a beverage herequite simply  genius,black_comedy
this was the first coen brothers film and i saw and i thought it was great is surreal dark comedy about jeff the dude lebowski jeff bridges becoming mixed up with german gangsters the kidnapping of an exporn star throne wife of the rich jeff and jeff lebowskis daughter a modern artist the dude gets mixed up with these events when gangsters break into his apartment and demands money from him until they realised they got the wrong lebowski the dude friend walter john goodman convicts him to go to home and demand compensation from him it was after this visit when the dude and walter gets mixed up with the kidnap plot asks the dude to drop the ransom money off for him and thereby get bunny lebowski tara reid back however walter came with him on the mission and steals the ransom money it was from there that things started to go worst and worstis an excellent film which is extreme funny it has some get characters especially the dude as a lazy ageing hippie and walter as a mad militaristic nut case he was meant to be based on john milius the film also uses many types of humour from dark humour which the coen brothers do really well psychical and little slapstick intelligent involving some of the jokes used surreal using dream sequences and a little catchphrase based with the classic shut the fk up donnyis well worth watching,black_comedy
the dude is content to let life go by if can bowl once a week get stoned and sit in his bathtub surrounded by candles this meditative deadbeat existence is suddenly thrown into disarray however when a couple of thug debt collectors break into his pad shove his head in the toilet and urinate on his rug it turns out he is a victim of mistaken identity at the urging of his semipsycho bowling partner walter he pulls out a 45 to settle an argument over two pinsdude seeks recompense from the intended lebowski a well heeled millionaire with a mansion and a teenage wife who may have been kidnapped by german nihilistsjeff bridges is a perfect fit as the dude inhabiting the mannerisms and style as well as displaying the contented munchies developed gut of a lifetime passive resister still living the summer of love in perfect counterbalance is fellow kegler and ex viet vet walter who is also living in the past but at tet by share force of personality john goodmans walter occupies center stage as much as dude shadowing wispily in the background the timid donny steve buscemirounds out the unlikely trio in a bowling tournament subplot opponent john turturro as jesus is over the top hilarious as he baits walter and the dude philip seymour hoffman as millionaire lebowskis obsequious assistant also registers in a brief rolelike its protagonist is a lovable shaggy dog of a movie whose layed back style purposely and with hilarious results undermines the seriousness and suspense of the kidnapping and amputation that drive the plot not since the late pro bowler ray bluths unique bowling style has the game been presented in such an unorthodox way taking the mundane washed out color setting of a bowling alley including the parking lot the brothers coen create a surreal dream in which eras and genres collide as they borrow from and update classics with their own visual flare from the bowlers montage over the credits to busby berkeley musical numbers jesuss entrance and the out of sync conversations between the team the coens deftly utilize the alley setting fully realizing its ignored potential of pop art and surrealismthe convoluted plot might suggest some big sleep and the anachronistic dude might have a resemblance to goulds long goodbye marlowe but the style and presentation are pure coen in three hundred game form,black_comedy
wowthis movie is justone of the craziest comedy movies i have ever seen aside from the horror comedies i watch this has to be the strangest movie however it is better than most stupid modern comedies most modern comedies are the same all stupid slapstick crap using the same jokes over and over again in every single movie the wedding crashers knocked up you me and dupree the breakup these are all pretty much the same exact movie just with the story altered a bit but not this movie this movie relies on acid trip humor and bad luck the good kind and stuff like that jeff bridges is someone i usually see in inspiration movies like tucker and seabiscuit so this was certainly a change of pace john goodman was very funny and random steve buscemi was also very good along with john torturro philip seymour hoffman julianne moore andwelleveryone except tara reid could have done without her good movie watch with friends for a good laugh,black_comedy
a rare treat lies within tbl the coens deliver a witty smart and at times political but it is the mix of their chosen language which all the characters in all their films share added with brilliant acting tbl will remain a memorable and special film if you lack knowledge of the fargo makers or have yet to see a film by the coen i worn not to approach tbl due to its different but outstanding way of delivering a story from the cool camera angles to the unexpected but valid ending tbl will stick with the viewer in mind for days and in heart for its characters the dude et al dialogue monologues direction originality and its one and only storyi hope that the coens remain in the high class because every film i have seen of theirs i have loved so raise a white russian to the creators and enjoy an unique unpredictable and unforgettable filmcheers coens,black_comedy
great movie great absence of enormous plot lines beautiful characters with depth hilarious at some points dramatic through situational humora great trip to the bowling alley of life jef bridges is in great shape as the dude but john turturro steals the show as the gay bowler steve buscemi plays the same character over and over but he does it so well that all is forgivenafter seeing this movie your carpet will be cherished ashes of the departed treated with respect and a night out bowling will be more adventurous,black_comedy

i am one of those who think the coen brothers have done better movies than but i will give it this this satiric tale of mistaken identity kidnap and death has a raymond chandleresquire feel that should certainly appeal to male viewers jeff bridges is dude lebowski who ends up being mixed up with a millionaire with the same last name david huddleston who owes money to some very bad men the dudes best buddy walter john goodman helps the dude in his quest to find the senior lebowskis hormonecrazed child bride tara reid who has done a disappearing act and may or may not have been kidnapped the film is bizarre to say the least with busby berkleytype fantasy sequences bridges as a 60s burnout with long unkempt hair and goodman as an individual with serious anger management issues bridges and goodman make the film worth watching although their constant use of expletives may turn off some they are supported in their efforts by steve buscemi as their strange pal donny and julianne moore as the even stranger maude lebowski sam elliott serves as the films narrator and shows up in a brief sequence this is quite probably goodmans finest film by the way,black_comedy
this movie hosts a bold cast of characters but does little to piece them into the film properlyhas its comedic moments amidst a cornucopia of quirky scenes and larger than life characters the plot despite its multiple twists is relatively simple an aged hippie in la gets involved in a mock kidnapping plot all due to a stolen carpet and a case of mistaken identitythis type of plot which is standard cohen brothers fare does little justice to the films often disjointed nature there are scenes in this film driven by some colorful cameos that could have been entirely omitted from the movie with little or no consequence to the films continuity there are many cameos in this film by some obscure actors such as david thewliss and sam elliot that feel more obligatory than necessary there is also an entire scene that could have been omitted in the film jeff bridges character is drugged by someone in the film you get to see the entire insane dream he has while hes drugged this to me was totally unnecessary and could have been handled so much better than a narcotics dream this is not to say there isnt some original comedy to be found in there are enough funny if not slightly bizarre moments to separate this film from standard comedic predictability john goodman does a stellar job as the main characters loud and lovable sidekick walter jeff bridges plays his character so well you forget hes jeff bridges the faults of this film definitely dont lie in the acting is hurt by its slightly surreal nature poor editing and excess of useless cameos and ambiguous charactersoverall this is a comedy that wont appeal to all fans of the genre the sometimes artsy edge will turn some people off it is also not the cohen brothers best effort in my opinion,black_comedy
is maybe my favorite film of the coen brothers  the others are o brother were art thou and raising arizonaalso fargo because is one of the greatest american comedies ever made for me the comedies of the coen brothers are much better than the thrillers like simple blood or millers crossing and in they create a very funny role that was excellent plays by jeff bridges the story is kind of simple a man is confused by other man that has the same name and he is in a big trouble but whats makes great this films is the actors and the funny touch of the directors jonh goodman and steve buscemi are just excellent also phillip seymor hoffman in a little role is excellent and other fact that i love in this film is that flea from the rhcp has a participation very little in the film and i love the music of the rhcp about the funniest dialogs and scenes in the film well there are a lot but i love the scene when walter put his gun in somkeys head and other of walter in when he gets angry because of the shomer shabbos of the dude they are a lot but i love when he says his versions of the kidnapping to and also when he crash in his car donnywell donny is funny in all his scenes and dialogs but when he says lennon about lennin is just great all this parts of the film are great but the best is when walter throws the bottle to the air with the rest of donny other great character is jesus and jonh turturro is excellentlet me tell you something pendejo his best dialog,black_comedy
this may just be the perfect movie though it may have a dull plot has perfect acting by all the colorful wellportrayed characters every scene is a tribute to greatness from the very beginning to the very end even though it came out nearly ten years ago it has still yet to be matched by another comedy ive found that it is a seriously underrated movie shadowed by mediocre comedies like wedding crashers and talladega nights it has amassed a gigantic cult following for good reason too it is flawlessly directed flawlessly casted and flawlessly acted despite its irreverence and relentless profanity it actually has an almost touching ending definitely a classic movie probably my alltime fav ten out of ten,black_comedy
this vaudeville show of vanity arguably the coen brothers finest work is many movies rolled into one but with the appeal of a finished masterpiece rather than the patchworky feel of your usual episode affair there is tumbling tumbleweed a desert epic set in motion by the strangers rambling monologue there is logjammin the ludicrous beaver picture starring bunny la joyalebowskiknutson and the eminent karl hungus there is urban achievers a twisted hostage thriller come art world satire there is hotel california a poignant social drama revolving around john torturro in his finest hour as latino child molester jesus quintana there is larrys homework the bleak suburban neonoir pi story and of course and most notably the cosmic gutterballs a jackie treehorn production following the dudes lucid dream as it spins from bowling bliss to nihilist nightmare featuring saddam hussein as shoeshine boy extraordinaire it is all this and more that makes the big l the ultimate la movie a major cinematic joyride a melancholic masterpiece you will never tire from,black_comedy
im a coen brothers fan so when i see in dvd i bought it i wasnt old enough to understand this film when it came on theater so i didnt see it now i had the opportunity to do final results  its a pure wonderful achievement by the coen brothersthe screenplay  the story is very originalthe characters live in a very confusing la maybe its like that and they are very wealthy and varied the dude the nihilist all these characters are different and when they collide it make very special situations these situations are varied too like the places this is not a film with just two or three places we can see very different places of lathe acting  just one of the most hilarious performances ive ever seen jeff bridges was the only one to play the dude with his long hair and some pounds more hes unrecognizable but not his performance and john goodman i think gave his most memorable performance even the small supporting roles are good too steve buscemi john turturoothe directing  coens classic they interesting about there characters even there isnt a lot of close shot the high states of the dude are pretty good without using a lot of special effects like this they make the scenes more realistic its a comedy film not a scifi movieconclusion  a excellent comedy with great performancesand dont forget  the dude stays up,black_comedy
so a broke stonerbowling lover wants revenge against hoodlums who mistakingly urinate on his living room carpet let the games begin bridges stars as the dude lebowski who enlists the help of his friend exvietnam vet walter goodman to exact revenge against a wealthy businessman with the same namesake it turns out he gets way more than he bargained for agreeing to find the millionaires young wife who has gone missing it turns out he is not the only one looking for this woman or the ransom money the dude encounters an eccentric cast of characters from the millionaires daughter moore to a gang of german nihilists including red hot chili peppers bassist fleathe story is extremely wacky which lead to lots of hilarity in some scenes the best part is that the film never takes itself seriously its more of a dark comedy than anything else the glue of the film for me is the great pairing of bridges and goodman goodmans character constantly looks to associate every situation with the vietnam war bridges is brilliant because of his laidback appearance including a robe and sandalshowever the story seems to hit a few snags along the way and for me makes the film far from perfect these snags for me are segments that seem to make the film drag a bit timewise there seem to be too many characters that popup and then we are forced to revisit them later in the filmin conclusion its a great dark comedy that doesnt follow conventional plot lines a cohen brothers trademark its worth watching for the scenes with goodman and bridges alone,black_comedy

this is a film that is hard to describe when anyone asks what its about i just say the dudethe plot is simple but wellwritten the characters are great and the dialogue is really nothing short of perfect this is coupled with star talent used to its fullest potential there is no one else who could be the dude jeff bridges just is john goodman is hilarious as the shortfused vietnam vet walter and steve buscemi plays a different role than usual but he still is given great moments because the three main characters play off each other so well the script is endlessly quotablenow this is not to say that the dialogue and characters alone make the movie funny comedy bleeds through at almost every scene in the unusual locations and series of events that occur maybe the funniest scene ever in a movie to me occurs when the dude gets his car back and good old ccr comes on the radio playing lookin out my back door and dude pounds on the roof drinkin a beer and smokin a jane all at the same time and he of course ends up crashing into a dumpster total classicbut maybe one thing that i find so great about this comedy is that even though ive seen it five or six times in the past couple years i always see something or get something new every time and everyone should dig the idea that the dude really is someone we all could learn from i mean he really just doesnt care about the views of him from society he just lives as he wants and he doesnt hurt anyonenow im not saying hes a hero because whats a hero but sometimes theres a man and im talking about the dude here sometimes theres a man who well hes the man of his time and place he just fits right in there,black_comedy
for one thing when this film was in theaters nobody even cared now so many people know it by heart that its not even funny this film is absolutely the best in all ways john goodman put on the roll of his life as walter this has to be the best thing i have ever seen john goodman do as for the rest of the actors it all seemed to stay on a pretty good track the coen brothers scored again with this movie it was a great movie and well enjoyed by people all around this was an absolute treasure to have on the shelf the coen brothers are making gold but this has to be their best so far if they were to make a sequel it would be impossible because jeff bridges would take a lot to look like the dude again well long live the dude,black_comedy
stars jeff bridges john goodman steve buscemi david huddleston julianne moore phillip seymour hoffman peter stormare flea torsten voges john turturro sam elliot tara reid jack kehlermany obviously consider this to be a classic i dont consider it one but i still found it very entertaining and was not disappointed our basic plot is stoner and loser jeffrey the dude lebowski is mistaken for millionaire jeffrey lebowski when men break in to his house and pee on his rug to get the money for the rug the dude goes to jeffrey lebowski and ends up on a mission to find rich lebowskis kidnapped wife the movie is fairly fast paced but that doesnt stop it from having periods of heavy clever dialogue mostly between john goodman as the exvietnam veteran walter and the dude many of the films most entertaining scenes are located in the bowling alley where the dude walter and donnie buscemi talk about nothing and of course bowl the backup cast is really good also including julianne moore as the kidnapped wife and john turturro as a sex offender bowler though i dont consider this to be a great classic film its still a good fun movie with enough gusto to keep the whole thing afloatmy rating  out of  113 mins r for sexualitynudity violence drug use and language,black_comedy
this movie is the coen brothers best filmit is their funniest most original and most engaging film of their illustrious careers the movie is about the dude jeff bridges a deadbeat hippiebowler who becomes entangled in the affairs of welltodo hollywood figures mr lebowski david huddleston and jackie treehorn ben gazzarathe strength of the movie is the uproarious relationship and dialog between the dude walter john goodman and donny steve buschemi all partners on a bowling team their lines might be some of the most memorable and quotable in recent comedic historyalong with the three main characters the coen brothers have a bizarre mixture of characters nihilist germans porn star thugs uptight artists bowlers spanish bowlers peaceloving cab drivers and interpretive dancing landlords the ingredients appears to be outrageous but the coen brothers make it workthis is a comedy that makes you laugh hoursdaysweeks after watching it it has a tremendous cast did i mention julianne moore and philip seymour hofman are also in it its one of those movie where outrageous characters situations and ideas are thrown together and it makes one of the most hilarious movies ever made it is certainly the coen brothers best highly recommended8 out of 10,black_comedy
this is the cohens at their best  and the actors at their best you put millers crossing fargo and raising arizona in a blender and you get the best caucasian ever made how many quotes have come from this film ive never gotten tired of this one the guy that does the marmot scream used to live down the street from me his voice is always found in their films the last time that i talked to him he was leaving lexington for the west he had just finished directing a doc on grunge ukulele musicians in the pacific northwest i think that his most disturbing sound effect was the odd scream of the paid off boxer in millers crossing that one always makes ya wonder what grandpas really going to do with the fire stoker when he picks it up on christmas,black_comedy
jeff bridges makes lebowski come to life in this not too hilarious comedy about a doper  or is he just a dope dunno  you figure it out  dudei love this comedy because it is so not offbeat yet is offbeat yet is real in a surreal kind of way  dude maybe this is for people with more sophisticated tastes than just raw heres a joke heres a punch line now laugh kind of comedy  or it isnt  im not sure  dudesee this and you will have spent another hour and a half seeing this movie as you have never seen it before  i watch it every time it comes out on cable  dude1010ldmy faith httpwwwangelfirecomny5jbc33,black_comedy
the big lebowski1998 review the coen brothers are back say hello tothis movie has one trend the characters if you think about the plot you really do not have to understand the plot at all the focus is on the characters jeff bridges is lebowski or the dude after two jerks take a leak on his rug our story beginsbe on the lookout for many other characters such as walter sobchakjohn goodmanis possibly the funniest and most realistic character here who is still living in the past vietnam buff goodman is at his best here as walter he delivers the best you are guaranteed to laughthe story does take many viewings to truly understand but this is a very addictive movie after one viewing you cant stop after one there is also plenty of curse words here the fbomb is quite the norm so this is not for the kids folks but for the adults this is a hootyou cant go wrong with a fantastic cast either from jeff bridges john goodman john turturro julianne moore phillip seymour hoffman and steve buscemi you cant go wrong there is also bowling here toothe last word damn funny this is all about the characters not the ploteven though its not badis just plain funny just remember the fbomb is heard almost every minute here so this isnt for the kids,black_comedy
theres one big reason i like the dude better than so many other films while lebowsky has his share of flaws they arent really the cause of his problems its simply stirs from a case of mistaken identity and i think people can sympathize with him so much more for thatthe characters are quirky and memorable its far more original than most moviesand while theres several scenes that are a stretch to say the least realizing that they come from the dudes imagination somehow make them that much more acceptable its one of the few movies that ive had the pleasure to just sit back and enjoy id recommend this movie to most of you out there especially those who appreciate subtle almost strange humor,black_comedy
its great the dude is so cool he is as simple a man can be with not much expectations hopes or fears he just wants his space he is basically as relaxed as a man can be who wants as little responsibilities or hassles as possible but the hassles come but he keeps is cool no matter how ridiculous the world surrounding him is including his friends this film is really funny really far out i definitely recommend it check out torturro with his yes i am ze jesus steve bushemi is really sweet in this and there is the cowboy and a bunch of really really crazy people that sum up america as we know it all the dude really wants to do is bowl,black_comedy
what a hilarious movie it is   it one of the coen brothers best  and one of the best comedies ever the characters were very well written and acted  ive never imagined jeff bridges in a comedy role  not even in my wildest dreams but he really has a good sense of humor and was the best for the dude role  john goodman is another member of this misfit gang  steve buscimi completes the funny trio the bowling shots were amazingly beautiful and it is a proof of how high was the cinematography in this movieeverything just sounds to be put in its perfect place  the music is good and goes totally with rhythm of the movie like if it were written especially for it very wise music choicesthe performances were good  especially by bridges  goodman  julianne moore was an ok steve buscimi wasnt badthe constant funny situations is one good point of the solid script  the other good point is the funny lines all around the movieit is the 2nd last good comedy from the coen brothers before o brother where art thou it is a very good comedy  dont miss it,black_comedy
it couldnt be funnier  it couldnt be more classicit should have won oscars for best actorthe dude jeff bridges and supporting actorwalter john goodmanas well as movie of the year bunny maude the jesus  donnie jackie treehorn even larry is this your homework larryyour killin your father larry have you ever heard of vietnam larry classic writing  amazing actors this will be a movie ill watch at least a million more times the only possible problem is there should be a part 2 maudes pregnate  that could be used in so many wayslets hope wiser minds can make it so if it were done ied be among the first to line up to see it,black_comedy
this is my number two all time favorite movie why this movie is an onion even now years after its release i watch it and the layers unfold what i have discovered is that the movies that somehow mysteriously move me in unknown ways upon the first viewing turn out to be religious metaphors blade runner pretty obvious if you at least a faint whiff of imaginative ability is more subtle watch the movie and count how many times jesus is said was jesus betrayed by the jews he was in tbl its all there an immaculate conception a betrayal a crucifixion a rebirth who is the jesus metaphor its the car the car carries the characters throughout the movie and is sacrificed in the end by nihilists the car carries the reward the million dollars that turns out not to be there because the money is not the reward bowling is the reward donny is reborn as the dude and walter return to the lanes the idolater falls maude becomes the next mary magdelene walter is paul the dude is john not even the cohen brothers can escape the judeochristian core of our society of course escape is not necessary if jesus cant f you on saturday hell f you next wednesday hey check out my album tacos and bowling on itunes httpphobosapplecomwebobjectsmzstorewoawa viewalbumplaylistid39322321 we all abide,black_comedy
this is one of my favorite films ever amazing performances from virtually everyone so many quotable lines virtually caddyshack level john goodman amazes me every time i see him and shines and rants in every scene of the many cohen bros films most of which are exceptional this is the most fun clever story developed and paced well and just so freaking funnyone of many interesting tidbits the dudes 69 check at the beginning of the film is dated 91191 followed by g bush senior talking on the tv about iraq war the more things changeone last note on the making of the cohens mention joel silver suggested and they ignored that he should get his rug back the rug the catalyst for all subsequent events is not really necessary and this film doesnt need that hollywood closure the dude would just say f it lets go bowlingwhat a brilliant film thats not her toe dude,black_comedy
ive seen it about twenty or so times now and i never get bored with it if you have seen it ever tried explaining to your friends what this movie is about somehow i never manage to really capture the essence of this flick which is part of the attraction i suppose of course there is the basic story line about a guy whose rug has been stolen by some nihilists who hold him for someone else having the same name but to be honest that storyline only serves to piece together the incredibly funny scenes that make up this movie oh boy do i wish i had some of the laidbackness the dude possesses bridges is your parents nightmare and lovable for that goodman and his neverending flirtations with jewish religion and vietnam are so utterly ridiculous without ever being offensive hilarious then there is donny a marvel in his own right the nihilists lebowskis daughter maude and her vaginal art her gayer than gay house friend anton the jesus in his purple shiny training suit the dudes landlord  neighbour the list is almost endless this movie walks the good side of the thin line where cheap stoporillshoot humor leslie nielsen style flicks occupy the opposite sidewatch it watch it again have a ball talking about it with your friends then watch it again together you wont be disappointed its a killer movie highly recommended,black_comedy
is one of those classic films everyone talks about that ive never seen until recently im glad i did this superbly cast comedy features jeff bridges as the dude the unemployed live and let live antagonist who is unfortunately thrust into a series of events beyond his control along with his two best friends and bowling colleges walter and donny played by john goodman and steve buscemi respectively the comedic timing and skillful screenplay are amazing watching these three interact in scenes is beautiful of course there is more to this film than the comedy and the mysterious twists and turns are strong on their own right and the overall lesson learned is heartfelt this really is a classic film brought to us by the coen brothers,black_comedy
this movie is definitely not for everyone some people hate it and some cannot find its humor i find it absolutely hilarious the casting is perfect and the dialog is fun i like the way the characters mesh and clash and completely lose their tempers  john goodman im talking to you  well done it is funny and offensive to some but i like that kind of moviejullianne moore is so great in role of maude lebowskisteve buscemi and philip seymorhoffman also give great performances then of course there is the dude jef bridgesthe most laid back of them all be sure to check out his fashion choices pay special attention to his shoes someone mistakes him for a millionaire and instead of letting the incident go an insane dangerous and funny adventure results how did he get into this mess bowling is known to solve all problems as do white russians but watch out for those nihilists,black_comedy
might actually be the funniest film of all time but only if you like its style of humor parody and subtle offkilter satire even then if you are anything like me you will find it only mildly funny during your first viewing as others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot while not as complex as millers crossing it still challenges viewers to pay close attention the dvd does not have a commentary but it does have a short feature full of interviews where the coen brothers explain some of their rationale for certain elements in the script and reveal places where the cast put their own individual marks on the filmfeatures the coens trademark comic style they are students of films and their secret is taking a traditional character and creating an incongruity between the way you expect the character to talk and behave as per movie conventions and what actually happens for the coens play with the detective buddy picture and the suspense genres they set up a philip marlowe episodic detective story but as their main character they substitute an aging potsmoking bowler jeff the dude lebowski played by jeff bridges for the film noir detective like marlowe the dude gets caught up in scheme a whole lot bigger than he is and gets episodically pushed and pulled by a lot of strange characters his buddy walter sobchek john goodman is a blustering viet nam veteran who manages to further complicate almost every situation much of the humor comes from the way the supposedly laid back dude continually comes unglued over walters behavior finally the coens incorporate not one but two hitchcock macguffins into the film the series of unfortunate events are set in motion by a rug the floor covering type and midway into the film it is replaced as a motivating factor by a young woman tara reid ultimately neither is of any importance yet they are the reason for everything that happens in the film new lebowski fans can be found drinking white russians entering their local bowling alley for the first time in years looking up nihilist in the dictionary and checking to see if tvland is showing any branded reruns if any of that sounds like fun you should definitely check out the filmthen again what do i know im only a child,black_comedy
easily one of my favorite movies by my favorite actor ive always like jeff bridges but he usually plays someone fairly together and knowing exactly where hes going and how hes going to get there here he may be together in a unique sort of way but he has no idea where hes going and he doesnt care how he gets where ever hes going just going with the flowas with so many great movies every character is a gem and even actors i dont normally like are excellentwhen i first watched this movie i was in a room with my extended family wife inlaws my inlaws inlaws and within 10 minutes all but three of us had left the room overwhelmed by the swearing and a bit disgusted with this character with no apparent redeeming features besides my brotherinlaw and myself my brotherinlaws 80year old jewish motherinlaw stayed at the end of the movie we had all laughed a lot but the best line was reserved for bubby who said ive never heard the word f used in so many interesting ways,black_comedy
writing and directing yet another cult classic the cohen brothers have once again concocted a masterpiece that gets better with every viewing witty intelligent vulgar happy sad runs through the gambit of emotions like few other films can match wrought with eccentric characters throughout the film creates some of the most memorable characters on the tinsel town scene jeffery lebowski jeff bridges who goes by the moniker the dude an unemployed burnout who enjoys driving around bowling and the occasional acid flash back walter sobchak john goodman a vietnam veteran converted jew whos still living in the past of both the vietnam war and his former marriage with his exwife cynthia theodore donald kerabatsos steve buscemi known as donny a california surfer who enjoys bowling always seems a little lost or at best a page behind the rest of the group jeffery lebowski david huddleston the real jeffery lebowski a paraplegic korean war veteran supposed self made millionaire and head of the little lebowski urban achievers foundation who has a penchant for vanity as evidenced by his choice of second wife bunny lebowski tara reid a young beautiful porn star nymphomaniac this is just a glimpse at a few of the movies characters who inadvertently interact together and solidify one of the movies greatest achievements the dialogue the array of characters that the cohen brothers create along with the brilliant casting of each character allows them to script some of the wittiest dialogue of any movie ever written ranging from absurd and vulgar to intelligent and insightful the dialogue flows so naturally and meshes so intricately throughout the movie that multiple viewings are necessary to completely appreciate the skilled craftsmanship of the syntactical and grammatical structure employed by the characters the dude enjoys lifes simple pleasures and leads a normal dysfunctional unproductive life of drinking causal drug use driving around and most importantly league bowling his apartment has a rug a rug that really ties the room together that is until his rug is mitterated upon by two of jackie treehorns thugs in an attempt to recover a sum of money from after a brilliantly crafted brainstorming dialogue session at the bowling alley with his eccentric bowling team walter sobchak and donny the dude decides to rectify his rug situation by going to the real jeffery lebowski whose rug the thugs were really trying to mitterate upon and recover another rug hopefully one that can match the old rugs ability to really tie the room together meeting with contempt and hostility from the dude eventually finagles a rug from the real jeffery lebowskis house this episode marks the beginning of a precarious relationship between the two lebowskis calls upon the dude after receives a ransom note stating that the love of his life bunny lebowski has been kidnapped from here the movie takes twists and turns as the dude acts as courier of the ransom money and finds himself center stage in the whole kidnapping fiasco mainly because he is in a unique position to either confirm or deny the carpet pissers as the identity of the kidnappers as the movie culminates the two lebowskis have a final bout exposing the true nature of each without wasting millions of dollars on special effects to fill in for thin plot lines and fluff for weak scenes and content the cohen brothers displayed their prowess through manipulating language and intelligently designing one of the best movies ever produced every time i watch this movie i find something that i previously missed firmly cements the cohen brothers as hollywood stalwarts in the movie industry,black_comedy
the coen brothers are known for a bizarre sense of humor as are their fans and once again they hit the nail on the head with this filmjeff bridges plays jeffrey the dude lebowski a burned out exhippie who hates the eagles 70s rock group whos biggest joys in life are bowling with his buddies played by john goodman and steve buscemi driving around and the occasional acid flashback he is mistaken for the millionaire jeff lebowksi who owes a lot of debt by two angry mobsters and theywell ruin his favorite rug shall we say he goes to the paralyzed millionaire for retribution for his rug only to become even tangled up in a kidnapping plot which involves a severed pinky toe threats of castration and the death of a car as the dude puts it he enlists the help of his crazy paranoid vietnam veteran walter played by goodman who converted to judiasm also to help him out figure out all the chaos going onthe film is for people with a weird sense of humor this is not your typical hollywood comedy by any sense of the imagination and this does have some pretty rough language in it with the fword being said 251 times recommended for fans of monty python and definitely a must see for fans of the coens brothers as well as jeff bridges,black_comedy
this film could not be better this has to be even better than raising arizona another terrificly witty piece of theirs i love the whole cast sound track silliness and seriousness the whole thing was marvelous there couldnt have been a better choice of th actor for the dude jeff bridges had it down from the very beginning milk drinking scene to the instigation of the whole mystery a few of my favorite scenes being the whole slam dunk and mitterating scene the degradation of the car the nialist in the parking lot the ferret in the bath him listening to the best bowling moments on a walkman the walk along the water with donny in hand just to name a few and who could forget the little hottie the mrs lebowski,black_comedy
it took me a few views before i fully appreciated all the subtleties of this film beyond being humorous from both a character and a situational point of view it has a near genius way of combining the extraordinary with the mundane putting the dude in a situation which he does not fit into at all the outrageous exploits of just about every other character including the dudes friend walter and his rich and powerful counterpart also named jeff lebowski are made even more outrageous in the fact that the dude just wants to lay back smoke a joint and not get involved in any of thisthe overly hyped exaggeration of the mystery plot combined with the extremely downplayed acting of jeff bridges as the dude make this film work on many levels and the irregularities of every character really play off each other especially between john goodman and jeff bridges john as the dudes friend walter is such a huge presence with his wild outbursts and near frantic insanity that it winds up the dudes already seemingly highstrung personality and creates a great contrast that really made me respect johns acting abilitiesoverall the great dialogue both subtle and blatant humor and excellent mix of situational and character comedy make this a film that i will definitely recommend for just about any collection,black_comedy
is a very clever hilarious film that stands up to repeat viewings over and over againthe nature of the film is difficult to specify its a comedy that combines elements of surrealism with a decent sound track and visuals and is carried through with excellent performances by great actors playing very funny but unique roles this is by no means a mainstream comedy the story of this film as you will find out doesnt really stand out but what makes the film good is the acting direction and script which im sure every big lebowski fan will tell you contains some of the best speeches and one liners ever written in my opinionthe cohen brothers in my opinion are fantastic directors for those who do not know and their style can be seen throughout using a very delicate balance of simple cinematography and music that wont excite the viewer but develops a pace which suits this film to perfectionall of the actors are superb steve buscemi jeff bridges and john goodman are all amazing and in my opinion goodman should have one an award for his role in the film the film also contains various other special characters throughout which just works brilliantlythere are very few if any elements to this film that could be improved any angle to any aspect you can think of has been chosen and executed perfectly to leave the viewer happy afterwards and as i said it stands up to repeat viewings i have no idea how many times ive watched it but its a lot perhaps 30 and its still just as funny im in awe of the perfect direction and faultless acting from start to finishi have and would recommend it to anyone and those i have love it too enjoy,black_comedy
just watched the ladykillers and am most disappointed ive one question whats happened fargo great big lebowski even better since then the coen brothers have not produced anything that comes close i dont know why this is but i really wish they could make a movie which is half as good as lebowski stop using a list actors such as hanks and clooney and go back to your roots jeff bridges performance as the dude is a joy to behold cant imagine hanks in that role or clooney as someone who doesnt roll on saturdays i can only think that as their movies gained popularity in the 90s they thought they would up the ante and work with big movie stars and have bigger budgets it hasnt worked please ditch all the movie stars and return to the great character driven quirky movies of which you made your names heres hoping,black_comedy
could you imagine anyone taking care to check the contains spoilers box before submitting a comment on this movie the joys of this movie have so little to do with plot revelations that checking that box would be superfluous even if the comment did reveal spoilers this is the cohen brothers best movie i will make a bold prediction in twenty years fargo will have receded into the shadows of forgotten but once praised films while will still be providing its own unique version of wit and humour to film lovers who appreciate the kind of comedy that comes out of funny characters and organic natural feeling dialogue,black_comedy
is it just me or has this movie progressively gotten better every year since it was released like 8 years agojust the setting of the film the brilliant performances by john goodman jeff bridges phillip seymour hoffman john turturo julianne moore david huddleston millionaire lebowski besides its so well written and is just a riot how many memorable lines can you fit in one movie lebowski is great as an almost tragicflawed hero figure hes a hard luck lazy stoner yet you still get a feeling of greatness from him from some of the things he tells us about his past and from his respected presence in the film hes just truly a classic unforgettable movie character i still think the best role in the film is played by goodman who is absolutely fking brilliant as walter i mean admit it who didnt forgive him for 8 years of roseane on the spot i like the slight philosophical undertext of the film and all the archetypes it portrays between the dude walter the millionaire lebowski maude lebowski nihilism pacifism  and using it all as a punchline is hystericaloh and turturo is immediately in the running for most memorable comedy cameo ever with jesus the perverted foulmouthed shttalker you said it man a true cult classic in every sense,black_comedy
do not watch this movie expecting a nice clean storyline from top to bottom in fact you shouldnt expect anything clean out of this movie including the dudes rug not to say there is no plot to there is its just completely inconsequential this is a flick you want to watch when you dont have much else to do youre feeling kinda relaxed and you have a beer or a white russian in your hands the dude will fascinate you him and all his quirky friendsif you watched it once watch it again the dialogue and the lines are so uniquely funny you will find new subtleties every time you watch it if anyone gives you trouble just say hey easy theres a beverage here,black_comedy
every once in a while there comes a movie that leaves you with the feeling that you have witnessed genius is definitely one of those movies you become entranced from the start by sam elliots opening monologue and it never lets up on first viewing the movie can seem slow confusing and even boring but do not let that stop you from seeing it againis an acquired taste it is very good at first and after a few more viewings it becomes undeniably excellent brilliantly crafted in the style of an old hollywood mystery is one of the funniest and most original movies of all time its craftsmanship is perfect and the actors notably jeff bridges phillip seymore hoffman john torturro steve buscemi julianne moore and john goodman all put up some of the best performances of their careers the script by the coen brothers is truly ingenious and its creativity is awe inspiring there are hilarious subtleties that one only notices after seeing it again and again i have seen the movie 17 times and it honestly gets funnier each time is truly the greatest movie ever made,black_comedy
if you take the time to look through some of the more negative reviews of youll see that a lot of people simply dont get this film frankly i feel sorry for them as they are missing out on one of the funniest smartest films ever made the characters are outlandish and ott and are total losers the dude and walter are definitely antiheroes which many people mostly americans im afraid seem to have a major problem with however european audiences have a great love for the lazy underdog and the dude is typical of such bumbling idiots as inspector cluseau the pink panther films and charlie chaplin which may explain the films success in the uk it has become a cult hit amongst students and is quoted by myself and my friends frequently the film boasts very smart writing and is knowingly bizarre and irreverent the dialogue is fastpaced and witty but slightly offkilter to match the overall pitch of the movie i recommend to anyone who is a fan of the coen brothers work and other films which emphasise wit over action such as withnail and i and lost in translation,black_comedy
joel and ethan coen  well known postmodernists the most famous next to quentin tarantino masters in conventionss jugglery the only hitchcocks successors in the field of suspense for example barton fink once again had a fling at viewer once again we are dealing with film labyrinth full of citations conventions and misleads brothers like always in masterly way changing conventions and all of that  accumulation of extremely funny scenes and episodes funny and witty dialogs and loony characters  drowns in smoke of absurdity the movie is made  like every coens production  very shipshape cinematography of genial roger deakins production design and set decoration also great dennis gassner and acting in the movie we can enjoy such great leading actors as julianne moore jeff bridges his best role great characteristic actors like steve buscemi john goodman or john turturro and also masters in supporting like philip seymour hoffman important fact is that characters played by bridges goodman buscemi and turturro were written specially for these actors,black_comedy
to me the greatest thing about the coen brothers is how vastly different each of their films is for example after making the dark dramatic fargo they made this film  a comedy about a stoner who gets his rug stolen what other filmmakers would make such a leap from film to film and continuing doing so through all of their films only the coen brothersstars jeff bridges as jeffrey lebowski an unemployed man known to everyone as the dude his life revolves around the nights spent bowling with his buddies donny steve buscemi and walter john goodman the latter of which is an easily upset vietnam vet life is good for the dude  until two thugs beat him up and pee on his rug mistaking him for a different jeffrey lebowski the dude goes to visit david huddleston and tells him about it shortly thereafter the dude is beat up by three people hes never met then ordered by to be the courier in an exchange s wife bunny a young tara reid has just been kidnapped from there on things get worse and worse for the dude how hes gonna get himself out of it is anyones guessis really a fantastic film there is a wellwritten clever and funny script  which isnt really a surprise from the coen brothers great directing and cinematography the latter by roger deakins particularly during some wonderfully quirky dream sequences theres also a really cool soundtrack featuring bob dylan ccr and morebut what would the film be without the cast jeff bridges is really great and funny as the dude the real highlight of the cast is probably john goodman who is absolutely hilarious as the dudes overthetop best friend theres also good performances from julianne moore philip seymour hoffman david huddleston and sam elliott coen brothers favorites steve buscemi john turturro and peter stormmare also appearas ive said the thing that is most appealing about the coen brothers are the differences between each of their films is one of their very best its a stoner movie  and its one of the best movies ever made watch it dude you wont regret it,black_comedy
 but will for a long time with characters seemingly transported from a 70s hippieexploitation bmovie acting out a plot redolent of raymond chandler only with enough slapstick to keep the three stooges busy for years this movies a bona fide hoot whether or not you remember who creedence was superb casting line readings that shimmer a quotable script and a dream sequence that youll remember every time you lace on those bowling shoes and a soundtrack that includes mickey newburys sublime just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in from 1968 sung by kenny rogers i believe in nothing  except,black_comedy

is about a man named the dude jeffrey lebowski who is mistaken for a millionaire with the same exact name and goes through bizarre experiences in an attempt to clear his name this film is a sure enough promise to make your worries be over after watching the movie i thought this film was going to be stupid and sure enough it was but also it was utterly hilarious with smart dialogue and stylish scenes jeff bridges as the dude does a terrific job in the film and his bizarre dreams are greatly acted by him john turturro also had a great role even though he only starred in about two scenes the introduction of him was the funniest scene of the entire movie john goodman steve buscemi and phillip seymour hoffman had good roles too as well this is a stupid funny film and that is entirely why i enjoy it with its slapstick scenes i liked fargo and o brother where art thou but this in my opinion is the best coen film yet i recommend ithedeens outlook 8510  b,black_comedy
without a doubt the funniest film ive ever had the privilege of watching a magical brew concocted from a script overflowing with multinuanced humour masterful directing and a cast with the skill and understanding to pull it offthe plot is a looselyrendered updating of raymond chandlers convoluted detective tales in this film the coen brothers have replaced the genres traditional antihero detective with a drugaddled aging hippie and if that makes any sense then all else flows from there ruminations abound on the ultimate ineffectuality of both the militant and pacifistic factions of americas people the story is played out in front of the backdrop of the gulf war which took place 7 year before the movie was made  giving the characters generally incompetent actions a resonance of futility  the people are not only too ineffectual to change the world they live in they also seem quite content to inhabit their garish world the fact that the characters barely mention the war itself besides walter an exvietnam vet whos fascination with the killing fields knows no boundsreflects on their general apathy  the dude the detective who is really a lazy hippie searching for his rattyassed rugin this tale is from the flowerpower generation yet is completely unconcerned with the state of conflict his country finds itself in  and yet this theme is not overplayed and the laughs come thick and fast intellectual gags observational humour physical comedy running jokes characterbased funny stuff  the strength of the actual comedy content lies in the sheer variety of absurdity the coens manage to address in one film  the two lead characters the dude jeff bridges and walter john goodman are wonderfully written and brilliantly performed the support cast are just as wonderful with julianne moore steve buscemi john turturro and sam elliott all playing their part in keeping the laughs coming the coens also introduce a host of eccentric bitplayers into the mix a gang of cricketbat wielding german nihlists knox harrington the video artist the dudes nervy landlord marty porn king jackie treehorn high school brat larry sellers these seemingly random characters help bring the coen brothers la to vivid life the plot itself is full of redherrings and after laughing ones way through an initial viewing a few questions will be left hanging and indeed some of the characters actions remain unclear after the credits have rolled ie did little larry steal the dudes car  who kepthadlost the millions dollars  was there a million dollars   the whole chain of events is initially precipitated by a case of mistaken identity and noone the viewers the characters seems to know exactly whats going on adding to the freewheelin rambling feel the coens trademark razorsharp dialogue has never been funnier than it is here once youre hooked youll never miss an opportunity to drop one of the endless hilarious quotes into conversation and your friends wont mind as youll have brainwashed them into loving this incredibly clever comedy film too  am i wrong ,black_comedy
in their career coen brothers wont again reach the high who they released with this movie  movie based over the vagabond brain of dude and the ironic and without a possible description of the jew walter  but rarely a movie can be remembered for his superb dialogs and sentences as  this aggression will not stand man the bums will always lose have you ever heardof vietnam youre enteringa world of pain son and many others  its as to describe a landscape colored with millions of colors  a way to walk in an alien heaven  its how life should be but the potential is its how life might be  kind of humans with their low vision of this world would not spend a cent as they wouldnt break their ordinary world of fear  fear watching a person who does change own world without pretending to change anything  an anonymous sequence of dna binary in a world ever biggest than the day before  and dude swims in this anonymous world  escaping from sharks  humans which lost from their born that free state primitive painted by jjrousseau in emile  anything of this movie is a huge smile and a long and bitter laugh about this occidental society ,black_comedy

the coen brothers make the kind of movies that i think you either love or hate their very special brand of humor and their weird characters make them an experience out of the ordinaryjeff lebowski jeff bridges is called the dude by his friends hes an aging hippie living the comfortable life mostly just bowling however one day he is mistaken for the infinitely more ambitious jeffrey lebowski an industrialist of considerable wealth the mixup leads to a set of events among including among other things german nihilists and kidnappingsyou have never seen jeff bridges like this before i dont know what it is that the coen brothers have but they always seem to bring out the strangest things in the actors they use just look at john goodman as soon as he works with the coens he shines like never before anyway the very strange comedy that this movie presents is something that defies explanation but i can say that i found it amazingly funny well written and well played and its also a beautiful movie with high quality photography as well as cinematographythis is probably the funniest movie that the coen brothers have ever made in competition with arizona junior a hysterical mix between weird characters weird comedy and great filmmaking a mustsee i rate it 710,black_comedy
one of the more bizarre movies ive seen by a long shot this follows swearaholic jeff the dude lebowski who is mistaken and has his rug soiled near the start of the film going to the intended soiledrug person the dude gets himself foolishly involved in a kidnapping case in which a womans toe is cut off him and his buddy walter and idiotic friend donny shut the fk up try to figure it all out this film mainly succeeds because of the characters john tuturro as a ludicrous child molester donny and walter the films high point always finding new hilarious dialogue to spit at the camera had it not been for some fantastic performances from jeff bridges and john goodman this may well not be the funny thrillerslacker comedy that it was a memorable movie filled to the brim with politically incorrect scenes and some unusually twisted phrases and comedy scores big but what do you expect if its done by the coen brothersoverall  out of  4 out of 5,black_comedy
before i watched this film i was a high flying business man working in london a mover and shaker a big wig you know the type i brought and destroyed people like you before lunch time just for kicks but that all changed on one of my rare moments off i managed to slow down enough to watch this film and let me say this i am a changed man instead of going to work and holding meetings with people all over the world i just walk around in my pants all day drinking white russians and touching myself oh and theres some bowling involved as well pay close attention to my story for we all need to slow down instead of working have a drink or go bowling or what ever you want i dont give a crap what you do,black_comedy
one of the best comedies ive ever seen in my entire life and definitely one of my favorite films ever it figures we are talking about two writers that produce gold every time their pens touch paper and about a truly incredible cast the story is absurd and brilliant but the real strong point of this movie are the characters the dude jeff bridges walter john goodman donny steve buscemi maude julian moore and of course jesus john torturo five of the many in this film really rare types of persons that produce some masterpiece acting from all actors stars or not the movie is full of out of the normal situations that watching them will make you laugh your heart out and amazingly intelligent linesdefinitely a very special film youre going to laugh really really hard and youll never forget it,black_comedy
from the infamous coen brothers comes a movie so fresh and original that one must wonder what they were thinking when the concept for this film sparkedrevolves around the simplelooking yet wonderfullyacted character of the dude jeff lebowski jeff bridges and due to a case of mistaken identity with another jeffrey lebowski he becomes swept up in the story of family deceptionthe story if the movie seems to be about extortion and conspiracy and kidnapping but the reality of the movie exists on two different levels there is the overly dramatic suspense story and then there is the story of a deadbeat who just wants his rug back and to remove himself from all the confusion the brilliance is that the movie treats the dudes plight as the more important story in the same process making a parody of the big story within the movie and a parody of dramatic plots in general everyone even the dudes best friend wally starts moving on this upper wavelength and the dude is the only one who brings the viewer back down to earththe dude himself is merely a complete loser albeit one whose charisma has earned him a crown of respect among his own lower tier he is swept up in the flow of this big conspiracy against his will and gets taken for a brutal ride he gets beaten up attacked by a marmet has his rug peed on and receives repeated abuses to his car along with other things the kidnapping plot becomes confusing and hard to follow but its not necessary to understand totally the real treasure of the movie is watching the dudes reactions to all the convoluted things happening around himthe juxtaposition of the overthetop drama of most of the characters and the simplemindedness of a man who spends the entire movie in his pajamas and with a white russian in his hand provides for countless memorable scenes and quotable dialogue the movie is at its roots always a comedy but a smart one its downfall is that it has more highly amusing moments than it does laugh out loud momentsstill what it lacks in cheap laughs it makes up for in beautiful cinematography the musical score the camera angles in the bowling alley especially and most of all the dream sequences that have to be seen for words cannot do them justicejeff bridges julianne moore and john goodman all give fantastic performances the characters are fun and memorable and theres not much i can do else to describe the movie everyone owes it to themselves to see this movie at least once just to experience its unique taste,black_comedy
cash converters has thrown up some real gems in its time but is without doubt the best 2 i have ever spent in my life once again the coens showed their undoubted genius which if i had my way would result in the bestowing of an honorary knighthood upon both of them and if i know our queeny which im sure i think i do then one look at the dude walter and donny and the decision would be made for her unfortunately i would imagine that snapped up the only copy ever to be seen in the converters what fool sold this put him in the stocks so she might have to splash out a bit more than i didnow compared to their other classics which is pretty much everything theyve done this may not have the original impact of blood simple the sublime acting of fargo think william h macy and frances mcdormand or indeed the insane imagination of o brother where art thou however what separates lebowski from the others is the almost unbelievable volume of hilarious characters every single character without fail is so funny that the only disappointing aspect of the film is that you cant watch more of each of them jesus quintana the brilliant john turturro is probably only on screen for about 5 minutes yet he is quite possibly one of the funniest characters of all time  you show your piece on the lane again ill take it off you and stick it up your ae the nihilists are scarily funny no more so than when they are being taken apart by walter in a fight scene that tops even motorcycle gang and though he barely says a word you can feel nothing but complete sympathy poor old smokey when in a truly poignant scene and beautifully acted scene he is accused of stepping over the line by walter unjustly i feel but it is the dream team trio who stand head and shoulders and upper arm above all of them tragic putupon donny we will truly miss you son scarred vietnam warhero walter this isnt nam man there are rules and of course the dude who is quite simply a dudethese characters would stand alone without a decent script and still entertain for the entirety of the film but this is the coen brothers who write such consistently and astonishingly funny scripts that you wonder how they keep doing it when they are on top form which they are pretty much permanently they make films of near perfection that other directors and scriptwriters could only dream ofmay lack the supreme cleverness of other coen films but it is undoubtedly their funniest and all you can do is watch in awe at the onslaught of brilliant characters the day they stop making films will truly be a mournful one,black_comedy
and without question the greatest movie ever made enough said i think but the site requires at least ten lines so here are ten lines1 shut the f up donny 2 phones ringing dude 3 jeffrey love me 4 hes a good manand thorough 5 also chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature dude asian american please 6 that rug really tied the room together 7 am i wrong 8 say what you will about the tenets of national socialism but at least its an ethos 9 im just gonna go find a cash machine 10 your revolution is over mr lebowski do you hear me the bums lost,black_comedy
i have taken quite a liking towards the coen brothers i never really appreciated their work since until recently when i saw both o brother where art thou and both very funny and abundantly entertaining movies the best thing about both these movies was that i watched them each in small bits every time for about 2025 minutes and when i started watching where i left off it was if as i had been watching the movie in one take there was no khmm i better rewind a couple of minutes back to remember what happened they were both highly enjoyable movies to watch because of their simplicity in storytelling and although simple the stories are always rich in detail and the two brothers are on hell of a storyteller i have always loved the movie directors that use the same actors over and over again and then make jokes about this in their movies the main reason i dig some kevin smith movies and the coens have a blast out of this as well its a homely feeling for the viewer i guess a sort of subconscious participation and understanding of these jokes which i find great the feeling of is very easygoing just as our protagonist a great sense of musical accompaniment great acting by each and every actor and a great sense of directing are all wonderfully presented plus there are many laugh out loud scenes that are truly hilarious the scene where the character of jesus a roughly 3 minute oscarworthy performance by turturo is presented oh yeah and a hell of a script simple and loads of fun710,black_comedy
so if you are like me you have a bit of a strange but clever sense of humor and youre sixteen and you have a large group of friends with a similar sense of humor now this is the perfect film for that kind of clich teenage bonding i remember laughing for ten minutes straight when the guy threw the coffee cup and the dude went you fking fascistalright well its a quality movie its weird you dont get it sometimes but you laugh and when its over you go whoa man that was good its seems silly and senseless but its one of thoooose movies where its cinematic genius at its best also this is undoubtedly john goodmans best role his character gets enraged a lot and he ties everything back to vietnamand its just the funniest shit ever not everything has to do with vietnam and alsolemme be frank with youi have a weird thing for steve buscemi seriouslywhatever it is about him that attracts a young lady to a kinda creepy older bugeyed little mani dont know but he is especially cute in this movie shut the fk up donny i am the walrus good stuffi should do more plot summary instead of quoting so ill seem somewhat intelligent welli cant really explain this movie just see it you will thank me alright thats it peace out,black_comedy

were it not for some of the woody allens classic slapstick films iwould have little reservation in saying that stoodalone atop the list as my all time favorite pure comedy over a periodof years ive probably seen this movie ten times and every time i watchit produces multiple belly laughsin my opinion the coen brothers who wrote and directed this piece arethe most versatile filmmakers of our time some how they manage toincorporate an ambiance of surrealism into all of their work comedic ornot nowhere is this effect more blatantly utilized than in the biglebowski a good example is sam elliotts narration and briefappearance which are totally out of place but completely effectivethen theres john turtturos cameo as jesus quintana a hispanic purpleclad pedophile bowling fanatic which left me howlingi would never have thought that jeff bridges could conform so perfectlyto the leading role of jeff lebowski or the dude as he insist onbeing called his sparkling adaptation of a dry witted mostly laidback unemployed pot smoking hippie who rarely takes anything seriouslyand has frequent acid flashbacks was completely convincingwith the encouragement of his friend walter john goodman the dudehatches what should be a relatively simple scheme to replace a damagedrug this evolves as the anchor for a complex urban nightmare that issmart and loudly amusinggoodmans portrayal of a high strung unstable totally irrationalconspiracy minded vietnam veteran is absolutely hilarious in my opinionthe finest performance of his career in fact his role may be the mostintegral component to the success of this filmunfortunately this film didnt receive nearly as much ink as the coenscomedy classic raising arizona which is unfortunate personally ithought lebowski was more intelligent and considerably more humorous,black_comedy
ok here goes some minor spoilersalthough i have been an imdb enthusiastmember for quite some time i do not usually write comments or reviews here this is my first but was moved to do so after seeing for the second time i first saw it around 2 years agoit is pointless to reiterate the comments of many other reviewers that this movie is simply great  great movie comedy acting directing etc i agree wholeheartedly see previous reviews for the merits of this movie however having watched the dude again recently i thought i would attempt to add something new to previous reviewsis their a point or message to this movie well for what it is worth  here is my offering it could be said that the main theme of the film is social or moral responsibility we all have our faults yet we constantly criticize others while ignoring our own we have the dude and walter being completely disgusted at the thought of someone peeing on the dudes rug and out of order it certainly is it held the room together man then very shortly afterward walter finds it perfectly acceptable to stick a gun in an opponents face for a bowling faux pas while constantly annoyed and frustrated by his best buddies lack of social and diplomatic skills the dude is probably committing the greatest sin of all  most people consider that dropping out not working and possessing a completely apathetic attitude to life is just not acceptable we all think those characters are fun have great lives and wish we could be them but we just cant we have jobs lives wives kids we then have poor old donny  everyone has a voice and a right to be heard but walter constantly reminds him that he is out of his depth and forever cuts him off there are also other comments on the idle rich bunny and the wealthy selfish types who are all consumed with themselves or what they do maude wants a child but is not interested in a partner or father for her intended offspring most would consider that to commit a child to a oneparent relationship automatically even before it is born is a moralsocial wrongperhaps these things suggest that we all have a responsibility to the people and issues around usthen there is the problem of the little green pieces of paper all morals or responsibility suddenly disappear when there are a million bucks floating around walter goes for the throat and decides that nothing is going to stop him and the dude getting that money the only thing that makes him think twice is when the dude suggests that he may not bowl in the team even the dude himself totally laid back and previously only concerned with getting a new rug gets caught up in the deceit and subterfuge eagerly snapping up the chance for finders fees and other financial incentives for finding money that he and his buddy lost in the first place fine attitudes all round in my opinion this point is finally rammed home by the comically inept nihilist germans they typify all the previous comments with a complete disregard for anyone and everything but themselves and financial or other gainthe responsibility issue then goes further up the line with walter reminding his buddies everyone around him and the audience about the vietnam thing echoing not just vietnam vets but many other disenchanted exserviceman worldwide socially and morally responsible government anyone  we are informed that the events take place shortly after the gulf war saddam hussein even makes an appearance issuing the dude with his bowling shoes in the dream sequence a chilling perspective indeedlastly my favourite scene which would seem to illustrate the main point the dude and walter are in a coffee shop and are reminded by the owner to watch their mannerslanguage as this is a family place the dude wanders off but walter just sits there his attitude and the look on his face are a picture he is gonna finish his coffee he aint doing nothing bad as he often says am i wrong,black_comedy
come on everybody now  say slowly after me duuuuuddenow that thats done what further introduction do we need for the great lord the doer of things and other stuff that genuine dudes do so you must have understood by now that were not speaking about just any dude nononono we are speaking about the dude el duderino or whateverok i cut to the point he just is the dude alright i dont know im talking like the dude here but just a normal dude because i wouldnt even be able to scratch at his great dudness here i am completely dudified after watching this movie oh good lord of dudness i have finally come to mention the word moviewhat am i supposed to do here write a review about the lebowski dude no way man there is too much dudness going on that i cant put it into any words here well i can say this you dont need to have fought in vietnam and died with your face in the muck to be able to appreciate this moviedude this movie does it1010,black_comedy
im not sure what the big fuss is about this film i didnt connect with the main characters whilst there was sympathy there i did not feel the empathy for the main character weve come to expect from hollywood the framing device for the film detracted for it and made it odd from the startthe basic plot of the film is that a layabout has his life intruded by the problems of another man hes exploited but through forces out of his control for instance his irritating layabout friend manages to outwit the baddie and at the end of the film things are fairly much status quo apart from lebowski being a rug and a friend down the answer to this predicament go bowling what is this film about its not a feelgood film its not a feelbad film its not a gooutandchangeyourlife film if anything it serves to prove the futility and banality of much of life yet does nothing with this chance a wasted opportunity a wasted film budget and a wasted hour and a half ok thats a bit harsh the film is not bad as such its just been hyped somewhat and i expected a lot more watch it by all means just dont expect to get too much out of it a couple of funny moments thats really about it,black_comedy
a wonderfully structured and imaginative film yet again from the best movie makers in town excellent characters with excellent dialogue is a combination that can never fail the dream sequences are also spot on and the plot keeps you on your toes the whole way through the dude has to be the best character in films for quite a while and is brilliantly played by jeff bridges but then again how can you forget john goodmans crazed vietnam vet walter sam elliotts the stranger ben gazzaras porn promoter jackie treehorn or last but not least john turturros peadophilic bowler jesus quintana,black_comedy
may include spoilersthe coen brothers is what i would call a masterpiece great actors superb dialogue great score jeff bridges is amazingly funny as the slackerpotheadwhiterussianjunkie the dude the supporting cast is full of good actors such as john turturro john goodman and steve buscemi and everyones contributing to the movie the humor goes from clever to pure slapstick but always manages to be funnythe most fascinating thing about this movie is that it improves upon each look after the first time i saw it i thought that it was great the next time i thought it was even better ive seen it six times now and it  just keeps on improving i think its the complex story a fine blend of parody and celebration to the film noir that makes it better the more you watch it1010,black_comedy
this movie really tops all other comedys from the opening scene the dude in his morning robe in the supermarket the old fashioned telephone which keeps on ringing every line in this movie is one to remember and every character is so good it makes you smile if you think about them and its a movie which gets better with every viewing i find humor so much better if its so dry you keep wondering if you should laugh out loud or implodewhat to say youve got to see this more then once,black_comedy
this movie is simply great  watch it again since its probably been a month or two since you last saw it  what can be said that hasnt already other than to comment on the unfortunate but hilarious alteration made to the dialogue for the tvfriendly clean edit when walter destroys the corvette in what he thinks is retaliation for the disappearance of the dudes car he bellows this is what you get when you fight a stranger in the alps  fans of the film will recall instantly what this line replacesthe cohen brothers are in top form on this one  too bad intolerable cruelty didnt quite deliver,black_comedy
i as you dear reader probably do too make it a point to sit aroundthe fireplace with my children and their childrens children duringthe holidays eating candied yams and watching the biglebowski  its a family experience that bonds us ever closer eachpassing year  we laugh in sorrow and weep in joyits got it all  german nihilists that dont believe in anything androgynous flamenco bowlers  flying femenist avantgardepainter people  smut videos with exotic accents filmed in gloriousvideo  furry little mammals in harnesses  white russians madewith powdered milk  iron lungs  photos of farmhouses just a bitwest from way out in the middle of nowherewitness the dude get kicked around from one limo into another feel the bubbles caressing your back as the bathtub turns into awhirlpool  learn a thing or two from the dude on how not tobarricade yourself at home  grab hints from the dude as how tosqueeze the most out of your walkman on those lonely weeknights  and above all appreciate the value of being polite tocab drivers because you know they are people too with feelingsyes maam has got it all hanging together as aroom does when theres a nice carpet laying about  anepistemology lesson in easy to swallow pink tablets a musicalextravaganza that puts any old cspan book signing broadcast toshame a buzzard flapping its wings in nevada and creating ablanket of fog over london is all this andmaybe just a little bit more but dont quote me on that onejust one thing though  does the dude really have to cuss somuchfor consistently putting me in a cheery mood lower to mid ninesout of ten,black_comedy
i guess this is primarily the coens tribute to the city of angels the plot is complicated and very much like a raymond chandler novel  it is interesting to compare with edward dmytryks version of farewell my lovely titled  murder my sweet the dude is the philip marlowe of our days or the days of the first gulf warjeff bridges proves once again that he is an extremely versatile actor i like the way he moves as lebowski reminds me of an overgrown baby john goodman makes once more clear that big bears are not always huggable the rest of the cast turns up sporadically and is rather part of the general scenery  all the people seem to be phonies except bowling buddy donny fashioned after unforgettable elisha cook jr i guess who is asked to shut up whenever he opens his mouth and wants to get in the picture the police chief of malibu and the taxi driver who drives lebowski home after his encounter with that chief seem to reflect the true life behaviour of people the coens encountered in southern california the scene of the chief throwing an empty mug at lebowskis head has an uneasy realism that makes it the most brutal of the whole movie,black_comedy
this movie is great im a very big coenfan and i think this flick is one of their masterpieces you see that the brothers and the actors had a great time making this movie the typical coenactors like john goodman jon polito john turturro steve buscemi  all play a role or at least have a cameo even if youre not such obsessed as me youll enjoy this piece of fun mel brooks once said that its not easy to make a good comedy  and thats why this movie really is a comedymasterpiecebut wheres frances mcdormand in this excellent flick,black_comedy
movies from the coen brothers hardly ever circle around its starseven when they feature george clooney this notion is parallel to that of alfred hitchcock a director who merely used his big name actors eg james stewart cary grant to draw people toward his films a brilliant stunt if there ever was like the auteur hitchcock joel and ethan coen apply their signature through their own particular themes and styles typical coen trademarks include wacky characters with even wackier circumstances complex narratives and of course malicious criminals the use of dialogue throughout their flicks is sharp and witty and the cinematography is usually astounding like all formalists style to the coens is very important luckily for them their actors have been excellent toowhile the coens have been sticking to their guns with the right team to emulate their indigenous southern players john goodman john turturro steve buscemi etc the end result lies in the view that stresses the dominance of the director this view is the auteur theory whoever controls the mise en scene is the true author of a movie giannetti 305 mise en scene is the medium of the story many elements strike across this medium throughout coen films beginning initially with quirky eccentric characterswith a commonly esoteric wellread audience many will claim ethan and joel to be elitists of sorts holding them to their own acidic mockery of both whitetrash raising arizona and whitecollared foolishness barton fink oh brother where art thou with characters emulating intellectual superioritiess the dude recurs various dream sequences any time hes coldcocked by incriminating visitors or whenever he enters his own acidflashback state of mind like the fate of these dreams meticulous camera angles focus on the fate of the individualsdialogue to the coens is so important perhaps so debatable to say that its the very element that links and ties the entire story of together each character in lebowski follows their own rules of dialogue walter john goodman ties everything back to vietnam donny buscemi does nothing but appear to be confused and behind in conversations the others are spewing back and forth for example the dude jeff bridges at his best and walter are exasperated about the dudes missing car yet donny is still hung up on why there is underwear in the briefcase and not the one million dollars that are supposed to exchange even in a smaller role the dedicated assistant to jeffrey brandt philip seymour hoffman never breaks from his smithers personality using the simpsons analogy brandt obeys to every request finally the dude incorporates tidbits from previously encountered conversations into new dialogues later in the film this aggression will not stand were gonna cut your johnson off larry and many moretechnical aspects in coen projectsa joel specialty as ethan is more the writeremploy much intimacy towards the characters in order for the usual black humor to work even in extremely violent situations and there are a lot of them camera angles and particular framing allow scenes to become flatout hilarious characters are always framed in a way that the viewer can anticipate that something godawful is going to happen when the dude first enters his house alone the camera aims down on the poor guy just before his face is flushed down the toilet and almighty carpet is soiled on this type of anticipation makes this sequences a lot funnier than the usual pop out of nowhere scams we see in much horror and crimedrama todayanother important element to the coens filmmaking is the use of cinematography with rather obscure environments even when characters are not isolated throughout many of the coen brothers films inner solitude is still apparent this notion might only contradict withs closeness in its framing the film just screams this is the dude and his simplicity the varying closeups indicate that might not be we might think other formalist elements include a plethora of jump cuts that often signify cliffhangers concluding jokeswhen you think coen you probably dont think sound however their soundtracks often tell a lot more than even the characters do who can forget credence clearwater revivals dude dude dude okay so its doo doo doo when the big lebowkis dude shoots from a formerfundamentalist to california err dudean auteur is not known for his or her consistency heck even critics will tell you that not all of french new wave was good the coens millers crossing raising arizona fargo and oh brother where art thou are all huge hits with critics yet the hudsucker proxy big lebowski and blood simple likewise all have had their cynics their notsotalkedabout films such as the man who wasnt there and barton fink are cult classics perhaps this case of hitandmiss is so mightily apparent due to the coen brothers revolving their films around witty dialogue and style almost nominated for a best screenplay or best cinematography whenever dropping a film and not the extensiveness of character developmentthe struggle between becoming a great auteur and shooting for a hollywood hit is a debate that now has become more visible with the release of intolerable cruelty the film stars an ensemble hollywood cast including huge stars catherine zetajonesdouglas and an againused clooney and even employs the use of a little romanticcomedy flair absent from previous coen independents can the coen brothers be deemed for films much to the liking of an alfred hitchcock whos acclaimed for using style over substance after all an auteur figure is one who adds his own personal touch to his art the coens make great art look black much to the humor that has helped separate these two directors from any otherindependent or hollywood notwithstanding45 stars,black_comedy
am a fan of the coen brothers i ve seen all their films  the first time i saw the big lebwoski at the cinema i wasnt really impressed but when it came out on video i grabbed a copy  after watching the video then the whole plot sank in jeff john steve and john tutoro were just mesmerising i love this film so much that i watched it once a month there are many reasons why i loved this film the plot actors involved the one lines etc etcone of my favourite line was when the dude went to maudes house and there was this annoying guy laughing and the dude said what the  is wrong with this guy who is he or when the real lebowski said his wife was kidnapped and the dude went bummer thats a bummer men  you will think the dude introduced the word men should i go on,black_comedy
you hardly could expect more from a movie there is a great script with great characters some of them walter might remain forever in the story of hollywood nice cinematography specially some clips related about bowling nice music too also wonderful performances of bridges goodman and buscemi but among all of them john goodmanwalter again raises to the topbut overall this is an hilarious comedy a great collection of laughs it wont change your live but it could surely will make it much funnier for a while 810 i only give 9 or 10 to things like citizen kane and the lot sorry about my english,black_comedy
10 pinning and the occasional acid flashbackwhen i saw this movie for the first time i was flabbergasted it was quite simply the funniest movie id ever seen it still is the c bros have once again pulled it off a masterpiecethe dialogue is second to none and john s lyons should have won innumerable awards for his unprecedented casting job sure ive met people who didnt like it but then again ive also met people who didnt care for roger  me i guess were just on separate planetsthe dude walter sobchak donny karabozoz and the rarely appearing jesus quintana are gut splittingly hilarious and the essence of working class heroes i loveumsince i fist saw this gem ive bought the movie the soundtrack and a pair of clear plastic sandalsi rate it supreme,black_comedy
i first watched this film some years ago and at the time was probably worse for wear from sleep deprivation and all i can remember was that i liked the film as i watched it this time i was concerned that my memory was playing up again or remembering wrong but then the movie started to get going basically jeffrey lebowski the dude jeff bridges is mistaken for the millionaire jeffrey lebowski chaos ensues as the dude becomes embroiled in the kidnap of lebowskis trophy wife who owes big money to big people and he would much rather be bowling a joel coen film that grows on me each time i have seen it the dream scenes are enough of a reason to watch the film but the superb acting from the likes of jeff bridges john goodman julianne moore and steve buscemi the nonstop story line that once it has started hardly gives you a chance to think or work out what is going on and the great direction and production make this a superb unmissable film,black_comedy
transcends the typical boundaries of slapstick humor and replaces them with a deeper more meaningful cinematic workthe acting in this movie is more than simply well done john goodman performs in one of the most hilarious comedy roles to date and jeff bridges undergoes the transformation to the dude easily a brilliant movie with a great punchline constant laughs and stereotypeknocking gags make this a must seerating 9 of 10,black_comedy
the cohn bros produce the best cutting edge comedy of the 90s in this wacky and original flic the writing is outstanding as is the acting  if only other filmmakers had their talents on eof the few movies i would buy to have on hand,black_comedy
apart from its burgeoning cult status this film is seriously overlooked and underrated perhaps partially the result of gross marketing misrepresentation regardless you know how there are some films that strike such a cord that you tend to believe you can effectively use them to screen potential friends and lovers this is such a film for me excellent script generationdefining philosophy both boomers and xers tend to like it the most in my experience tempered with humor unforgettable characters and performances exquisitely produced my favorite film of the coen brothers offerings and in my top ten of anyone elses great soundtrack to boot,black_comedy
i can really feel for this guy  he gets his whole life turned upside down just because of a case of mistaken identity  the dude survives and thrives somehow  john goodmans character is deeply deeply disturbed  he could stand some postvietnam transition therapy  shut the  up donny,black_comedy
i like this the best of all the coen brother films and although having seen almost every film steve buscemi has been in i never have appreciated him as much as now after having seen him in this film steve is absolutely stunningly wonderful and of course john goodman is once again one of our ten best actors the most suprising element of this film is how good jeff bridges is in this why this movie did not get the critical acclamation that barton fink and fargo got escapes me completely i truly enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it most poignant for me was the archetypical hypocrisy of the can do right wing doppelganger of the dude which is seemingly selfevident to the general public or it wouldnt have been characterised with such nonchalance this film brings us back to the mindset and humour of another coen classic raising arizona great stuff,black_comedy
if youre a coen bros fan run do not walk and get yourself a copy of this movie  there are some movies i can watch more than once and this is one of them  there are so many laughs in this flick you pick up something new with each viewing  am i wrong,black_comedy
it is the early 90s george bush snr is attacking iraq and in the middle of los angeles is a man named jeff lebowski aka the dudebridges the dudes life consists of three main things to get stoned to drink white russians and to go ten pin bowling life is simple for the dude unforunately he is mistaken for the millionaire with the same name as him by two thugs who relieved themseleves on the dudes rug after the dude explained the situation to the lebowski he was thrown out and told to get a job however lebowski had changed his mind and ask the dude to help him find his kidnapped trophy wife with the help of his bowling sidekicks which consist of a vietnam veteran who sees everything in terms of war and battles and a quiet person who is always told to shut up when he puts his opinion into the conversation they go onto a weird and wacky adventure it includes meetings with a bunch of german nilhilists a feminist artist and an old fashion cowboy to name a few i do not want to carry on with the plot of the movie otherwise it will consist with some spoilers but my thought on the movie is this probably one of the funniest stoner movies i have seen for a while it would have to be said that the plot is flimsy yet it is the characters invented by the coen brothers are truly amazing jeff bridges portrayal of the dude is so great that he will only be known as the dude on his tombstone john goodman is fantastic as the vietnam vet walter and steve buscemi is too funny as the straight guy donny however there is one character who is truly funny and that is the hispanic bowler jesus quintina unfornuately he is a bit player in this movie but his lines are first class no doubt about itto conclude this movie is a great movie which should be watched by those who admire a good comedy and great characters also i would like to say that this movie is better than fargo,black_comedy
the coen brothers is perhaps the most entertaining film i have seen in a long time  this film is a ludicrous parody of mistakenidentity movies and i mean that in a good way  clever visually appealing and having an engaging soundtrack is the perfect movie to watch when bored in class under the influence of some controlled substance or all of the above  i find that i can watch it at any time and love it  i thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with a quirky random sense of humor and a taste for absurdity  above all it will make you want to go bowling  thumbs up,black_comedy
is one of the coen brothers best movies so far i cant believe that more movies arent this funny or original hollywood needs to take a lesson from the coens and start making quality films instead of churning out crap like gigli and legally blonde is perfectly cast jeff bridges is the dude and ive never seen him more comfortable and at home in a role john goodmans walter is one of the funniest and most conflicted characters he has ever played everyone in the movie does well philip seymour hoffman deserves praise for his proper endlessly smiling assistant brant the soundtrack enhances the feel of the film and fits it perfectly the humor and innate weirdness of the movie only furthers the genius of the coen brothers bottom line so funny so great so coen if you dont like this movie im sorry but you dont know what good is,black_comedy
stars jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi as three loser slackers who get caught up in a kidnapping plot involving a paralyzed millionaire david huddelston his pornstar wife tara reid a strange artist julianne moore and a group of german nihilists peter stormare flea and torsten vogesof the coens movies ive seen fargo and the hudsucker proxy  all three where quite enjoyable but lebowski leaves the other two far behindon the groundand coughing in its dust  the dialogue is fast furious and funny the performances are grade a and the semicomplex plot is both easy to figure out and great fun to watchof course if there is anything wrong it is the language  first it was die hard then reservoir dogs then this  all great movies but one wonders if so much language is necessary  still its easy to get over and it even parodies itself with sam elliots stranger character who questions why all the characters need to use so many cuss wordsbut as i said the good outweighs the bad  this is one rollicking fun and completely hilarious movie 8510,black_comedy
the first time i saw this movie i fell asleep i was unimpressed now i think ive seen it at least 20 times and it gets funnier everytime i notice something new everytime i watch it how many people would rent bowling shoes and not wear socks with them the scene where turturro is introduced is probably my favorite of the film he first appears as this feared bowler type that everyone appears to be worried about walter introduces him and cuts him down to what he really is and as he does it the lyrics in the song switch from spanish to english  at this point you realize the humor of the whole scene it goes from something magical and almost beautifulas magical and beautiful as bowling can be to something hilarious in about 2 seconds the soundtrack fits perfectly with every scene in the movie especially the opening scenes the jesus scene and the gutterballs scene although the dude is the hero my favorite characters are john goodmans walter and steve buscemis donny goodman pulls off walter the way no one else could and buscemi is just as amazing in his limited role sam elliotts narration adds the perfect icing to the cakeas walter would say am i wrong am i wrong,black_comedy
i saw this movie in theaters when i was an undergrad in auburn alabama auburns a great school its just in an unfortunate locationanyway  this is one of the few great movies i was allowed to see there lord knows they didnt allow many cool movies in town  this movie can be enjoyed on so many levels  as a sociopolitical commentary on the supposedly nonexistent state of class in the american society  or as just a damn funny movie  oh and asia carrera the most awesome woman on the planet is featured albeit brieflyim a big movie buff and this one is definitely in my top 10,black_comedy
you can try very hard for a long time to find something wrong with this film dont bother trying there isnt anything the script is wonderful  as youd perhaps expect from the coens  the casting and acting is spot on the music is great and above all the feel of the whole thing is sublime pathos and humour in equal measure its difficult to pick out the best bits there are so many memorbale lines and moments jeff bridges looks born from the role of the dude steve buscemi and wonderfully understated julianne moore almost unrecognisable quirky but it is john goodman that steals the whole thing for me his performance as walter is one of the best you will see and is the main reason that you can watch this film over and over it doesnt matter that you know what is going to happen and what he is going to say the performance never disappoints whenever i travel on business i only ever take 1 dvd with me the choice is always the same,black_comedy
i can say only one thing about this brilliant masterpiece its like a 5000 pieces puzzle that fits perfectly everything in this movie is like it should be nothing more nothing less the characters the story the music the photography it all fits together like it was ment to be this is a piece of art,black_comedy
this movie has no point no structure it doesnt appeal to a mainstream audience it isnt cerebral and it meanders its way to no real conclusionhaving said that it is a nearly perfect comedywhen i first saw a few years back i was somewhat disappointed with it  but this movie just gets better with each viewing and it is now easily one of my favorites  the dialogue is just hilarious despite some excessive profanity and the interaction of the main characters is thoroughly entertaining  good acting all the way around although goodman and bridges stand out  in general this is just a fun movie to watch,black_comedy
this has to be the greatest movie of all time ill say it againyou told brandt on the phone he told me yes yes the bums will always lose shut the fk up donnie classic unforgettable line after line a work of art how can clerks be above this in the ratings this is at 228 and droppingcome on people the coen brothers are 2 of the most intelligent writers and directors in the history of filmperiod incrediblethe film would have been flawless if it was not for the flying with the bowling ball trip thingand the other dancing scene david huddleston was perfect as the other jeff lebowski he should have won something for that role,black_comedy
quite possibly the funniest movie ive ever seen  also one of the most under estimated movies though it might take two viewings to really take it all in,black_comedy
i think this film is a plagiate at least the films whole idea is in finland there is an exactly similar serie of films called uuno turhapuro this guy is called uuno turhapuro and hes kind of a whacko like lebowski they both have unfriendly father in laws well in big lebowski the dude didnt marry maude like uuno who married for money and made his father in law crazy his father in law was a finnish minister and the wheelchair guy is filthy rich important figure also uuno has two crazy and weird friends like the dude also the plot is always something funny and a bit nuts just like in big lebowski if you like big lebowski or are a big fan of it i recommend the turhapuro series for you while this serie of films is not so widely known internationally its creator pertti pasanen was a real genius of entertainment and uuno turhapuro series are a marvelous creation,black_comedy
this is the most hilarious movie ever made  the acting and character interaction are outstanding  this is also the most quotable movie of all time as well  there are at least 200 funny lines in this film  the coens are evil genuises,black_comedy
i have to say this is one of the best movies i have ever seen  the first time i saw it i chuckled a little bit  the second time i guffawed and chortled  the third time really began to let loose with the laughing every subsequent viewing has had me laughing harder and harder  this movie has the most replay ability ive ever seen in my entire lifethe dialog is awesome john goodmans character reminds me very much of one of my friends  jeffery lebowski is one of the greatest characters the screen will ever see  i really dont enjoy jeff bridges most of the time but it this movie hes so amazing  hes like another person  buscemi is spot on as always and the plot is amazingthe problems with this movie lie not in the work itself but in its audience  a lot of people will not like this movie simply because the first view only yields chuckles and chortles here and there and there are dream sequences  the sound track is phenomenal though featuring loads of vintage musici would recommend this movie to anyone who has patience and anyone that likes character filmshowever if youre all about plot and action and dont understand character movies dont see this one,black_comedy
after viewing the dude at least 30 times i must say it has taken a zenlike quality  all the mysteries of life can be explained by the dude   the film is the beginning the middle and the end,black_comedy
spoilersimagine your the dude imagine all you really want is for your carpet to be clean isnt life wonderfulthis film gives us an impression of what life could be life if we really didnt carepersonally im a bloody philosophy student  yet compared with the dude im ridiculously stressed the idea of spending your entire life with absolutely nothing to worry about sounds like heaven perhaps leaving something for your kid a book or something and then just lazing around sounds like heaven the dude has an almost perfect life thoughi mean dont get me wrong to enjoy this film youve gotta be half cut like myself  youve gotta be slightly relaxed however the point is that this film might not be perfect by any stretch of the imagination however its an entertaining piece of work worth watching  which noone would be disappointed in watchingwatch this and enjoy a piece of art in its utmost form,black_comedy
i first saw this film on showtime in 1999 and i got to say that this film was funnier and crazy than hell the dudejeff bridges is a stoner bum that people confused him fordavid huddlestone because of the last name so attackers beat the dude up and pee on his carpet i wont describe the rest of the film but the wife of is kidnapped and it is up to the dude to save her great cast funny script innovated humor this film is the greatest comedy ever made,black_comedy
i divide the comedy genre movies in three groups the first group consists of movies similar to style of movies here are also analyze this white men canft jump as well as all eddie murphyfs and jim carreyfs movies those films are build on some kind of plot and most of all clever and funny dialogues in the second group are kind of movies similar to monty python top secret and all david zuckers movies brain donors hot shots and the like to say movies without cleancut plot just a bunch of unrealistic and meaningless situations accompanied by even more meaningless and irrelevant dialogues and the third group is only occupied by charlie chaplin the true genius of movie making and acting and just everythingbut letfs get back to tbl to me this movie is probably the best one in its group it is such a funny flick if you are lucky enough to see it with friends you gonna say to each other those vivid dialogues and expressions for months to come just check out the tbl memorable quotes on imdb i think it has the biggest number than any other movie on that side every single word was hilarious and jeff bridges man the greatest i remember watching him in arlington road after tbl and ifve got to tell you i couldnft help myself but picturing him with a goatee a potbelly a ponytail and a pair of those huge bermuda shorts drinking white russian and smoking pot it ruined the whole moviearlington road i mean one of the most memorable characters created on screen after chaplins tramp ok overdid it and of course john goodmani suggest you stop reading and run off to the nearest video shop and even buy the movie i envy you for the great time you gonna have watching it on a second thought this one gets even better with every viewing and dont forget to bring your friends along its double the fun,black_comedy
this movie was a confusing mixedup mess that took a while to piece back together in the end as well as leaving a few plot holes behind  like what happened to the guys in the beginning that threw jeff into the toilet demanding his money  and instead of a clever kidnappingransom story we find out in the end that the girl bunny never really was kidnapped  what jeff bridges character also named jeff or the dude oh god goes through the movie trying to save another man named lebowskis slutty pornostar wife tara reidand gets his ass kicked all the way  this movie sucks  watch fargo instead,black_comedy
gotta love every minute of this movie extremely well written and by far the best of all coen films and they have made some good ones love watching this film with friends after a night at the bars always brings a smile to our faces for all of us that take life too seriously watch this and feel comfortabiding in chicago,black_comedy
best movie ever how can you go wrong when your protagonist is named the dude or his dudeness or el dooderino anyway if you havent seen it hopefully youll realize what youre missingand thats just like my opinion man,black_comedy
acting 44screenplay 34predictability 14stomach intensity 24overall 34comments the coen brothers fargo have done it again theyve taken a simple idea and turned it into something completely different youll wonder who came up with this this is a wickedly funny film,black_comedy
quite possibly the funniest movie ever made  the first time i saw this movie i didnt quite get it but i knew there was something there   then it hit me and i absolutely could not stop laughing  john goodman and jeff bridges complement each other fantastically in this movie  this movie also showcases just how dynamic an actor jeff bridges can be,black_comedy
this movie was excellent jeff bridges role was excellent john goodmans was as well i also thought tara reid was hotter than ever in her short role the plot of the movie and what unfolds is incredibly funny i suggest anyone who wants a laugh should see this there are only 2 other comedies in history that come close to touching this one those are fletch and dumb and dumber see this movie,black_comedy
the coen brothers have a visionary brilliance that becomes more than clear as your watching this movie ive heard it referred to as a lovehate movie and it seems to be that the people that hate this movie are the ones looking for a quick hour and a half pie in the face and the people that love this film realize the vision of its directors and the undeniable hilarity that slowly unfolds with each viewing that is the real beauty behind this movie the ability of the coen brothers to create an atmosphere of subtle nuances and situations that only get funnier every viewing and every situation youll learn is incredibly funny it seems like everytime you watch the movie no matter how many many times you watch it you see or hear something new something that didnt seem to be there last time and along with the deep interwining events and cleverly crafted dialogue between each absolutely unique character forces you to almost second guess your own mind and creates an unique atmosphere that most movies could only wish to attain oh and i did mention is funny right funny,black_comedy
a comedy with a difference a case of mistaken identity  is an offbeat story with great dialogue and some very strange characters the juxtaposed personalities of the goodman and bridges characters make for some great comic moments including ten pin bowling getting stoned and a kidnapping  the characters are diverse  a stonehead a rug a man called jesus a vietnam veteran a millionaire and a floosy and not forgetting the germans all in no particular order and there are many others as well ive seen this film a number of times and its still worth watching again it gets better every time  watch out for john turturros unmissable role even though its fairly minor hysterical long live the dude and people like him,black_comedy
i will say thisit is worth the rental to see jesus quintano dance a sultry dance while a spanish version of hotel california plays in the background just too hot to be a pedophile haha just be careful he will beep you in the beep he wont beep you in the beep on saturday no he will wait until wednesday you got a date ha ha ha claims that a day of rest is for busch league but he feels generous so he will wait until wednesday laughable ha ha ha ha ha two thumbs up mr john turturro two thumbs way way up,black_comedy
there are some movies that are written so well that you inadvertantly memorize big sections of the script and realize later that your friends have as well this happens with monty python movies spinal tap pulp fiction and big lebowski im serious this movie belongs into the comic stratosphere,black_comedy
thats the best description i could come up with after seeing a quirky bellyshaking tripping shamus comedypacifist deadbeat and bowler jeff the dude lebowski lovable shaggy dog jeff bridges is a victim of mistaken identity when two dopes rough him up and p on his rug wanting money the real target is a  wealthy paraplegic philanthropist david huddleston of blazing saddles the dude wants reimbursement for the rug but finds rich lebowski is a hypocrite however his trophy wife bunny tara reid of the first two american pie films is kidnapped and asks the dude love that nickname to play courier for the ransom yet theres something rotten in denmarkjoel and ethan coen theyre both writers producers and directors in my view has performed another masterpiece for movie fans who dont want the same runofthemill junk from the dream factory all the time the actors performances are well steered john goodman a stock actor in the coens universe is funny as walter bridges volatile bowling chap and a classa oaf who thinks everything has to do with the vietnam war which he fought in much to the dudes grief julianne moore who looks like my kindergarten teacher which i had a crush on is sexy as maude the rich lebowskis daughter who creates strong feminist artwork any relation to the same named sitcom with bea arthur and helps out the dude in more ways than one  plus other coen figures john turturro a grad of my elementary school st clare in queens ny and steve buscemi former valley stream long island resident and firefighter are fun too what caps the film is the gutterballs sequence the kenny rogers song the saddam hussein lookalike moore as a viking bridges as a tv repair guy and the bowling pin dancers rock and the stranger played by dryvoiced sam elliot who questioned his participation in the film was he supposed to be god or what then again weirdness is the rule of the coen brothers films and it hasnt failed them far from it to quote the strangerenjoy this film ,black_comedy
they dont come any betterfunnier than this perhaps my fav film of all time these guys are masters at making entertaining intelligent funny movies i just wish they could make a big l iieven though i usually loathe sequels,black_comedy
you get so much inspiration out of this movie i saw the comments of this movie and there were the quotes i read them and have to laugh again and again what a great movie is this absolutely a great end of the moive with the best laugh of the night,black_comedy
this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen and i never get bored of watching it again and againthe great acting between the three main characters goodman bridges and buscemiis 100 pure fun to watch even if buscemi does not say that much he gives his part a memorable performanceall the other actors who have small parts are hilarious take turturro for example who plays a latino bowling player named jesus with such perfect acting so i cant help laughingso if youre looking for a very twisted and well played comedy this is the one to see this picture will make you feel really gooddont miss the burial scene,black_comedy
yes it can watch the film at least 3 times i watched it over 25 times ever time i watch it i discover something new last time i watched it i discovered that walter is a owner of a security shop sobchack securites i rang my best friend and asked him if he knew what walter does for a living he flipped i tortured him by not telling him  he watched the film more than 50 times and didnt knew the answer americans dont forget we also have subtitling here some we cant notice everything anyway lebowski stands for great actors great characters great photografhy great directing great music and great directing i voted a 10 because theres really nothing in the film i dont find hilarious greating from the netherlands murat,black_comedy
hands down the funniest movie of the 1990s  there are some many memorable lines and characters  the actors are brilliant especially jeff bridges and john goodman  the coens should of gotten more recognition for this brilliant comedy,black_comedy
a masterpiece i love that movie its weird as all cohen brothers movies are its funny and its pure genious jeff bridges and john goodman are great bushemi and turturro provide excellent fillup for the support characters and all the other characters fit perfectly into the game and what about the general idea thats as usual genious the rise of uselessness the avalanche effect the absurd events and the complete originality of the plot all the classic elements of cohens movies are there perfectly mixed into an extremely funny and crazy movie great,black_comedy
i personally think this is truly one of the great masterpieces of comedic film  awesome  it offers so much nuance comedy that it becomes the type of movie you can watch about thirty times and still find new things to laugh at  if you have not seen this movie please do so asap it will be good for you,black_comedy
if youve just seen fargo then take a break before you watch this film it is very different and as amazing in its own right the first time i saw it i wasnt so impressed and thought the dream sequences out of sync now i cant watch it enough and i would recommend reading the ww norton book and then watching the film again and again to see a completely new side to the whole lebowski thingthe book really ties the experience togetheri cant pin point one specific thing that makes this movie so enjoyable its just the summerkinda california retro look specifically the lighting which has a story in its own right sam elliots character gives use a frame of reference and makes me feel envious of the dude a freeloader who writes bad checks for a quart of half and half and just seems to bounce here and there thru life without a worry in the world just being the dude far out man,black_comedy
i have wanted to see this movie for a long time now but i was a little leary because the two other coen movies i sawthe hudsucker proxy and millers crossing kinda sucked but this film is a huge improvement over them  although the plot is rather messy the film is very funny and charming i loved jeff bridges character the dude  since then i have seen fargo blood simple  and raising arizona the only dissapointment of them was blood simple  some people will find this movie way too strange and stupid but others will love it  ill give it a 75 out of 10,black_comedy
well big lebowski is the only movie i can watch 3 times in a row and enjoy every little scene of it it has everything an excellent comedy should have  good plot excellent actors performances great camera work music brilliant dialogues and most importantly it is funny and entertaining no matter if watched for second or 1002 timebe prepared that it will not make you roll on the floor laughing and it not as filled with gags as say naked gun series probably you wont even like it for the first time or just find it weird trust me  just go watch it again tiny details are crucial in this movie and on the second view you start to notice and appreciate them,black_comedy
i think that the film took quite a while for the jokes to start with the first 30 minutes ish focussing on setting the scenen for the rest of the film having said that however there are some hilarious moments overall a pretty good watch one major thing i did disagree with though is when jeff bridges said i hate the fing eagles  the eagles rule also why did steve buscemi donny have to die,black_comedy
what to say about this film that hasnt already been guessed at the story comes in and out of a period in jeffrey lebowskis the dude life and shows the ease with which he gets himself into ridiculous situationsi gave this film 10 out of 10 one of only 3 films to score this out of about 600 ive rated  take note all you people out there giving daredevil etc 10 pointsthe editing is superb the lighting and use of colours is unlike anything ive ever seen examples include the darkness which falls at the scene of a disasterous event outside the bowling alley in the second half another is the jump cut to an exploding firework used when the dude is punched whilst lying on his new rug the trails of light from the firework then morph seamlessly into an aeriel view of the lights on the streets of la at night amazing stuffvisuals are great but when not backed up with equally good dialogue you can end up with a george lucas movie the dialogue in this film is at times nothing short of astonishing john goodmans character walter is a vietnam veteran with excellent vocabulary historical awareness philosophical ability all shot through with tirades of foul language he is both hilarious and thought provoking much like the film as a wholewith a supporting cast of john turturro julianne moore steve buscemi david huddleston philip seymour hoffman peter stormare and tara reid the movie shimmers with comic timing and great actingits one of the best easily said i know but in this case its true,black_comedy
from what ive been able to perceive this film has been vastly overlooked ive heard that it received bad reviews at the time of its release and although i personally enjoy this movie i wouldnt doubt that many critics missed the point  i say this for several reasons  first of all this film is certainly not for everyone  obscene content aside of which there is plenty the strangeness of this film will certainly turn off many viewers secondly even if you are interested in a movie as oddball as this it may still take a while to appreciate  i myself needed to see it three times before i realized how funny it is  now this may seem like a lot a work for a yield as little as enjoying a movie  this is not the case  if you are a fan of any of the other coen brothers movies or of just comedy movies in general i implore you to rent this  yes it has the coen brothers trademarks great dialogue and a very interesting and complex plot but this movie isnt good because of its technical accomplishments its just great fun to watch,black_comedy
this movie is by far one of the funniest comedies i have ever seen i just love everything about this movie the dialogue cast and just about anything else you can imagine the one thing i like most about this movie is the characters i adore the fact that jeff bridgess character is so relaxed calm and cusses alot i mean where else can you find a character who can say man i hate the fing eagles like him i really like how aggressive john goodmans character is and how he has a recurring obsession with the vietnam war overall this movie is absolutely awesome if you havent seen it i suggest do so youre missing a lot,black_comedy
this is my personal favorite from the coen brothers  this film is absolutely nuts  john goodman character is soo extream that your jaw just drops whenever he shows up  every one of steve buscemis lines steal the scene that he is in  this film has dream sequences people ping on rugs and a guy who has been dubbed the dude  what more do you from a film 1010,black_comedy
this hs to be one of the funniest films ever although the humour is sometimes silly at times notabely john goodman it is highly entertaining his constant abuse of the steve buscemi character leaves me laughing everytimejeff bridges playing of the dude is probably equally as good as goodman cause lets face it we all know somebody as fazed out as the dudethis is a true comedy and surely one that everyone likes,black_comedy
coen brothers make something out of nothing in this crazy black comedy about a down and out loser who gets used and abused for being the nice guy who really doesnt give a hoot about the things that make life that little bit complicated and just wants to go bowling like everybody else in this forsaken world,black_comedy
whenever i am far away from la longing for home i pop this dvd into my player and enjoy one of the funniest most enjoyably bizzare films i have ever seen along with steve martins brilliant la story this stands as one of movies that captures the quirky often times nonsensical aspects of living in los angeles particularly if you live from hollywood west towards venice beach i really dont want to ruin the film by going into the plot instead i will assure that it a captures the la mystique and b is highly entertaining,black_comedy
is frankly a terrific entertaining film  when discussing the coens and their output usually people jump all over fargo or o brother where art thou  i cannot fault them for this as these are great movies but i have always been drawn to those films that follow the bigger hits wedged between the aforementioned coen brothers movies fits quite nicely  the plot doesnt really matter  it assuredly does twist and turn and is incomprehensible at times  as this film is a take on the film detective genre most notably the big sleep which doesnt make sense either this is extremely acceptable  take the bogart character that has all the answers out of the plot and place a burned out broke bowler that loves white russians in his stead throw in john goodman steve buscemi juliane moore philip seymour hoffmann and a funny wellexecuted story and you have  allinall i would say about 3 stars out of four,black_comedy
the coens most memorable film thus far  the scripting andcharacterisation are nothing short of comic genius by placing thedude  a helpless lazy yet lovable layabout  at the centre of a plotthat spirals relentlessly and in typical coen fashion the recipe forlaughter is readymade everything else is just a bonus theensemble cast performs uniform brilliance bridges andgoodman becoming one of the funniest cinematic doubleacts inthe process glorious,black_comedy
in modern film there are only a very few people who can be consistently counted on to bring out intriguing odd movies  perhaps the two most prominent of these people are joel and ethan coen creators of such masterpieces of fargo and blood simple  while most of their previous work has been critically acclaimed it wasnt truly until fargo that the pair became more universally known  is proof that the duo have past a rare test  they have transferred their concept of quirky filmmaking to the mainstream while retaining their biting sense of humor this film is truly hysterical and at times poignant  its a black comedy that is truly a delight to watch  jeff bridges and john goodman have fantastic chemistry and the dialogue shows the biting satirical yet overt comedic prose that the coen brothers have mastered in previous masterpieces,black_comedy
here we have a typically coen brothers story of an easygoing hippy who finds himself in several layers of deep trouble with porn directors scary bowlers performance artists scary german electronic musicians a cranky old millionaire and the mysterious bunny lebowski  rude crude and very very funny especially the bowlingthemed hallucinations this movie is a mustsee,black_comedy
is in a class all by itself it is not only a great comedy with lots of laugh and absurdities it is also a great film as art the coen brothers absolutely must do more films like this i believe it is where they excel you cant help but love every single character they have fleshed out for you even those who get very little screen time like john turturro as jesus quintana stick with you a movie to be seen time and time again a cult movie ,black_comedy
after watching the heavenly film i realized that no matter how hard life is theres always the dude that makes our lives so simple its good knowin hes out there takin er easy for all us sinners the dude is some sort of a divine creature a representative of god on earth characters like donny aka shut the f up donnyand walter made me think that maybe life is not all about money cars and clothes its about those little moments of happiness when you hit a strike or have an in  out burger maybe thats what life is all about,black_comedy
this film is a masterpiece of frivolity invention and homage although bridges is superb as the dude the deadbeat 90s reincarnation of the film noir detectives of yesteryear and the setpieces are truly memorable the show is stolen by goodmans ferocious vietnam vet he manages to play the frustration of paranoia and impotence within the constraints of compassion and above all loyalty hijacking the dudes every move he muscles in on the chance to escape the boredom of his provincial life and glowers through the entire movieof course these are not the only notable performances from the coens familiar cast the film is helped by a host of superb supporting performances buscemis putupon bowling pal turturros latino pederast and the awkward psh particularly spring to mind  and the script is just amazing this film is destined to become a classicit is punctuated with moments of genius from the best golfing gag ever through the north by northwest pencil tracing homage and the most painful hit in the face with scene on film and beautifully shot throughout the bowling ballet opening sequence and jesus hotel california are a joy to behold and the narrator could not have been better chosenthe film does maybe lack the melancholic disciplined humour of fargo but it is just as good a film in other respectsi recommend you buy rent or steal a copy right now and enjoy yourself thoroughly,black_comedy
you just gotta see this movie youll probably need to watch it more than once to catch everything but its definitely worthwhile john goodman is amazing especially when he goes crazy with a baseball bat youll see its a great scene  i dont want to give anything away but nothing is as it seems and even some of the characters in the movie dont keep up with the deceptions this is a thinking mans raunchy comedy rent it buy it see it,black_comedy
is the best comedyfilm i have ever seen the dude is such a looser unbelievable and how happy he is when he may take of his clothes at the doctor the dream sequences in the film are really good too the best thing is when the dude and walter are trying do bring the money for bunny lebowski but why are the germans shown in such a strange way  doesnt matter  great film,black_comedy
well i dont about you but i take comfort in that insider jokesfor those who have not seen it this movie is comfort food for the soul see it asap,black_comedy
is coens best along with fargo only the coen brothers could create a masterpiece like this one the story actors and the dialogue provide for a fun two hours the story itself is not important but its oddball cast of characters that makes the movie so funny and charming jeff bridges gives one of his best performances of his career as the dude his extremely lazy lifestyle makes you laugh john goodman is good as the dudes best friend walter who is a vietnam veteran steve buscemi as the quiet but loveable donny john torturro as the eccentric bowler jesus peter stormare as the former porn star and nihilist and julianne moore as maude philip seymour hoffman and the rest of the cast also do a great job  is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen especially the dreamsequences are cool and funny  my rating1010,black_comedy
many people have commented on this movie so rather than review it in the typical fashion i will simply make some points that i feel are of interest1 the coens are cinematic genuiuses when watching this film realize that everything in it is done for a reason with that in mind you might realize what a masterwork this film is2 long have i lamented the fact that every stoner comedy ever made has looked like it was made by stoners so many movies involving potheads are idiotic and unrealistic finally here is a movie that accurately portrays drug use its effects and does not underestimate the intelligence of the viewer call it the intelligent stoner comedy3 set in the early 90s this movie was made in the mid 90s sparking the obvious question why set a movie only a few years back because for the coens it is a launching pad for cinematic brilliance4 the maude character is great i think she intimidates a lot of us men but it really is nice to throw a deconstructionistfeminist in there5 philosophically speaking this movie really touches some bases example when the police officer calls the dude a loser and the dude replies well thats like just your opinion man is morality simply an opinion does with authority come the right to pass judgement on others to what extent these and other questions are raised although perhaps not solved in this fine work of art1010,black_comedy
the first coen brothers film i saw was fargo that was a great film if a little short then i saw this now when i first watched this i expected a gory dark film like fargo what i got surprised me this film was quite mellow and laid back for the coens at least in terms of sheer gory violence but then the plot went off in all sorts of directions and at times became confusing but one thing remained noticable the sheer quality of the writing and the great acting the dude is a warm lovable fool who just wants to live his life and not have people mess it up for me what made the dude such a great lead character was the quality performance from jeff bridges the way in which he makes the dude appear confused but also clever is totally believeable for me the dude was one of the most likeable heroes since vincent vega in pulp fiction as good as bridges is as the dude one actor outshines him john goodman as walter walter is a mentalist but also a good man and goodman manahes to portray this with ease imo this is his best performance to date of course no film would be complete without quality dialogue and has this in spades for all the profanity there is real meaning and thought gone into the writing and it helps give character to the characters in much the same way that glengarry glen ross writing did,black_comedy
either youre life is going to be changed by it or youre missing the whole point a truly amazing observation on life espacially on how to take it easy life is very simple and beautiful when you think and act like the dude even if they seem to get pretty much complex just sit back and enjoy the ride long live the dude,black_comedy
this is the coen brothers at their very best and it is hard to believe they will ever be able to top this one which i see as at least at a par with their critically acclaimed fargo this is easily the funniest and most quotable movie ive ever seen and it is still wonderfully entertaining after many many viewings the cast is perfect  jeff bridges and john goodman arguably gave the performances of their careers to date in this movie the only reason i could see why people could have problems with this fine work is the language which does not exactly adhere to the commonly accepted concept of good manners if you dont mind that this movie is a definite must see great idea for a fun evening go bowling first and then watch with a couple of caucasians 10 out of 10 and yes it really tied the room together did it not,black_comedy
the coen brothers best comedy manages to be hilarious and flat out weird at the same time  lots of great jokes and gags but some odd sequences that may turn some viewers off  the movie has no real plot just a series of short pieces that happen to have the same characters  everybody performs well and the characters are great  except for john goodmans character who gets a little bit annoying at times  a definite must see for coen brothers fans but some nonfans may not buy into their sense of humor,black_comedy
i have scientifically determined that is the third best film of all time if you disagree with me well yeah like well thats just like your opinion manthis film is amazing i watched it once enjoyed it thought it was very good watched it again it got better it gets better every time i watch it i laugh to myself over funny lines that i recall from time to time and my friends shun me as a lunatic until i show them the movie and they join me giggling in a corner hey mr lebowski its ok im a brother shamus  what  like  an irish monk you see i seem like a madman dont i you have to watch the film to understandthe film is packed with funny lines from beginning to end it has a languid easygoing style which draws you in the music and lighting design and acting all combine to produce a superb mood the gallery of characters is so colourful and off beat that there is literally not one dull moment in this beautiful hilarious film the main idea is a simple one  imagine if a curious case of blackmail kidnap and mistaken identity in the heart of los angeles were tackled not by philip marlowe or sam spade but by a clueless stoner who would rather be kicked out of a taxi on his way home from a night of beatings and druggings than listen to the eagles on the radio on which the fabulous coen brothers add layer and layer of fantastic characters each undercut by their vanity or madness or stupidity or other weakness and each pushing the befuddled dude further into a semiconscious messwatch this film now no stop reading this website go to blockbuster and rent the video when youve watched it five times buy the dvd then raise a glass to the dude  wherever he might be,black_comedy
the brothers coen might be the only filmmakers in the world who could put out a comedy caper about a middleaged unemployed stoner his warobsessed best friend a paraplegic millionaire his feminist sister soiled rugs an eccentric pornographer a gang of 3 german nihilists late of a technorock band and a trophy wife moonlighting as a porn actress and actually make it workbridges goodman and buscemi are as great as would be expected  kudos also to the terrific swedish actor peter stormare in his 2nd goround with joel and ethan coen  his screen time is minimal but memorableas others have mentioned be sure to give tbl at least 2 viewings before passing judgment on it  i saw it for the first time when it first came out i found it to be only average at the time  years later a friend was howling about some of the great dialogue and urged me to give it another chance  im glad that he didthe plot is certainly contrived  but its a character and dialogue driven comedy  tbl may be the most quotable film of the last 10 years if not of all time  the writing cinematography soundtrack acting and direction are all perfectly executedrating  1010  definitely not to be missed or seen only once,black_comedy
is quite simply my favorite comedy of all time it wont be for everyone and i can understand why some may find it a fairly odd film lets be honest it is slightly odd but absolutely hilarious john goodman is fantastic as always and in my own opinion jeff bridges puts in his finest display ever as the laid back lebowski steve buscemi is well steve buscemi but is perfect for his rolei dont feel all coen brother fans will love this as much as i do as i feel in many ways it is quite different from much of their other work if i had to liken it to any of their previous work i would have to say the film the naked man although as a coen brother fan myself it happens to be my personal favoritefans of films such as spinal tap and withnail  i will surely love this film just think students all over the world will be watching this film right now remembering various quotes to use from the film tomorrow this may sound ghastly but hey this film proves students do have taste after alld,black_comedy
its all been said before so to summarizeone of the funniest most quoteable movies of all timesuperb acting and amazing dialoguea perfect 10 in all respects,black_comedy
the dude abides and rightfully so  with their greatest piece of work yet the coen brothers have created a masterpiece with whether consciously or subconsciously the coens have painted the most life like picture of hollywood that has ever been seen by the naked eye  raw honest and most of all hilarious tells the story of three good friends whos lives revolve around bowling  even when one of them the dude jeff bridges gets caught up in a case of mistaken identity they still focus on the bowling league  this isnt all folks ha anyone with half a brain will laugh at this movie although anyone with the other half still in tact will surely see that even from sam elliots opening monologue this entire film spoofs the hollywood process  regardless of whether you recognize this or not personal opinions are laid to rest with this film  it has been said that every individual has an individual personality but along with the dawn of this beautiful new coen brothers film is also the realization that there is not one person on this green old earth that can make it through without laughing  it is packed so tight with jokes that itll make your grandadies constipation look like a piece of cake  if you dont like this film or rate it anywhere below a 7 that is fine for at that point of clicking the vote button with 7 or below you shall finally find that you are indeed retarded  proceed to the doctors immediately for treatment because if you rate this film 7 or below you are in need of medical attention  personal opinions are laid to rest,black_comedy
 its somewhere down there oh man this movie should be much higher in the users rating i mean there are so many funny lines and scenes i couldnt imagine before minor spoiler when goodman drops out of the car after throwing out the ringer and the uzi just goes off but the nihilists are still f amateurs and hes still the clever nam veteran lets go bowling when dude is driving the car and drops his joint burning himself and he is using his beer to cool his lap you can imagine where it goes from here he fixes the cable and so on and so forthjust great watch it 1010 macaulay j connor,black_comedy
every time i watch this i catch something new like last time i noticed supersmall spoiler that during the dudes second acid flashback the carpenter outfit that he wears is the same thing that karl hungus wears as the cable guy in log jammin thats what i love about this movie there are so many subtleties it makes for prime reviewing actionjeff bridges is awesome steve buscemi is awesome john tuturro is awesome john goodman really shouldve been nominated for an oscar what the heck the whole movie is awesome the coen brothers are excellent filmmakers to say the leastyou cant go wrong with the dudebut i guess yeah well thats just ya know like my opinion man,black_comedy
this was the coen brothers first release after their awardwinning fargo and it continued their reputation as probably hollywoods most imaginative pair of idea men critics of the coens say their movies have no sensitivity and that their imaginativeness is only a recycling of old themes i say that i dont agree one hundred percent with their police work there what they do is pay homage to classic memories of films while working them into the strange universe that has been titled coen county continues with what has made them so entertaining bizarre characters encounters and dialogue occur during his dudeness journey in the city of angels dont expect majestic truths to be revealed heartrending melodrama or fireballs just loads of laughs for anyone who appreciates intelligent and abstract humor my only question is who is the stranger supposed to be is he the dudes guardian angel his longlost father or another member of the seattle seven,black_comedy
a simply amazing film with definite cult status i can watch this movie over and over especially when i need to be picked upits one of those movies that makes you feel safe and comfortable just because the dude makes you feel like everything will work out fine the movie is hilarious and there are so many great quotes and characters it is also one of the few films that makes me think la might be a nice place to live the music is excellent the dream sequences are inspired i enjoy most coen brothers films but this one is truly special it has such a good flow to it often when i really like a movie i enjoy the first half hour or so more than the rest this one is entertaining from start to finish jeff bridges whom ive often liked in films has really made one of the greatest characters of all time the dude abides viva el duderino,black_comedy
the coen brothers are at it again this film rocks from head to toe dont watch it on usa though this is what happens when you find a stranger in the alps rent it and get comfortable for the dude shall spill a most excellent tale of mistaken identities and general clowning around,black_comedy
a magical farago of comical mishapsperhaps one of the best pieces of sustained anarchy everthe scene involving the dudethe cricket bat wielding enforcers as they throw the marmot on him as he lies soaking is surely one of the alltime clasics a mustsee if you you like your humour raw,black_comedy
this movie is great  this movie is about dude lebowski and his friends who unwittingly get involved in a kidnapping plotfirst lets talk about the dude  this man is possibly the laziest sucker alive  he dresses shabbily and lives in a rundown apartment but thats okay with him  the only things he cares about is getting high drunk or going bowling  until his apartment is broken into by thugs who rough him up and ps on his rug because they mistake him for someone else with the same last namethis dosent sit well with the dude that rug is possibly the most valuble thing he owns  so he goes looking for in hopes of getting some reimbursment for the rug  he ends up getting involved in a kidnapping plot involving lebowskis wifethis isnt your typical comedy it isnt filled with sight gags or slapstick comedy although there is some of that  the humor in this movie concerns the attitudes of the characters  on opposite sides of the spectrum are the dude who is totally laidback and easy going  to his friend walter who blows up over everything  this movie also has some subtle jokes you might miss if you arent paying attentionjeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi all give great performances in this movie  definitely a modern classic,black_comedy
the first time i saw this great artwork of the coen brothers i was really surprised that it is able to top fargo and raising arizona goodmans youre entering a world of painscene is the best of all in my opinion mark it zero and have you ever heard of vietnam are my alltimefavourite phrases of this movie and of course the destruction of lennys car was really awful i cant get tired of watching this movie again and again and againim giving this movie 23 points out of 10,black_comedy
i thought this movie was off the wall and i loved it  i really got a good laugh and a kick out of this movie  jeff bridges acting was excellentvery cool and calm,black_comedy
id seen no reviews or synopsis of this film when i picked it up in my video library the fact that it was a coen brothers film was enough to make me rent it i was not disappointed its a warm funny film full of great onelinersonly the coens could take a rambling plot and laid back characters and tie it all up neatly together for me their finest,black_comedy
is a must it makes me think that theres still some great american movies with unpolitically correct attitude weird behaviour weird thoughts weird lifes the dude and his pals show how american movies can fit the european sense of humour its all about bowling and ping on a rug only the coen brothers can make movies like that and they must be thanked for this true jewel,black_comedy
is a beautiful and empowering film a film that an entire life philosophy can be based upon filled with human though mentally challenged andor psychotic characters that anyone can understand allows you to feel as though you are not alone in life regardless of how pathetic yours may be  the rollicking scene where one of the films antagonists jesus first appears is emblazened in my soul for now and all time,black_comedy
this movie reminded me of pulp fiction but somehow i like this better i find more amusing than pulp fiction and i think jeff bridges does one hell of a performance in this movie john goodman is of course also good but he always is my opinion i rate this 8 of 10,black_comedy
this movie is all what you ask for you can definitely see that it is a coen movie by the good and funny lines in the movie the plot of the movie is so far out there that it is so funny to watch all in all this is one the best films i have seen i recommend this to any one just one more thing if you seen fargo and you loved it then you also gonna love this one,black_comedy
the coen brothers strike again and provide yet another glimpse into the skewed world inhabited by their imaginations  this perfect and unexpected followup to their popular and critical success fargo is an absurdly loony movie that defies simple categorization is it a comedy a thriller a mystery a neonoir  the truth is that somehow its all of thatand a bag of chips  more or less its about bowling mistaken identity and a soiled rug  jeff bridges is so mellow so cool as the dude and julianne moore everybodys favorite indie darling lets just forget the lost world is perfect as the mindbogglingly bizarre maude  look for appearances by all the usual suspects john goodman steve buscemi john turturro as well as a few new friends  celebrates coolness hallucination and nihilism and it elevates bowling beyond the status of new religion directly to the one true faith,black_comedy
the debate continues among the coen brothers fans as to whether this movie measures up to its predecessor fargo  as good as fargo is this movie is much more fun to watch  i saw this movie in harvard square in the spring of 98 and i cant recall ever laughing so hard in a movie theaterits a great film in so many ways but the writing is what really makes it shine  the interplay between the dude walter and donny is perfectly timed as is their runins with jesus the bowler  all of the actors performances are excellent and the special effects in the dream sequences are firstrate  this movie hit me just right and has held up well in repeated viewings  very highly recommended,black_comedy
this is a fun clever movie from a team that specialises in the intelligent quirky type of film great performances interesting characters witty dialogue and a suitably bizarre plot all add up to make this a very good movie but i preferred fargo if it comes right down to it 810,black_comedy
i think this movie is as funny as raising arizona and to me it is much more relevant to the average person than fargo was i recommend this movie to all those who dont listen to the hype,black_comedy
its hard to know what kind of people will like this film it seems to me that some fans of the coen brothers work are split on a number of their films and this is no exception but is a slice of life in la and despite its surreal surroundings seems to be all too realthe coen brothers have stated that this film is much closer to reality and truth than fargo ever was and if youre not already in on the joke fargo was stated to be a true story at the beginning later to be revealed as a fictitious one for those who stayed for the end creditsis filled with outrageous characters memorable dialogue and a twisting plot lotta ins lotta outs as jeff bridges dude would put it the only disappointment is we dont get to see more of the flamboyant quintana jesus who likes to bowl maybe a bit too much played by john turturro and steve buscemis character donny who doesnt seem to know whats going on most of the time which annoys john goodmans guntoting walter perpetuallyno one can fairly accuse joel  ethan of not trying different things and producing quality work which clearly comes from two men who love film and are dedicated to a vision and then execute it beautifully i sincerely hope they never lose the desire to keep making films of this calibre,black_comedy
is my favorite movie no other has such subtly masterful interaction with such colorful characters it is not a high suspense thriller or a drama but a funtime feel good comedy that doesnt try too hard to get there but isnt that what the movie is aboutits just about sitting back and enjoying the ride i have seen it 20 times and it still has a friendliness about it the action heats up just so often but it doesnt disturbthere is so much slackering that it sort of rubs off and makes you feel at peace just to sit there and take it all in and its real funny too,black_comedy
those who have said that this is not a good movie didnt understand one bit of it or tried to understand too much this is an awesome movie man and it is unique in the way it brings bottomofthebelly laughing or the instinctive natural type of laughter if youd like to a modern genre thats hard to associate with humor one of the best ive ever seen besides jim jarmuschs down by law not that its comparable butin short its a very funny yet intellectual look at life through the eyes of the bozos that we all are go see it,black_comedy
is a pulp fiction wannabe for 1998  the movies plot was way too complicated and realistic to be placed easily into proper film formula  however there are some moments and performances that are downright superb  john goodman as the dudes bowling buddy walter is completely convincing  being a steve buscemi fan i was disappointed with the size of his part  he has more talent then a line here a line there see the wedding singer or pulp fiction for more examples  too much was left way too wide open  had the movie had a little more beef in some areas  and a little less of the weird dude dream sequences ie gutterballs then maybe i would have liked this movie more  12,black_comedy
i like the bridges character a lot simply i think anyone can identify with him love him and understand him i would like to know someone specially encouraged like the dude to face life like it is a jokethe performance of all the cast is one of the best actorsteamwork i have ever seen on the silver screen the sequence when they dude walter  donny meet jesus at the bowling was delightful and hilarious turturro was terrificthe coen bros are one of the most creative filmmakers couples the cinema ever had,black_comedy
some critics didnt like this movie accusing it of being inconsistent of having no plot and of talking about nothing i think they are the sort of people that praised pathetic boring movies like the thin red line or spielbergs latest epic lebowski is the best coen movie ever in a plot that is essentially a bizarre version of the big sleep the coens throw in some amazing characters like the la slacker dude the halfcrazy vietnam veteran the dudes pathetic landlord jesus the nihilists and the result is absolutely brilliant the heroes or should i say idiots of the movie have the unique ability to screw up everything they are trying to do from a simple investigation to the shaking of donnys ashes in the end the surreal dream sequences demonstrate the coen brothers virtuosity i laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie lebowski is one of the funniest and most original movies of the decade ten out of ten,black_comedy
when i first sat down to watch i looked around and thought hey where am i who is that strange man on the floor then i turned on the movie as you can tell i enjoyed the movie but had trouble seeing it considering i was recently macedthe dude bridges so he is called by his friends is an obvious sociopath he has little to no regard for any life especially his own the dude should come hang out with me and my friends so we can share some white russianswalter goodman is the best foil character for the dudethe best part of the film was played by buscemi he played donnie donnie will be sorely missed,black_comedy
a decent offering from the coen camp lots of memorable quotes which gave me plenty of laughs and i think bridges is excellent as the dude this is no life of brian mind you but i dont think ive seen a funnier movie this year my advice is rent it and while youre at the store grab a sixpack as well churchies dont even bother renting this  theres lots of profanity,black_comedy
i thought this was one of the funniest movies i have seen in years  i think that john goodman deserves an oscar as best supporting actor  i cant remember any actor being as funny as he was in this movie  maybe zero mostel was as funny in the producer  although the plot was silly the acting was marvelous  the actor called jesus in the bowling alley was magnificent  i watched that scene over and over and laughed each time  it was a great movie,black_comedy
generally it doesnt bode well for a movie if i fall asleep during it nevertheless thats what happened duringi cant say that there was anything particularly horrible about it except that like fargo the pace was a bit slow for me it was an interesting movie but never elevated to the point of greatnessthe day after my first attempt at watching it i rewound the movie to where i left off and was much more disappointed with the ending than i probably would have been if i were half asleepi think this film is a sarcastic play on the common man as a hero and in that respect it was a little bit refreshing and somewhat similar to kingpin but if you want to see a great movie with the common man as a hero just rent the hero with dustin hoffman five starsten,black_comedy
this movie is my fav movie in the world it may be pointless but its great and in my opinion reflects life if you look closely jeff bridges john goodman steve b and all the rest just do a great job at acting there roles the only bad part was it ended,black_comedy
only from the makers of fargo could a movie such as this be made a jewel of a film full of great performances and one of the wackiest wildest plots ever written a great ride funny and believe it or notextremely intelligent john goodman at his best as the vietnam vet with a screw loose jeff bridges makes post60s hippy life look great too,black_comedy
if you have ever felt guilty for being too lazy wait until you see this movie and meet the dude the laziest man in los angeles a movie filled with a great sense of humor if you are smart,black_comedy
one of the many reasons ive grown to love coen bros films is that they increase my vocabulary  lets face it how many of us know the definition of micturateto paraphrase nathan arizona watching coen bros movies has become my whole goddamned raison detre,black_comedy
i have heard many people say that fargo was much better than and this frustrates me because it really is hard to compare the two they are both very different and have completely different atmospheresis such an enjoyable movie and is full of tremendously funny dialogue an excellent performance from jeff bridges who plays the hilarious dude the stoner whose main love in life is bowling and his main goal is to well do nothing bridges portrays the dude perfectly his bowling buddy walter john goodman is in a word classic as the somewhat mentally unstable vietnam war veteran steve buscemi has only a minor role as opposed to his larger role in fargo as dudes other bowling buddy donny and julianne moore has an interesting  role ass daughter maudejohn turturro is the show stealer of this film as jesus the bowler there is hilarious conflict between his bowling team and the dudes teamall in all the coen brothers have succeeded again this film is truly excellent and should be viewed by anyone who has a video store in the vicinity,black_comedy
is one of the funniest films i have seen in a long time how the coens manage to put every sort of character plot twists unordered sequences and musical interludes into a film and still make it work is magical to mejeff bridges plays the dude perfectly in this film opposite john goodman as his buddy walter the duo are absolutely hilarious together and seem to play flawlessly off of each other throughout the film steve buscemi plays a short but funny role as the spaced out friend of the dude and john turturro may have well stole the show playing the overindulgent exposerbowler jesusthis film contains some of the most hilarious and wacky scenes that i have seen in a long time these include the scene in which thugs bust into the dudes lair and dunk his head in his toilet and then proceed to urinate all over his rug the scene in which the dude writes a check for 69 cents the scene in which the germans bust into the dudes lair and put a marmot into the tub with him while he is having a bath and the fight scene between the germans and the dude walter and buscemis characterthis film worked for me in every aspect except for the lack of a plot to guide the film and the overlong ending regardless of these points is about as much entertainment as one should be able to watch in two hours710 stars,black_comedy
i saw this movie on terrestrial tv about a year ago after hearing so much about it after watching it not a day goes by without me laughing about a particular scene in it it is one of the coens finest movies and definitely their most underrated three actors make this movie a classic jeff bridges john goodman and john turturro bridges is a terrific actor who is extremely underrated much like the film and there is no actor who is more perfectly cast for the role of the dude than bridges who brings immeasurable panache to the role of basically a drifting stoner goodman a coen regular is given his meatiest film role yet and he grabs it with both hands admittedly he is given some terrific lines but goodman fills walter sobchak with humanity as well as humour turturro is given the slimmest of cameos but his queer latino bowler jesus quintana is without doubt the best cameo ever in a movie no question also how can you not love a movie that casts both sam elliott and philip seymour hoffman,black_comedy
wouldnt it be great to see a sequel to we could revisit walter and jeffreys la however there would be no donny i didnt like seeing donny go the coens could make a lebowski that sets in today instead of the 90ies hope the dude still obides,black_comedy
is easily a modern classic it is so under appreciated its sick this movie rules every scene is funny and needs to seen again and again this movie has everythingamazing characters achieved by actors at the top of their gamegreat directing including mind spinning dream sequencesincredible music that meshes perfectly with the actionsexdrugsdrinkingviolencebowlingif you like funny movies i highly recommend this one if you like detective movies you will appreciate this film if you like chandler novels you will love this filmdo yourself a favor and go out and buy this modern classic you wont believe how much you enjoy it,black_comedy
the first time i saw i left the theater kind of scratching my head what was it i had just watched sure it had its moments of true laughoutloud comedy but was this movie just a comedy four years later i can answer that question its a comedy each successive time i watched the film i laughed harder i laughed longer these days i like it better than cats i want to see it again and again seriously after about two dozen viewings this movie in my opinion the coen brothers best is a true masterpiece it defines a time in american history it defines a man a man called the dude and he was a lazy man and from opening credits to closing these days i virtually laugh nonstop he is the man the man for his time and placeor however it goes,black_comedy
let me just start out with saying that i love the coen brothers  love them there is only one movie that i didnt really like the man who wasnt there but the directing and cinematography was amazing is definitely in my top 5 movies i was on the floor laughing when i saw this movie  aaaaand this movie is the best recapscenestolaughwithyourfriends movie  you know what i mean  you go and see a movie thats not that great then at work or with friends later you discuss scenes and you cant help but laugh out loud  and you wonder why it wasnt that funny to begin with  well this movie was that funnyi mean just the fact that the main character is called the dudecome on that is hysterical  and dont you just want to kill john goodman  and all that wacky stuff that happens to poor dude  aaaaand to boot i recently saw a power puff girl episode on accident i swear where the professor says hey man this is a private residencei dyed when i heard that  dont you love it when lame cartoons add adult humor so that we can have fun too,black_comedy
one way to classify yourself as a filmgoer is by identifying your favourite coen brothers movie  i believe that in the future this will be a universal standard and all reviews will being with the reviewers preference is brackets under the title  for example you might get fargo but closely followed by the man who wasnt there or millers crossing  this would enable everybody to make snap judgements on whether to read the review or noti would imagine followers would be very much like the dude the go through life avoiding conflict and find it real hard to remember what the movie was all about afterwards  consequently their reviews will never be scathing but slightly lacking in detailthis films is a reaaaallllly relaxed coen brothers effort following the dude around the bowling alleys of los angeles in the early 90s  much to the dudes dismay he gets mixed up in an affair involving nihilists exporn stars and conceptual artists that results in a soiled rug and a run in with a marmot  jeff bridges is excellent in the role of the dude and right now i cant help feeling this is going to be the part hes going to be associated with for the rest of this acting life  the rest of the cast are just as superb notably john goodman and julianne moorei think the keep to this films success is the way the audience associates with the dude  he trundles through the film trying to work out what is going on while keep a certain distance from events which is pretty much what i was trying to do while sitting in the cinema  this trick makes this possibly the most accessible coen brothers film to date and its thoroughly recommended to everyonego seethe hudsucker proxy just over fargo,black_comedy
ive seen this movie about 9000 times but one line remains a mystery to me in the scene where walter tells the dude that the jesus is a pederast the following conversation takes placewalter so how much did they give you dude 20 grand man and of course i still get to keep the rug walter just for making the handoff dude yeah they gave the dude a beeperso whenever these guys call walter what if its during a game dude oh i told them that if it was during leagueplay donny whats during leagueplay walter life does not stop and start at your convenience you miserable piece of smy question is about this last line who is walter talking to it seems unlikely that hes talking to the dude because i dont think he would call the dude a miserable piece of s well he could but only when emotions are rising this seems not to be the case in this scene on the other hand if hes talking to donny who s always interfering at his convenience his timing is way off his reaction would be way too fastany ideas,black_comedy
an extremely funny and original movie directed by the coen brothers  the usual suspects appear  jeff bridges john goodman john turturro  each play weird and wonderful characters caught in mundane lives of their own choosing  until jeffthe dude lebowski bridges meets his nemesiswickedly amusing lines characters and scenes abound  check out julianne moore as a whipcracking eccentric feminist artist  john turturro steals the movie as a violent paedophile with a love for ten pin bowling  john goodman puts in a believable effort as a volatile foulmouthed vietnam vet phillip seymour hoffman offers yet another offbeat performance as a supercilious aidelovers of german porn and techno music beware,black_comedy
a coen brothers masterpiece if you havent seen this film prepare to laugh your troubles away due to the superb performances of steve buscemi jeff bridges and the supreme john goodman whom i feel gives his best comedy performance ever deadpan sarcastic and a must for anyone who enjoys bowling or rugs,black_comedy
i was fortunate enough to be introduced to this movie by a great girl  she couldnt believe that i had not seen this movie and after i started to watch it i knew why  where had i been  i have no idea but i can say this was a clever and highly entertaining story  i loved jeff bridges portrayal of jeff lebowski i mean the dude  this movie had me laughing and seriously glued to the set  i would highly recommend this movie to someone who wants a good laugh or a classic movie to add to their movie collection  i almost went out immediately and bought this movie on dvd  i truly am glad i had a chance to be introduced to this movie  i hope anyone reading this who has or has not seen it would be interested in watching it,black_comedy
it started ok  jeff bridges is usually quite easy to like in a movie  but i soon get bored the main reason is because like other coen brothers films the characters are fairly empty and void of humanity and you just end up not caring about them and subsequently not caring about what happens to them i rented this on video  the case said in a perfect world all movies would be made by the coen brothers i think this is a little overrated in a perfect world no movies would be made by the coen brothers ,black_comedy
probably one of the best comedies ever  jeff bridges is so underrated the dude in my book is one of the best heros in movie history  if you like fargo more than this movie youre braindead this film rocks,black_comedy
this is probably the funniest film i have ever seen i can watch it again and again and never get bored john goodman in the role of his life with big lebowski the coenbrothers show that they are probably the best filmmakers in the world along with woody allen,black_comedy
i remember watching this movie for the first time and found it to be pretty good the second time i watched it i was in fits of laughter by the third time i was hysterical this movie has so many injokes and funny scenes you simply will not catch them all in one sittingthe story itself as a crime movie is absolutely brilliant never have i seen so many characters involved in one plot so well and all because of a rug well partially jeff bridges john goodman and steve buscemi give a magnificent performance and their friendship on screen as a group of guys doing nothing but bowl and drink beer is one to admire the dude is probably one of the coolest characters ever created but to be fair everyones character has been remarkably developedthis movie is hilarious and if you are looking for something chilled and funny then this is it duderating  5 out of 5,black_comedy
that classic one of many line pretty much sums up the dudei cannot rave about this film enough  literally every scene is funny if not downright hilarious  what i want to know is how the coen brothers come up with this stuff  their comedic writing is pure geniusthe casting is outstanding the acting great and the direction is right on plus it has a awesome soundtrackif you havent seen this movie run dont walk and buy it  you will not be sorry  i dont know why youre still reading this i said go and buy it10 out of 10,black_comedy
this movie is more real then any of us want to believe  why do people think there is no plot  this movie has an excellent plot  just because you dont know the answers to all the questions like a traditional williscagearnoldtravoltastallone action movie doesnt mean that there is no plot  most movies attempt to tie up all the loose ends and give a nice easy to understand package  in the first five minutes you already know that mendozarodriguezcastillo etc is the bad drug dealer and you basically sit and watch while the hero with a tough name goes and gets him good work steel  youll make sergeant for this  thanks chief  thats not how this works and thats now how reality works  and yes theres a lot of weird characters in it but theres a lot of weird characters everywhere spend a few minutes listening to people instead of avoiding them and youll be shocked at the amount of characters you run into  a crazed vet  i know several a aging hippie who just wants to be left alone  i know him too now we all know that pornographers porn stars and rich old men with bad intentions exist so this isnt a stretch  the oddest things would be the german nihilists but is this that much of a stretch  there already exists a similar popular german stereotype from mike myers sprockets bit on snlits the other movies that are fantasy  an akward kid who makes the team because hes got heart and wins the admiration and respect of his peers a dorky girl who gets a makeover and becomes popular  a rogue cop who shoots 50 people and solves the case himself even though hes off the case  a romantic comedy in which the male character does things that would get him arrested for stalking in real life  horror movies in which the victims deserve to be killed due to their own stupidity  woody allen sleeping with attractive womenso in summary mind if i do a j,black_comedy
the funniest movie i have ever seen is based around the life of the dude  a parasite on society who has only one life concern bowling  played by jeff bridges he embarks on a strange journey after wuthe chinaman pd on his rug that tied the room together  with the attempted help of his friend bowling partner and vietnam vet walterplayed by john goodman they try to solve the mystery of where the fk is the money  a must see for anybody who enjoys sarcasm and real humor not some gimmick,black_comedy
is simply one of the best comedies ever made it is impossible not to be smarting at this filmthe cohen brothers have a top notch cast in jeff bridges john goodman and julianne more sam elliot and steve buscemithe script is flawless although i have heard grumbles about a lack of plot  honestly doesnt this film make up its shortcomings through the extreme talent of its castand not only that with multiple viewings it gets even funnier if you cant love something like this then your appreciation of life needs questioning 1010 buy rent this film it is worth its weight in gold,black_comedy
the first time i saw this film i was young so i didnt really have any interest in it but when i saw it a couple years later i went straight to the mall and bought it i cant stop watching this movie i laugh at every seen even though ive seen it  million times the coen bros made another great movie to bad they dont give best picture for comedys anymore i think everyone should take a look at this film more than once and have a good laugh till next time the dude abides,black_comedy
whilst i cant say its the best film ive ever seen  theres a lot of competition for that title and its hard to pick just one  i can say that its the best comedy ive ever seen until 2005 when it was eclipsed by 1968s the odd couple  the characters are just so eccentric yet superbly complex and detailed as in all of the coens previous movies the writing is treated with the same level of sophistication that the brothers bring to all their work its not dumbed down just by virtue of it being a comedy almost every line in the script is ripe for quotationon a comedy level it works perfectly but the storyline itself is just as intricate as weve come to expect from joel and ethan dont worry if you dont fully understand the plot machinations it doesnt really matter when you are laughing so hardbridges is perfect as the perpetually stoned dude he infuses the character with such a likable charm that youre likely to be smiling even when he hasnt said anything there are an array of other colourful characters but the dude  ahem  really ties the film together he is a filmic icon and should be regarded as such for all time theres also a great cameo by sam elliot man i loved that guy in masktrue the film cant quite sustain its momentum throughout its running time so there are slow spots i didnt enjoy the scenes with julianne moores character nearly as much as the others but when it gets it right its hilarious and there are so many scenes that i wish i had wrote but then i dont have 11000th of the talent of the real scriptersthe coens have created a filmic universe that you or at least this writer want to inhabit yourselves the characters seem so lifelike and leap off the screen im just waiting for the brothers to pen a sequel i need to catch up on the further adventures of the dude and his buddy walter even the sadly departed donny that calls for a prequel how about it guys could you see your way clear nice marmotps oh yeah and the dream sequences are weird and wonderful too watch for them i have the song just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in buzzing around my head as i type chilledgotta go a white russian is calling ,black_comedy
as far as im concerned this is easily the very best movie the incredible coen brothers have made to date comedy is one of the most difficult demanding genres around and in order for it to work it must be made with a professionalism that exceeds all imagination  now thats one of the many great things about everything in this movie is sheer genius every detail is right and the timing is perfect but it feels so laidback you hardly notice the brilliance and skillwhat else can i say  the dude is just about the coolest main character you can possibly imagine and hes surrounded by a hilarious troupe of supporting characters that make this film a truly worthwile event walter sobchak donnie the three nihilists the jesus maude jackie treehorn brandt knox harrington  theyre all hysterically funny  same goes for the nonsensical situations the dude gets into the first appereance of the jesus the farret scene the toilet scene wheres the money lebowski  the confrontation on the parking lot the money handover the beach scene and so many more wonderful moments  ill kick myself for not mentioning them later they can make anyone with a sense of humour howl with laughter again and again and againthe cast is tremendous jeff bridges is in my opinion one of the best american actors around and as the dude he finally got the chance to show what a remarkable comedian he really is john goodman steve buscemi john turturro julianne moore philip seymour hoffman each and every one of them gives a new meaning to the word deliciousin short this movie is such a feast of wonderful dialogues hilarious characters and unbelievably funny scenes its already a true classic the dude abides man the dude abides,black_comedy
rating 12 out of many people will go into expecting an actioncomedy along the lines of say rush hour these are the people who dont know who the coens are is actually a very original comedythiller that is bursting with energy no character is a recycled version of another one even the dude couldve ended up as a jaytype slacker but he becomes something else walter sobchakwell he kicks fing a theres also a surprising sweetness in the story which i didnt really expect on the other hand there isnt enough of the funniest character jesus quintana youd think that there would be some kind of relation with the plot but unfortuatly there isnt also the dudes dream sequences no matter how good they are seem just like fillerso all in all is an incredibly entertaining movie go see it,black_comedy
is an unusual film that presents a wide array ofeclectic themes and ideas throughout one film  the originality ofthe plot is captivating enough to hook the average viewer even ifthey dont particularly like the movie  the viewer is compelled tocontinue watching the duration of the film in order to achievesome resolution for the many stories that are introducedthroughout the film  the acting of john goodman and jeffbridges is surprising but very well accomplished  the biglebowski is an unforgettable movie allowing for much ruminationafter viewing   i recommend to a viewer that hasbecome bored with the copious mainstream movies that areconstantly thrown into the video stores every weekend  after allwho can pass up a movie that revolves around a central characternamed the dude,black_comedy
another fine performance from one of the greatest and most underrated actors working today jeff bridges he gives us the dude a lovable waste of space who gets caught up in a chain of events he has only a tenuous understanding of along with his crazed vet friend walter john goodman comedy geniusand hapless donnie the fabulous steve buscemihe attempts a number of schemes and plans which start with him trying to rescue his soiled rug well it really pulled the room together getting in his way are nihilists crazy artists julianne moore pederast bowling opponents john turturro and marmots oh and the soundtrack features kenny rodgers and ignore the rumours different to fargo not worse what are you waiting for,black_comedy
people view as a screwball type comedy that is as heavy on the laughs as it is on the vulgarity  but there is so much more there i view this movie as the quinticential coen brothers movie because everything they have done in the past is in the movie  there of course is a large helping of thier special brand of humor that seems to appeal to everybody  there is a bit of drama from movies such as millers crossing and then there are the thrills that the produced in fargowhat most people dont see is that it is a modern twist to the classic film nor movies  watch the classics the maltesse falcon chinatown even the coens own blood simple and you will see how much has in common with these movies  i think that if you took sam spade out of the 40s and put him in the 90s you would have jeff lebowski  other common elements the movies all contain is the wide variety of characters the problem is never solved to the viewers satisfaction and you cant help but feel for the detective no matter how slimey and shady he is so i urge you to take another look at this movie and dont just look for laughs but also look for the sheer brilliance of the coen brothers because who but they could hide a classic in a comedy,black_comedy
i dont recall to have seen a bad coen movie so farbut this one particulary became my favourite of them allincredibly funny with strong performances and original characters which are toped by john turturros appearence as jesus quintanaat bowlingthe confusion caused by his nameconfused to a similary named millionairebrings a lot of worries on the dudes headboth jeff bridges and john goodman are at one of their careers bestthe apelatives thenthe dudehis dudenessel duderinoare amplifying bridgeslate hip characters originalityacording to goodnmanas walt sobcheckeverything has a literal conection to vietnamhe is a vetalsohe is the alwaysreadytohelp buddy of the dude but mostly screws it all unexpected ending where all facts come to light is also very cleverly donestrongly recomended to all coen and good movie fans in general,black_comedy
this film i watched became quickly my all time favorite movie my father and i can watch it whenever i want a movie with characters that are so powerful a story that is dumb and smart at the exact same time and lines that can be quoted all the time with friends though its not the best family movie most families dont like the f word that much but it is something to be charished with its beautiful acting directing and writing this movie is hilarious,black_comedy
there were parts of this movie that made me laugh so hard i had to stop watching it to catch my breath  the actors are so perfect so precise in their portrayal of their characters i really feel like i am in so cal in 1991,black_comedy
how good is this film i may be out of my element here but i have to say it must be one of the finest movies ever made it is so funny so clever and so absolutely stupefyingly brilliant given the habits of john goodman and steve buscemi best actor in hollywoodno question to steal every movie they are in i didnt think it would work but i was proved wrong this movie rules,black_comedy
i never heard much of this movie until a few days ago i mined the web for some information on it and it seems like most reviews put it into the 2 to 3 star category after seeing it i couldnt disagree more not only is this movie hilarious but it makes a quiet statement about living up to ones own expectations and about life in general not everyone will get it as they say but thats ok this one has enough laughs to please anyone,black_comedy
rarely do i watch a movie more than 3 or 4 times i have watched at least 27 times in the past three years its just that good mind bending twists that are shadowed in an i dont care attitude make for some truly hilarious scenes the energy between jeff bridges and john goodman is natural polar and just plain fun to watch john turtorro and steve buscemi also add flair to the picture in their supporting roles the humor in this film is subtle at times im still catching gags that i have not seen before this is the mark of true genius on the part of the coen brothers if you are considering renting this movie dont buy it you will want to watch it over and over  if i did not love it so much i would not have required all of my employees to watch it this way when we were in a meeting and one of them would say eight year olds dude we all knew what he was talking about get the movie,black_comedy
the big l is one of the greatest films ever it captures an ethosway of life with amazing accuracy  attention to detail its comedy is both subtle  clever words fail me but it has to be said that those of you who think fargo is the greater of the two have lost the plot i could easily watch this film over and over  still find new hidden gems hidden within you cant say that about many i think people have a problem with it cause it has no real beginning or end its  a section in the life of the dude one can really say it just is a masterpiece the thesaurus doesnt contain enough words ,black_comedy
there are so many things that i like about this movie  first of all i dont think there is another movie that has so many great quotes in it not to mention that every character in the movie has their share of great quotes  if you are looking for a movie to quote look no furthersecond the dude has the coolest style  a guy obviously stuck in the sixties he carelessly and effortlessly slides through life without a job and has the best time at it  a kindhearted innocent guy he loves to bowl get high and listen to bob dylanthird the plot of this movie is excellent  dont be misled there is very little apparent plot  however there is very much going on that is unsaid which makes the movie very complex and intricate  to understand the motivations of the individual characters takes some concentration  it took me many times of watching it to fully understand what each character had going on in hisher headfourth the dialog is highly developed  the conversations in this movie are so unlike most movies  the characters continuously interrupt each other change subjects lose their train of thought etc  such a refreshing departure from the cookie cutter hollywood film  but yes there is an unusually high amount of obscenities  however this movie does not attempt to sugarcoat the vocabulary of real people they keep it truetolifeas with most of the other coen brothers movies the underlying theme is this  something bad or illegal happens and instead of the onlookers trying to help the victims they decide to try to make a personal gain from the situationa masterpiece  10 out of 10  now go out and watch it,black_comedy
to say is merely a comedy is to disregard what has to be one of the best scripted films to appear during the last 20 years  only the coen brothers possessed the bravery foresight and genius to bring this celebration of the slackers and lowlifes to the screenthe strength of does not lie in its cinematography or its occasional special effects which are excellent but rather in its refusal to conduct itself like any other main stream film  repeatedly the film falls back upon the interaction between the characters  who can forget the various bowling alley dicussions between the dude walter and donny  the way that through one conversation we are able to see deep into the farout psyche of each character as they strive to plod along in their mudane and underfunder existencethe coens attention to detail is another prominent feature of the film its the little things that count  such as the bullishly jewish walters firm which is known as sobchak security or ss for short  or maybe the donnys inability to get a word in edgeways  i have seen the film many many times now and each time i have seen something new which can only serve as a testament to the coens abilities as film makersthe plot of is made so ridiculous that it could only be made real by having a group of completely ridiculous characters  the coens refuse to leave even the most incidental character without some kind of strange background or character quirk  just see brandt or the aggressive police sergent for examplesserves as a celebration of the lazy and unambitious  in the dude we find solace  he makes you think why do i have to bother dealing with things  why stress over things that do not matteras i believe a reviewer in empire put it  in an ideal world all films would be made by the coen brothers,black_comedy
the coen brothers hit gold again with this film the best film ever about just being a dude jeff bridges is superb in his peter smithlike portrait of an everyday californian joe who suddenly finds himself embroiled in a world of kidnap extortion and violence after a group of germans break into his house mistake him for a millionaire and soil his carpet heck hes just the dude bridges recently admitted that whenever he catches this film on tv he finds it hard to switch over its easy to see why like all the coens best films this is a  multilayered work with memorable characters effective cameos the usual strangeness quotable lines some of the best and some very very funny scenes original and definitely one to catch again and again,black_comedy
perhaps the funniest movie of all time  the coens had always been masters of realistic sounding dialogue in fargo for example but this movie puts it over the top  having lived in california for many years it always reminds me of how people talked there swearing using dude man and fk in every sentence and not really finishing a sentence  overall a great movie,black_comedy
definitely one of my favorite movies and easily one of my favorite comedies the coen brothers delivers great laughs often with great subtlety  as such the jokes may not go over well with everybody  but rarely have i seen such a welldone comedy with such wellplaced memorable quotesto name a few this aggression will not stand man  but theyre amateurs  leads  yeah ill just check with the guys in the crime lab downtown  theyve got four more detectives working on the case  leads thats not her toe dude  papers    business papers  yeah well thats your opinion man  ah that must be exhausting  some brown rust coloration  donny youre out of your element  phones ringing dude well there isnt a literal connection dude  he fixes the cable no walter it didnt look like larry was about to crack  and on and on and on     all recognizable and wellloved by those whove seen this many timesmost likely derives its title from the 1940s filmnoir the big sleep considering that each have a meandering plot though is of the comedic laidback variety laidback just like the dude where you really neednt complain about the plot or lack thereof just sit back and relax with a white russian and just have fun with this one as it takes you through the world of the dude9 out of 10,black_comedy
its the little things about a coenconstructed universe read film that make me laugh and lebowski is no exceptioncase in pointthe dude is lazy has no job and lives er slacks in venice beach where he painfully scrawls out a check for 69 for white russian fixinsspecifically halfandhalfat the local supermarket  not exactly the most intelligent mind on the planet  yet he knows the exact street in north hollywood where to find the innout burger for those who are lachallenged north hollywood is about 20 miles inland and worlds away from the beach  makes you wonder if somewhere in that hazy melon of his he knows every location in la county  of course he knows this  it would be out of character if he didntand anotherat jackie treehorns malibu beach pad treehorn grills the halfbaked dude as to where bunnie lebowski might be  suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a phone call and jackie scrawls info on a pad while on the phone  we get the requisite zoomin closeup as the dude watches from across the room  jackie excuses himself and exits  the dude as philip marlowe rushes to the pad and lightly traces onto it  instead of an address or any useful info about the aforementioned phone conversation he instead traces a picture of an man shall we say standing at attention  of course he does  treehorn is the selfdescribed publisher who created logjamminwhat else did you expect to find on the padnow ill concede that events like this can not possibly sustain a film and i think lebowski was lambasted because it is a film not about story but about a collection of characters  funny characters in fact even the idea of taking a burnout and dropping him in the middle of a convoluted marlowe noirlike caper is enough to make me start laughingyes the language is crude  yes it sometimes feels like a collection of scenes strung together  i will say however this film is incredibly funny and hits the mark again and again,black_comedy
nothing else than pure genius i hope you wont stop judging a movie from how many times they use the word fk would be really sad if you did so cause you would miss one of the best movies of all timesthe dude who for some might be a total loser stands up to the condition of hero a great amazing slacking hilarious hero a mention of his own for john turturro who despite having a really small part in the movie comes out with an outstanding interpretation of jesus which would be worth the price of the dvd on its ownwhat can i say i love the coen brothers and this is without any doubt their best movie so farif you still havent seen it give it a shot you wont regret it,black_comedy
okay so the language is extremely rough probably the highest number of f words to ever be uttered in a movie but in a decade chockfull of trashy pathetic attempts at comedy is a refuge that is the most original comedy in years jeffery the dude lebowski with his laid back attitude gets mixed up in a screwy plot of misunderstanding and just plain idiocy his buddy walter the scenestealer the vietnam vet walters personality and foulmouthed rants create a crude but hilarious comedic effect the dialogue is witty throughout the movie full of sarcasm and political satire and must be listened to carefully to be sure none of the punchlines are missed as this movie could be a radio program and barely lose any of the humour i warn you that this movie bores anyone bearing a sense of humour that is unwilling to endure such an absurd comedy,black_comedy
i didnt care much for i found that there was so much going on at the same time that the coen brothers werent sure what to do the material theyve created it wasnt an awful film  it was enjoyable   but that was because of the colorful characters and the excellent performancesisnt even comparable to the coen brothers last film the excellent fargo this ones more like their past film raising arizona this one definitely wont sweep the oscars though the performances of julianne moore and john goodman could easily be considered for supporting nods,black_comedy
all right lets see what weve got here firstly theres the dude bridges the dude likes bowling the dude likes a white russian every now and then and thats about it the dudes two best friends are walter goodman a deranged gun totting vietnam veteran who will show you what happens when you fk a stranger in the ass and the timid former surfer donny buscemi add to that a lying billionaire a kidnapped trophy wife some mad nihilists peter stormare  flea and youve got the ingredients for a perfect coen brothers comedy a film thats worth watching at least ten times in my opinion,black_comedy
is a fantastic film  theres not a bad bit in it or a bad bit to be said about it what an hilarious piece of cinematic brilliance all the characters are tremendous  the dude  jeff bridges fantastic walter soapcheck  john goodman menacing donnie  steve buscemi hilarious then theres john turturros jesus jackie treehorn and the nihlists the list is endless the best cast in a film ever words cannot describe if you havent seen it go and buy it now in an ideal world all films should be made by the brothers coen not many directors have only ever made good films and no bad onesthe coens have made brilliant films and never any bad onesthis is no2 in my top 10 films of all time 2nd only to a clockwork orangeshut the  up donnie,black_comedy
this movie crosses so many boundaries and limitations that 999 of all other comedies limit themselves to everything from a carpet ping thug to a pervert named jesus that can bowl like no ones business is in this movie every scene makes my sides split the plot rates up there with akira and the matrix simply genius so many twists and turns with an ending you have to see more than once to believe great music all throughout as well simply this movie has everything you could ask from a movie including many 1st rate a list actors that do a wonderful job however do not see this movie if you are faint of heart or ears lots of cursing as well as a few violent scenes and a couple nudity scenes as well as a hefty dose of inuendo and sexual jokes but if you are like most people this will not even phase you and you will love every last line in the movie i cant think of anything i would change in the movie  props to everyone involved in making this movie it is 1st rate,black_comedy
warning minor spoilers virtually ignored by the mainstream and a relative commercial failure is the coen brothers most hilariously clever comedy to date the film combines the best of slapstick hilarious dialogue extremely welldrawn and complex characters an excellent plot and social commentary of the highest calibur to create perhaps the best comedy of all time jeff bridges is absolutely brilliantly lazy in his quasipassive burntout character while john goodman provides perhaps one of the most impressive performances as a shafted disgruntled reactionary nam veteran john turturro provides the most immediately upfront hilarious character as a bowling paedharass jesus quintana thats right nobody fs with the jesus ive watched this movie four or five times to date and have yet to grow wary of the virtual infinity of perfectly repeatable lines and if you are offended by incessant swearing well all i can say is you are entering a world of pain,black_comedy
greatly underrated coen brothers comedy a simple plot of a slacker involved in a case of mistaken identity  what follows a nudeswinging abstract artist jewish vietnam war vet gone nuts german nihilists and beautifully surreal dream sequencesjeff bridges is perfectly cast as the dude along with the coen brothers regulars john goodman and steve buscemi john turturro steals the show with a fantastically funny performance as a paedophilic bowlerbeautifully made film with instantly quotable phrases celebrating the simple things in life,black_comedy
i have seen this fine film numerous times and still find it to be a hilarious piece of cinema however many of my friends and associates continue to insist that is a waste of time most of these people have not even bothered to watch the movie a second time it is not until seeing it again that the movie does not make sense i urge anyone who has seen this movie once to rent it and watch it again it will be worth it and if you havent seen it rent it and watch it twice if anyone has met resistance when preaching the creamy goodness of please contact me,black_comedy
insane film noirish comedy thriller from the ever reliable coen brothersamiable hippy slacker jeff the dude lebowski gets accosted at his home after being mistaken for another lebowski an elderly local millionaire bigwig whos young wife owes money all over town the dudes rug gets soiled by one of the thugs during the attack so he sets off to try and get compensation from the other lebowskiwhat follows is the dude getting mixed up in a labyrinth of plotand counter plots involving kidnapping dope porn moguls german nihilists and a savage marmotif you like your coen brothers movies along the lines of fargo and oh brother where art thou and i do your gonna love this bridges goodman and buscemi all give great performances while the story is clever original off the wall funny and choc full of eccentric characters you even get julianne moore thrown in for good measure and coen brothers regular john turturro popping up as a crazy latin american bowlersee it you wont be disappointed8 out of 10,black_comedy
im bored and going to spoil many things so if youve never seen this movie skip past this review nowto me is a scathing social commentary on a few types of burnouts prevalent in the 90s  now while the typical definition of a burnout is drug related i would argue that the core trio of this movie dude walter and donnie are all burned out on life in their own unique ways  the dude is rather obvious seeing as he chooses to smoke roaches and drink white russians throughout the whole movie furthermore i presume him to be a weed dealer due to his neverending supply of pot kahlua and money  walter feels that society has been indebted to him for his service in nam so his irrational righteousness carries him through the story with an award winning swagger  donnie is the awkward outsider trying to enter the dialogues too late thanks to his innate timidity  while these guys seem like an unlikely trio leave it to the coen brothers to combine them in a rather dysfunctional faction to show the utter pointless absurdity of their livesfrom there the movie centers around the inherent human trait to recycle things that it comes across  the conversations are circular the characters all develop vernacular influenced by others and the most boring conversations turn into a slapstick gag by the rather simple method of immediate repetition  the coen brothers are masters of characterization i wanted to slug that pregnant cop in fargo for her accent alone so its interesting to watch the characters develop throughout the course of  you generally dont get a one dimensional look at any character in their moviesthe subtlties of the coen bros movies are what make them borderline genius and is saturated with all kinds of hilarious quirks that are easy to miss  check out jesus coke fingernail on his pinky or how the cops raid the bowling alley after the gun scene while walters borrowed dog runs off yet inexplicably shows up later  or even the irony of how the selfproclaimed nihilists are so worked up over getting the money that they dont fit their title subtly pointing to the core trio as the true nihilists in the movie  the dude only smokes roaches except when hes in the lap of luxury ats place where he lights up a spliff even the middleupper class work ethic is chastised when the dude shrugs in utter disbelief that hes getting completely discredited because he doesnt have a formal job  i wouldnt be surprised if these characters were based on people from the coen brothers past seeing as they probably were ridiculed as aspiring directors many years ago and maybe even got told to get a real job on several occasionsi think this movie is their masterstroke although the hudsucker proxy is indeed wicked too  most everything is perfectly implemented in this movie and consequently utterly hilarious  this whole adventure starts with someone uh soiling the dudes rug and ends with the dude getting the most wicked 5 oclock shadow ever in between lies the most hilarious social commentary ive seenhowever this movie is completely hit or miss  some people are going to call it incoherent and boring others like myself will call it genius either way the coen bros caustic sense of humor isnt for everyone although its a blessing if you can understand it seeing as youre treated to the best movies that come out of america in my humble opinion,black_comedy
dead funny hilarious intelligent and absolutely original the acting especially john goodman is first rate and the coen brothers seem to have the time of their life no deeper thoughts here just entertainment for a demanding audience,black_comedy
in 100 years time the coen brothers will be remembered for fargo as their classic film but their most celebrated film is not their best lebowski is the king of funny films personnally i find nothing amusing about slapstick comedy the beauty of lebowskiand all genuinly funny films dr strangelove withnail and i annie hallis that it uses well crafted characters intelligence andor stupidity for reaching the child within lines such as shes gotta feed the monkey are just so off the wall that it never fails raise giggles smirks and riotous rolling on the floor the dude and walter are one of the best double acts ive ever witnessed up there with lemon and curtis in some like it hot or laural and hardy while critics are afraid to praise new films and rank them with the so called classics i believe the coens will be remembered for this as well as fargo the same way that orson welles is remembered for citizen kane and then touch of evil fargo and thenwhich is much better,black_comedy
well i thought i was till i nearly pied my pants laughing the first time i saw tbl and the second timeand the third one of the things that kills me about this movie and apparently noone else sees is the fact that the dude is so laid back that he rarely has a thought of his own three quarters of his dialogue is only him repeating something he picked up from someone else in the film he even catches himself almost repeating something he doesnt mean toand stay away from my special ladmy fin lady friend did anyone notice what he was wearing in the gutterballs dream sequence its the same thing carl hungus has on in the logjammin porn video the whole plot is motivated by the dude being influenced by everyone else mostly sobchak and he just floats along with it not until near the end when he realizes my thinking about this case has become very uptight and actually figures things out for himself does he really guide his own destiny i must have watched it 10 times before i caught everything lot of ins lot of outs lot of what what have yous lot of strands in the duders head the best comedy of all time hands down,black_comedy
this is another funny film from the minds of the coen brothers it was funny audacious and hilarious despite the amount of profanity it was used in the film it was still a funny movie all of the cast members were great especially john turturro as the bowler his two scenes really made the movie in a way it was sort of like the raising arizona of kidnapping movies it had a surreal feel to it and thats how most of the coen movies are anyway for all you coen lovers they have a new film coming out and thats the man who wasnt there anyway see it10 out of 10,black_comedy
everything likable in movies this movie has screenshots the bowling scenes alone are spectacularly unique soundtrack feelgood songs when needed and the nihilist music perfect characterization within exaggerated stereotypes characters are unique and human as well comedy an assortment of both high and lowbrow plot unnoticably complex   the toooften used movie description enjoyable on many levels speaks specifically towards a true classic for the true film buff,black_comedy
is a strange funny film that occasionally struggles for coherence  fortunately this lack of coherence is usually part of its charm  its the story of the dude jeff bridges also known as jeff lebowski an amiable stoner trying to cruise through life on the path of least resistance  the dudes world is ruined one day though by a bunch of thugs who break into his apartment beat him up ruin his favorite rug    and realize that theyve assaulted the wrong jeff lebowski  the thugs were actually looking to pummel jeff lebowski david huddleston the millionaire industrialist whos up to his neck in trouble with organized crimesince he was beaten up unfairly and since his prized rug has been ruined the dude decides to seek compensation from this other jeff lebowski  what follows from there is a wild tale involving kidnapping modern art pornography bowling and german nihilists  in other words its another wickedly funny movie from joel and ethan coenjeff bridges is great as the dude an affable easygoing guy who constantly struggles to do what he thinks is right throughout the film    even if his idea of whats right is sometimes slightly warped  the best character of the film though is the dudes best friend walter sobchak as played by john goodman  how goodmans portrayal of walter failed to win an oscar for best supporting actor let alone even get nominated for one is downright criminal  walter is a walking talking ticking time bomb all sorts of contradictory rage rolled up into an extremely unstable package  walter likes to think of himself as this calm allknowing voice of reason but deep down he knows hes not and that makes him all the angrier watch how walter belittles his other friend donnie steve buscemi for donnies politically incorrect use of the term chinamen  and then watch shortly thereafter how walter personally describes a group of german nihilists its nothing short of comic brilliance  also worth noting  tara reid has a very small role as bunny lebowski but she also has the best line in the entire film  dont miss it  is a characterdriven film heavily reliant on the quirks and reactions of its characters to make it work  well not only do the performances in the film make work but they make it work magnificentlyvisually is one of the coen brothers best theres a loving sweeping series of glorious shots used for the bowling sequences that are offbeat original and highly effective  theres also a pointofview shot from inside a bowling bowl that works to great effect the weakest part of lebowski is the actual story  parts of the plot thread involving the german nihilists while funny   are often pointless and dont add much to the rest of the film  also some plot threads either vanish altogether partway during the film or are never satisfactorily resolved  that however is a byproduct of one of thes overall recurring themes the dude abides  the dud is easygoing enough to deal with any situation no matter how weird or random it might be unfortunately by giving the dude weird and random situations to deal with the overall story loses focus  its not a major enough problem to drag the film down significantly but its enough to keep a good film from becoming greatrent it if only to see the tour du force performance of jon goodman  a bizarre and downright funny movie  grade ba,black_comedy
my favorite comedy of recent years filled with funny quirky characters and situations as youd expect from a coen brothers movie done with style the hero or antihero rather the dude lebowski may not be a genius but very likeable nonetheless you got to love his attitude while stumbling through a crime mystery apparently inspired by chandler hammett and the like he gets seriously drugged by a porn producer is beaten up by a sheriff threatened with losing his johnson used as a sperm donor by a feministartist and this list of mishaps is not even complete but amidst all this hes able to smoke some reefers drink a lot of white russian cocktails which i tried for the first time myself after seeing the film i can recommend it and go bowling with his friends at the end someone even dies but its the character you least expected tothis is one of those rare movies that get even better with each viewing two thumbs up,black_comedy
when im in a bad mood and the life doesnt seem too bright i pull out the tape with big l  and start my vcr the first time i watched this movie i was laughing so hard my stomach ached for a couple of days and it only got better on the second viewing since not being an american i missed many of the jokes the first time around the acting is superb by everybody  from jeff bridges who is 100 authentic as the dude to flea who cameos as a misfit wouldbe kidnapper the story is wonderfully original the cinematographic work is great  how about those nutty dream scenes i will not spend time describing the plot as  many others have done this already but ill say this if like me you  have trouble facing adversity in your life take the lead from the ultimate walrus  the dude and take it easy and if you cant the dude will do it for you i dont know about you but i take comfort in that its good knowin hes out there the dude takin er easy for all us sinners peace ,black_comedy
spoilers spoilers and even more spoilers  so watch out basically this movie is about a dude and his rug  jeff lebowski who likes to be addressed as the dude is an amiably indolent aging hipster that demands retribution when two strangers mistaking him with another lebowski break into his apartment push him around and pee on his rug  when the other lebowski a gaseous old tycoon refuses to do anything about the matter the dude simply helps himself with one of the oldtimers rug on his way out  thats the beginning of a sunny shaggydog valentine for all the idlers and drifters dreamers and nonconformists that languidly float around the periphery of the city of los angeles the city of dreams  the movie was obviously written with jeff bridges in mind by ethan and joel coen and for once their stylized offthewall pyrotechnics make better sense  sporting an unkempt goatee and a pot belly bridges the most unfussy of actors disappears inside the dude and gives the movie its own scruffy soul hes in almost every scene steering it effortlessly while he casually strolls across the screen  its a classic comic performance the coen brothers are excellent kinetic filmmakers who aware that film time and film space is geometrical and that human nature is ridiculous come out with prodigiously complex cosmic jokes like two freak astrophysicists on an acid trip  sometimes the ride is memorably amusing as in fargo and raising arizona and sometimes it is ornately mindbending as in millers crossing and barton fink  on the joke is that the joke itself gets forgotten  even the persian rug that the dude snatches away is stolen midway through the film and barely ever gets mentioned again apart from the rug the movie features a tumbleweed a goodoleboy drawlin narrator bowling balls two bowling pals a bowling alley a guy named jesus the tycoon and his secretary an abducted girl a suitcase full of money some norwegian punks a prattling nympho painter a fat performing artist an oily gangster a mean policeman an even meaner cab driver a sawedoff toe a bittenout ear an otter a can full of ashes and jeff bridges who grounds this whacko comedy into the real world  without him it would have turned into another abstract pattern,black_comedy
artistic intriguing and damn hilarious  i love this movie through and through  i always catch something new every time i watch it  if you havent seen this movie get out there and rent it  you dont know what youre missing,black_comedy
this fabulous comedy by the coenbrothers only keeps getting better and better the more times you see it bridges is perfectly cast as the dude the easygoing laidback kind of guy who spends his time bowling smoking weed and listening to his creedancetapes goodman as vietnamveteran walter who sees a conspiracy in almost everything and doesnt want to be bothered on his jewish holidays comes up with another great performance as well as buscemi moore seymour hoffman and turturro in a very small but entertaining role as bowlingking jesus and then there is elliott as the stranger who says he hasnt heard of a story as stupifying as this one i couldnt agree more great writing superb acting and a terrifying marmot,black_comedy
the finest most original film makers in hollywood bring us yet another classic movieso many quotable lines with an excellent cast to boot  the next time you go bowling with friends you will find yourself saying im throwing rocks tonight john turturo is excellent yet again here as jesus  a treat of a movie with great dialogue  how do them coen boys do it1010,black_comedy
first this movie is mustseemusthave all the little details the colorful characters and great music makes it one of those movies you can watch time and time again the acting is very good allround the dialog is just so funny but most of all the pacing is just so right everything seems to follow naturally so you cannot help but being drawn in my favorite coenbrothers movie so far and a classic movie,black_comedy
this film shines like a great big ball of burning gas in the sky providing all who live beneath its great shining beauty with warmth and light and happiness it truly is one of the most amazingly brilliant masterpieces ever made packed with visual and verbal invention skill and class every second every frame is simply magical from the grimy milky toilet of the opening scene through all those wonderfully colourful crazy dream sequences to the final pan of the camera away from our heroes a riot of colour imagery and beauty the story is a wonderfully rambling sprawling tale based loosely on raymond chandler and old bogey movies packed with chandler staples and nods to great classic film noir the characters are all brilliantly conceived written and played bridges and goodman make a truly classic oddbuddy combination buscemi and turturro play wonderful minor comic figures wonderfully julianna moore philip seymour hoffman david thewlis the list of great actors playing out of their skins goes on and on the music is perfect sam eliots narration is aweinspiring who else could possibly have played that part but above all it is the visual splendour of every scene which makes this film really stand out what the coens have created here will last forever as one of the very last great cinematic achievements of the twentieth century and sets a standard towards which all future filmmakers will have to stretch themselves to the utmost to reach a truly flawless film which leaves the viewer with a lasting sense of pleasure and satisfaction and even manages to improve with each successive viewing deserves every possible award and recognition available and should be seen by every sensible person on the planet as often as possible only through this can true world peace and prosperity be achieved,black_comedy
this is one of the funniest movies i have seen there are more subplots in this movie than first meets the eye  a big bonus for me is that my two teenage boysages 1719share the same opinion  common ground not always found  jeff bridges turns in another great acting job  the cast is almost to good to be true the interaction between the the dude donnie and walter is very special,black_comedy
is about a man with balls the dude it wasnt his fault someone urinated on his rug but thats only the beginning of this laugh out loud comedy from the people who brought you fargothe coen brothers got so much critical acclaim for their previous film that they decided to mix it up here and they did some critics loved it some hated it after seeing fargo i have to admit it wasnt what i expected but they roll enough solid laughs and camera tricks to satisfy even the most vengeful critic get over it they wanted to do a comedy and they did it better then mostscoring a perfect 300 is the dude he is the guy you wish you could be if you had the guts to throw all responsibility behind you and enjoy life not caring what people think of you or what you do the dude never was shown rolling a bowling ball during the movie despite most of it taking place during a bowling match involving himand also scoring a perfect 300 maybe he wont shoot me is walter played by john goodman never better or louder goodman plays a volcanic vietnam vet who shouts paranoid logic and profanitysteve buscemi may have had a good score but every time he tried to talk walter told him to shut the  up so i give him a 250 hey what can i say he played the loser in the group better than mostand last but not least a 200 to john turturro who played a hispanic pedophile bowling champ named jesuspetes movie rating out of 10 9,black_comedy
after the hudsucker proxy this was the coens second movie that couldnt fully satisfy me i like their films and this is also a very funny and unique one but somehow i feel they didnt work very long with it they didnt concentrate and it wasnt important for them funny my critics about this one are exactly the opposite of those i have about o brother where art thou there i felt they neglected the dialogue here the dialogues are coenlike give us ze munny lebowski or we cut off your johnson but i missed the visual fascination of earlier movies and the story is really really confusing im not sure if they understood it themselves but now let me get to the positive aspects carter burwells music always works the actors are fabulous especially john goodman and  in a completely new kind of role  steve buscemi the coens can be lucky to have such a welltempered cast and crew consisting mainly of their closer friends they have already worked with several times jeff bridges is also great what else do you need its definitely not the right movie to explore the coen universe  take barton fink raising arizona millers crossing or o brother instead but if you just want an evening of nonmainstreamfun watch lebowski,black_comedy
even while pressing myself during a period of neurotic fits i was not able to come up with a more perfect film  funny to no end chalk full of ingenuity poignant as a red clam this film has it all  a movie so good that watching it is like eating a little slice of heaven,black_comedy
hilariously funny film brought to us by the coen brothers  centering around the dude bridges it consists of a series of sidebusting sequences involving his bowling friends goodman and buscemi narcisists another lebowski and the other lebowskis evil daughter  succeeds in comedy where fargo largely fails  great timely acting and a good feel for the random,black_comedy
the funniest movie of all time one of the best movies of all time i have never laughed so hard in my entire life the coen brothers truly are geniuses jeff bridges gives an incredible performance kpax eqsue and the combo of john goodman steve buscemi and john tuturro makes it awesome and as an added bonus we get a sexy looking tara reid and an even sexier if it is possible philip seymour hoffman,black_comedy
i can just say that this particular peice of storytelling by the brothers cohenreally did uplift my spiritsand brought back to me just how life was for mebeing a lebowski type characterif only i had the big fellas resolve,black_comedy
opening had me laughing as well as it was doing for the first little while the movie is weird and it get stranger and stranger until the characters plot and situations get on my nerves especially the dudes dreams not worth watching not even for free,black_comedy
if you havent seen this movie see it in the near futurenever and i do mean never has a movie been more of a cognitive comedy by this i mean it isnt a no brainer like tommy boy or the mask  those dont even rank near  tbl makes you think about the different types of people that have surfaced as a result of our new society the new age and what happens when you throw them and a million dollars together the dude is excellently portrayed by jeff bridges hes a laid back unemployed joint smoking bowler  thats who he is  all throughout the movie he tends to pick up other peoples lines and use them instead of his ownthis aggression will not stand and to use the parlence of our times strike me right off the batand so in many ways he is representative of the average the other complimentary characters are by no means less important or for that matter less funny  walter sobjac is one of the funniest characters you will find in any movie shomer fing shobbas in conclusion see the movie youll laugh and laugh again,black_comedy
just as some people hate jim carreys movies i do i can perfectly imagine that some will not find this film funny if you have a slightly stupid sense of humour ie if you appreciate the ridicule like for example what the monty python do youll just love this film personally i found it so funny that i was crying,black_comedy
im just going to give one example that will explain why i think this film is so extremely funny at this point in the film my friend and i watching it had to back the tape and watch it again about ten times before we were through laughing i had sore cheeks after thatmy example is the story of the guy who licks his bowling ball,black_comedy
i have wanted to see this film for ages on the strength of other reviews not so much from the content of the movie but simply that it was always very highly recommendedi can now see why this is such a funny and enjoyable film and one that i cannot wait to see again i am not into long reviews  does anyone read them  all i will say is that i have never seen jeff bridges and john goodman give better performancesi love films that have great characters in them and the dude himself is one of the best,black_comedy
im going to be daring  i shall court with controversy  i have a terrible feeling that i will not escape with my artistic integrity such as it is intact  is the coens finest achievement  there  ive said it  and will now wait for the inevitable aftermath  but why the lebowski is and always will be a sublimely irrelivent film of the most absurd and brilliant kind  it allows a perfectly cast bridges with a similarly brilliant goodman to expose the characters in full  the dude one of the most enduring and sypathetic characters in film history  becomes involved with a series of events that lead him to the dark under world strangly enough for a guy who just wants his rug of the porn industry this quest for the rug is aided and mostly abeited by walter in a series of intermingled story lines that are started concluded but mostly just forgotten about by the dude in the coens superlative writing the dudes goals as with the films pretentions are modest enough  all the dude ever wanted was his rug back and the coens simply show that life is life  involving both strikes and gutters  a special mention has to be made for john tuttorro the explosive jesus with a record who in a few minutes of screen time makes an impression comparable to brando in apocalypse nowalmost  combined with the brilliant music beautiful cinematography and the weirdest acid flashbacks youve ever seen this films a winner  did i mention it really tied the room together,black_comedy
i truly enjoyed this wacky film  the coen brothers are ingenious in their way to tell a story  it also doesnt hurt to use some of the best and most under rated actors in hollywood jeff bridges plays the slacker the dude jeff lebowski to a tee  he does not stray away from his character  his chemistry with goodmans orthodox militant walter is choreographed flawlessly this movie is as trippy as the dude and leaves you rolling for morei cant wait to see what the coens have in store next,black_comedy
its one of the few comedies that gets funnier each time you watch it i just saw it again a few nights ago and laughed out loud at least a dozen times it has so many qualities that you look for in being able to watch a movie more than once memorable lines hey man theres a beverage involved here great characters when will i see a movie about jesus the bowling freak and an interesting plot too involved to mentionthe performances by jeff bridges and john goodman are just incredible i could remember after i saw it the first time i wanted to become the dude steve buscemi is also great in a more relaxed comedic role opposed to his normal freaky type characters very original and funny,black_comedy
some nice touches  and overall an enjoyable film as much as i admire jeff bridges though i question why the coens resorted to using a relatively big hollywood name in this one i truly hope they go back to using less recognizable actors and actresses in the future that way the film will not be subservient to the actors,black_comedy
this movie is one of the most shallow yet so so deep movies ive ever seen so many bizzar characters which have nothing to do with the plot  what plot the plot  none exsistant at least not a real one john goodman was amazing every muscle in his body yells im walter in this movie jeff bridges was excellent as well doing a great dude one of the best characters ive seen on screen i watch this movie again and again and enjoy it every time the dreams sequences are great the erotic bowling shots are great and of course nobody fucks up with the gesus10 out of 10,black_comedy
since i got on vhs several months ago its been in my vcr almost constantly  this rich multilayered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewingperhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film youll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once  i equate to 12 monkeys in that regardboth films are wildly entertaining on the surface slightly ominous underneath and have moments of pure genius throughouteach of the coens films seems to be their take on a certain part of the country in particular criminal activity gone awry in each areawith numerous references to their favorite movies thrown in  seems to take la headon and show us the city as something every bit as stupefying as in any of those other places  if fargo and the big sleep are combined with modern la would be the result jeff bridges and john goodman seem to be perfectly cast because their backandforth banter is hilarious  i actually cant think of a character that i would have cast differentlyevery character is memorable and thoroughly entertaining in its own way  the way they play off one another and affect the dudes travels is just crazy there is some really great writing in this film and the soundtrack is really great especially the dream sequences  if you only watch the movie once youre probably missing a lot of thingsi tend to like movies that break conventions and this is definitely one of those films  the main characters arent glamorous at all the films only sex scene is hilarious in contrast to the typical hollywood scene and there isnt a coherent plot that can be outlined in a nice simple layout that everybody will understand  just like the main characters the film seems to bumble around aimlesslybut all the bumbling somehow resonates with coherence by the time its all overyoull either love this movie or hate it  if youre offended by drug use even though the film hardly glamorizes the use of drugsit shows what happens to the dude after years of drug abuse hes an unemployed former roadie for metallica or profanity i think this movie probably set the record for the use of the fwordbut its always sort of melded into the conversation and you hardly even notice it after a while this may not be the film for you  but i bet if you give a chance itll get under your skin,black_comedy
nice film good moments but i didnt like jeff bridges acting as the dude in fact this may just be a bridges family thing as i dont like any of their stuff a bit like the mcgann brothers in england  all too obvious and not great actorshowever the film starts off nicely and you feel you are going to get engrossed in a plot or a few plots midway through however reality dawns and you realise a lot of the threads are left unexplored and the ending is very anticlimatic a complete opposite to fargo great acting by goodman and buscemi,black_comedy
how cool is this movie  dude its way cool caught this movie in london the first time then saw it in new york the second time now its on cable in oz  a great cast with a good story and brilliant direction,black_comedy
i enjoyed the story and found it comparable to pulp fiction in depicting the antics of lowlifes doing wicked things to wicked people  at times it was hilarious  the dream sequences were excellent  what ruined the movie overall for me was the extremely excessive use of the f word and the stuttering and repetition of jeff bridges dialogue  better dialogue writing would have made this movie a real gem i gave it a 6,black_comedy
all of the characters are strokes of genius this is without doubt one of the most character rich films since the days of bogart cagney and grantthe coen brothers are two of the finest minds working in film today they can scare the st out of you one minute and then have you holding on to your sides with chronic belly laughssee this film before you die and the world will seem a slightly more human place to be  oh and vote for it lets get that rating up,black_comedy
is one of the best comedies therell ever be  one of the main reasons this movie did not get the attention it deserved was because of the advertising  from the creators of fargo  in my opinion killed this film  fargo was an art movie that only most critics liked  tbl is so far from fargo  its unreal  i can see how people wouldnt watch it thinking it was similar in some way to fargo  let me give you an example of why tbl is so good and better than fargo  jesus quintana  jesus will probably be the best character to ever appear in a movie  the coens created an urban legend with jesus and then only gave him a few minutes of screen time this is actually a good thing however since having him in the movie too much would ruin him in the same manner knowing the ending to the usual suspects would ruin the experience  those who love jesus as much as i do can only live with the fact that well never see him in a film ever again but using him in another film would ruin the character  so this also is a good thing  the coens did it right with jesus a unique character that creates a unique comical experience in a unique film  the film and jesus will never be used or revisited for further films but its comical genius you dont see in a film every day  so give tbl a try if nothing else youll have to admit it is the best written comedy ever made,black_comedy
this movie quickly became my favorite film after seeing it as el gran lebowski in chile this past summer this is an artistically beautiful movie with great character development hilarious dialogue gorgeous cinematography and music that serves to bring it all together also a great movie if youre in an altered state of consciousness if you know what i mean john goodman and jeff bridges make a wonderful comedic pair this is yet another gem from the coen brothers,black_comedy
superlatives ensue i find to be exceedingly entertaining the three main actors bridges buscemi and goodman did an extremely convincing job in fact its hard for me to watch another movie with jeff bridges in it and not expect him to say new shit has come to light manthe convoluted plot comes ties together like a perfect episode of seinfeld and the scenes are shot beautifully esp the bowling and dream montages the script is witty and hilarious without being juvenile and soooo many classic lines can be gleaned from it this movie is a classicyou will laugh harder everytime you see it the sarsparilla man is rightit does make one feel safe knowing that the dude is out there,black_comedy
 oh isnt that the movie about the guy who justs walks around and smokes pot all day  people like that shouldnt be dignified with a response  theres no use explaining the genuis behind this movie to someone of that caliber  my friends and i were recently saying that this is one of the only movies where you can start it anywhere in the movie and watch it from there theres not a dull moment to be found every actor is great esp jeff bridges and john goodman  of course they were overlooked for any awards  overall this is the coen brothers best work to date and one day will get its dueon a side note was i the only one who noticed jeff bridges was wearing that same bluesleeved baseball shirt in the fisher king,black_comedy
this movie is a rare type that does so much and does it so well we have comedy drama sex drugs violence urination on a rug its all hereit is hard to talk about what goes on in the movie without revealing too much but lets just say that we have a guy who just wants to be left along with his bowling buddies who ends up in a scam that he thinks will be his big breakmuch hilarity ensuesbesides any movie that features flea the basist from the red hot chili peppers has to have at least some redeeming value rent this if you havent then buy itand remember im the dude,black_comedy
one of the greatest films ever made  and believe me i am supercritical its really quite a shame that most people just dont understand this film i guess mostly because there has never been anything like it before i could not stop laughing throughout this movie  the people that dont get it hardly laugh at all  what a disparity  i know people that have watched this movie over twenty times  you dont want to miss it  pure genius,black_comedy
i am not a fun of coen brothers in fact i dont like their films but big lebowski is really the best film of the season bridgesgoodman are really magnificent also other players especially john turturro are superb too the only compliant i may have is julianne moore she sucks great players except jm great performances except guess who great film ah and really great music dont miss this coen masterpiece,black_comedy
often mistaken as one big acid trip well it is but its so much  more this hilarious flick truly lets john goodman shine  i have yet to see him in anything funnier  the rest of the cast just makes this movie something to be watched time and againits now 2nd on my alltime most watched list behind only monty python and the search for the holy grail which ive logged over 100 viewings so itll be hard to top,black_comedy
the best comedy of the ninetiesi loved the characters john goodman excels as the agressive vietnam veteran hellbent on helping the dude steve buschemi underplays his role perfectly and of course jeff bridges wears the dudes character like a second skin the dialogue is cracking the coen brothers really showing off their masterful ear for language it is a privelige to see how every line is delivered and timed to comic perfection then theres the coen brothers labyrinth plot of  surprise kidnapping ransom demands sexthe film is very imaginative loads of offbeat characters  the stanger maude lebowski  a vaginal artist and of course the millionaire lebowski even the direction has the obligatory coen brothers slant  we see the world of bowling through the kind of devotion and attention that scorsese put into american pool in the color of moneyin a world of dumb comedies grasping in futility at the most obvious jokes shows just how well er big it really is constantly laugh out loud moments intelligently written and so many classic scenes you really need this in your collection,black_comedy
this whole film was hilarious there are few movies ive actually sat at in a theatre and hunched over in my chair laughing  one of my friends at this movie lacks a sense of humor and even he was cracking up  jeff bridges was hilarious as a budsmokin lazy unemployed bowler and so was john goodman as a crazed war veteranthe best replayed lines in the whole movie were john goodmans you are entering a world a pain everytime something doesnt go his way and the antics of a femine bowler named jesus john turturro who always talks in some unknown accent and nonstop commentary  some people didnt like the ending but i thought the ear in the air and the ashes in the face added a twisted blackness to this classic comedy  fargo is still the best coen brothers movie yet but this still comes in for a close second  watch it over and over,black_comedy
this was simply the best picture of the year and it annoys me that it didnt get a single academy award nomination it was perfectly written amazingly acted wonderfully directed there wasnt a single thing wrong with the film if you ever talk to a person who did not enjoy this film its because it was too far above them there are plenty of jokes for everyone and then there are the perfectly added inside jokes as well such as the several references to branded an old tv show a show the characters in the film loved they talked of it lasting hundreds of episodes when in fact there were only a handful of episodes there were jokes about every day life jokes about the simple fact that the dude is a dinosaur every other radical or hippie grew up got jobs and stopped with the drugs the dude on the other hand is still living in the 60s and if you look at his friends they all have their own little stories and show how deeply their pasts affect them however they show this great characterization through jokes something very hard to do for example waltergoodmanobviously hit his peak and the height of his life back in vietnam and when he was married so the jokes about him are walter spazzing at people i am a united states veteran and thats how we get to know him how unique is that the same thing can be said of donniebuscemi here is an exsurfer who obviously did drugs and they took his mind you know this from his sheer absent mindedness its truly a unique film of which we shall never see the like again and for that im sorry its the coen brothers at top form,black_comedy
i liked the camera shots in the bowling alleyi liked all the repetition of vulgarityi liked the comedy and the coens famous actors buscemi goodman etcis funny as hell little action and great simplistic dialogue,black_comedy
this is the greatest movie of all time  every line in this movie is great every character is great  it makes bowling look elegant and beautiful where was jeffs oscar nomination  hes too good for an oscarno one has ever come so close to perfection  the dude is a god  a god among men every time i see the part where the sheriff is yelling at the dude and the dude says im sorry i wasnt paying attention  it totally kills me the coens have a special place in my heart for making a movie that i love so so so much this is a wonderfully weird funny beautiful movie,black_comedy
at a conservative party ccktail function sometime last year after a few drinks the subject naturally got onto best films the general concensus was that withnail  i had that title of funniest and of that there was little genuine argument however there was a small contingent of persons present who claimed that the coen brothers with lebowski a then recent offering could possibly wrest the title from robinsons hitherto safe hands though i should add that they voiced this opinion in a humble and respectful manneran investigation ensued and within a week i had located an establishment that was to play it and set to my task viz a comparison with studious meticulousisity to take the film as it stands would be the only way to treat it fairly because to be fair to it it is completely different to withnail it is a totally different kind of humour and style of filming whereas withnail features a kind of low budget dark earthy and realistic humour lebowski has a certain elaborate feel to it from the expensive sets and abstract scenes to the wealth of locations and hollywood feel but enough of the comparisons im supposed to be writing about lebowski here so no more withnail but let it be said they are both titled on names and concentrate on bums or a bumlebowski tends to rely on seemingly obvious jokes and repeated lines and stylessuch as shut the fk up donny ill suck your ck for a thousand dollars and am i wrong combined with a rewarding subtle blend of characterbased humour such as lebowski never finishing his lines donny never getting to say anything brandts nervous mannerisms and numerous self referential statements some people from the dumb and dumber school of comedy appreciation will get very little of lebowski and will not rate it these are largely the same kind of people who thought that mallrats was better than clerks the introduction to the film and most importantly to lebowski is utterly perfect the look at this supposed bum and then at the till girl to put things in perspective creates good empathy with the inner workings of the protagonist he took his  choice others take theirs great camera work and combination with dylan provides the perfect setting to the bowling hall and hence the backdrop to the film this style of filming is the coen brothers at their very best and blending of the title sequence into the story is done as well as anyone could dothis film is made of a combination of straightforward camera shots and dialogue with very little action aside from bowling or driving this is then juxtaposed with some very abstract scenes such as dream sequences and slow motion footage of questionably real situations this technique often creates a very effective result though sometimes can become tiresome the main crux of the film is set in the real world and revolves around the dude attempting to repatriate his living room with a rug this is largely done in a very ordinary fashion but with a great wealth of humorous conversation goodman provides many memorable sayings where the film goes at a tangent to this but with immediate purpose in mind it works very well the best examples of this are the introductory bowling scene as stated and the introduction of the loveable jesus when these scenes are not so welcome is when they actively distract from the flow of the story and serve only to break it up in an undesirable manner still without this experimentation we would have been without some of the films most impressive momentsas the dudes main opponent is a disabled veteran with a personal achievement complex he is acted out brilliantly by huddleston has an excellent vocabulary  including micturate and is a very aggressive character especially towards the dude looking after him is his faithful servant brandt who has some delightful nervous mannerisms and peculiar gaits which work well with his characters speaking parts the blend of humour is mostly based around slight subtlety on the part of some characters and outright overthetop acting on the part of others add this to some great visuals though not over the top and the result is a finely crafted humorous product in all though not as good as the all conquering withnail lebowski does manage to better fargo and is certainly one of the funniest films in recent years,black_comedy
this was the first coen brothers film i saw and it was superb i didnt really know much about it apart from it was supposed to be good and was made by these critically acclaimed brothers i rented it out and watched it twice i bought it within a week the main characters  the dude and walter  are simply the best funny and interesting and the supporting cast all put in good performances the humour varies from sight gags to plots twists and back again the music is also great it adds to the overall feel of the film really well add to that its a film with bowling in and you cannot go wrong one of my favorite movies of all time see it,black_comedy
i have always liked the work of the coen brothers and to tell the truth i found that did meet all of my expectations  and moremany commentators are disapointed with the movie because they find it very difficult to follow the plot andor the characters are not fully developed andor too many characters etcwell  these things are what you would expect from a drama and is not that at all it is not fargo  it is a comedy with a great deal of surrealism there are no higher moral issues and no lessons to be learned besides never spread the earthly remains ashes of your friend against the windthe three main characters are all great john goodman is perfectly cast as the cantgetoverit vietnam vet walther and the scene where he jumps out of a speeding car with a uzi in order to pursue the kidnappers is slapstick at its bestthe best scenes though are the ones with the dude walther and donny arguing what to do with the dudes personal problems it cannot get any betterif you havent laughed long and loud during this movie i will suggest brain surgery in order to find the lost sense of humourrating 9 of 10,black_comedy
well  when i first saw it i missed many parts or little details which made this masterpiece so much funnier  the characters introduced are so unique and original i was really impressed maybe because this was my first coencoen movie it hit me harddude lebowski is so lazy that at certain points he cant even think what to say so he copies what george bush says or writes a check for less than a dollarthis movie in a way makes fun of jews  italians  poles  germans swedes greeks  mexicans but not in a vulgar way i really loved the attitude the dude  had when someone broke into his house smashing the door while he was smoking pot in his bathtub  hey this is a private apartment  or the fact that he drank everyday about at least 3 white russiansthen in comes sobczak  the dudes buddy and bowl mate this guy is absolutely played fabulously by john goodman  he is so fixated about rules and these  rules have been fought for by himself and so many other  good guys in nam   this fixation is so strong that at a certain point he points a gun at a bowling contestant because he went  over the line  but claimed otherwise or the fact that he argues with  autobahn  nihilists that  these are not the rules   without a hostage there is no ransom anyway simply the idea of introducing a character like sobczak who is a pole who was in vietnam  lives in the states and pretends hes jewish because his exwife was  but really is a catholic  is absolutely hilarious to meall the characters in this movie are worth mentioning but space runs out id conclude that this movie is a rare type of low budget  nonhollywoodmegaproject movie that to me is at a higher level than many actionpacked  superfx multimillionaire movies that are coming out these days  ill certainly look out for more coen movies,black_comedy
all i have to add to discussion is my disappointment with it as a seasoned watcher of coen flicks  i appreciate the effort to do something completely out there but there were two points when i expected an explosion of coen cinema and they never happenedwhen the dude discovers he is being followed by jon polito from millers crossing and barton fink no less i expected a classic coen sequence  a car chase of some sort but not just a car chase if you know the coensthe other glaring omission was the bowling match at the end  as they displayed in the dream sequence  which was an mtvish disappointment but still stylish  the coens can photograph anything and make it interesting we sat through enough rambling  we deserved that bowling match  is it possible some studio editor decided it wasnt necessaryjeff bridges is brilliant as the dude  it is not an exaggeration to say that he deserved as oscar nominationbridgess performance is so realistic and convincing that john goodman whos normally great comes across as gimmicky and schticky  and i didnt think it was possible to waste steve buscemi  because hes great even when he just stands around  but he is wasted hererent millers crossing instead  is for coen fans only so that they can appreciate the quality of the other coen films,black_comedy
i watched a few nights ago with a handful of friends one of which was a female  during the film i wondered if this was a film she could enjoy  i do not know any female who has seen the film  after she told me she loved it  i was taken aback by this comment and now i am thoroughly convinced that this is a great movie  it would be impossible for me to give away any of the plot considering that the plot is inexplicable however is a phenomenal comic mystery complete with cursing bowling unemployment grand theft auto a matter of one million dollars and a toewith nail polish,black_comedy
the dude is one laid back fella who breezes through life without a care in the world  except for bowling but when the dude is mistaken for another jeffrey lebowski well the dude has some serious thinking to dothe coen brothers have come up with another gem of a movie one which may appear slow moving and lazy but is never anything less than entertaining this is due to the hilarious dialogue and some class acting especially from john goodman as walter goodman has always flattered to deceive in his film career but finally he shows how great a comedy actor he is you cant help but laugh at some of his lines and mannerisms  bunch of f amateurs youre entering a world of pain donny youre out of your element etclike all coen movies some of the jokes will be missed the first time around if youre after a great sliceoflife comedy then look no further i remember this film wasnt that well received at the boxoffice but in empire uk magazines list of 1998 best films it managed to come 2nd910,black_comedy
this picture blew my mind  jeff bridges nailed the dude character john goodman was great as the whacked out vietnam vet and the camera work kicked some serious ass  the coens do it again with this bizarre tale that keep you guessing and laughing  no review could give this film true justice but let it be said that it is highly recommended for viewing,black_comedy
this movie means absolutely nothing goes absolutely nowhere the pitch hovers somewhere around vulgar and every character is a flake  how then is it so entertainingjeff bridges holds the thing together like glue  he plays the unflappable dude  who gets flapped aplenty  with such wit and grace that he pulls off plenty of schtick making this cartoon utterly believable and convincing  oh ho  he writes checks for less than a dollar  he smokes a joint and says bummer  he lives to bowl and yet never rolls  the coens were dead right to cast bridges any actor who misstepped would have sunk the shipeven still a quarter or more of the scenes dont work but what does is very entertaining very funny  probably as much foul language per frame as good will hunting but at least here it seems to make sense the coens dont cram it into everyones mouths unilaterally,black_comedy
